  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience using a 3600 mAh battery for the HTC Sensation smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  This text is devoted to a detailed overview of the extended battery for the still popular HTC Sensation smartphone, including details of purchasing via the Internet, review of the package bundle and the product itself, and of course, research on the battery life of the smartphone in different modes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I received the new HTS Sensation smartphone as a gift, I was amazed at its capabilities.  Two high-frequency cores with a powerful video adapter easily twisted the video (1280x720 High 4.1, which was most demanded by me), opened heavy PDF-files almost without delay, loaded web pages with a complex structure.  But all this power in the eyes of devouring a battery.  And if in the mode of the book and a bit of Wi-Fi Internet, he lived for two days, then the trip for the whole day outside the city (a long road, GPS, photography) could end in a brick in his pocket.  And away from home. <br><br>  Therefore, I thought about purchasing a more capacious battery that would allow me to do whatever you want the whole day without thinking about the remaining charge.  A few days of surfing the net, as well as past experience led me to the site of Mugen-Power, a Chinese manufacturer of advanced batteries for smartphones.

      <br>
      Just want to note the reasonableness of the site.  The user immediately sees the menu with a list of manufacturers of equipment, the list of models is displayed in the drop-down list.  No need to look for anything - everything is immediately available.  For each model, a table with available batteries is displayed, containing the most requested information - capacity, cost, photo.  User reviews, stock status available.  The purchase process is detailed, payment is possible through PayPal.  In general, everything is done to quickly find the desired model and its comfortable purchase.  Separately, I note free shipping.  While one battery in the HTC brand store costs 1800r, plus delivery to the house is 300r, from far Hong Kong a more capacious battery will come for 1400r, including delivery to the post office. <br><br>  However, the battery that came to me for review was obtained in a much more surprising way.  Mugen-Power will send batteries free to users who wish to write a review of their products.  It is enough to contact the staff of the company - they will answer you politely, describe all the details and once again amaze you with Asian generosity.  As a result, I didn‚Äôt have to waste time on trifles and asked for the most capacious battery for the HTC Sensation at the moment - at 3600 mAh, according to the specifications.  Delivery time from Hong Kong to the post office was about two weeks, not counting the time for preliminary correspondence and searches for a parcel in the mail (lost within four walls).  I note that the whole way of the parcel, from its arrival in Russia to delivery to the post office, is recorded on the website of the Russian Post. <br><br>  At the end of the section more about the battery.  Link to purchase page <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/htc/htc-sensation/mugen-power-3600mah-extended-battery-for-htc-sensation-with-battery-door.html">HERE</a> . <br><br>  The site has photos and even a good video clip. <br>  Due to the large capacity, the battery does not fit into the body of the smartphone.  Therefore, the manufacturer attaches to the purchase of a new back cover, characterized by greater depth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b20/13b/7cc/b2013b7cc283bc66df144a54bf06c82a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Battery</b> <br><br>  <b>Delivery and packaging</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/241/5d2/abd/2415d2abdc08bb4b0dd5b93ade39828e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Packaging</b> <br><br>  The battery arrived in a tight paper bag, with a piece of brief information pasted on it.  In the package - a plastic box containing the battery itself, and an information sheet.  The latter personally pleased me very much.  It describes in detail how to charge the battery at first to achieve maximum efficiency, contact information of the company.  At the beginning and end of the text - thanks for the purchase.  Yes, the cost of such a piece of paper is scanty, but the feeling of the company's concern for its customer is much more expensive. <br><br>  A plastic box consists of two halves, not fastened, so you can open and close it without any consequences of appearance.  Personally, I was inspired with trust in the company for a long time, but another buyer may feel uncomfortable, knowing that someone could actively use his property before.  The rest of the packaging is very good: hard plastic, cardboard, foam (or as the name of the material that seals the entire assembly in this case) - all this ensures that the battery and the new cover will arrive as a whole and not beaten. <br><br>  <b>Battery and back cover</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/13b/6fe/bad13b6fe6182b08ddeb4b797790c7f2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Side view</b> <br><br>  The battery has its main characteristics - capacity, voltage, the manufacturer.  In terms of thickness, it naturally exceeds the standard battery by a factor of two.  For this reason, a new back cover is required. <br><br>  The cover is made entirely of plastic.  The standard cover on the edge and in the center was reinforced with metal, but here the structure is generally homogeneous.  Therefore, it is logical to question the rigidity of the resulting structure.  Not only the cover itself, but also the smartphone.  In the basic version, the metallized back cover bears the main protection; in the version from Mugen-Power, the smartphone itself adds rigidity to the design.  At the base of the smartphone is an aluminum plate.  On the one hand (let's call it ‚Äútop‚Äù), there is a screen with a touch panel, on the other (‚Äúback‚Äù) - the two halves of the motherboard.  All system logic is covered with a rigid plastic panel.  It is inserted into the battery.  Thus, even without a proprietary back cover, the design must retain sufficient rigidity even with a more massive battery. <br><br>  Returning to the study of the new cover.  It consists of three parts: a ‚Äúbath‚Äù, covering the entire smartphone and battery, a panel full width of the case with openings for the camera and LEDs, a thin rim around the ‚Äúbath‚Äù perimeter, which appears just at the ends of the device.  At the first inspection in the eyes rushed poor quality build.  The panel with holes was glued crookedly - on the one hand it adjoined the ‚Äúbath‚Äù closely, on the other hand a gap of a millimeter and a half was obtained.  The panel also protruded slightly above the surface of the ‚Äúbath‚Äù.  At the junction of the rim with the lid there is clearly a strong roughness scratching the fingers.  This is a real bald!  To see this on a high-tech device from a large company is very strange. <br><br>  Only plastic is used as a cover material.  It looks like a soft touch, but not the highest quality.  In my specimen, the roughness was uneven - on the one hand, the hand feels uneven, as if there was some dry dirt on the surface.  Moreover, after a couple of weeks of use, I noticed that the rough coating began to peel off.  Under it showed a smooth, even slippery, dark gray plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9f/b6b/e3a/e9fb6be3a62ab3dd40ff19ec7e428c1b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Smartphone with battery installed</b> <br><br>  In this case, the cover is quite thin and light.  As on the original cover, antennas are mounted into it, but the electrically conductive material is different here, cheaper, obviously not copper. <br><br>  On the front side is a lattice conversational dynamics.  On the standard cover, the grille is attached from the inside, on the new one - from the outside.  Here it is such a thin lattice plate, loosely glued in a couple of points.  It is easily pressed through the center inward, slightly dangles in its place.  I would not be surprised if, when wearing the device in her pocket, it will fly off pretty quickly.  In general, this is another unpleasant discovery. <br><br>  In the back cover integrated power button and volume rocker.  They are very tight, sit tight.  The buttons are flat and slightly wider than usual; in places where they are pressed, a large and sharp pimple is placed.  Apparently, this was done to make the buttons easier to touch, in reality, these growths cling to clothes and annoy the finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/541/827/1af/5418271af1f3c786cbbdd97490433f38.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Cap height comparison</b> <br><br>  To finish the description of the cover should install it on your smartphone.  To my surprise, the phone sat on the lid very tightly, no backlash.  Nowhere does it creak; the body of the smartphone and the lid are felt as one.  What is even more surprising, the thicker lid makes holding the phone much more comfortable.  Wide, slightly beveled sides ideally fall under the fingers, the smartphone does not slip into the palm of your hand.  In this case, the total weight has changed imperceptibly - the heavier battery is adjacent to the lighter cover. <br><br>  The cover is very tight to the body of the smartphone.  Dust under it practically does not fall, much less than when using a standard cover. <br>  The total for the cover: selected materials, their processing and assembly - at a level below the average.  But the shape is very good.  It retains the common features of the smartphone, contributes to the comfort of use. <br><br>  <b>Antennas</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e20/c9f/a3f/e20c9fa3fcfaf3ff30697eb2bc83b6a7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Inside view</b> <br><br>  In the cover are built-in antennas radio, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS.  In comparison with the standard cover, the new one reduces the sensitivity of the device.  In general, in good conditions, the sensitivity is almost not reduced, but when the situation worsens, the device shows a noticeably weaker signal level. <br><br>  So, in places of uncertain cellular network coverage, the device produces noise in the dynamics, the signal indicator suddenly drops to two divisions (on the standard lid below three in such places did not fall).  The Wi-Fi module finds fewer networks, skipping those with a weak signal.  With the base cover, it was even possible to connect to these networks.  The GPS-signal of the device with the new cover catches worse: fewer satellites are visible, the time for determining the coordinates in equal conditions is more than one and a half to two times.  The device with the new cover spends more time searching for visible satellites. <br><br>  Another test for WiFi power is the neighborhood open network in the house.  With a new cover, the device connected to it once, showed the minimum signal level.  But it was enough to put a full-time cover - the level was almost always the maximum. <br><br>  <b>Autonomous work</b> <br><br>  The main section, which describes what, because of what you have to put up with all the problems of the new cover.  This is a battery.  Its capacity is 3600 mAh, which is more than twice the standard battery.  Confidence that the battery really has such a capacity, initially was not.  So the device, after the buildup of the battery according to the scenario recommended by the company, was tested in different modes.  The numbers are accurate enough, tested twice.  There is a discrepancy in the values, within 10 percent. <br><br>  A full charge of an enlarged battery occurs in 4 hours when using a HTC branded charger for 1A. <br><br>  The easiest mode is reading a book from the screen.  Base battery - 10 hours, Extended - 23. <br><br>  Watching video 1280x720 High Profile 4.0 with hardware acceleration: 6 hours 20 minutes against 14. <br><br>  Intensive web surfing via WiFi (5 meters from the access point as the crow flies): 4 hours 15 minutes versus 9 hours. <br><br>  Camera.  The camera is turned on, taking pictures one by one per minute.  3 hours against 6 with a little. <br><br>  Real use.  During the day, several calls a day, an hour and a half reading a book and WiFi.  The radio module is turned off at night hours on 9. In this mode, the device with an extended battery worked 7 and a half days exactly.  The basic battery in this mode was enough for about three days and a little. <br><br>  The result for the battery is that the actual battery capacity is very close to the stated 3,600. As a result of power calculations, I got 3400-3500 mA. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  I went with this battery a month, counting from the day it was received at the post office.  This is a useful thing that allows you to discover all the possibilities of a smartphone - you can do anything during the day without worrying about the remaining charge.  For the day, put the battery is extremely difficult.  On the other hand, the work of wireless interfaces suffers.  Moreover, the new cover is not different build quality and materials used. <br><br>  As a result, for use in urban areas, when the device can be recharged at least once a day, it is better to stay on an expanded 1950 mAh battery that fits in a regular case.  But for long journeys, where you still can hardly use the connection, a huge 3600 battery is perfect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139751/</a></p>
