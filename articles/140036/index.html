  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with Vadim Mityakin, Director and Founder of GALS Soft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a major international conference on mobile technologies # MBLT12.  On the eve of the conference, we talked with Vadim Mityakin, the director and founder of <a href="http://www.galssoft.ru/">GALS Soft</a> , about the current situation in the market of mobile applications, development prospects and the specifics of this market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d70/fa8/8fb/d70fa88fb9ac8285660c50d4dc032ac8.jpg"><br>  <b>AppProfessionals.ru:</b> Vadim, hello.  As you know, one of the activities of GALS Soft is the development of mobile applications.  Comment on what is the current situation on the application development market in Russia?  What are the prospects for further development? <br><br>  <b>Vadim Mityakin:</b> Hello!  The situation in the market of mobile development today is very hot.  Now is a time when all companies, organizations make their mobile applications.  Absolutely, quite soon (according to my estimates, in about a year) the development market will change.  The prospects for further development have two aspects - applied and technological.  The application aspect concerns how applications are used.  The fact is that now, basically, mobile applications provide users with a rather truncated functionality.  Those.  for example, a mobile client of some news resource provides an opportunity to read articles, but does not allow to manage content, create your own library of articles, etc.  But the audience of mobile devices is growing, and sooner or later the moment will come when the main way of working will be through mobile devices.  Then companies will be forced to improve the functionality of applications, and even restructure approaches to the organization of their services, restructure their business processes around the mobile way of working. <br>  The second aspect is technological.  Today, there are many mobile platforms, and all are doing, mostly, native applications.  But the inevitable transition from native applications to Html5, to web applications adapted for mobile platforms, as well as orientation to cross-platform.  Already now there are development tools, universal libraries that allow writing the application logic in the same language once and then with minimal adaptation, already connected with the specifics of the application interface, to publish it for various platforms. <br><br>  <b>AppProfessionals.ru:</b> What distinguishes mobile application development as a business area?

      Vadim: As a business, it is almost the same as any other development.  There are market niches, but in terms of application design and production cycle, by and large, is no different.  In any case, it is required to collect requirements, to prototype, develop, test, implement, etc. <br>  Inside the business there are companies that develop their applications, sell them and earn money on it.  And there are companies that are engaged in the development of to order.  The product of custom development can be custom mobile applications or corporate mobile applications that are embedded in the technological process of the customer company and are tools for the operation of the company. <br><br>  <b>AppProfessionals.ru:</b> Today, cloud services are developing more and more.  In view of this, the question arises about the development of mobile applications for working with clouds.  Are there any features in the design? <br><br>  <b>Vadim:</b> From a technical point of view, mobile applications that provide mobile access to certain services available via the Internet are no different.  It is simply software that is leased over the Internet, and mobile access to it is no different from any other mobile access. <br><br>  <b>AppProfessionals.ru:</b> Speaking of clouds, we can not fail to mention your own service for organizing events and video broadcasts - Confcloud.  Tell us about the project and plans for its development.  What are its features / benefits? <br><br>  <b>Vadim: The</b> service for organizing events and video broadcasts Confcloud, which we are developing, is just a vivid example of a cloud service, which is based on Microsoft Azure cloud technology.  The idea is this.  Companies hold many events.  Regardless of the fact that events have a different format, different content, different visitors, the tasks that the organizers face are usually the same.  They must notify and register the participants, receive payment for participation from them, familiarize them with the materials, schedule, speakers, additional materials, video materials.  Then, during the event, to give the opportunity to watch a video broadcast, the opportunity to communicate between the participants, after - to tell about the results of the last event.  Over the past few years, we have made about hundreds of sites for events of various sizes.  At some point, having accumulated this experience, we decided to make a platform where all these functions are conveniently assembled for event organizers, with a good interface adapted for mobile access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ad/66f/91b/2ad66f91b7b47118b4553615b56ed6cf.png"><br><br>  As for the plans.  Development of the service as a professional means of organizing events is our main task.  The development is not only technical, but also in terms of building relationships with companies that are engaged in the professional organization of events, and companies that themselves hold events for their clients and partners.  And now we are focusing not only on Russia.  Our task is for the site to be, in fact, a quality standard for such services. <br><br>  Thank you for the interview, we wish you success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140036/</a></p>
