You are doomed! <br>  That's not true.  There is always a solution.  And before plunging into debriefing on this decision, let's try to dispel the myth that creating tons of content in order to build up organic traffic is the only correct decision. <br><br>  So‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Is the increase in the amount of content on the site is equal to the increase in the rate of organic traffic? <br>  When you submit sites from the first page of search results, what resources come to mind first?  Wikipedia, Habrahabr, Correspondent ... The reason for the good ranking is that these resources consist of thousands, if not millions, of unique content pages.  Yes, trite - the more content you create, the more keywords are read by the search engine, which leads to a positive ranking of the site.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/526/464/45a5264649e0417681dc0b3009702346.jpg"><br><br>  The graph above * illustrates that the pages of Internet resources from the first page of Google‚Äôs search results consist of at least 2,000 words.  And the pages of those who hit the first positions in the list reach an indicator of up to 2,500 words.  By the way, if you start to figure out which keywords these sites are ranked, most of them will turn out to be so-called long-tail keywords. <br><br>  But does this mean that you have no chance to rank well without producing content?  Let's try to figure it out in practice.  A great example would be a website with multi-million traffic <a href="http://www.adme.ru/">adme.ru</a> , where texts reach a mark of about a hundred words.  Let's try to enter the phrase "creative advertising on transport" and get the first position in the issuance of this keyword. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/e63/472/4b9e63472ac84e5cbf7cef472fd00cf5.JPG"><br><br>  And here is the amount of text on the page + captions to the photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/303/6e5/b94/3036e5b941a24ddbb60b6191fcdf27ef.jpg"><br><br>  You will say that the admin is not enough, but still generates text pages?  Take an even more textless resource - for example, <a href="https://www.blablacar.ru/">Blablacar.ru</a> - 2 million traffic per month.  There is practically no text content.  And this means that they are doing something else, which makes the search engine take them to the first place by the set of keywords in the variations of ‚Äúfellow traveler‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/664/e3b/629/664e3b6298204bb19e701428b03f3cc0.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Reverse external links and ranking</b> <br><br>  If you look at the statistics, adme and blablacar have something in common and this is an impressive number of external links - 355K and 36.3K, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f48/9f7/753/f489f7753632479d80dafb8f808c3a1e.JPG"><br><br>  In addition to many external links, both the admin and blablakar have a fairly large number of pages being indexed - <a href="https://www.google.com.ua/webhp%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome-instant%26ion%3D1%26espv%3D2%26ie%3DUTF-8">362,000</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com.ua/webhp%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome-instant%26ion%3D1%26espv%3D2%26ie%3DUTF-8">10,500</a> , respectively. <br><br>  <i>So how can you increase organic traffic without increasing content on the site?</i> <br><br>  You will be able to succeed in the attendance of your resource by performing the following steps: <br><br>  1. <b>Create a lot of pages on the site</b> - regardless of whether they are filled with text on a string or there will be one line, you need to increase the number of pages.  The more pages the site has, the more chances it has to be ranked in the future. <br><br>  2. <b>All your pages should be indexed</b> - if Google does not like the quality of the content of your pages, you can fall under the Panda filter.  In order to avoid this, any, even the smallest, text must be unique, stylistically and grammatically verified, to carry the meaning for the reader.  You also need to pay attention to the content of the site, which is created by users in the form of reviews, reviews, comments. <br><br>  3. <b>Links to your site on information portals</b> - this is quite time-consuming, but giving an excellent return on the task.  To get a reference in a popular intern-edition requires effort, but links in those will bear fruit in the form of an increase in positions in search results.  Meet journalists, write useful articles for portals with the target audience that interests you, ‚Äúbe friends with blogs‚Äù on a related topic. <br><br>  4. <b>Be proactive</b> - use resources where your knowledge can be useful.  For example, keep track of questions in Quora or Pressfeed, give answers to them on behalf of a member of the resource team - sooner or later your information will be in the ‚Äúten‚Äù and will be published, as well as the link to the site.  Also, track the advisory lists of resources on your subject, contact the authors of those - convince them that your site should be among those indicated. <br><br>  5. Finally, <b>be patient</b> - if your content is not detailed and not sufficiently informative, organic traffic should not be expected right now.  In the near future, you will receive search traffic, but don‚Äôt hope for a daily miracle - everything will be, but not immediately. <br><br>  So, this article does not reinvent the wheel, but is intended to once again draw the attention of the owners of successful and almost successful resources to building long-term relationships with search engines.  And this can and should be done by creating a field of external links to the site from the trust resources of the network.  In particular, if your site does not allow you to move through a large array of content. <br><br>  And, of course, do not forget about the quality of the services and products that are presented on your site, because such giants as Amazon or Apple, if you look closely, do not really focus their attention on blogging. <br>  Synergy of diligence in the promotion of the site and a good promoted product is not the easiest thing, but it will definitely lead you to success. <br><br>  <b><i>And what methods of increasing organic traffic will you advise?</i></b> <br><br>  <i>* Graph taken on the <a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/">SerpIQ</a> website <a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/">.</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292314/</a></p>
