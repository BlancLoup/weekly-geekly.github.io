Just as hackers find flaws in the software and use them for their own purposes.

      The idea is not new and does not belong to me.  I first heard about this when I was at university.  At the lecture on ‚ÄúLegal support of international scientific and cultural relations,‚Äù the teacher told the following story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>In the early 1990s, numerous travel agencies appeared in our country like mushrooms after rain.</i>  <i>By entering into contracts with customers, they took as a model standard contracts of similar Western firms, without thinking that in our conditions it is impossible to provide the same range of services at the same level that is spelled out in contracts.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The people, legally grounded, were engaged in carefully studying the contracts of various companies, finding a company that undertakes an obligation that it cannot fulfill, concluded an agreement with it, went on tour, and upon return made a complaint and received their money back.</i>  <i>In some cases, these people managed to get from travel agencies amounts that far exceed costs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  I liked this idea so much that I began to look for similar opportunities in the realities of the beginning of the 21st century (it was in 2002).  And found. <br><br>  <i>By this time one of the most dynamically developing branches of business was cellular communication.</i>  <i>Numerous dealers of mobile operators sought to attract customers, making them the most attractive offers.</i>  <i>Very often it was possible to meet the offer to connect to a mobile operator and get a bonus: $ 5 or $ 10 to the account.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the meantime, in our St. Petersburg two mobile operators provided customers with the opportunity to terminate the contract for the provision of communication services and receive money in their hands that remained in the account at the time of termination of the contract.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For ‚Äúhumanitarian hackers,‚Äù it was an untapped field.</i>  <i>In one day, one person could walk around to twenty cell phone stores, offering a $ 10 bonus, connect there to one of the operators (as a rule, one passport at a time could have no more than one connection), and in the evening you could go to the operator‚Äôs office, terminate all twenty contracts and receive $ 200 net profit in cash in two weeks.</i>  <i>Such an operation could be done every day.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The amount was so significant that it could attract the attention of the tax inspectorate.</i>  <i>However, when I addressed my inspector with the question: ‚ÄúAnd if I bought a sofa and received a cover for it in a store, should I include this cover in my income statement?‚Äù I was reassured by explaining that I should not.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At first, there were very few people involved in this: in the offices of telecom operators it was said that in the entire five million city only five or six people were engaged in this.</i>  <i>The damage to dealers was insignificant (compared to the profits from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù customers), and they could afford not to cancel the attractive offer.</i>  <i>Even if in some salon one of the ‚Äúhumanitarian hackers‚Äù was blacklisted and never served again, new salons appeared every day offering bonuses.</i>  <i>And they did not know this person in them.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>However, over time, information about this method of earning spread (although I am sure that people who earned their living by it, kept their mouths shut).</i>  <i>And by the summer of 2004 in St. Petersburg "on an industrial scale" several hundred people were already engaged in this.</i>  <i>And so "indulged" and do not count.</i>  <i>As a result, by the autumn of 2004, offers of such bonuses disappeared from the pages of St. Petersburg newspapers and magazines.</i>  <i>Now bonuses are given only on tariff plans that do not provide for the possibility of withdrawing funds from the account.</i> <i><br><br></i>  Then I turned my attention to the world wide web. <br>  <i>In some electronic stores, online auctions, on a number of betting sites, etc.</i>  <i>customers have an internal account with which they make payments.</i>  <i>In some places it is possible to replenish this account and withdraw money from it with the help of several electronic payment systems, and a couple of years ago, no conversion fee was charged at all.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So what prevents to enter money into such an account through e-gold, then withdraw via WebMoney, exchange WMZ for e-gold in any exchanger and as a result get an amount that exceeds the one that was originally?</i>  <i>(The dollar of the e-gold system always cost less in exchange than WMZ.)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This could seriously earn.</i>  <i>But now there are almost no such systems with automatic withdrawal of money.</i>  <i>And letting the operator verify such a transaction is too dangerous.</i>  <i>Any normal person will immediately realize that this is detrimental to the firm.</i> <br><br>  But there are other ways.  I found out about one of them on the <a href="http://www.majesty.ru/forum/topic25678.html">Majesty.ru</a> forum. <br><br>  <i>Its essence was that the partners of one gambling establishment distributed to all those who register in this gambling establishment by their link a bonus of $ 50.</i>  <i>It was assumed that just so you can not withdraw the money.</i>  <i>First you need to play on them and increase the balance to a certain amount.</i>  <i>It was difficult to earn a serious amount on this, because the bonus was given only once per IP, and in order to receive it it was required to present a scan of the passport.</i>  <i>And for the first 50 dollars to win is not easy, especially if you are new to the game.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But suddenly, from nowhere, strange announcements appeared on the Internet: ‚ÄúI will lose to you in poker‚Äù.</i>  <i>I suppose the people guessed that it is not necessary to play with anyone and merge the bonus fifty dollars, if you can lose it to your man for a small pullback (50%, for example).</i>  <i>I don‚Äôt know if this was really so because I personally didn‚Äôt do it.</i>  <i>But it looked like that.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Then they began to hire other people to register accounts and get bonuses.</i>  <i>They paid for different amounts.</i>  <i>Someone 15 dollars, someone 10.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Personally, I paid 5. And then, not wanting to delve into the subtleties of the game, I resold for 15.</i> <br><br>  And one more way is described on the <a href="http://www.rusmmg.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D3847">RusMMG</a> forum.  Here I just quote: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn general, I found a bourgeois office, estessno in the internet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>They once hired people, well, I had nothing to do, read the offer.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>They have a system - you sign a contract, you pay monthly installments - and you download any software from their site for free.</i>  <i>And you have to pay 99.90 usd every 3 months during the year.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Send a membership agreement, fill out the form and that's it.</i>  <i>Payment by check, or paypal or egold.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Looked soft-some kind of software, clips, and so on</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But personally, I was amused by something else, since no one particularly in their club was in a hurry to join, they hired people, such as managers, who had to drag customers and for each person brought in, the manager received from the office not a lot and 119.90 usd.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Taking into account that they did 4 clever 99.90 = roughly 400. (And if the client paid for the whole year at once, it cost 320 usd), then paying the manager is easy for them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In general, my HYIP thinking immediately saw a hole in their system))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In short, I signed a contract with them.</i>  <i>And ‚Äûled customer‚Äú.</i>  <i>It was me, but with a different ipak and other data.</i>  <i>In short, he signed a contract and joined the club.</i>  <i>Paying at the same time 99.90.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>At the end of the week they sum up, well, they sent me my 119.90.</i>  <i>Of course, the info about the ‚Äúclient‚Äù was invented, and of course, I was not going to pay the other members.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The same pyramid, only win-win.</i>  <i>I give my 99.90 and at the end of the week I get agent 119.90.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>One bad thing is that a lot of fuss with filling out forms and finding a proxy.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In addition, when the thread they can guess that they are fooled.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But nevertheless it was funny))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Twisted all this while two times. "</i> <br><br>  The last three examples show that today there is a very fertile environment for ‚Äúhumanitarian hackers‚Äù - ‚Äúe-business‚Äù.  And to look for offers with defects in e-commerce is easier than anywhere else.  So why work then? <br><br>  (First published by me on the forum <a href="http://bxod.ru/topic5363.html">BXOD.RU</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38528/</a></p>
