After all, people - beings are primarily social, and it is noticeable sociological shifts, or vice versa shocks, have the greatest impact on the existence of humanity.  If it is simpler to say, then surely each of you would agree with such a simple statement that canceling the queues in the office throughout the country would give the common people much more happiness than selling a new batch of google-glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b40/5c3/e76/b405c3e76e460a685656ed55bfcd321b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      But at the same time, the social sphere often remains the most conservative and immune to all sorts of innovations and improvements.  In this article we will try to discuss with you several professions of the future, the need for which in our society is already overdue today, or even ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù. <br><br>  One can often hear the complaints of certain figures and philosophers that real democracy (the power of the people) begins only where the power becomes a real servant of this very people and is ready to fulfill all the collective requirements and demands, give feedback, report publicly and to be constantly threatened at any moment to be dismissed with insufficient competence, in the opinion of the majority of citizens.  Who among you in the company of friends or just at home in the kitchen did not dream of something like that?  But it seems that the times of Ancient Hellas are already irretrievably gone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a53/514/761/a53514761617fdc6c80f41c0724207bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, then it was easier to gather all citizens in a single area and quickly discuss all pressing decisions, and what to do when the country's population exceeds 100 million people?  And here, only recently, the widespread penetration of the Internet and access of communications between people to a fundamentally new level again allows us all to return to the origins of classical democracy.  Let's imagine an ideal situation where each of us can place several dozens of proposals for universal voting online: <br><br>  - construction of a kindergarten on a waste land, <br>  - demolition of garages for the new stadium, <br>  - replacement of the monument of sv.  Vladimir - on the monument to A.S.  Makarenko, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/555/522/77d/55552277d1280d6c6cd23aef36762a96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, at first there will be a lot of various proposals, opinions, just pointless criticism, because each of us is convinced that it is his problem that is the most important and urgent of all, and the state budget is not unlimited.  So, the profession of a <b>specialist in crowdsourcing public issues</b> will be urgently needed.  Moreover, collecting the most successful proposals on the basis of a vote, sending them to the appropriate authorities is only the first third of the case.  The most important thing is to collect weekly reports on the work done and communicate these results to all those who voted for the proposal.  Also, at the end of each week, collect from the citizens a general decision on whether it makes sense to extend the authority of the Responsible person for the execution of this project for another week or is it worth changing it to a new, more efficient manager.  Such original democratic principles, similar to the principles of the popular Veche, praised by our ancestors, could quickly and efficiently solve dozens and hundreds of social problems accumulating in our society today without any hope of a speedy resolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/631/eb3/3e0/631eb33e0e13a6f75063d446650720b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, it is possible that even a passive model of a dispute of signatures, ‚Äúlikes‚Äù or plus signs will not be quite enough to fully stir up all that swamp of accumulated social problems.  See the executive in person, ask direct questions, listen to comments on your suggestions online - also extremely popular idea among the masses.  And again, the Internet, its instant communication capabilities and the organization of video conferences and direct dialogues between the most remote corners of our vast Motherland - can help to realize this concept.  And here you need another true professional in your business to organize the chaos of disputes and critics and send them in a constructive direction.  This will be the <b>Moderator of the platform of communication with government agencies</b> .  A specialist who organizes an online dialogue between public activists and officials responsible for specific areas (for example, lawmaking, education, housing and communal services, construction, pensions, etc.) to work out joint decisions.  This specialist can work both within state structures and be a public activist (national diplomat).  One of his specializations will also be the organization of interaction with professional communities to receive advice and expert analytics on the technical feasibility of implementation and budget assessment of people's proposals.  This will be an extremely difficult job, because in addition to the skills of working with people, such a moderator will have to have knowledge of several languages ‚Äã‚Äãand cultural differences of different sectors of society.  But, despite the apparent complexity, the effect of the activities of such moderators can be hundreds of times higher than that of the State Duma in its current composition. <br><br>  With the development of the global transport network - the boundaries are getting closer.  Other nations and peoples, with opposing values ‚Äã‚Äãand customs that were previously thousands of miles away from all of us, already today are within the hours of availability of a regular passenger aircraft flight.  Society as a whole is becoming more cosmopolitan, and cultures are mixed and transformed.  This does not always happen peacefully, since there are still enough people in the world who are aggressively disposed towards other people's values ‚Äã‚Äãand beliefs simply because they are different.  And here, the <b>Migrant Adaptation Specialist</b> , who will help various nationalities and cultures to seamlessly integrate into new communities and societies, is now urgently needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e29/b55/a4b/e29b55a4b83455077e2f8a2f4ea528bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So let's consider the state as one big corporation.  For example, inside this corporation, by an internal order, everyone is ordered to drink only coffee.  However, one day a new specialist comes to work, who drinks only tea and hates coffee.  How to be in this situation? <br><br>  Lose such a specialist and bungle his assigned tasks?  Then quickly hire another?  Analyze how the novice himself is holding on to his position and is ready to give in to his tastes, pouring in himself coffee in the morning through force, but for the sake of a common cause?  These questions do not have a single answer and a common recipe. In each case, thousands of features and details need to be considered that will not be obvious to a manager without special psychological education, conflict management skills, and knowledge of several languages.  But the success of the team depends on the efficiency not only of the novice himself, but of all members of the old cohesive team, within which a split or open protest can also occur during the redistribution of responsibility (for example, in the case of distribution of the tasks of the resigned employee equally to the whole department). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/195/3b6/e9d/1953b6e9d31caf034a133f32bb89ebbe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Charity is another major component of a healthy social society.  The skills of mutual help and support for those in need at a difficult moment are created by nature itself as an excellent help for the survival of the species as a whole.  However, today many people in their natural need of helping their neighbor are stopped by information about the existence of entire criminal syndicates, about dishonest money on alms and so on.  Simply put, today kindness is not regulated by anyone at the federal level, as if it does not exist in the country at all.  Of course, in such a situation, a transparent and universal project is urgently needed in which special <b>Moderators of charitable platforms will</b> eradicate fraud and establish a clear and visible process of redistribution of funds, as well as establish a continuous connection between the needy and those who are happy to help.  Instead of several hundred incomprehensible funds with hazy schemes and flows of funds, there is a single federal online system in which you will receive confirmation from the final recipient for each donated ruble.  Such a concept would greatly help society as a whole and in particular the individual.  The most vulnerable representatives today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/794/561/5da/7945615da3285182131c49a24eba73fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here we go to the next social problem: any donations, the largest sums - do not heal by themselves.  We need technology, doctors, medicines, special classes, love and support of loved ones.  Often, people with disabilities, even after receiving a large sum, do not have the physical capabilities and practical knowledge about what to do with it further.  There must necessarily be a number of sensitive and attentive professional: <b>Social worker on the adaptation of people</b> .  It will be a specialist who builds people with disabilities into a normal life, namely, he prepares to undergo the necessary treatment, or teaches skills for remote work, helps them to choose the scope of professional activity, to organize the work process and the process of rest.  This may be the selection of clinics and resorts, online communities and platforms for communication, educational courses and much more. <br>  And it will significantly improve and educate our society as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5ad/7f5/7df/5ad7f57dfda371bb3d9c130b9d743a7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting that, unfortunately, only the adaptation of the disabled is not enough for the prosperity of society.  Unfortunately, no matter how bright the future is in this article, we have to admit that social conflicts will not go away.  This can be either a misunderstanding on a national or gender basis, or conflicts provoked by a difference in material status or an accessible level of education.  No matter how much you and I would not want to, but for a very long time, the society will need a separate and highly qualified <b>Specialist for the resolution of social conflicts</b> , acting as an intermediary and based on the analysis of various data, finding the optimal compromise.  The main requirement is a non-violent solution for any conflicts that arise, and even better - a preventive reaction to potential opportunities that may become conflict-prone in the future.  Judge for yourself: the same religious and cultural strife with so many people on the planet is fraught with such disastrous consequences that you need to start preparing such mediators urgently and in large quantities in all universities of the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/de2/146/6cb/de21466cb23df96b90ac35d05ca82231.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the most interesting of all and the most promising profession in the social sphere of the most immediate and expected future is a professional who helps to transfer state functions in the social sphere.  For example, cleaning of premises and territories, water and heat supply, energy saving, recycling of solid household waste, repair of buildings and communications, municipal transport, kindergartens - all this will gradually come under the responsibility of social entrepreneurs who organize these functions in the format of public-private partnership.  This will be a <b>specialist in the organization of public-private partnerships in the social sphere</b> , who will help citizens increasingly to take responsibility for the quality of life in their country (city, district, house) and more actively improve their daily lives.  This will be a huge step in the development of the whole society as a whole, because such a step will mean a noticeable increase in trust in a friend and an exit to partnership. <br><br>  The pride from the realization of such a concept is comparable to the pride of a mother, who for several years did not let the little daughter go to the stove, but now the child has grown and is already able to prepare a delicious dinner for her tired parents who have returned to work.  Just imagine this bright picture, when everybody is collectively responsible for repairing the entrance and landscaping the playground, when it is not the abstract Governor or President who is always guilty of throwing garbage past a container or walking a clean-up day to build a new school for children. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2d1/48a/38c/2d148a38c743003704c23135b3ab260e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, all these fantasies still seem almost unrealizable, unrealistic and too optimistic.  The article just wants to draw your attention to the fact that the technologies themselves are already ready, that it will be physically possible to realize all these ideas right now.  The Internet is already ready to make our society more mature and responsible for its own life, to more actively help people solve their own problems and organize the most passionate leaders of society.  Your computer, laptop or phone can now become your new democratic tool, a tool for solving any social problems. <br><br>  Is man ready?  Is our psychology ready to let all the above-mentioned professionals into their lives and even more so to become one of them? <br><br>  <a href="http://atlas100.ru/">Read more about the future professions on the website of the atlas of new professions</a> <a href="http://atlas100.ru/"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365699/</a></p>
