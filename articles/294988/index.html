Or, to be more precise, not for the pleasure of whether we created YC. <br><br>  True, but only in part.  It is very interesting to work with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%25D0%25A2%25D1%258D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD">Robert Morris</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB,_%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Trevor</a> again.  I missed it, since we sold Viaweb, and all these years after, I had ideas about what we could do together.  This is definitely one of the aspects of the reunification of our group in Y Combinator.  Every few days I stupid and call it Viaweb.

      Viaweb we started to make money.  I got tired of living wandering from one freelance order to another, and I decided to work as hard as I could, until I could solve my problems once and for all.  Viaweb sometimes brought pleasure, but it was not intended for this, and in general it was not intended for anything.  I would be surprised if some startup thought for fun.  All startups are mostly boring (schleps). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The real reason why we started Y Combinator is not selfishness and not virtue.  We did not do it for making money;  we had no ideas about what the return on the project would be, what it would be even after some time.  We also did not plan to help young people become co-founders, although we liked this idea, and from time to time we consoled ourselves with the thought that if all our investments were accumulated, we would be able to do something disinterestedly (this is rather biased). <br><br>  The real reason why we started Y Combinator is probably only available to hackers.  We did it because it looks like a huge hack.  There are thousands of smart people who could create their own company, but did not create;  it is enough to apply a little force directed to a certain place, and we will be able to fill the world with a stream of new startups, which under other conditions might not have appeared. <br><br>  In a way, it's a virtue, because I think startups are good.  But what really motivates us is an absolutely immoral desire that will stimulate any hacker who has discovered some complex device and realized that with a small adjustment he can make it work more efficiently.  In this case, the device is a global economy, which, fortunately, turned out to be open source. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Another <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tceh/blog/253311/">107+ articles by Paul Graham</a> on Habr√©. <br>  <i>(Who wants to help with the translation - connect)</i> <br><br>  If you are interested in getting into Y Combinator and Graham's ideas are close to you, write in a personal, I have a couple of ideas. <br>  <b>Is your startup ready to apply to Y Combinator?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294988/</a></p>
