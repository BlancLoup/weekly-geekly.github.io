Even loyal customers are beginning to think more about the choices and conditions that other companies offer.  Add to this the fast pace of life of the target audience, a high level of information noise and promotional activities of competitors.  Only in this way you will get a real picture of the world of marketers, who daily have to fight for 3 seconds of attention of potential customers and subscribers. <br>  There is a logical question: how to influence the subscriber in 3 seconds? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Subscriber Psychology</b>

      If you are somehow connected with marketing, copywriting or sales, study psychology.  Here is a list of the main psychological facts that should be taken into account in the process of mailing preparation: <br><ul><li>  The subscriber performs the action emotionally.  Do you want the subscriber to follow the link in the letter - call his emotions.  Logic makes you think, not commit the action. </li><li>  Subscribers love facts.  Even when a potential client falls in love at first sight with the product in the mailing list, he will still double-check the specifications, reviews and compare prices with the prices of similar goods from competitors.  For a quick decision, give the subscriber the most detailed and clear information. </li><li>  All people are self-centered.  I often receive ‚Äúcold‚Äù mailings from unknown companies with the text ‚ÄúWe are an active, young team of specialists who do this and that ...‚Äù And so what?  I have something to do with it? <br>  The same reaction from all subscribers.  Talk about them, their desires and needs - this is the only way you will gain attention. </li><li>  People love shopping.  No need to convince a person to buy goods, he will do it himself.  Your task is to interest and show value. </li><li>  Netizens are always searching.  Information, goods, services - we are always looking for something.  If you can satisfy the subscriber‚Äôs need for a particular product / service or provide practical information, he will take action (follow the link in the letter). </li></ul><br>  As we can see, emotions play a pivotal role in the process of making a purchase decision, but the facts help to interest and convince. <br><br>  <b>Influence patterns</b> <br><br>  <b>AIDA</b> : Attention - Interest - Desire - Action formula is deeply rooted in marketing practices.  Igor Mann, a well-known Russian marketer and founder of the publishing house MIF, has repeatedly stressed in his reports the importance of following this model in advertising communication.  For mailing it is also more than relevant. <br>  Each component of the influence algorithm has its own place in the list: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ede/823/e33/ede823e3387340a797a29a335f6db807.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87c/4e0/6ed/87c4e06edf6d4c7f9d31b9f1d241e98e.jpg"><br><br>  The algorithm of the AIDA model is based precisely on the emotional factor of decision making and is great for everyday goods, clothes, small household appliances - i.e.  for goods, the decision on the purchase of which can be made at lightning speed (B2C segment). <br>  For durable goods or B2B segment, it is better to use another model - ACCA. <br>  Attention, Comprehension, Conviction, Action (ACCA) for someone may be just a modification of the usual model.  But its essence is significantly different from emotional influence, which means that ACCA deserves a separate algorithm and attention. <br>  ACCA is based on reasoned conviction and logic in making purchases.  Consider the steps of the algorithm: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4c/47c/293/b4c47c2931364cbda4ffe424a17afcea.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4f/291/328/a4f2913280404e16978f4f3119169358.jpg"><br><br>  Each of the models is used and shows good results.  In order to determine which model is more suitable for your product / service, answer a few questions for yourself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/37f/752/d0a37f752b57409c9094591bd0b36ed9.png"><br><br>  However, to convince the subscriber to follow the link and buy the product of daily use is also possible with the help of arguments and logic.  It all depends on your goals, the specifics of the target audience and product features. <br>  Try different algorithms, test messages, and find your own belief model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca2/9ba/b7f/ca29bab7f3794b228bb1e1dfecf86916.jpg">  Irina Chugay, marketer <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293956/</a></p>
