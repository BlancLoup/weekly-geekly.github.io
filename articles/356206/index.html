Yes, the very VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Yandex, Rambler, Mail.ru, Snapchat, Telegram, and others.  So, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media developed and submitted for public discussion a draft order with requirements for software and hardware and equipment, which should be installed by respected ORI, and what data these Internet services should transfer to the FSB in the system of operational search activities (the notorious SORM) so that the friendship between the state and the ORI, so to speak, grows stronger, and no one is offended by anyone (sorry for the high-pitched syllable). <br><br>  The order is called <i>‚ÄúOn approving Requirements for equipment and software and hardware used by the organizer of information dissemination on the Internet in the information systems operated by it, ensuring the implementation of specified actions during operational investigative activities, including a storage system,‚Äù</i> and its design, submitted for discussion by the general Internet public, <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">posted</a> on the portal of draft regulations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  SORM equipment will receive and accumulate the following information from the RAN register: the user ID in the RIS IP, the date and time of registration, the date and time of the agreement on the RIS IP service, its number (if entered into the contract), the data entered by the user: last name, first name and middle name, pseudonym, date of birth, address, address of residence, telephone number, passport data and other documents, list of identifiers in the RIS IP indicated by the user as relatives, forwarded messages entered by the user belonging to him  identifiers in other means of electronic interaction, including the name of the service and the identifier, the date and time of the last update of the registration information by the user, transmitted files, audio and video call records. <br><br>  The document is big.  And detailed: this is not a Wishlist, this is quite a detailed presentation, like what SORM should receive.  The secret of correspondence does not seem to relate to it, because, as we all know, this is done <i>in the name of the highest good</i> , and therefore, it is beyond the people's opinions.

      When I read about the fact that Facebook builds a graph between as many people as possible, I wondered how they do it, sometimes analyzing sources unrelated to each other.  Here, as you can see, the graph will assemble itself, you just have to dig into the storage of SORM-a: dear "organizers of the dissemination of information" with all their desire can not hide anything. <br><br>  Interesting, and will be? <br><br>  PS The phrase in the headline from the cartoon ‚ÄúThe kid that counted to ten‚Äù comes to my mind: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d7/fff/49e/1d7fff49eb40c4a80b0376c2aa530fd2.jpg"><br><br>  Remember, forest dwellers are against being considered, but he, brave and clever, knows for sure that they will be counted for good! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356206/</a></p>
