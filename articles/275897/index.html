  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top your questions to our person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The secondary IT market is very specific, especially from the Russian point of view.  Why?  Everything is logical here: the purchase of used IT equipment is associated with the purchase of a lot of working equipment on the radio market or on an ad.  Well, what to do if we are accustomed to cats in bags. <br>  Indeed, the decision to purchase a BU is a serious and, we hope, deliberate step.  A person who, more often than not, has been entrusted with a considerable part of the company's budget, is responsible for the purchase of equipment, on which the continuity and productivity of the functioning of this company directly depends.  Experiences about this are explicable.  In this short article, honestly and without embellishment, answers are given to the most frequently asked questions of customers, equipment and our company. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Where and how much equipment did you sell?</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is not possible to answer this question.  Do not immediately blame us that the first question has no answer.  The fact is that the server and network equipment is purchased by us abroad, at auctions of brands such as HP, DELL, IBM and Cisco.  This is a serviceable, previously worked machinery, which for one reason or another was put up for sale.  And there are few such reasons: from the bankruptcy of the company to the renovation of equipment.  When buying, there is not and cannot be direct contact with the organization that used this equipment earlier.  Therefore, it is possible to judge the path taken by our ‚Äúiron friends‚Äù only on the basis of the marking of the release date on the body and our imagination. <br>  Most importantly, after purchase, the iron is tested again and all possible defects are either eliminated or not detected due to their absence.  So we sell the already proven equipment, ready for the next start and long-term work. <cut>

      <b>2. If you buy a sled for HDD and a separate server hard drive, will the drive be determined by the server?</b> <br><br>  In newer server models, non-original hard drives are not really detected by the remote access system due to the lack of corresponding firmware on them, but this does not interfere with the disks to work properly (regularly for as many as the manufacturer of the disks guaranteed).  So if the fact that there is a ‚Äúyellow light bulb‚Äù does not bother you, then you can safely buy sleds and hard drives separately. <cut><br><br>  <b>3. What are the guarantees and who provides them?</b>  <b>Why is the warranty not provided by the manufacturer of the equipment?</b> <br><br>  Warranty is an integral part in the preparation of documents for the sale.  It is provided by our company.  Servers and other large equipment have a one-year warranty, but if you wish, you can purchase an extended warranty for a period of 2 years.  Components are also guaranteed for up to 12 months.  All equipment is provided with a 7-day free MoneyBack service. <br>  The manufacturer of the equipment provides a standard warranty of up to 3 years on new equipment.  Since the equipment is used, in most cases this guarantee is already expired. <cut><br><br>  <b>4. Where is the guarantee that your company will not disappear before the expiration of the warranty conditions?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Unfortunately, such guarantees cannot be given, but it is possible to provide arguments of our stability in the market and cleanliness in customer service. <br>  Our company was founded in 2003, and for 12 we have an extensive base of regular satisfied customers, not to mention its daily replenishment.  You can always read reviews about the company, check its position on the Internet.  Of course, you can not trust many positive reviews, but you will not find a frank chernukha about us.  And the main argument: we still exist, despite the fact that many have left this market over the years.  Therefore, you can safely <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery/">buy a server</a> and forget about it for a long time, and in case it doesn‚Äôt remind you of yourself, rely on us. </cut></cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275897/</a></p>
