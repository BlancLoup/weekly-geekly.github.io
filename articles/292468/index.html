Both cases are interesting because for a very substantial increase in conversion we did not have to make large-scale changes - we hope that our experience will be useful. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Audimania case: delivery calculator and work with orders from regions </h4><br>  Several years ago, we were puzzled by the fact that customers on the Audiomania website page do not see all the necessary information that would help them make a decision on an order.  The first thing we did during the solution of the problem was to create a regional delivery calculator.  This gave us a triple increase in orders from the regions (we described the trajectory: <a href="http://retailrocket.ru/blog/autsorsing-v-ecommerce-transkript-podkasta-traektoriya/">transcript</a> , <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/trajectory/00001">podcast</a> ) about how the calculator was created.

      <br>
      At the next stage, we worked on increasing the number of calls to our consultants and specialists from clients who are not living in Moscow or St. Petersburg.  At that time, the number 8-800 was still a rarity, so we determined the city by ip-address and, depending on this, replaced the telephone.  If the client was not from Moscow and St. Petersburg, we showed him the number 8-800, signed that the call was free - so people from the regions started to call and consult with us more readily. <br><br>  At this stage, it was possible to further increase the conversion by working with a certain segment of regional buyers - those who do not live in large regional centers.  Why are we interested in this group of clients?  Now, due to the fact that the growth of the Internet audience and the growth of the consumer audience of the Internet in major cities has almost stopped, that is, everyone who wanted to connect to the Internet and had the experience of shopping has already done so, the main gain comes from small settlements. <br><br>  It was important for us that the people living there showed more activity, but there was one problem in the way of solving this problem: potential customers often did not dare to place an order, knowing that the delivery possibilities to their localities are severely limited (often, only the Mail Russia).  On the other hand, we understood that these people live relatively close to major cities and regional centers. <br><br>  We did the following: we found the base of GPS coordinates of various cities and towns and used the data from there on the delivery calculator page.  Now residents of small settlements have more alternatives: they can get the goods at the place of residence or come to the nearest major city and take it from there.  We determine where the client lives, and on the delivery calculator page we show in which localities nearby it is possible to deliver the goods cheaply. <br><br>  Now we have decided to expand this practice and conduct an experiment: we deliver goods for free throughout the country with the exception of hard-to-reach regions and places with limited delivery capacity (these are villages and small settlements to which goods can be sent, again, only by mail - this method is not suitable for some categories of goods with which we work).  In this case, we also offer free delivery of goods to the nearest major city, where the buyer can easily come and pick up the purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/bdb/95b/9febdb95b2994add93104a23aa37378f.png" width="700"><br>  <i>Now Audioumania‚Äôs delivery calculator looks like this: the company offers a free delivery option (in this case, it‚Äôs Audiomania itself that chooses the courier service or transport company) (if the user wants to make the choice himself)</i> <br><br><h4>  Case "Boffo": the exact time of delivery and the organization of the product card </h4><br>  In the case of "Boffo" went a little further.  Logistics service "Boffo" establishes restrictions for sellers: in accordance with them, orders can be taken on a specific date not earlier than a specified time (for example, no earlier than 12 noon).  Previously, this information was used only within the company: this approach allowed us to deliver goods without delay. <br><br>  At some point we decided that this information could be broadcast to our customers.  Since we have our own delivery service in Moscow and St. Petersburg, people thanks to this see the real time of the nearest delivery, and can choose the actual time when they want to receive the goods.  This greatly increased the conversion in Moscow, to peaks - up to 15%. <br>  It is clear that these are not ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù numbers, but in this case we did not aspire to consciously increase the conversion: it turned out that the additional information on when exactly the buyer would receive the goods could seriously and positively influence the purchase decision. <br><br>  The basis of the problem and the main task in this case is to really fulfill the promises and deliver the goods at the specified time.  If a person once faces what is written one thing, and another is done, he will lose confidence in the store and will not buy anything in it. <br><br><h4>  Additional features to increase conversion </h4><br>  In addition, as practice has shown, it is useful to write return terms in the item card.  To make this information available, and the card does not look overloaded, we will organize it using the tabs: "Description", "Delivery", "Payment", right there next to information about the product, reviews, texts, articles and the very information about the return. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/eb0/106/2a0eb01063964dc7b0cc8b227a788385.png" width="700"><br>  <i>This is how the product card is organized on the site "Audiomania"</i> <br><br>  When we expanded the rights of consumers and indicated that returns and exchanges are possible not within 14 days prescribed by law, but within a month, this also gave an additional increase in conversion.  By itself, it was insignificant, but the sum of all these small changes gave us quite a tangible effect. <br><br><h4>  Findings: </h4><br><ol><li>  Pay attention to the delivery of goods: it is possible that buyers from the regions are hesitant to make an order, because the delivery options are limited.  Offer alternative options: it is sometimes easier for customers from small communities to come to the regional center and pick up the goods from there than wait for delivery by mail. </li><li>  If you have a well-established work of the courier service, give customers the opportunity to choose the exact time of delivery: this may be a determining factor when making a purchase decision.  But be careful: the client should not be given a reason to doubt the veracity of this information. </li><li>  Take care of the product card content: if there are too many product data, organize them by tabs.  As practice has shown, it is useful to emphasize once again that you are working in full compliance with the law and can provide the client with even more rights than is required by law. </li></ol><br> <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/51a/afe/d2c51aafe97b47329a6ec85f51b75caa.jpg" width="700"></a> <br><br>  <b><i>PS:</i></b> <i>Audiomania is celebrating his DR!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We thank our customers for their dedication and continue to work for our favorite audience:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/">Updated Audiomania website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/">Our blog on Geektimes.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/253238/">Our podcast in iTunes</a> </li></ul><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292468/</a></p>
