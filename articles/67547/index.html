On the one hand, they are manufacturers and suppliers of software, hardware, IT services, on the other hand, they are dealers, VARs, and on the third, buyers and users of all IT benefits. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/022/d33/89e/022d3389e4fdd640ec3f74257fd45c04.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that this is not just a friendly party - all interaction goes on in the plane of solving various IT-problems, choosing a specific solution, finding a seller.

      In fact, IT4All.ru is an exchange of IT services. <br>  Why we swung to such a global project. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We are trying to solve the problems of all participants in the IT-market at once. <br><br>  From the experience of our many years of work as a software seller, we have to admit that in fact the lion's share of companies has IT specialists who understand little in licensing many very popular products. <br>  So these small offices, which are found in a great variety not only in the Russian periphery, but also in the most white-stone, buy software that does not solve their problems, but guarantees these problems in the future. <br>  Therefore, at the very first check by the relevant authorities, all sorts of great things are revealed: in particular, the use of home versions of software to solve business problems.  This is one example.  Another fairly common is the case of mindless tranquility, when, in a company with 100 computers, they order 100 boxes of office space.  Those who know will understand. <br>  IT4All is such a reserved place in RuNet where dealers, vendors and customers will finally meet.  We hope that as a result of productive communication, participants in the IT market will no longer live their separate lives.  I want to reduce the nose to the nose of the manufacturer of specialized software for solving production problems and a company that needs just such a product to automate work processes.  After all, ironically, they do not know about each other.  There is a third interested party: VARs (value added reseller).  They could make money on this contact by offering their services in installing, configuring and supplying equipment. <br>  All participants in this business triangle, having made acquaintances, should eventually see new horizons for the development of their business.  By joining the IT4All community, vendors can easily reach regional dealers and customers.  The latter are directly online get a qualified recommendation of vendors and experts.  Vendors, dealers, VARs will appreciate IT4All's suitability to accommodate solutions and cases.  Well, of course, to promote their own additional services to the circulation software. <br>  Independent experts at IT4All, by the way, are welcome as nowhere else.  Their advice in the project has a special role: the recommendation of a specialist can be decisive for the user when choosing software or his vendor.  In general, this platform allows the expert to constantly improve his professional rating, be aware of market events, work on direct communication with vendors and dealers.  And to confirm the high competence of experts provided certificates from leading vendors. <br>  The site has just been launched, so we welcome any suggestions and suggestions for its work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67547/</a></p>
