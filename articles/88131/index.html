  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu 9.10 and his life on my desktop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Habr! <br><br>  With my first post I want to introduce you to my new system, in experienced circles called ‚ÄúKarmic Koala‚Äù, and in the world of marketing and economics - Ubuntu 9.10.  And, maybe, for you, it is very, very familiar and comfortable, then, to me, a hard-nosed winner with 8 years of experience, it seems amazing, interesting and slightly ... mysterious.  So, what prompted me to finally switch to alternative operating systems, and how it was done - under habrakat. <br><br>  Fasting is not at all provocative and does not call for conversion of free software into the faith - it simply shows the experience of one person only.  How it loves Habr, yes.

It all started, like many - from ordering free disks on Shipit - the first sign was 8.04.  She didn‚Äôt stand up with me - I don‚Äôt even remember why I decided to refuse her.  Let me just say that I then had an Asus X51 laptop (either R, or L), something didn‚Äôt go there, and Genius‚Äôs webcam didn‚Äôt want to work - everything was demolished very quickly without any investigation.  Well, then everything is the same fragments, samples - but later, plunging into the system Webmoney Transfer and professional activities, I increasingly dug a hole in the systems a la Ubuntu on my computer.  But this did not prevent me from installing Fedora 9 in one enterprise as a DNS server.  I read a lot of manuals then - and I smoked no less.  But even such an act did not make me go. <br><br>  By the way, the picture you see is somewhat higher - this is mine.  Yes - and it was she who was the last kick in the ass so that I tried to finally transfer to Linux.  Prior to this, while still not on Windows 7, I vehemently tried to learn how to work in OpenOffice 3.2.  What I want to say is that the developers have so successfully brought OpenOffice to the mind that I wanted to use it in return for Office 2010!  But - then it did not work out.  The lack of statistics on characters without spaces is really annoying. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.kz/" title="Pics.kz"><img src="http://pics.kz/s3/97/b2/fc/4b/97b2fc4bc06705c549d1b65b8c580470.png" alt="Pics.kz"></a> <br><br><h5>  Initial problems. </h5><br><br>  When I bought my desktop for a modest sum, I first installed, of course, Windows 7. Then, when I got Ubuntu 9.10 - I tried and started it ... but the installer, as well as LIVE-CD, did not start wanted to.  X did not go, as I understand it now.  The PAVP service, embedded in the BIOS, was to blame for everything.  As I found out, it is responsible for hidden memory backup when using the integrated video card to properly display and smoothly display Blu-Ray discs.  At the same time, it is enabled by default and just ‚Äúeats‚Äù 256 Mb, keeping them in reserve.  Well, in addition, he did not allow to run the Ubuntu installer - which, you see, is bad. <br><br>  To be honest, the OpenSuse 11.2 installer started and even wrote me the distribution kit on the hard disk.  But while working, I met such hard brakes that it is better to use Windows than to try to overcome these 9 circles of hell.  I also tried to trust the rumors that the 2.6.32 kernel solves this problem - but everything turned out to be false, especially since I could not update the kernel in a normal way. <br><br>  After a week of torment and tinkering in the settings - I solved the problem.  Glory to labor, as they say, and <br><br><h4>  Go! </h4><br><br>  Carefully transferring all my belongings to an external hard drive from Transcend, put in an installation disk (which, by the way, I also pre-ordered with Shipit - a habit, or something) - turned on autostart, and went off! <br><br><h5>  About Ubuntu. </h5><br><br>  Installation is easy, but long.  We have 1 Mbit in the steppes for external Internet resources, so when Ubuntu decided to download Russian language packs, I took a nap.  One way or another, installation is simpler than in Windows XP, but much slower and more complicated than in Windows 7. This is a subjective opinion, naturally. <br><br>  So, the pristine orange desktop was loaded.  The environment of Gnome is familiar to me - and it is a priority, the most convenient for me.  First thing I did: <br><br><ul><li>  Installed additional non-free packages (Ubuntu Restricted Extras); </li><li>  Put Pidgin instead of Empathy (sorry, but the triangles-statuses and the minimal fixation of the window in half the desktop I really did not like); </li><li>  OpenOffice 3.1.1 is replaced by OpenOffice 3.2 (it works much, significantly, much faster and better. However, with the setting of spell checking, there are still significant difficulties); </li><li>  Ubuntu Tweak is installed, and Google Chrome, Dropbox, Skype, Deluge, Google Gadgets, Woopra, just in case VLC is installed with it, and of course, any decorations, of course; </li><li>  Put Wine, the only way so far and did not understand why? </li><li>  Reduced the font by 8 pt - by the way, who will advise which font to use? </li></ul><br><br> <a href="http://pics.kz/" title="Pics.kz"><img src="http://pics.kz/s3/a9/5c/3c/c5/a95c3cc555d1bbb7e897952fc457f91e.png" alt="Pics.kz"></a> <br><br>  Minuses at the moment (at the moment - because I haven‚Äôt fixed them yet. I think that you can fix any minus in Ubuntu, the main thing is to give it time and knowledge): <br><br><ul><li>  Webcam does not work.  It works more precisely, but it starts up, turning the image over (I still remember it because of the torment in Ubuntu 9.04, when I was still trying to start it - it was still half a day, then it was blown away); </li><li>  Because of the integrated video card (X4500, G41 chipset), small brakes are felt; </li><li>  Headphones do not work - the sound is supplied only to the speakers, for some reason; </li><li>  Even under Vine, the program that is occasionally necessary is not launched (Advego Plagiatus, for example); </li><li>  In OpenOffice 3.2, there are still no statistics on characters without spaces.  We have to go to third-party sites.  Although lately I still say the price by the hour, labor costs - but the symbols are still the basis, the foundation. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  About Webmoney. </h5><br><br>  Now a little about my travels already in Ubuntu itself.  I‚Äôm a freelance copywriter who had long ago refused Yandex.Money because they no longer change in a normal, natural way to Webmoney, and because their normal, natural output in Kazakhstan is very low, downright uncivilized, rate.  I have been using the Webmoney Transfer payment system for two or three years - the BL is quite high, and some customers throw money without even asking for a wallet - which is why I CAN'T refuse my wallet.  The Mini was started - but for some reason it does not allow to fully use the service, not allowing me authorization on many resources.  This fact has stopped my transition to Ubuntu before - but now I have found a delicate and secure solution. <br><br>  What I've done?  Everything is very simple - connected Webmoney Keeper Mini and Enum.  Authorization and payments through Enum do not require the presence or even launch of Keeper Classic, so payments go in the right direction without any problems.  Well, funds are managed through Webmoney Keeper Mini with wallets connected from Classic.  I have long been convinced that everything ingenious is simple, and it is not necessary to use this strangely painful Light, with its safety certificates. <br><br><h5>  About Windows and Ubuntu. </h5> <br><br>  So now the most important thing.  How long can I take it?  I myself can not answer this question.  I like both.  I love the appearance of the seven, I like its new taskbar and super-duper transparency.  I am used to everything there - down to the smallest detail.  But I don‚Äôt like the price of ‚ÄúWindows 7 Professional‚Äù at the moment, because the budget of my small family of two people is not yet possible, due to the great plans, to spend more than $ 200 on a copy of the disk - buying a full license remains in the span .  And I have a very strong conscience ... <s>which hawks my heart at night, forcing</s> me <s>to cry and cry in a pillow</s> that prevents me from using pirates. <br><br>  Nevertheless, Ubuntu 9.10 is a very decent operating system, which gives the opportunity to work and run the programs I need.  What else do you need from the OS?  Never mind.  To play around - well, it's someone like that, lately I‚Äôm used to just collecting discs with licensed toys, and not playing them.  There is such a mania - on the boxes.  I have it very developed.  So at the moment Ubuntu 9.10 - for me is a normal alternative, with which I do not lose anything, but only save.  What else do I want to say?  Well, I hope that Ubuntu 10.04 will be far worse than the current distribution, and I will be able to use it also conveniently and without problems. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I still have a laptop - HP Compaq 6720s, which I, after buying a desktop, gave my wife with all the giblets.  Now there is her usual Windows XP, but I'm already thinking of a quiet night, while no one sees, to install the gentle Ubuntu or Kubuntu there.  Still thinking. <br><br>  Useful links for beginners: <br>  forum.ubuntu.ru - community forum where you can find or request solutions to many problems; <br>  help.ubuntu.ru/manual - manual. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88131/</a></p>
