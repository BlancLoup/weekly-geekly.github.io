He just needed to download this missing document to complete his part of the project.  Time flowed inexorably forward. <br>  There was a blizzard outside the window, making it difficult to quietly go out and walk to the library, but Eugene did not even think about this option.  All his thoughts were lines on the screen, offering to register to gain access to the site. <br>  In the tense silence, the telephone rang suddenly.  ‚ÄúEvgeny Vladimirovich?‚Äù Asked a voice at the other end of the tube.  ‚ÄúYes, it's me,‚Äù Zhenya muttered, perplexed and slightly nervously. <br>  ‚ÄúEvgeny Vladimirovich, my name is Konstantin Olegovich.  I call to remind you about tomorrow's meeting and make it clear how much depends on you. ‚Äù  The interviewer made an explicit emphasis on the word "you." <br>  "Yes, yes, everything will be done by tomorrow morning," - said Eugene. " <br>  "All the best, Evgeny Vladimirovich."  At the other end of the tube sounded beeps. <br>  ‚ÄúHow did you all get me!  Tomorrow, after the completion of the project, I will go on vacation! ‚ÄùThe leading Atom-3 project manager shouted in hearts. <br>  He was suddenly scared.  Scary for everything at once.  For my wife, for my daughter Lenochka, for myself, for my work colleagues.  And just in general for tomorrow.

      The year was 2027 and Information Security (yes, it should have been written with a capital letter) was an important component of the entire Internet.  It was necessary to be very careful and never anywhere on the Internet do not leave your personal data: no photos, no date of birth, no data about work and friends.  For in aggregate, all these data gave unlimited possibilities to attackers. <br>  Collecting as much information as possible about a particular person, the Illusion group known throughout the world, created clones of people, and managing them could receive money in banks from the accounts of victims, organize terrorist attacks or even more insidious and evil crimes. <br>  Social networks disappeared in 2019.  The world began to understand the whole threat from the dissemination of personal data.  The guys from Illusion still collected victims for themselves, creating websites with pornography, file sharing services and free postal services, the prerequisite of which was registration using personal data.  All actions performed by the user on the Internet are confirmed by a biometric signature.  And people, not paying attention to the existing danger, with inexhaustible carelessness, all continued to fall into the Databases of social hackers from Illusion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou got it with your information security!‚Äù He exclaimed aloud.  Until the minute determination disappeared, he entered the registration data into the fields on the site and put his finger on the biometric sensor. <br>  With unblinking eyes, he followed the rapidly changing information on the monitor screen.  The page was fun, as it seemed to Eugene, it rebooted and a link appeared to download the necessary document. <br>  Hurriedly clicking on the link, Eugene was already thinking about tomorrow and about the successful completion of the project. <br>  But on the screen, too slowly, as it seemed to him, the document began to open.  Zhenya squeezed the mouse in his hand.  "Well, rather, already," he murmured, and immediately turned deathly pale, without taking his eyes off the monitor. <br>  On the screen, in the opened document there was an inscription ‚ÄúThank you for registration, number 772241034‚Äù. <br>  Eugene already realized that his data fell into Illusion. <br><br>  Outside the window, the blizzard was all the same ... <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70054/</a></p>
