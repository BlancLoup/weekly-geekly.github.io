      I was pleasantly surprised by the conference venue chosen by the organizers.  This is the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation.  It is located right on the Mediterranean coast.  Near the center is quite large and, I note, free parking.  There are big problems with this, there is no place to put the car, and all parking is paid.  And so, choosing a good place to park a car and inspect the beautiful, clean beach, we see a rather unusual facade of the press center.  The press center itself is a small three-story building.  The design of the facade creates the feeling that the concrete blocks just float in the air, and between them only glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97e/02b/762/97e02b762e4a11a18c35044ba86f4a25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I arrived at the site, as it should be in advance, so that I can sign up without a turn and go straight to networking.  But it was not there.  The organizers forced to wait at the entrance not only ordinary visitors, but also eminent investors.  The door was closed in front of everyone :) But it gave a great opportunity to start networking right on the porch.  Special attention was drawn to military helicopters, which often ply along the coastline from north to south.  It looks safe and very interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32a/8b7/685/32a8b76856b77b83902df14bbfd965f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quite a lot was the German speaking public.  As it turned out, this was due to the presentation of the NRW.Invest Germany system.  Also among the attendees of the conference I met Russian speakers.  To my surprise, most were from Ukraine.  There were also visitors from Israel and other countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/200/dc6/31c/200dc631cbab8600f9f9d886015958d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the doors were opened for visitors, everyone quickly went through the registration and received a long-awaited badge and a booklet with a program of performances.  In the cool, spacious lobby on the first floor, networking immediately began to boil.  Quite convenient accreditation made it possible to quickly understand who to look for.  A distinctive feature of accreditation, the organizers have chosen the color of the string for the badge.  White - the organizer.  Yellow - speakers.  Red - investors.  Blue - all the rest.  I was the owner of the blue ribbon and represented abz.agency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea6/ace/8d4/ea6ace8d4b707e5873b7a3641a6447dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I have a rather bad colloquial English.  And I had prepared a small greeting: ‚ÄúI'm representative of abz.agency company.  Our company is a web-developer as outsourcing partner.  Our team consists of 20 employees.  Here I want to find new projects for development as an outsourcers. ‚ÄùIf the interlocutor was interested, then the ritual of exchanging business cards was carried out.  And then followed a short conversation about who does what.  So after all, networking should work;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d65/18e/527/d6518e527cac7ace585716fa0cbba54a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, everything moved to the 2nd floor, where there were no empty seats.  The performances were organized quite well.  But there was as always a couple of incidents with presentations.  Oh, these PPTs :) I really enjoyed the performance, which was not directly related to our line of business.  Namely, web development (Laravel, Symfony frameworks, Node and AngularJS) and digital marketing (UX analysis, A / B test, and other CR enhancement methods).  I liked the start-up about the pass system.  For example, your company has 500 employees and in the mornings people spend quite a lot of time at the entrance to get to work.  This system allows you to scan the visitor and skip it automatically while he passes the scanner at a speed of slow pace.  A person just needs to go through the turnstile at normal speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ac/45b/5e3/9ac45b5e32a69b462e8e47179775bed5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The day ended pretty quickly.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/323988/">We are waiting for what will happen next.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/69c/0ec/f2869c0ec777243431e3e226655b816d.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323986/</a></p>
