AI <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242931/">processes photos</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273996/">draws pictures</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275170/">creates an arrangement</a> for musical works, generates room designs and people's faces.  Now artificial intelligence is engaged in writing a script for a horror movie. <br><br>  Why attract AI?  According to the authors of the project, now so many lines of the plot have been developed for films, that it is difficult to invent something new.  But you can make a movie of the elements of the plot lines of existing works.  The authors of the new scenarios usually do this, but they use, firstly, only a small part of the material - what they remember.  Secondly, it is difficult for people to objectively evaluate both individual storylines and the resulting scenario as a whole.  As a result, 87% of new films fail at the box office. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Artificial intelligence can analyze huge amounts of data, ranking information according to various criteria.  The problem with AI is that it cannot compose a whole plot, attractive to a person and logical in general.  An example is the short film "Sunspring", the script to which is entirely written by the AI.

The only thing that can justify AI in this case - there are a large number of films created by people, where there is no more sense and logic of the narration than in ‚ÄúSunspring‚Äù.  AI should say: "I am an artist, I see it." <br><br>  Therefore, the authors of the project ‚ÄúImpossible Things‚Äù decided to use AI to search for original and popular cinema lines among the audience of the plot, individual elements.  And it is up to man to make all this into one. <br><br>  This is about the movie "Impossible Things".  It shows the story of a family who loses a little daughter.  In order to recover from the experience, the family leaves for a country house.  Mother is engaged in the restoration of the house, develops the design of rooms for her two other children.  But things are not going according to plan - she begins to hear voices, sees a strange woman and is confronted with the spirit of a child similar to her daughter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/249/055/5f8/2490555f8de396dedad0a34cebc5bd7f.png"><br><br>  The authors of the project believe that it is impossible to replace a person in the creative process.  AI can help him, but so far it‚Äôs still too early to talk about replacing a person with a computer. <br><br><h3>  So how does it all work? </h3><br>  The filmmakers used Natural Language Processing (NLP).  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãfed thousands and thousands of elements of various plot lines to hundreds of films, giving the system information about the film's popularity, box office amounts and rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ed/047/19f/0ed04719f02a6203ff76902e67d2f22d.png"><br><br>  The developers have created a graphical interface for the operation of their system.  The result was a platform that analyzes individual elements of the plot of films with a demonstration of the popularity of the plot in different regions of the United States.  AI is also trying to predict the payback of films with the inclusion of the proposed storylines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f80/da3/0d1/f80da30d18e296d90a62cc9a403ce931.gif"><br><br>  After selecting 10-20 individual elements, which, in aggregate, according to AI, give the film maximum popularity, the scriptwriters-people begin to make up a whole plot. <br><br><h3>  What is already there? </h3><br>  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãdid everything it had to, and people wrote a script following the analysis.  He is ready, the film can be shot.  The only thing that prevents shooting at this stage is the lack of money.  Funds are not so much needed, about 30,000 Canadian dollars.  And the authors of the idea are trying to raise money <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/970954017/impossible-things-worlds-first-ai-co-written-featu">for Kickstarter</a> .  For three days, the fourth part of the required amount was collected, and by the end of the due date, two more months.  It can be expected that the money will be collected, and the film will appear on the screens.  Contributors who donated amounts from C $ 1000 will be able to access the software used to create the script.  Access is granted for six months. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtjBM8wL1ec%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6Ce0AH8nazbDfKUSbgTQniTR8vA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I wish that the shooting was completed as quickly as possible - then one could understand what the film is and whether or not AI can improve the quality of the film.  Perhaps it is so, but there is also such a problem as the director‚Äôs vision, the quality of the cameraman‚Äôs shooting and the acting.  If all this is on top, you can talk about the success of the film. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396525/</a></p>
