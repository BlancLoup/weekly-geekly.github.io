And, most importantly, I realized that buying shares was not so difficult as it seemed before, and not even as expensive (in terms of overhead), as I had assumed.  And in this article I want to share only my experience in this field in the form of general theoretical information and practical guidance (HOWTO) for beginners.

On American and European exchanges, it is customary to use letter tickers, which are usually abbreviations on behalf of the company itself (for example, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:GOOG">GOOG</a> - Google Inc., <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:MSFT">MSFT</a> - Microsoft Corporation, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DEPA:DSY">DSY</a> - Dassault Syst√®mes).  On Asian markets, stocks are usually given numeric tickers (for example, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DHKG:0992">0992</a> - Lenovo Group Limited, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DTPE:2498">2498</a> - HTC Corporation, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DTPE:2357">2357</a> - ASUSTEK Computer, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DTYO:6758">6758</a> - Sony Corporation, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DTYO:6752">6752</a> - Panasonic Corporation). <br>  The ticker is unique only within one exchange.  If a company exposes its shares on different exchanges, then on one exchange its shares may have one ticker, and on another exchange - another ticker.  To uniquely identify specific stocks, you need to know the name of the exchange, and the ticker of the shares on this exchange.  Therefore, specific shares are often denoted by the abbreviated name of the exchange + through the colon ticker of specific shares, for example, HKG: 0992, TYO: 6758, NASDAQ: MSFT, NYSE: RHT, EPA: DSY, TPE: 2498. <br><br></li><li>  In addition to the tickers for the designation of securities using ISIN ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number">International Securities Identification Number</a> ) - is the international identification code of the security, which is unique in all global exchanges. <br>  The structure of the ISIN is described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6166">ISO 6166</a> .  The first two ISIN characters are the two-letter country code of the issuer of the security, for example, US - USA, CA - Canada, RU - Russia (for a full list of country codes, see <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1</a> ).  This is followed by 9 letters and numbers of the national security identification code (National Securities Identification Number, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSIN">NSIN</a> ).  The code completes the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">check digit</a> . <br>  The ISIN code is assigned by national numbering agencies ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_numbering_agency">NNA</a> ). <br><br></li><li> Some companies place their shares only on one of the world exchanges, while others are presented simultaneously on several world exchanges in different regions (America, Europe, Asia). <br>  The US NASDAQ Stock Exchange specializes in shares of high-tech companies (electronics, software, etc.), first of all there are American companies from Silicon Valley.  But there is no hard division according to the types of companies represented between exchanges; shares of leading IT companies can be found not only on the NASDAQ exchange. <br>  For example, here are a few companies that <b>trade on the NASDAQ</b> : Google ( <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:GOOG">GOOG</a> ), Microsoft ( <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:MSFT">MSFT</a> ), Apple ( <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:AAPL">AAPL</a> ), Cisco Systems ( <a href="http://www.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:CSCO">CSCO</a> ), Yahoo!

This implies that the issuing company for the first time brings its shares to the stock exchange, offering them to an unlimited circle of persons.  After entering an IPO, a startup or private company officially becomes a public company.  Before taking the company's shares to the exchange, the company is audited, its assets are valued and its shares are calculated. <br>  An IPO (i.e., putting companies into free sale on the stock exchange) is beneficial to various parties.  For company owners, this allows them to attract additional investments from a wide range of investors.  Investors, on the other hand, can buy shares in a company in the event of the company's future financial success and, accordingly, an increase in the market value of the shares. <br>  The experience of entering the IPO of IT companies in recent years shows that the value of shares is noticeably reduced after 1-3 weeks after the start of trading on the exchange.  Therefore, if you decide to buy shares of some IT-company immediately after the IPO, it is better to bear at least a week. <br><br></li><li>  Listing (from the English list - list) - a set of procedures for the inclusion of securities in the exchange list (list of securities admitted to exchange trading), monitoring the compliance of securities with the conditions and requirements established by the exchange.  During the listing, the stock exchange conducts an examination of the securities and verifies the legality of the financial and economic activities of the issuing company.  All securities issued by the issuing company to the exchange are subject to listing. <br>  Delisting is the reverse procedure, i.e.  exclusion of the company's shares from the list of traded on a particular stock exchange. <br><br></li><li>  Players in the securities market can be divided into two categories: traders and investors. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c8/06/c80673af75cdfb58784c6f823267feee.jpg" alt="Investor">  <b>Investors</b> buy and sell stocks relatively rarely, i.e.  make long-term (for several months or even years) investing in shares of one or several companies.  Moreover, stock investors use for the purchase of shares only their own funds. <br clear="left"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4a/db/4adb248fb3a24b5d0ceb8f1ffb7efe33.jpg" alt="Trader">  <b>Traders</b> are more active in trading stocks, often buying and often selling stocks of various companies.  Moreover, exchange traders often trade not only with their own funds, but also use borrowed funds for the purchase of shares (for more details, see <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">margin trading</a> - trading with leverage). <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Traders</a> , in turn, are also divided into different categories according to various criteria.  For example, by the duration of transactions (ie, the time from purchase to sale of shares): <br>  <i>Day trader (day trader)</i> - makes deals within one trading day (one trading session), closes all positions before closing the exchange day without transferring trades to the next day.  The duration of transactions at day traders from tens of minutes to several hours. <br>  <i>A scalper (he is a pipsman, he is a hare)</i> - an even more short-term trader, makes a large number of transactions with a duration from several seconds to several minutes.  On each transaction, earns a little (because the value of shares in this interval varies slightly), but at the expense of the huge number of such short-term transactions during one trading session can be pretty decent amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/df/1b/df1b40c75a4ea5c607dcbc143530dac1.jpg" alt="Bender monocle and cylinder" align="right">  In the field of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">scalping</a> (pipsing) in recent years, exchange robots (automated trading systems) have been very successful.  With the help of the algorithms embedded in them, these robots automatically analyze micro oscillations and trends in the course of various stocks and automatically put in orders for their purchase and sale. <br>  They are able to put a huge number of applications per unit of time.  A live trader can no longer keep up with them in the speed of data analysis and bidding.  Therefore, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãscalping on the stock exchanges, there are practically no chances for people against modern stock trading robots.  As a robot Bender would say: <i>‚ÄúKiss my shiny metal ass, pathetic pieces of meat!‚Äù</i> .  Glory to the robots! <br><br>  Sometimes investors are considered as a kind of traders, but in my classification I decided to separate them. <br>  If an individual (individual) acts as an investor, then he is usually called a private investor.  <b>This article will discuss how to become a private investor.</b>  However, having tried yourself in the role of an investor, you later may want to engage in more active trading in stocks and move into the category of exchange traders. <br><br></li><li>  It is not the investor himself who is engaged in buying and selling stocks directly on the stock exchanges, but a special intermediary, called a broker.  A broker is a sales representative who is a professional market participant and makes transactions on the stock exchange on behalf of a client (investor) and at his expense. <br>  Brokerage services in global markets for the end client are usually provided by numerous investment / brokerage companies. <br><br></li><li>  The general scheme of stock trading on the stock exchange, briefly, looks like this: <br>  <b>a.</b>  The client (investor) opens a brokerage (trading) account in a brokerage company and transfers funds from his bank account to it. <br>  <b>b.</b>  When a client wants to buy some shares, he submits to the broker the order to purchase shares.  In this case, the client‚Äôs brokerage account is debited for the purchase of shares, as well as other fees and commissions. <br>  <b>c.</b>  When a client wants to sell existing shares, he submits to the broker the order to sell the shares.  In this case, the funds received from the sale arrive at the brokerage account minus fees and commissions. <br>  <b>d.</b>  The client can withdraw money from the brokerage account to his bank account or, on the contrary, add additional funds from the bank account to the brokerage account. </li></ol>  <b>Thus, in order to buy shares of some companies on the stock exchanges, you, as a private investor, first of all need to find a suitable investment company that provides brokerage services on the relevant stock exchanges.</b> <br>  But in order to understand which investment company will suit you and which one will not, I will set forth some more important theoretical information about investment companies. <br><br><h2>  What you need to know before looking for an investment / brokerage company in Russia </h2><br>  Firstly, it should be understood that not all Russian investment / brokerage companies trade in Western stock markets.  Many of them trade (and, accordingly, provide brokerage services) only on Russian stock exchanges (RTS, MICEX, SPCE, etc.). <br><br>  Secondly, some of those Russian investment companies that still trade in Western markets provide brokerage services on these exchanges only for legal entities, and they do not work with private investors. <br><br>  And thirdly, some of those Russian investment companies that still provide brokerage services in Western securities markets to Russian individuals provide such services not to everyone, but only to qualified investors. <br><br>  According to Russian legislation on the securities market <b>for trading stocks on foreign stock exchanges, you must be a qualified investor</b> . <br>  A qualified investor is not just a name, it is an official status established by Russian legislation. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b6/04/b60468aa305c18b72a6b64c57834c9f3.jpg" alt="emblem of the Federal Financial Markets Service of Russia">  The term ‚Äúqualified investor‚Äù was introduced by the Order of the Federal Service for Financial Markets (FSFM) of March 18, 2008 ‚Äú08-12 / pz-n‚Äù.  This order approved the Regulation on the procedure for recognizing persons as qualified investors, according to which individuals, for recognition as qualified investors, must meet certain requirements. <br><blockquote>  <i>An individual may be recognized as a qualified investor if he meets any two requirements listed below:</i> <ol><li>  Owns securities and (or) other financial instruments meeting the requirements of legislation, the total value of which is at least 3 million rubles. <br>  In determining the total value of these securities and (or) other financial instruments, the corresponding financial instruments transferred by an individual into trust management are also taken into account. </li><li>  She has experience in a Russian and (or) foreign organization that carried out transactions with securities and (or) other financial instruments: <br>  - not less than 1 year, if such an organization (organizations) is a qualified investor by virtue of clause 2 of Article 51.2 of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the Securities Market‚Äù; <br>  or <br>  - at least 3 months if such organization (organizations) is a qualified investor by virtue of paragraph 2 of Article 51.2 of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the Securities Market‚Äù and on the date of recognition of a person as a qualified investor, this person is an employee of the specified organization; <br>  - at least 2 years in other cases. </li><li>  Performed quarterly at least 10 transactions with securities and (or) other financial instruments during the last 4 quarters, the total price of which for the 4 quarters was at least 300,000 rubles, or made at least 5 transactions with securities and (or ) other financial instruments over the past 3 years, the total price of which amounted to at least 3 million rubles. </li></ol></blockquote>  As you can see, for a beginner in stock trading these are obviously impracticable requirements.  Therefore, if you are only planning to buy shares, but have never done this before, then you will not be able to immediately receive the status of a qualified investor. <br><br>  <b>However, there is a way around this limitation.</b> <br>  The fact is that it is necessary to meet the requirements of Russian legislation and have the official status of a qualified investor for trading on foreign exchanges only if you are trading from the territory of Russia, i.e.  if your brokerage account is located on the territory of the Russian Federation. <br>  And if the brokerage company and, accordingly, the brokerage account through which shares are bought / sold are located outside of Russia, then they no longer fall under the jurisdiction of Russian exchange legislation.  And it is this scheme that will suit you if you are new to the stock exchange.  Below I will describe in more detail this scheme of access to Western stock exchanges under the code name "Cyprus brokerage scheme." <br><br><h2>  Cyprus brokerage scheme </h2><br>  <sup>(At once I will make a reservation that the ‚ÄúCyprus scheme‚Äù is an unofficial name, I used it in my article just for brevity)</sup> <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c7/b0/c7b07f128ba2e0f37ec0f3ed4cc2bd81.jpg" alt="Cyprus Flag">  The scheme is used for access of Russian investors to foreign stock exchanges and is as follows. <ol><li>  A Russian investment company (or bank) registers its subsidiary brokerage company in the Republic of Cyprus. </li><li>  A Russian investor who wants to trade stocks on foreign stock exchanges is turning to this Russian investment company. </li><li>  There he is offered for trading on foreign stock exchanges to enter into a brokerage service contract directly with their subsidiary company in Cyprus. </li><li>  The client (investor) concludes this brokerage service agreement with a Cyprus brokerage company, opens his brokerage account with this company in Cyprus, transfers funds from his Russian bank account to it. </li><li>  Next, the investor buys and sells shares on foreign stock exchanges through this brokerage account. </li><li>  Income received after the sale of shares on a brokerage account can be transferred to a bank account in Russia. </li></ol>  In general, everything is the same as when trading through a Russian brokerage company on Russian exchanges.  But in this scheme, the stock exchange is located outside of Russia, and the brokerage account of the investor is also located outside of Russia.  Thus, the purchase and sale of shares and the receipt of income by the investor entirely occur outside of Russia, which means they are so derived from the jurisdiction of Russian legislation. <br><br>  <b>The purpose of this scheme is precisely to deduce the client's exchange activities from the legal field of Russian legislation in order to circumvent a number of restrictions that are imposed by the laws of the Russian Federation.</b> <br><br><h4>  Why precisely Cyprus? </h4><br>  Why do Russian banks and investment companies implement this scheme through a brokerage company in Cyprus?  Why not in any other country outside of Russia? <br><br>  Some people mistakenly believe that the choice of the country is due to the fact that Cyprus is an offshore zone.  However, this is no longer the case.  Offshore zone is the past of Cyprus.  In 2004, the Republic of Cyprus joined the EU, and then the offshore regime for international companies ceased there.  And in 2008 the Republic of Cyprus also joined the euro zone. <br>  That is why in my description I called this scheme Cypriot, and not offshore. <br><br>  However, in Cyprus, although it is more officially and not offshore, favorable tax conditions for brokerage companies still remain, and this is why: <ol><li>  According to the tax laws of the Republic of Cyprus (Cyprus Law "On Income Tax" of 2002), income received in Cyprus from the sale of securities, as well as in the form of dividends, is fully exempt from taxes. </li><li>  For other types of income in Cyprus there is a single tax rate of 10% - this is the lowest income tax rate in the European Union. </li><li>  Since 1998, a bilateral agreement on the elimination of double taxation has been in force between Russia and the Republic of Cyprus. </li></ol>  It is for these reasons that Russian investment companies and banks register their subsidiary brokerage firms in Cyprus.  Simply put, opening a subsidiary brokerage company in other countries will not be so profitable due to higher taxes. <br><br>  We‚Äôll talk about taxes later, but in the meantime just remember that the <b>Cyprus brokerage scheme</b> described <b>is the only option for a beginning private investor from Russia to buy / sell shares of foreign companies in Western stock markets</b> . <br><br><h2>  Depositing funds to a brokerage account </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bd/a3/bda3a5fac353b4e0c9ab3a9363d001d0.png" alt="Cash input">  So, let's say you found a Russian investment / brokerage company that gives private investors access to the US stock markets (NYSE, NASDAQ) using the ‚ÄúCyprus scheme‚Äù.  You sign a contract with their Cypriot subsidiary, open a brokerage account in their Cyprus office.  Now you need to transfer money to this brokerage account. <br><br>  Depositing funds to a brokerage account opened with a Cyprus brokerage company is possible only with a bank transfer from any bank account.  You can not deposit funds to a brokerage account in cash through the cashier. <br><br>  When signing a contract for brokerage services and opening a brokerage account in Cyprus, you will be given the details of this account.  And further on these details you can make an interbank transfer of funds from your account from any Russian bank. <br><br>  Brokerage companies do not charge clients for depositing funds into a brokerage account.  However, the majority of Russian banks charge their clients for inter-bank transfer fees from their bank accounts to accounts with other banks.  How much this commission will make depends solely on the tariffs of your bank. <br><br><h4>  What to do if you still do not have your account in a Russian bank? </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d4/5c/d45c1b2bd9ee7456a9f1b0fec3864249.jpg" alt="Money in the bank">  It's not a problem.  All (or almost all) Russian investment companies that provide brokerage services on foreign exchanges have their own Russian subsidiary bank.  When signing a contract for brokerage services, you can immediately ask to open for you a bank account in their Russian bank. <br><br>  Opening and maintaining this Russian bank account is usually free.  The commission for an interbank transfer from this Russian account to your brokerage account opened in Cyprus is usually also not charged (since these are usually related banks owned by one holding company and the relevant agreement has been concluded between them). <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many Russian private investors, who already even have accounts in other Russian banks, still do not refuse such an opportunity and, when signing a contract for brokerage services, at the same time open an additional bank account in a Russian bank of the chosen investment company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through this account and carry out the input of funds to your brokerage account. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The choice in favor of such a scheme for depositing funds may be for various reasons:</font></font><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in other Russian banks there are high interbank transfer fees; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in other banks, the procedure of interbank transfer abroad for hemorrhoids (you need to additionally come to the department, wait in line and independently fill in some pieces of paper); </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> other banks have a daily limit on the amount of the interbank transfer; </font></font></li></ul><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">well, or something else. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then a bank account will be opened for free right in front of you and on the spot. Immediately after the signing of the contract you can make money in cash through the cashier. And right there you will be helped to transfer funds deposited from it to your brokerage account in Cyprus, they will fill in all the necessary papers for you (transfer order), you just need to sign it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many customers find this method more convenient for themselves than transferring money through another bank. Therefore, I recommend that you also consider this option if your chosen investment company provides such an opportunity.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For foreigners, this may seem like something wild when a person in one bank at an ATM or cashier withdraws a large amount of cash from his bank account, then carries them in his pocket / bag / backpack down the street to a branch of another bank and brings them there again. your own bank account through a cashier or an ATM with a cash-in. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, due to the greed of Russian banks, many customers still choose such an unsafe scheme with manual transfer of funds between bank accounts.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In which currencies can I deposit funds into a brokerage account? </font></font></h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3a/80/3a80888dc3e67c58b9d647519db1b05c.jpg" alt="Money - USD EUR RUR"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you trade on the US stock exchanges, then your brokerage account will, of course, be in US dollars (USD). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, this does not mean that you must first convert all your funds into USD and transfer them to a brokerage account already in dollars. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Russian investment companies usually allow you to transfer funds to your brokerage account in any of the four currencies: US dollars (USD), euro (EUR), pounds sterling (GBP) and Russian rubles (RUR). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scheme of such a transfer is as follows:</font></font><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> When you open a brokerage account, you report in which currencies you plan to deposit funds (in one or in several). </font></font></li><li>          ,           .               ,           . </li><li>                . </li><li>           ,        .        ,          USD-,    ‚Äî     .. </li><li>                . </li><li>      . </li><li>  ,           USD,           . </li></ol><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currency conversion on the side of Cyprus takes place at the rate of European interbank currency exchanges on the day of submitting the order for conversion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The commission for conversion on the Cyprus side is either absent altogether, or it is, but small (less than the commission for currency conversion in Russian banks). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, if you have financial savings in rubles / euros / pounds that you want to transfer to a brokerage account in USD, do not rush to change all the money into US dollars in Russian banks / exchangers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, it will be more profitable to transfer money directly, as it is, in current currencies and convert them into USD already on the side of Cyprus.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Stock purchase </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As mentioned above, the broker itself conducts transactions directly on the exchange. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The investor makes a decision on the purchase or sale of shares and gives the broker an order (order, order) to complete the transaction. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are several ways to submit orders (applications) for the exchange transaction:</font></font><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Independent formation of trade orders through the exchange terminal. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Submission of instructions "from the voice." </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Submission of orders from the browser via the web interface. </font></font></li></ol><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Stock trading through stock terminals </font></font></h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2b/d8/2bd85473a3da7cb882e1b78f51aa0730.jpg" alt="QUIK trade terminal"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the exchange terminal is used on a computer, the corresponding client application is downloaded and installed to complete transactions via the trading system supported by the selected broker (for example, QUIK, Laser Trade, ROX Integral, MetaTrader, etc.). To set up secure (encrypted) data exchange with the broker's server, the client generates a key pair, and then exchanges public keys with the broker by email. After setting up the software, the client (investor / trader) can independently perform the full range of exchange operations through the interface of the installed application: track the quotes of the stocks of interest, view current buy / sell orders, give trade orders (buy / sell orders), track their status and etc.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To date, all client applications for exchange trading systems are available only under Windows. Linux and Mac OS X users run them either in virtual machines or via WINE. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The interface of these applications is very complex and overloaded with a variety of information. These exchange terminals are focused primarily on trained traders who are well-versed in this subject and actively trade on exchanges constantly. An inexperienced newcomer who is not well versed in trading terminology and in many aspects of stock trading will not be easy to understand and master this interface.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are planning an investment strategy on the stock exchange (that is, occasionally making one-time deals for buying / selling shares), then I would not advise you to bother with mastering these applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, most of their functionality will not be in demand for you in this case. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For access to this trading terminal a monthly fee is charged from the client‚Äôs brokerage account monthly.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Trading shares "with voice" </font></font></h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7b/eb/7beb3e5aaabb0a8a3b3ccae0adb94d09.jpg" alt="Broker at phone"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of the submission of voice orders (in the slang of brokers, this is called ‚Äúinstructions from the voice‚Äù), applications for the execution of a transaction are made by phone, simply by words. After signing a brokerage contract, the broker sends the generated list of voice passwords to the client. To receive orders by phone, the broker has a special multi-channel phone (or just a few phone numbers). In the case of an investment company represented in Moscow, there are usually both Moscow phone numbers and a number with the prefix 8-800 for free calls from all over Russia.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a client (investor / trader) wants to make a deal to buy or sell shares, he calls this number, it appears, calls the number of the brokerage contract and passes voice authentication using the existing list of voice passwords. Then he announces to the broker what he wants to do (buy / sell), with which stocks and how many. The broker listens to the order, clogs it in the trading terminal, voices it, names the current value of the specified shares and asks to confirm the completion of the transaction. After confirmation, he conducts the transaction (orders at the market price are executed immediately, orders with the specified price are put in a queue; the types of orders below are discussed in more detail) and reports the final amount of the transaction at the time of its execution.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you sell / buy shares of some well-known well-known companies, it is enough for a broker to simply name the company. And if you make a deal with the shares of a little-known or hard-to-pronounce company, then it is better for the broker to indicate the name of the exchange and the ticker of the shares, well, or their ISIN. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The entire customer conversation with the broker is recorded in case of controversial situations like: ‚ÄúOh, what have you done? I didn‚Äôt mean it at all! ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor voice orders is not required. In Russian investment companies operating according to the ‚ÄúCyprus scheme‚Äù, all the brokers on the phones are Russian (at least Russian-speaking).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Submission of orders for exchange transactions through the telephone can be used as an independent (primary and only) way of working with a broker investor, as well as an auxiliary (alternate) option in case, for example, a computer with an installed trading application is unavailable or there are problems with access to the Internet.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For voice orders, authentication is usually based on a list of voice passwords. After the conclusion of a brokerage contract, an individual numbered list of 20-30 random numeric or alphanumeric sequences is generated and sent to the client. The operator (broker) to authenticate the client necessarily asks for the contract number (to select a list of passwords for authentication) and asks to dictate one (or two, if in doubt) of the password from this list, and the operator himself calls the numbers of the requested passwords (for each call asks for a password with any number from this list that he wants at the moment). For example: ‚ÄúSpell password number 17‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The way to trade "from voice", although it is very antediluvian, with a time delay (while you communicate with a broker, the stock price may change noticeably) and not too secure (voice passwords can be overheard / stolen), but it‚Äôs the most understandable and easy to learn for beginners. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you are not planning active trading, but long-term investment in stocks, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">if you make one-time transactions on the stock exchange (once a week, or rather even less often), I would recommend that you start with voice instructions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most brokers do not charge a fee for giving voice orders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But some have a fixed fee for each voice instruction.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Stock trading through the web interface </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some brokerage companies, in addition to stock exchange terminals and voice orders, also provide their clients with the opportunity to submit trade orders via a web interface. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is essentially close to the terminal application (because it is done by the client on a software basis online), but the functionality is much poorer and the interface is much simpler. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, for the investor (or not too active trader) the functional will still be more than enough. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Security of such web services is usually provided by HTTPS connections and login / password authentication. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Access to the web application is usually free.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Brokerage Commission for the purchase of shares </font></font></h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/16/89/1689bbdcdc9fd1edc7efb215dc19f6ce.jpg" alt="Broker comission"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regardless of the method of submitting applications for the purchase of shares (terminal, telephone or otherwise), in addition to the amount of purchase of shares, you will also have to pay a brokerage commission. Brokers operating on the US stock exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX), it is customary to take a commission not as a percentage of the transaction amount, but as a fixed amount of money for each share purchased. On average, this is 1 cent (0.01 USD) for each share purchased. Sometimes it happens that for active traders, brokers reduce the commission to 0.9, 0.8 or 0.7 cents per share (and even lower), and for low-active investors who occasionally make one-off transactions, on the contrary, they can increase this commission to 1.1 or 1.2 cents per share. But on average in industry, the commission is exactly 1 cent per share, so be guided by this value.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a brokerage commission of 1 cent per share, if you buy 1,000 shares, in addition to their cost, you pay the broker a commission of $ 10. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, it does not matter how much the shares themselves cost, maybe $ 20 per share, or maybe $ 600, only the amount will affect the size of the brokerage commission. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes brokerage fees also specify a minimum commission for a broker.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äúbroker commission: 1 cent per share, but not less than $ 10‚Äù may be indicated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, when you buy 2,000 shares, you pay the broker a commission of $ 20, when you buy 1,500 shares - a commission of $ 15, and if you buy 1,000 or less shares, a commission of $ 10 (since this is the minimum commission). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If some minimum brokerage commission is specified in the tariffs, then it is usually in the range of $ 5 to $ 15.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a rule, the brokerage service agreement gives the client (investor) the opportunity to trade immediately on many foreign stock markets (all of them will be listed in the agreement). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the rates of the brokerage company may differ depending on the exchange on which you will trade stocks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But US stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX) in brokerage contracts always come in one package and all are serviced at uniform rates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it does not matter which of these exchanges you will trade stocks in, the cost of services will be the same everywhere.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Types of transactions and types of orders (orders / orders) for the transaction </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stock trading happens </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">at a long position [Long]</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (when stocks are bought with a future growth in their value, and after an increase in their value they are sold) and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in a short position [Short]</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (when shares are borrowed from a broker with a future reduction in their value, these shares are sold at a high price, and after reducing their value, they are again bought at a low price and returned to the broker). </font></font><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d7/6c/d76ceaa7b17fe228f3e6bc41301636fc.jpg" alt="Buy sell"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accordingly, there are only three types of stock transactions with shares:</font></font><ol><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buy</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - buy stock.</font></font></li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sell</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - sale of previously purchased shares.</font></font></li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãShort</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - sale of shares borrowed from a broker.</font></font></li></ol><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The long position opens with the purchase of shares (Buy transaction), and closes with the sale of the purchased shares (Sell transaction).

Lot size is different for different stocks: for some stocks, the lot size can be 10, for the other 100, for the third 500 or other quantities (usually the cheaper the shares, the larger the lot size for them). Accordingly, the shares can be bought and sold only in a quantity that is a multiple of the lot size. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this does not apply to the US stock exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX), all shares are traded on them individually.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on the NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX exchanges you can buy and sell any number of shares: at least one, at least 50, at least 143, at least 1001. But you need to understand that buying / selling only one share will not be too profitable, </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in this case, fixed overhead costs for the purchase, sale and withdrawal of funds will already constitute a significant percentage of the total costs of the transaction. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you trade stocks on other (non-US) stock exchanges, you should first specify (for example, from a broker) the lot size for the stocks you are interested in.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The queue of applications for the transaction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Glass" trading terminal</font></font></h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/50/87/5087614b6be226093b84e52a080aa902.png" alt="Glass">  For a visual representation of the queue of current bids for the purchase and sale of shares of any company in the trading terminals usually use a table that is called ‚Äúglass‚Äù in the trading slang (it is also ‚Äústock exchange glass‚Äù, ‚Äútrading glass‚Äù, ‚Äúapplication glass‚Äù or ‚Äú glass of the trading terminal ").  In English terminology, ‚Äúglass‚Äù may be called DOM (Depth Of Market), Market Depth, OpenBook, or Blotter.  It usually looks like the one on the right. <br><br>  For each security traded on the stock exchange, there is its own order queue for buying and selling, which is not related to the order queue for other stocks.  And, accordingly, a visual representation of each share displays its own ‚Äúglass‚Äù, which is in no way connected with the ‚Äúglasses‚Äù of applications for other shares. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù consists of a vertical list, in each line of which there is an application to buy or sell shares, currently issued by one of the brokers.  "Glass" is formed only by applications for the purchase or sale of shares with an established price (limit order), i.e.  we see them in this ‚Äúglass‚Äù.  Each application line contains a limit price and the number of shares (or lots) for buying / selling at this (or better) price.  All orders in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù are sorted at the price indicated in the limited order submitted.  In this view, the bid price decreases from top to bottom.  In the lower part of the ‚Äúglass‚Äù (in the green zone) there are orders for the purchase of shares - <b>Bid</b> , and in the upper part of the ‚Äúglass‚Äù (in the red zone) orders for the sale of shares - <b>Ask</b> (they <b>Offer</b> ) are located. <br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> Sometimes applications in the "glass" depict the opposite in ascending prices from top to bottom.  Then the applications for the purchase (Bid) will be at the top of the "glass", and the application for the sale (Ask), respectively, at the bottom.  Color marking of applications for the purchase / sale in the "glass" may also differ from that described.  It all depends on the settings of the trading terminal, which displays this "glass". </blockquote>  The full queue of requests at a given time can be in the table view rather large in height, then in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù not the entire queue is displayed, but only its central part, i.e.  N best sell orders and N best buy orders (where N is, for example, 10).  The value of N in this case determines the depth of the "glass" and is configured in the trading terminal. <br><br>  If a limited order (an application with a specified price) to buy or sell arrives in the "glass", then two options are possible.  If it intersects at a price with counter orders available in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù, then it is immediately executed (in part or in full).  If it does not intersect at the price with the existing counter orders, then it takes its place in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù (in the corresponding position at the price) and waits for counter orders that satisfy it at the price. <br><br>  For example, if in the situation shown in this illustration, a limited buy order (buy limit order) with a price of $ 35.53 is received, then it will either be immediately fully satisfied (if it contains no more than 485 shares), or (if more than 485 shares) it will be partially satisfied (for 485 shares), and the application for the remaining shares will be queued for a purchase with a price of $ 35.53 - while the boundary between Ask and Bid will move, because  the price of $ 35.53 is already included in the purchase requisition (in the green zone). <br>  And if in the situation shown in this illustration, a limited buy order (buy limit order) with a price of $ 35.51 or $ 35.48 is received, then this order will simply fall into the "glass" and wait for the counter order. <br><br>  Market orders in the "glass" are not delayed, they are executed immediately upon receipt.  If a market order to purchase shares (buy market order) arrives in the "glass", then it is immediately satisfied with the best price (at the moment) for the sale of shares.  And vice versa, if a market order for the sale of shares (sell market order) is received, then it is immediately satisfied with the best price (at the moment) for the purchase of shares. <br>  If, in the situation shown in this illustration, there is a market request for the purchase of 450 shares, they will immediately be purchased at a price of $ 35.53 per share.  And instead of 485 shares at $ 35.53 in the "glass" will be an application for 35 shares at $ 35.53 in anticipation of future counter-deals.  With a market bid for sale in the same way: if there is a market bid for the sale of 300 shares, they will immediately be sold at a price of 35.50, and in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù there will be an application for the purchase of 20 shares at 35.50. <br><br>  If the market order specifies the number of shares more than in the most profitable counter order available in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù, then part of the market order is executed at the price of the best bid, and the rest at the price of the next best bid, etc., until the market bid will be completely fulfilled. <br><br>  If several similar bids of the same type are placed at the same price, they will be displayed in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù not as separate lines, but as a single line in which the number of shares from these applications will be summed up.  And when a counter-order appears, which covers this total number of shares, not wholly, but only partially, the orders will be executed in the order of their receipt (first of all, the order that arrived earlier). <br>  For example, if someone makes an application to purchase 1000 shares of this company at a price of $ 35.50 per share, and then another application comes to buy 800 shares of the same company at the same price of $ 35.50 per share, then in the "glass" these two applications will be Display one line: 1800 shares at a price of $ 35.50 per share.  And if then a counter order appears for the sale of 1,500 shares at a price of $ 35.50 per share (or better), then the first purchase request (for 1,000 shares) will be fully completed, and the second (which came later) will be only partially fulfilled (for 500 shares), and the application for the remaining 300 shares will be expected in the queue (in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù) of the next satisfactory counter offer. <br><br>  <b>Spread</b> (spread, read [spread]) - this is the difference between the maximum bid price for the purchase and the minimum bid price for the sale (at the same time).  Visually, the spread is in the center of the ‚Äúglass‚Äù, between bids for buying and bids for selling.  In this illustration, the spread is $ 0.03. <br><br>  <b>Liquidity</b> is an economic term for the ability of assets to be quickly sold at a price close to the market.  As applied to stocks and the securities market, the greater the number of transactions (trading volume) for these shares, and the smaller the spread, the greater the liquidity of these shares.  If a certain application reduces the spread, then it accordingly increases the liquidity of these shares, and vice versa, if the application increases the spread, then it reduces the liquidity of these shares. <br><br>  Filling the ‚Äúglass‚Äù with bids and the spread value is constantly changing in real time as brokers submit / withdraw bids and as bids are fulfilled (that is, as purchase / sale transactions are completed on these shares on the stock exchange). <br><br>  You, as an investor, are unlikely to ever have to deal with the analysis of applications in the ‚Äúglass‚Äù.  Usually only active day traders or scalpers track this.  For investors who make occasional one-off deals, this is not so important.  I described ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù here, just to visually explain how the processing of incoming applications for the purchase / sale of shares on the exchange takes place. <br><br><h2>  Where and how to track stock prices </h2><br>  In the above-mentioned stock exchange terminals there are not only transaction functions, but also information functions for tracking stock prices (both current and time-based).  True, the default stock quotes from the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges there are not displayed online, but with a delay of 15 minutes.  In order to see online quotes at stock exchange terminals, usually, in addition to the subscription fee for access to the terminal, you need to additionally pay a subscription fee for access to online stock quotes. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ba/6d/ba6dd91053ce0c4e07b5534c0768567d.gif" alt="Google finance">  But it‚Äôs not necessary to pay for online quotes, especially considering that there are online services where you can track stock prices: <ol><li>  <a href="http://www.google.com/finance">Google finance</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Finance</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.bing.com/finance">Bing finance</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://money.msn.com/">MSN Money</a> </li></ol>  All of these services receive stock price data on US stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) in real time.  Therefore, you can always get up to date information about the value of the shares. <br>  In addition to the value of shares (current and in time schedules) in these services, you can also look at some other financial information on shares: trading volume, change in value for the last trading session, the size and date of dividend payment, news related to the company's financial activities, etc. (somewhere more information, somewhere less).  Periodically you can go there and keep track of stocks that interest you. <br><br>  Which of these services to use, decide for yourself (which is more like).  I personally find <b>Google Finance</b> convenient, but I know that <b>Yahoo!</b>  <b>Finance is</b> very popular among financiers.  Microsoft's financial services for convenience and information content, of course, are losing heavily. <br><br>  You can easily notice that the graphs of the course do not change smoothly, occasionally breaks (sharp jumps) of the course up or down occur - this is the so-called <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%258D%25D0%25BF">gap</a> . <br><br><h2>  What influences the change in the value of shares? </h2><br>  Perhaps this is not an exhaustive answer.  The value of shares of a separate company is affected by a huge number of various factors. <ol><li>  First of all, of course, the financial performance of the company.  Often noticeable jumps or drops in stocks occur just after the publication of the company's annual or quarterly financial statements.  If the reports showed a good income - the shares grow, showed strong costs - the shares fall. </li><li>  Also, the yield or the announcement of a new promising product of the company, on which investors have high hopes for increasing profitability, affects the value of shares. </li><li>  Often influenced by large corporate transactions: the purchase of a promising company, the sale of part of the company, mergers, acquisitions and more. </li><li>  Announcement of some strategic plans of the company, change of leadership. </li><li>  The overall rise or fall of the entire market or a particular industry. </li><li>  Local and global financial crises. </li><li>  Natural disasters, wars, epidemics in the area where the company's main production facilities are located. </li><li>  News about the company's activities and possible financial consequences. </li></ol>  And many, many other factors (obvious and not so) from the most different spheres of life and business. <br><br><h2>  Trading time </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/52/f2/52f28b6fce7beb4a88ce32bea998d251.jpg" alt="Trade dates and hours"><h4>  Trading session </h4><br>  Trading on the US stock exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX) takes place on weekdays (Monday through Friday) from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm [US Eastern Time] (i.e., from 5:30 pm to midnight Moscow time ).  There is no lunch break on the US exchanges (which is noteworthy, there is only a lunch break on Asian markets). <br>  The specified time interval is the time of the trading session itself (Core trading hours) when stock purchase / sale transactions are concluded. <br><br><h4>  Extended hours </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/e2/25e230de5ad693f9f1c3bb263db0279d.gif" alt="Extended trading hours">  In addition, there are also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_hours_trading">Extended Hours</a> on US stock exchanges on trading days: <ul><li>  <b>Pre-market</b> - an interval of several hours immediately before the opening of the main trading session. </li><li>  <b>After-hours</b> (Post-market) - an interval of several hours immediately after the close of the main trading session. </li></ul>  For example, on the NASDAQ exchange: <br>  Pre-market - from 7:00 am to 9:30 am [US Eastern Time] (that is, from 15:00 to 17:30 Moscow time). <br>  After-hours - from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm [US Eastern Time] (that is, from 00:00 to 04:00 the next day Moscow time). <br>  During these extended hours, exchanges only accept applications from brokers to buy / sell stocks, but the transactions themselves are not conducted at this time.  Deals on applications submitted during these extended hours are queued and will be held only during the next trading session. <br><br><h4>  When can I apply for buying / selling stocks? </h4><br>  An order can enter the exchange system only during the trading session, as well as during the extended trading hours.  However, many Russian brokers who provide Russian clients with access to US stock exchanges allow clients to keep their orders with the broker in an interval closer to business hours in Russia, for example, from 9:00 to 24:00 Moscow time.  This is done simply for the convenience of customers who want to leave applications during business hours.  In this case, such orders are cached on the broker‚Äôs side, and they are entered into the exchange system with the opening of the exchange. <br><br>  But personally, it is more convenient for me to apply when stock exchanges in the USA have already opened.  This is just after the end of my working day at the main job, when working fuss no longer distracts from the process of analyzing the market and considering applications for buying / selling stocks. <br><br><h4>  Weekends and holidays </h4><br>  US exchanges do not work on weekends (Saturday, Sunday), as well as on official US government (federal) <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">holidays</a> . <br><br>  In the US, most federal holidays are not scheduled for a specific date, but are indicated relative to, for example: <ul><li>  <b>Martin Luther King Day</b> - the third Monday of January; </li><li>  <b>Memorial Day</b> - the last Monday of May; </li><li>  <b>Columbus Day</b> - the second Monday of October. </li></ul>  Those.  in different years these dates fall on different dates.  Therefore, in order to know exactly what specific dates will be the weekend on the stock exchange in the current year, it is better to look at the calendar on the stock exchange website itself.  For example, the calendar of non-working holidays on the NASDAQ Exchange website: <br>  <a href="http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx%3Fid%3DCalendar">www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=Calendar</a> <br><br>  And on the days of Russian public holidays, if they do not coincide with weekends or American holidays, the US exchanges, of course, work. <br><br><h2>  Storage of purchased shares </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bb/3d/bb3dda5df9b05f19710b5d39bf08fa36.jpg" alt="Bank deposite storage">  The brokerage company, as a rule, has its own depository (centralized depository of securities, more precisely, a securities accounting center).  Together with the signing of an agreement on the provision of brokerage services, the client (trader / investor) also signs an agreement on the provision of custodial (depositary) services with the same brokerage company.  Under this agreement, a custodian is opened for the client (aka a custody account, a deposit of securities) in their depository.  This custodian ‚Äústores‚Äù (takes into account) all shares purchased by the client until they are sold or until the shares are transferred to another depository (if the client wants to transfer the shares to another company for storage). <br><br>  When an investor buys shares, in reality no movement of documents takes place.  Shares have long existed only in uncertificated form.  It‚Äôs just that the company that issued the shares makes an appropriate entry in the database of the register of shareholders, which confirms that such and such number of shares now belongs to such and such a client and is stored on such a custodial account in such a custodian bank.  Plus, the corresponding entry in the database of the custodian bank itself.  The new owner of the shares is entered in the register of shareholders of the company with a delay of three days (T + 3 rule), so traders who open and close their positions on shares within 1-2 days do not even enter the register of shareholders of the company. <br><br>  Usually, in addition to the local depository of the brokerage company itself, the purchased shares through the chain of accounts of nominal holding are also taken into account in the upstream and more authoritative depository - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%2526_Clearing_Corporation">DTCC</a> (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation), which is located in the USA (New York).  Relatively speaking, in IT terminology (or rather, in the terminology of a hierarchical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a> ), one can imagine that the depositary of a separate brokerage company is an ordinary certifying center, and the superior depository DTCC is the root certification center for stock accounting. <br><br>  Thus, you will never be able to hold the purchased shares in your hands.  Although they are called "securities", but in reality it is not paper for a long time.  The time has already passed when the stock of shares was a bundle of rough dense papers with seals, signatures, holograms and watermarks that lay in a personal cell in the shareholder‚Äôs safe deposit box of the shareholder.  Therefore, if you planned to buy several shares of any company only to hang a beautiful piece of paper in a frame on the wall or to show off to your friends, you can forget about this idea. <br><br>  It happens that storing shares in a custodian for a client is free of charge, and it happens that for this, a client‚Äôs brokerage account is regularly charged for custodial services.  If custodial service fees are charged, then it is usually expressed as a small percentage of the total market value of all the shares that are stored in the account.  This fee is charged monthly and each month its amount is recalculated depending on the total market value of the shares that are on the custodian on the last day of the month. <br><br>  If you suddenly need for some purposes a documentary proof of your ownership of any shares, the brokerage company will, upon request, provide you with a paper statement from your custodial account certified by seals and signatures of the managers of the Cyprus brokerage company. <br><br><h2>  Dividends </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/10/94/1094720c3790687844f4205611420857.jpg" alt="Dividends">  Dividends are a part of the company's profits, which are distributed among the shareholders in accordance with their shares.  If the profit from the growth of the value of the shares appears only after the sale of the shares, then the dividends are the additional profit that the shareholders receive on the contrary. <br>  Dividends are not at all a guaranteed return to shareholders.  The company's board of directors regularly decides whether dividends will be paid to shareholders this year, and if so, in what amount.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If in one year the company paid dividends to shareholders, in another year the board of directors may decide that there will be no dividend payments (or, on the contrary, they did not pay them before, but then they could start paying them). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many young and rapidly developing companies do not pay dividends to their shareholders at all, they prefer to invest all profits to the maximum in their development. And older companies, the rapid development of which has already slowed down, for which expansion no longer exists, and whose shares have for a long time kept at about the same level, on the contrary, they often resort to paying dividends in order to increase the attractiveness of stocks for investors.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the sector of American IT companies (in particular, companies from Silicon Valley), many companies do not pay dividends at all, but there are also those who pay. For example, the following companies do not pay dividends: Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Red Hat (RHT), AMD (AMD), nVIDIA (NVDA), Adobe (ADBE), Yahoo!

In this case, the brokerage service agreement is concluded with a company registered in Cyprus, and you will receive income to the brokerage account in this Cyprus company.

A custodian bank is a bank responsible for safekeeping of securities in the country where they were issued. The custodian bank is listed in the shareholder register of the issuing company as the nominal holder of these shares. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, a certain American depositary bank, which has a contractual relationship with a custody bank in the issuer's country, issues a corresponding number of American depositary receipts (ADRs) for the amount of shares deposited. One ADR may be equivalent to one share, part of a share, or several shares of a foreign issuing company.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, ADRs are derivative securities (derivatives) for shares issued outside the United States. This paper confirms the ownership of its owner to the number of shares of a foreign issuer indicated in the certificate. For the ADRs themselves, the issuer is the American Depositary Bank (95% of ADR issues are accounted for by three banks: Bank of New York, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase), and ADRs are already denominated in USD, therefore these derivative securities can be freely traded on US stock exchanges as shares of US issuing companies. From the point of view of a participant in the US stock markets, ADR can be regarded as ordinary shares, since their buying and selling is no different from buying / selling common stocks of American companies.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this scheme, the two banks mentioned (one in the USA and the other in the country of the company issuing shares) are essentially intermediaries between the investor / trader who bought ADRs on the US stock exchanges and the company that issued the shares outside the United States. Through these intermediaries, the register of shareholders is kept through ownership of ADRs, the transfer of financial information to the owners of ADRs, as well as dividends and other property rights on the relevant shares. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, here are a few non-US companies that have issued shares in their own country, and these shares are listed on the stock exchange in their country: Hitachi, Ltd.

And in May 2011, the IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange was actually released not by the Russian company Yandex, but by its Dutch parent company Yandex NV.
