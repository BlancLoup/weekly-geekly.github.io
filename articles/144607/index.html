  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Always there, or why I left Sberbank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://www.tcsbank.ru/static/media/analisis_pic2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have only been working on the Internet for seven years and today took another step in this direction - I finally said goodbye to Sberbank and switched to another bank, which has no branches and all issues are resolved only via the Internet and by phone.  Withdrawal free of charge at any ATM (at a certain minimum amount).  Internet bank is smartly implemented, there are decent mobile applications.  When making phone calls, you connect immediately, without waiting for the operator (he called several times).  Compare this with Sberbank, where you have to go to the branch on any issue, even on such a trifling matter as connecting or disconnecting the Mobile Bank service.  If you are lucky and will not be kilometer queue of grandmothers.  Or lunch break.  The Internet bank is rather poorly implemented, some functions simply do not work, and employees cannot say why.  To get through to the staff, sometimes you wait half an hour. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Today I was finally convinced of the correctness of my decision.  I went to Sberbank to write a statement about the refusal of his plastic card (as without a statement).  At first, I stood in the rain for half an hour, because there was no electricity in the bank (this is not the first time).  Then I took the coupon in the terminal of the electronic queue - the latest innovation of Sberbank.  Thanks and on this - now you can not find out from the grandmothers, who was standing where.  In the electronic queue I spent another 10 minutes, and here comes the girl with the words that on Saturday they do not work with cards, come on Monday.  Funny and sad at the same time. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Even putting the terminals of the electronic queue, they could not implement such simple functionality as informing that this service is not available today. <br><br>  Sitting in line, I stared at a huge monitor with the motto of Sberbank: "Always there."  This is an erroneous motto.  Today, the number of branches does not play any role for those who have a cell phone or the Internet (that is, almost everyone).  ‚ÄúAlways near‚Äù is my phone, not a branch of Sberbank, be it at least on the first floor of my house.  And Sberbank, founded in a prehistoric year of some sort, risks to stay there. <br><br>  <i>Update:</i> I want to ask all commentators who accuse me of ordering.  Explain to me how to write when you want to praise something?  How to formulate that you are not accused of advertising and not minus karma?  What to blame and minus, tell me, and I will willingly change it.  First, in the post was the name of the bank, I was advised to remove it, I removed it, but the accusations and minus still continue.  Is it really impossible to praise anything on Habr√© without accusations of advertising? <br><br>  <i>Update 2:</i> tired of the charges, stop participating in the comments.  Sorry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144607/</a></p>
