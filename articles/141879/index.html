  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian-German student school JASS-2012. Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habravchane. <br>  Today there will be a story about the JASS international student school held in March.  I prepared the text of the post together with my friend, who also participated in it. <br><br>  In early February, we learned about the opportunity to participate in the international Russian-German school for students <a href="http://wwwmayr.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/konferenzen/Jass12/">JASS-2012</a> (Joint Advanced Student School), which is held in our city for the eighth time.  <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/teachers/kulikov">Alexander Kulikov</a> , the coordinator of the <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/">Computer Science Center</a> (whose students we are, also this new training platform was already mentioned in one of the Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141466/">notes</a> ), the <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/">SPbAU NOCTN RAS</a> and <a href="http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/csclub/">POMI</a> and just a very talented and passionate person, told us about this.  The school consisted of two thematic courses - a course on efficient algorithms for working on strings (Design of Efficient String Algorithms) and developing modern mobile applications (Usability Engineering &amp; Ubiquitous Computing on mobile devices). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The last course interested us, and we have applied for participation.  Therefore, the story will be mainly about this direction.  For a start, everyone had to go through a competitive selection: describe their own idea for an application that would be interesting for implementation, in demand among users and useful in the market, and also make a short report on one of the topics suggested by the school‚Äôs organizers.  The most interesting of them were: aspects of developing applications for Android / iOS, Test Driven Development, basic concepts of Smart Spaces / Internet of Things.  All materials candidates prepared in English, thereby showing that they can find a common language with German colleagues. <br><br>  We were among the thirteen of our students who were selected.  Approximately the same number of guys came from <a href="http://portal.mytum.de/welcome/">the Technical University</a> of <a href="http://portal.mytum.de/welcome/">Munich</a> to our city with two leaders - MTU professor <a href="http://wwwbruegge.in.tum.de/static/lehrstuhl_1/people/52-professor">Bernd Brugge</a> , who also teaches at Carneggy-Mellon University, and Professor <a href="http://wwwmayr.in.tum.de/personen/mayr/">Ernst Mayer</a> , a computer science specialist.  The school lasted only five days (from March 19 to March 24), during which time we offered our own ideas for mobile applications, chose the best of them and breaking up into three teams of 4-5 people each, developed prototypes.  I really liked that all the decisions, from the ideas of mobile applications to planning where to go for a walk in the evening, were taken by universal suffrage and everyone could express their wishes.  All the teams were international, and working from this was only more interesting.  The development process was based on the Scrum technology, the sprints were lasting for one day, every evening we were going to a scrum-rally, discussing the achievements and difficulties of each team over the past day.  At every rally, Professor Bernd Brugge always asked each of us a question - what do YOU ‚Äã‚ÄãPROMISE to do tomorrow?  Semantic and psychological emphasis was placed on these two words: you personally promise.  It was impossible to answer in style: ‚Äúwe will do‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will try to start performing‚Äù, the professor demanded from the participant a response that begins with the words: ‚ÄúI promise‚Äù.  Of course, such an answer, in the face of colleagues, tuned to the feeling of personal responsibility for the result and the desire to work hard tomorrow so that your own promise does not turn out to be an empty word.  It seems to me that it was this small but very important lesson that turned out to be the most important thing that we learned from this school.  This work ethic is worth sharing with us from the Germans.  We also noticed that German colleagues are paying a lot of attention to careful planning, meetings and discussion of design activities.  We, however, could not wait to start developing and get a result as soon as possible.  At first it seemed to us that the approach to the work of our German colleagues was too long, but then we realized and made sure that the planned work gives the best productivity and stable result.  In the short period of our cooperation, we have gained a good experience in work organization - planning, discussion, and personal responsibility.  These simple but important things are sometimes lacking in our country. <br>  All the time of our short cooperation, we worked in a very calm and friendly atmosphere between all the participants of the school.  It must be said that not all the allotted time we were engaged in directly developing applications, one of the main factors in the success of an application on the market is the ability to interest the user.  Therefore, about one day we spent on inventing and creating with our own hands a small commercial that reflects the essence of the application.  Our team has developed an application that detects potholes on highways using an accelerometer.  We have such a commercial in the style of a Hollywood movie trailer:

In such a short time, all three teams achieved tangible results, we were surprised by the overall productivity!  Our team showed two prototypes: for Android and for iOS.  All applications had basic functionality that can be developed further. <br>  In the evening of the last day, all the participants of the school celebrated a successful conclusion at a banquet, attended by the co-founders of JASS, the famous mathematicians <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%25AE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Yu.V.</a>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%25AE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Matiyasevich</a> and <a href="http://www.cph.phys.spbu.ru/about/slavianov.html">S.Yu.Slavyanov</a> .  We were able to talk with German students in a more informal setting, learn about the education system and work in the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering in Germany. <br><br>  JASS School has become an excellent extension of experience, exchange of experience and just a place for new professional contacts.  All participants had only positive impressions.  Thank you very much for this to the school organizers, more such events in the future! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141879/</a></p>
