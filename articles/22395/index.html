I wanted to tell about the real project in which several methods listed in the article are perfectly implemented. <br><br>  There is a company, one of the divisions of which produces all kinds of yoghurt.  The company has long since been oriented and is positioning its products as products of a healthy lifestyle, thinness and happiness in general.  Therefore, with her boxes look at us slender, beautiful, smiling ladies and gentlemen, as well as happy, laughing children.

      At some point, marketers of the company come up with the next move for the next promotion of its products.  The company announces a competition: "Take a place on the packaging of our product."  For submission of applications for the competition have determined a sufficiently long period.  Such that the virus has time to reach as large a population as possible.  To participate in the contest, you need to apply for a form and upload pictures of yourself, your relatives, friends and acquaintances on the company's website.  The winner will be the one who get the highest number of votes for his photo. <br><br>  We will not go far for examples.  Personally, I was twice today reminded of the need to vote.  I think my family is not an exception: many people have the Internet (many people have it), yoghurts eat almost everything, the majority craves for fame.  All members of families involved, distant and close relatives, colleagues and subordinates were called to computers.  It is difficult to say how many of them have become new participants.  At the time of this writing (the deadline for submitting applications is far from complete) the number of pages with photos was ... 3998 (!).  Each page has a photo of 8 participants.  Total - almost 32 thousand participants and accepting applications continues. <br><br>  Someone might think "fig-se!".  And I think that there are chances.  Since I believe that a sufficiently large number of those who sent the photos did not send a separate fax (!) With the refusal of financial claims and permission to the company to use the photo at its discretion. <a name="habracut"></a>  Maybe I'm naive, and all consumers are so cunning that they always read the information, printed in small print in the basement of an advertisement? .. <br><br>  Typical lottery.  Why participate in it?  First of all, winning is always great.  It doesn't matter if you are jumping in a bag in a long-distance race with barriers, or you eat sandwiches for a while.  I heard there are people who compete in the number and size of donations.  Sorry I am not familiar with such. <br><br>  Secondly, "shoots" another idea marketers.  Those whose fax has already been processed get the opportunity to find on the site a sample of the goods with their (!) Photo.  Not just a sample.  A cool three-dimensional object.  Which you can twist, look from all sides, make a couple of "pictures".  Moms will go to the site two or three times a day to look at their child on the packaging of yogurt and brush away the tear of emotion.  Colleagues of mommies will be attracted to discuss the merits (mostly their own) and disadvantages (mostly alien) photos and models.  The male part of the population will begin to brag about their girlfriends / offspring, and at the same time discuss with their colleagues the advantages of the blonde from the packaging of yogurt and redhead from a bottle of yogurt. <br><br>  We can safely assume that each participant will ‚Äúlead‚Äù to the site, at least 3-4 people.  Daily.  One hundred thousand spectators per one ruble ... It will be ... It will be ... Roughly, it will be 100 thousand uniques a day.  The eyes of which will fix the emblem of the company against the background of happy faces of close and not so close people.  Advertising specialists can correct me, but, in my opinion, this is called ‚ÄúCreating a long-term positive image.‚Äù <br><br>  I just looked in the fridge.  What do you think yogurt and drinks which company in it most?  More recently, we gave preference to their competitors. <br><br>  Total  At a very low cost, the firm receives: <br><ul><li>  Positive image. </li><li>  Regular customers. </li><li>  People's product. </li><li>  Increase sales. </li><li>  Debugged mechanism for conducting competitions.  To start the next will only need the initial injection in the media. </li></ul><br><br>  The client is also not in the loser: <br><ul><li>  Amused. </li><li>  In the case of a miracle - won.  And no, so at least bought a lottery ticket.  And, cheaply.  Just think, spent quite a bit of your time. </li><li>  He showed himself to the general public, looked at others. </li><li>  Against the background of gloomy everyday life, I saw a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãjoyful faces. </li><li>  Once again, I felt like a voter deciding the fate of the world, and a little bit my elect. </li><li>  Used a quality product. </li></ul><br><br>  By the way, about the last item.  No company will help if the goods are of poor quality. ... In this place I have already begun to deploy a detailed explanation of my statement.  And then he realized that he wanted to say something about it. <br><br>  I wanted to say about why I put this article in "startups".  As mentioned, the costs are ‚Äúinsignificant.‚Äù  But as one of my friends says: ‚ÄúI have been scooping out of your home for two days already.‚Äù <br><br>  The organization of such events may be beyond the power of one, albeit a large, firm.  A combination of several players is required for one joint action.  Say: manufacturer + portal (information sponsor) + social network + photo service.  Or: local TV station + video service + podcasts to listen to applicants, for example.  The list and options are endless.  Each such set of participants is a startup.  At the same time, everyone solves his own problems, everyone achieves his goals, all together they are pleasing (courting) the client.  Providing him with a non-overlapping set of goods and services.  It turns out, all in a prize?  It looks like it.  Both customers and merchants.  Vintuvin in action. <br><br>  The main thing, in my opinion, is not to screw it up: not to do such campaigns, playing out the powder compact in the virtual contest "Miss City" and using curve hosting and non-working services.  Make it beautiful.  I have an advertisement for Jeep on my site.  She is not there because I want to buy it.  And not because Jeep is cool.  I put her because she is insanely beautiful and fun. <br><br>  Are there any losers in this situation?  Of course.  These are competitors of the company who decided to stop in the promotion of their goods and services on the distribution of leaflets in the transition and posters all over the wall of a multi-storey building.  They paid a lot of money for it.  Just do not take into account that times change.  Web 2.0 has come.  Yesterday. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22395/</a></p>
