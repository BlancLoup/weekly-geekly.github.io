Recently, during the construction of new server vaults, there has been such a trend: not just modern functional buildings are being created, but real works of art are being built.  The unusual architecture of buildings fascinates and attracts the views and not only the views (perhaps to some extent, a successful marketing move to attract customers).  It turns out that there is even a competition for the title of the most beautiful data center in the world.  What is the main criterion when choosing a favorite: functionality, decoration, unusual approach to construction, etc.?  A public online voting was held with the support of Quality Uptime Services; as a result, 15 server storages were identified, each of which can be called the most beautiful. <br><br><h3>  1. Switch Pyramid (Michigan, USA) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m7/xl/h1/m7xlh1hz1wqnpbetjevbwjsz0ss.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It‚Äôs impossible not to recognize the original look and feel of the Switch data centers with their patented power and cooling systems.

Together with other buildings, the Switch will create a campus with a capacity of up to 320 MW, powered by 100% renewable energy sources, plans to allocate 170 thousand square meters.  meters under the data center and 40 thousand square meters.  meters for office space. <br><br><h3>  2. Bahnhof Pionen (Stockholm, Sweden) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yb/eb/f9/ybebf9_ntetbcb2j_6qmbytpzl8.jpeg"><br><br>  By the creation of the Bahnhof Pionen in Stockholm approached creatively and eventually the world was given another functional masterpiece of architecture.  The data center, located in the former nuclear bunker, was opened in 2008. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/yu/xw/9eyuxwlf-fvdq0jshbqlybrggb4.jpeg"><br><br>  Design Pionen leads the mind to the well-known James Bond, is the embodiment of some elements taken from the movie Silent Running (1970).  Located at a depth of 30 meters inside the Cold War nuclear bunker, Bahnhof Pionen rightfully deserves the title of not only the most beautiful, but also the most reliable data storage.  The artwork is decorated with waterfalls, greenhouses with exotic plants, and the reigning atmosphere of the dungeon gives a touch of magic and something fantastic. <br><br>  In a word - fascinates ... <br><br><h3>  3. Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4i/s7/lg/4is7lgj3nm-d29cuaevmdgdmotq.png"><br><br>  What was once a holy place of worship, known as the Torre Girona, is now home to the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, the main hall is filled with glass server rooms.  It is a place where the past and the future are intertwined, creating a unique atmosphere of the present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/30/xv/cw/30xvcwesub1esk71upn2bmxvk2y.jpeg"><br><br>  The building of the former church Chapel Torre Girona, restored after the Spanish Civil War, this summer (2017) installed the world's largest supercomputer of the new generation MareNostrum 4 on Intel processors with a performance of 11.1 petaflops (13 in the list of the most powerful supercomputers TOP500 ). <br><br><h3>  4. Google Mayes County (Oklahoma, USA) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/mb/pc/qymbpcyhgufjt1srvybjmhu-bac.jpeg"><br><br>  How to create a unique exterior of the data center and not to turn the buildings into one banal gray complex, into an undistinguished industrial object?  Google knows for sure, and not only knows, but also practices.  The fresco is an amazing decision raising any building to the rank of works of art. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/xa/xy/xxxaxyinmupkqzpl28lkgbehtni.jpeg"><br><br>  The nomination for the most beautiful data center in the world is Google Mayes County.  Thanks to the creativity of the artist Jenny Odell, the walls found their original style.  When creating collages, she used satellite images of the Google Maps map service.  Over the transfer of images worked by 15 artists, 400 colors were used, transferring the images to the wall using a technique similar to that used by Michelangelo when painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.  Cloth served as the facade of the server building. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q-/ks/4v/q-ks4virgkw3qzuaf_tq14uswgw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  5. Gak data center (Naver, South Korea) </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/zu/a3/dbzua3nbtnkyy1crqrq8fcyadsu.jpeg"><br><br>  Naver - the largest Internet portal and the most popular search engine in South Korea - has set up its data center at the foot of Mount Kobon in Chuncheon (Gangwon Province). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wu/jz/c0/wujzc0_rcjcrjksnrnbtubsd1rg.jpeg"><br><br>  Data Center Gak securely stores the media content of its current customers.  The data center surprisingly combines traditional design elements with advanced technologies, such as reuse and recycling of rainwater. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/89/lm/la/89lmlarnzf3znoclpt050wgdj3c.jpeg"><br><br>  The data center Gak (ÈòÅ) was named after the main skete (vault) of Janggyeonggak in one of the most famous temples of Haeins, which retained about 80 thousand Buddhist sacred texts on wooden tablets.  The unique design of the repositories is noteworthy: they were located close to each other on four sides of the highest point above sea level and were aimed at each other in such a way that the wind flows from the Gayasyan valley provided natural ventilation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/eh/23/c3eh23mikvbtgfdwbebutgkacsw.jpeg"><br><br>  Often, system failures occur due to overheating from the heat generated by the servers; cooling is extremely important to ensure the smooth operation of the equipment.  A huge amount of energy is consumed to cool the server.  In the Gak server storage, maximum efforts were made to cool the servers in an ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù manner.  Gak was the first data center in the world to receive LEED Platinum Certificate (LEED -NC Platinum V2009). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/6i/1s/uy6i1sephhpe-aaknsdbjvcpdlm.jpeg"><br><br>  The cooling system is a technological development and a decade-long experience.  Before servers was created free space for cooling the air inside.  Besides the fact that each server has its own cooler and power supply, every four servers in the Gak data center have a single power supply and power source, which allows minimizing the loss of electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nh/mi/gn/nhmignohlhweckl76ovfqtqm8qk.jpeg"><br><br>  Racks have been developed that allow you to densely accommodate hundreds of servers, increasing the efficiency of space use  An environmentally friendly approach to server cooling was applied - AMU (Air Misting Unit). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ke/vm/0x/kevm0xpfpnhh2c7l9xnnmgqnnpu.jpeg"><br><br>  Various methods for cooling server servers were considered, which could minimize the use of air conditioners that are not very environmentally friendly.  A method was chosen in which natural air penetrates the server room from outside, is filtered and cooled with the help of foggers.  The AMU (Air Misting Unit) filters the air and uses mist; the air temperature is reduced by spraying the smallest particles of water.  Air cooling method is highly economical, safe and environmentally friendly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/_m/5t/p0_m5tgbhs_yqqpyiodqlckhdxc.jpeg"><br><br>  Ice is used to cool equipment during the hot period.  In order to save ice is produced at night, when the cost of electricity is minimal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/js/uu/_ijsuuig6vv3vfytg_et8ufbxgs.jpeg"><br><br>  Hot air emitted after cooling of the servers is used for growing greenery on the territory of the data center, rainwater is used in fire-fighting systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/jx/hh/zrjxhhorwr-j42_axjymbzuih_0.jpeg"><br><br>  The data center is powered by renewable solar energy.  LED LED lamps and electric cars on campus once again underline the company's desire to be green. <br><br><h3>  6. Green Mountain DC1-Stavanger (Norway) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mi/id/ye/miidyeuif229vvtdyepqgaerb-e.jpeg"><br><br>  Green Mountain DC1-Stavanger eco-friendly data center also runs for the title of the most beautiful server storage in the world.  Only for its location on the rocky shore of the sea bay of the western coast of Norway - the fjord - inside the mountain, the data center is worthy of first place.  Home for Green Mountain was the premises of the former NATO Cold War ammunition depot.  Green Mountain DC1-Stavanger is an incredibly safe place: doors 50 cm thick, access to the repository through tunnels deep underground.  Such a structure is protected from electromagnetic and radioactive radiation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xu/pf/wm/xupfwmlbyafovrvw5pelyokkcxo.jpeg"><br><br>  DC1-Stavanger is a unique data center with a high level of security.  The occupied territory is 13,600 square meters.  The data center consists of three two-story concrete buildings built in the mountains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/nv/42/eenv42htzjy06lkervkwpcj30ki.jpeg"><br><br>  DC1-Stavanger is powered by three independent environmentally friendly hydroelectric power plants.  Cheap electricity makes Norway a tasty morsel for building server vaults. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/1u/wu/as1uwumzti_kfvj5vp2v_f_8t88.jpeg"><br><br>  The cooling source of DC1-Stavanger is water from a nearby deep-water fjord.  At a depth below 75 meters, the water temperature is stable and is 8 degrees Celsius all year round.  Due to the effect of gravity, cold water from a depth of 100 meters enters the data center cooling system without any energy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/o4/rr/wko4rr9iq4kwpudkp9x78ac0vsy.png"><br><br>  The cooling system (including the cooling station, piping and pumps) is completely duplicated, providing a reliable N + N solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/ek/dv/qaekdvgrbheusaambhp82-9rrzg.jpeg"><br><br>  Customers can be provided with server rooms ranging from 50 square meters to 1,550 square meters.  Servers are located in underground machineries (traditional with raised floor, cold / hot corridors and container solutions).  In the cave kingdom, hypoxic air technology is used for fire safety, known as the oxygen reduction system.  The advantage of such a system: hypoxic air can prevent a fire.  The oxygen level is constantly monitored, the equipment is duplicated by N + 1. <br><br><h3>  7. NGD (Newport, Wales) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pn/lq/ql/pnlqqlkidxhev60slwdv7zzveys.jpeg"><br><br>  In 1996, LG acquired an area of ‚Äã‚Äã203,000 square meters.  meters for the construction of a semiconductor plant.  But the Asian financial crisis in 1998 left construction only in the plans.  The land was returned to the government of Wales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/qf/u-/fzqfu-w-uayj4ka3kpljnhqd8rc.png"><br><br>  2007 is the year when NGD was founded.  There was a need to create a data center, South Wales was the ideal place to host one of the largest data centers in Europe, its area is close to the mark of 93 thousand square meters.  meters  In 2009, the first contract was signed with the British telecommunications company (BT), over time, many global companies will become NGD clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-4/bx/rx/-4bxrxdgosnkktbzedwjiue2tii.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2010, NGD was the largest European data center (70 thousand square meters. With the ability to accommodate about 19 thousand racks), for the power of the brainchild, only energy from 100% of renewable sources is used.  $ 26 million has been invested in the Super Super Giant International Power Transmission Network for connecting NGD directly to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/jf/0k/tojf0kohwico31suturf5fhot8w.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2012, Next Generation Data Provider (NGD) became the first operator in the UK to receive a certificate as fully complying with the industry's ‚ÄúData Center for Climate Change Agreement (CCA)‚Äù.  The use of a solar farm located on the roof to power the server cooling system helped the company to bring the PUE ratio to a low level (rumors were running up to 1).  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a farm was 75 thousand square meters.  meters  The data center complies with the Tier III standard, the maximum power is 180 MW - more than enough even to power the whole city. <br><br><h3>  8. Amsterdam Data Tower (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x0/-j/rf/x0-jrfpenasnrc158qfgfjsxeb4.png"><br><br>  Another contender for the title of being closer to beauty is the American company Digital Realty, the world leader in providing data center services.  Most recently, the company moved its server capacity from the AMS 1 Telecity data center (2016) to the new data center Amsterdam Data Tower / Amsterdam Data Tower.  13-storey building with a height of 72 meters, a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 thousand square meters.  meters <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y6/07/cx/y607cxu_jsgzbf-fnxsuk6hvjrg.jpeg"><br><br>  For cooling, external air and groundwater are used.  The building was designed by the architect Rosbach in the Netherlands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cs/pv/hu/cspvhubkxbqn2p5onqgata7i75y.png"><br><br>  Due to their location in the Science Park in Amsterdam, users have the opportunity to be part of a rich ecosystem of telecommunications organizations, Internet service providers and cable companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/ej/8f/uyej8fl57ixjcecobqdsivcawb8.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MeC5_HW0yx8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The appearance of the Amsterdam Data Tower differs from other candidates with its triangular shapes, the design of which perfectly fits into the environment, and the bronze facade emphasizes the ‚Äúcold‚Äù beauty of the building for reliable data storage. <br><br><h3>  9.
