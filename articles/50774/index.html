Become a PM!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over 5 years of work in the company, a huge number of project managers have changed. <br>  PMs are dying like flies.  Like infantry battalion, abandoned in a meaningless frontal attack. <br><br>  They die (they leave) themselves, they are killed (dismissed), xenocide is organized (they are dismissed together with the team).  Running without rifles, comrades behind you, will replace you.  And they will live their 2 minutes. <br><br><img height="490" width="523" alt="56.51 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5b7/662/14e/5b766214efa43f596fe8216d06c82510.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Look at the PS (game development) project, and estimate how many managers have changed on it. <br>  On medium projects, such as ours, the lifetime of a PM is 1-2 projects.

    <h4>  Tricky stuff </h4><br>  Being pm is an incredibly complicated thing.  And if you do not understand that the essence of this is that the people who make the project are incredibly complex, that it is incredibly difficult to organize any effective teamwork beyond a small project - you will not succeed.  Do not try.  For now, at least don't feel it. <br><br><h4>  Take care of your ass and nerves </h4><br>  A couple of first years, when I was completely green PM, I really didn‚Äôt sleep well.  I was constantly worried, worried about the future.  I did not know a lot, a lot was for me for the first time, I did not know how to solve these or other problems.  Everything was aggravated by the fact that for those around me I pretended to be a knowledgeable person, and therefore I was afraid to ask.  Thank God I had the will to drive away the thought of spitting, and not to give up on this idiotic idea.  To be honest, I just had no way back.  Bridges were burned.  The release date of the project blasted into my mind.  I went to bed with this date and woke up with her.  Any PM will tell you how - he is not sure that there is life after the deadline.  In this mode, many managers live.  Constantly.  Do not believe?  Try, ask your manager, that in his life deadline project.  Your PM does not remember the release date?  Do not think more than 2 seconds, change jobs.  Even now I don‚Äôt sleep very well, but for quite different reasons (or the same? :)). <br><br><h4>  Screwed up </h4><br>  When you screw up.  And this, speaking mathematically, will happen evenly and continuously.  When at least one of your employees screwed up.  And this will happen regularly, because you can‚Äôt foresee everything.  You'll be getting fucked up.  Constantly awake getting pussy.  I like it so much.  What I repeat again.  Hee hee, you'll constantly get pussy.  It only sounds sweet, not so in life.  Your profession is to ‚Äúdo nothing yourself‚Äù, but to achieve the result ‚Äúby someone else‚Äôs hands‚Äù and to get fucked up.  Dear ones. <br><br><h4>  You substitute Vasya </h4><br>  I am sure that you are not thinking about this moment.  In the eyes of all other people, including the authorities, everyone works poorly on a bad project.  Cool, yeah?  But this is almost certainly not the case.  Damn it, it's not at all so !!!  Probably, even each of the people that you have could work quite effectively, if your hands did not grow out of assholes.  Vasya, a programmer, would have been long enough for a senior-a and would have gotten decent money, he could have gotten married if it weren‚Äôt your Krivoruk project that, so that his second year already stretches.  And you can't get off of it!  How to pull out the project leaders?  You do not understand how fatally you are able to expose your people.  Your programmer Vasya, who is really a cool employee, but had the misfortune to get to you, he is honest, he will finish long-term construction.  And then leave the company.  But do not worry.  You too will die after this project.  But what it will matter.  Do you understand what evil, Krivorukov you are our comrade, you have done for the team, for the whole company.  How much money and time pissed away for the owners. <br><br><h4>  You need to pull your pants over your head </h4><br>  If the team were aware of this.  She would have you, yes, panties pulled on her head.  This is not our method tell you!  Well, how else can you, Krivorukov, force you to leave your fucking pride in one place and force you to negotiate with the lead designer Petya, with whom you, so that you are an idiot, "you cannot work."  But the team is not aware of it, so you are relatively safe.  How nice that your team does not read me.  Yes, it will be a reptile who makes a repost at home, or, God forbid, where the thread type in his team.  You understand that then, the team, with your eggs in hand, will force you to start promoting the project.  Although, of course, it is more likely that they will simply spit on you, and, realizing the catastrophe, and that otherwise they will not drown in this place for another year, that they will not see the asterisks, will try to organize themselves. <br><br><h4>  Your manager is a hero </h4><br>  But if, suddenly, your hands are not from ass, and your project will be successful, everyone will be heroes.  Appreciate your nekrivoruky manager, your new brilliant asterisk (upd: grade who did not understand), this is his merit.  You do not understand your happiness.  And I'm not talking about myself. <br><br><h4>  Haha you in person </h4><br>  And especially if you decide to become a manager, because of ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm under thirty, it‚Äôs time to run the blacks,‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to feed the family, how else to make decent money‚Äù.  You have absolutely no chance, you have to compete with those for whom this is a favorite job, vocation, hobby, passion.  From you, a good specialist, you will have a terrible manager, you will have time to prosrat n money and time.  And the more cool you were special, the more money for the company you will have time to prosrat.  You will lose interest in the work (after all, you liked to program it!), You will sour in 6-12-24 months.  By promising you, you will sour without your favorite work.  Ha ha you in the face.  Rarely when you manage to survive at all and return to programming, during these months or years you will lose both the qualifications and the glint in your eyes. <br><br><h4>  Who gets more of it? </h4><br>  Perhaps the manager gets more programmer.  But this is only if we are talking about very different grade-ah.  And it is in idiotic companies.  An ordinary manager, this is the level of money senior.  If you are already an expert or leaddev in a good company, then only, well, a really cool manager, I repeat, it may be that you will receive more money.  What is the point of losing money, condemning yourself to years of hard labor and slaughtering you, leaving for not favorite work? <br><br><h4>  Vasya?  Bring down nafig </h4><br>  If in order to get big respects or big bablosy in a company, you need to become a manager - drop it from this company.  There are normal companies where you will be respected for your prof. Skills, will pay a lot of money and you will be engaged in your favorite business.  Those who say that nowhere in game-devs big money is paid are not right. <br><br><h4>  How to become a PM </h4><br>  Well, firstly, I will tell you that you do not need it. <br>  Still want to become pm? <br>  Do you really want to become PM?  Are you sure about this? <br><br><h4>  Why are you an idiot </h4><br>  No, well, you are a real idiot.  Re-read the post, if you still do not understand why. <br>  Devil !!! <br><br>  Well, you and stupid.  You are still here and want to be PM! <br>  Read my posts, I always repeated to you, you are a lazy whiner and a too weak person.  I do not want to spend on you and the minute of my time. <br><br>  Get out of here.  You will never become PM (what you want ish!) <br><br><img height="252" width="599" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4d3/239/457/4d3239457c4fed84c070868c0d342915.png" alt="270.75 KB"><br><br>  Tristabaxaf for a funeral with you there? <br>  Are you a masochist, do you like getting pussies and burning your first-time cells in huge quantities? <br>  Get out of here pervert. <br><br>  Are you back again? <br>  Okay friend.  Let's go for good. <br>  There are a lot of those for whom this work is a passion, who will spend 12 hours a day and will not ask for much, unlike you.  Especially now in a crisis.  Well, seriously, objectively and completely honest.  You have no chance.  Take your tristabaxof for a funeral and better go find a job where you can continue to program / draw and get good money / pleasure from work. <br><br>  I do not know what to do with you. <br>  You still have no chance, but let's ... <br><br><h4>  Let's try this </h4><br>  Read everything you can on project management, working with people, psychology, teamwork, conflict management, SCRUM / MSF / XP / Agile.  All.  Learn the basics of all other professions (if you are in a game dev, then this is qa, programming, art, design, marketing, business, sales).  Read constantly and very much and only when the number of books read will be more than 30, can you continue to read a little less.  Become a leader in your project, doing your own small business.  Ask your manager how you can help him.  Of course, he will say that he needs your help.  Prove by works that you are able to bring him help.  Become an assistant and fallen.  Start small.  Practice.  Practice a lot.  Become a master of a small team, which, for starters, will make some thread of low priority, for the entire project, garbage.  Put your ambitions and desires in the back of the box and get ready for a very long journey from the very bottom.  The more trust you have, the more results you have, the sooner you will be entrusted with really risky and big projects.  Find someone you can learn from.  Begging (by deeds) for him to allow you to be in a team and learn from the experience.  Most importantly, do not waste your years, go to the right team.  Even if it means moving to Vladivostok and losing money.  I know very poorly the game industry, but I think you can learn a lot from Orlovsky (Nival, Heroes 5, Allods), Crank (Wangers, Perimeter, KranX prod), Gusarov (Cosm. Rangers, King's Bounty), Devisheva (Nival), Mishulina (Nival), Antonov (Reaxion), Shpilchevsky (Nival), Batkin (NaughtyDog).  Do you think differently?  You know what to do with your opinion.  If there is an opportunity to get into real, Western companies, such as EA, or oh, Blizzard - fight for this opportunity.  Sorry everyone cool, who did not name, I really do not know the industry. <br><br>  And yet you are brave, if you are still here.  I sincerely hope that you have made a truly informed choice. <br><br>  Am I too strict?  demand too much? <br>  I immediately told you that you did not suit us, but you did not believe me :) :) <br><br>  Amen. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50774/</a></p>
