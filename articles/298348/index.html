It is simple, highly effective and efficient.  The main task of marketing is to attract and retain customers.  And the best client is loyal, because he will be your PR manager and referee in one person.  Working with such clients is a pleasure for both parties. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And what do loyal customers need?

    <ul><li>  Human relation; </li><li>  Response to complaints; </li><li>  The manifestation of attentiveness, gratitude, anxiety, interest; </li><li>  Real action, not promise.  As their consequence - satisfaction. </li></ul><br><br>  A pressing issue today is increasing customer loyalty.  Extole conducted a <a href="http://go.extole.com/Resource-ePaper-GigaOM-Research.html">survey of marketers</a> about the methods and tools they use to maintain or increase customer loyalty.  More than 50% of marketers use email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b16/36b/67b/b1636b67b7be4bdaa8afd4e7439498e5.png"><br><br>  <b>What is the need to improve loyalty?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  To build trust with customers; </li><li>  To prove your competence and reliability; </li><li>  For the location of customers to the company.  If a person is interested, he will definitely want to return for another successful purchase, which will bring you profit and lead to higher conversion rates. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Portrait of a loyal customer</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c52/3a6/12d/c523a612d2ab4a17894ba434a0b049ae.png"><br><br>  <b>Why use a newsletter to increase loyalty?</b> <br><br>  Email distribution is an effective way to communicate with existing customers and attract new ones.  According to Western marketers, you need to send only <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/aka/docs/pdf/keep_customers_with_email.pdf">6-7 email</a> letters in order to transfer the subscriber to the category of buyer.  To attract new customers, use a common marketing trick: offer a gift in exchange for a subscription.  Then send attractive welcome letters, notifications about promotions, sales, be sure to thank for every purchase and ask to leave feedback. <br><br>  <b><u>Types of email letters to increase customer loyalty</u></b> <br><br>  <b>Welcome letter</b> <br><br>  A welcome letter serves to increase loyalty before you buy.  The first impression is extremely important, and the first letter has a direct impact on it.  These letters are very effective for attracting potential customers and making them permanent.  The formula for an effective welcome email is: <i>personalization + 1 welcome offer + subscription benefits + a description of how often emails will arrive.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/c15/985/5c1c15985a5646e3ba2bff0521cfb981.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Weekly newsletter</b> <br><br>  Weekly newsletters make it possible to maintain customer relationships.  With their help, you can retain customers and increase loyalty.  But this is possible provided the content is relevant and useful.  Subscribers do not like to receive meaningless mail and this can lead to unsubscribe. <br><br>  Examples of content for weekly newsletters: <br><br><ul><li>  Lifehacks </li><li>  Guides </li><li>  Contests </li><li>  Checklists </li><li>  Interview of a famous person in your business </li><li>  Research results </li><li>  Video tutorials </li><li>  Operating Instructions </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38b/797/f13/38b797f13ce1426487e30f10d9f3c5e8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Trigger letters</b> <br><br>  Despite the dryness of such letters, their discovery <a href="http://geniusmarketing.me/lab/5-oshibok-email-marketinga-kotorye-ubivayut-otkryvaemost-vashix-pisem/">is 102% more</a> than the weekly mailing list.  Trigger letters are sent after the visitor performs any action on the site.  For example, registration on the site, adding goods to the cart, purchase, etc.  They should be sent to certain groups of subscribers, and it is important to do it on time.  Trigger letters create a sense of customer value for the brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cf/f56/c36/8cff56c366a3417081ce5846949c1720.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Letters of an abandoned basket</b> <br><br>  These are messages to people who put the goods in the basket, but did not place an order.  The reasons may be many.  The most common among them are: <br><br><ul><li>  mandatory registration on the site; </li><li>  many steps that need to be taken to place an order; </li><li>  low speed of loading pages on the site; </li><li>  lack of detailed information about the product in the order; </li><li>  doubts about the safety of the purchase; </li><li>  cost of delivery; </li><li>  no return policy; </li><li>  limited payment options; </li><li>  Difficult site navigation (difficulty in finding a shopping basket), etc. </li></ul><br><br>  To avoid this, make a simple order form.  You should also remind the recipient that he forgot in the basket, and take care of quality copywriting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d14/9ce/b43/d149ceb434be48a7b16328225f524af7.jpg"><br>  <b>Post-sales letters</b> <br><br>  With the help of such letters you establish communication with the client.  In them you are interested in the opinion of the person, emphasizing its importance.  Give clear instructions and offer bonuses in exchange for customer feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d5/702/4f3/1d57024f38b44feda2a0b52c50f39630.png"><br><br>  Offer to purchase related products as well.  For example, when buying a camera, send an email with different lenses to this model.  Such trigger messages will help you to express concern for the client and gain his favor and trust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/557/bee/859/557bee859d934d28b0d6d452acc6b449.png"><br><br>  <b>Message about promotions, bonuses and special offers</b> <br><br>  Try to make the offer unique.  Be sure to point out the urgency of the purchase, that the promotion is valid only for a short period of time (for example, ‚Äúsell -80% until the end of January‚Äù or simply set a time counter). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ac/9aa/6da/3ac9aa6da1354815a12a776eb0ddbbec.png"><br><br>  Discount offers must also be relevant.  If you offer the customer a product with a discount that he already has, then this will entail a negative reaction: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ed/947/8bd/2ed9478bd6644e1cafb649ce1cbf1332.png"><br><br>  To prevent such situations, follow the customer's purchase history, and for the relevant offer, pay attention to the pages viewed, abandoned shopping carts and additions to wish lists (bookmarks). <br><br>  Also, give clear instructions on how to use the bonus (what exactly needs to be done and how).  When using a series of letters, do not be overly annoying.  1-3 letters with promotions and bonuses will be quite enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/177/817/053/1778170539044c5c879ae71c1efbd99c.png"><br><br>  <b>Reactivation letter</b> <br><br>  A reactivation letter is sent to subscribers who have not made a purchase for a long time.  Also used to refund former subscribers.  According to research, it is much harder and more expensive to attract a new client than to sell something to an existing one (according to statistics, the latter will spend <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2014/03/HowToBuildProfitableCustomerLoyaltyProgram_online_revised.pdf">67% more</a> than a new client).  So do not rush to just let them go and show anxiety.  You can ask why the client stopped buying, and also offer a bonus, a discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29f/5f2/a16/29f5f2a1658348e1a3bf70a727931ee0.png"><br><br>  <b>Letter of thanks</b> <br><br>  Pamper your customers, thank them for their activity and loyalty.  You can do this with the help of gifts, promotions, bonuses and of course warm words.  This kind of promotion will please regular customers and of course attract new ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53c/84e/254/53c84e254ff34ead93384e4933d92083.png"><br><br>  Remember, customer loyalty is invaluable for business.  As much as you would like, you cannot buy it.  Take this issue seriously, do not try to constantly sell something.  To begin with - earn the trust of the client, show your reliability.  Then the work done will bear fruit in the quality of profit and a good reputation, and your customers will enjoy shopping. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298348/</a></p>
