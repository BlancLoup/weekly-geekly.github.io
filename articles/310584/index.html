This is understandable: <b>creative disorder</b> with sometimes not obvious areas of responsibility for ‚Äúordinary‚Äù development, where different people are responsible for the code, brunches, test benches, assembly and deployment, and do not really want to go to the ‚Äúglade‚Äù of their colleagues, is <b>opposed to a high level of organization</b> . <br><br>  In companies with embedded DevOps, developers have more support and can work more efficiently. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/310584/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b93/0b5/7e1/b930b57e1f1f442ba8f503fbc28196e6.png"></a>

      But it is not enough just to want to work ‚Äúrightly‚Äù, you need to somehow come to this.  And here everything is not so simple. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  You can not just take and develop DevOps (c) </h3><br>  More precisely, it is possible, but this process can easily go only in small companies, where one or two projects are being developed, or when a high level of development culture is initially present in all teams.  But what about internal startups where the idea often overtakes the physical and technical capabilities of the company? <br><br>  When we at Positive Technologies decided to develop DevOps, we ran into dozens of teams that worked on projects both public and non-public.  The teams differed greatly in size, using different release models and technological stack.  All this did not allow to create a solution on the principle of one size fits all. <br><br>  At the same time, resources are always limited and they were not enough to introduce DevOps approaches within each team and project.  We needed some new approach.  And that's what we came up with. <br><br><h3>  The first steps </h3><br>  We needed a set of basic DevOps practices that we could quickly adapt to the tasks of any project.  To do this, it was necessary to develop templates for building, deployment and test configurations, to ensure the scaling of projects for the many git branches of individual components, as well as a large number of components themselves and their versions. <br><br>  We managed to solve these problems by transferring the Continuous Integration infrastructure to use a bunch of several tools: <br><br><ul><li>  TeamCity - Continuous Integration organization system; </li><li>  GitLab - storage system source code component products; </li><li>  Artifactory is a system for storing collected binary versions of components and products, caching a proxy of external repositories for various package managers (nuget, npm, pip, rails). </li></ul><br>  In the course of numerous experiments on real projects, a hierarchy of TeamCity projects and a typical interface for all projects in this system was developed. <br><br>  The following processes were worked out in detail: <br><br><ul><li>  assembly and deployment on test benches; </li><li>  running functional and other tests; </li><li>  assignment of quality labels to packages (test, stable, ready for distribution to customers); </li><li>  publishing release builds to update servers; </li><li>  delivery of assemblies and updates to production and many others. </li></ul><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c7/eff/5a7/1c7eff5a7a6a42d7beaee987a6218a15.png"></a> <br><br>  <i>By clicking the picture will open in full size.</i> <br><br><h3>  What is the result </h3><br>  All this is good, but there were questions about the introduction of DevOps in all projects of the company. <br><br>  And what if you combine several dedicated specialists with different core knowledge into one group that can solve the devOps tasks of the entire company? <br><br>  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a "fire brigade".  Now, instead of inventing automation from scratch for each project on their own, employees working on it can order the DevOps service. <br><br>  As a result, we were able to significantly reduce the cost of training and launching work on the new methodology, as well as reduce the number of possible errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be8/641/958/be8641958f5849679e43a5a687daed4d.png"><br><br>  <i>The topic of introducing DevOs is extremely interesting, here various approaches are possible.</i>  <i>And it is extremely important to meet and share experiences.</i>  <i>Usually such events are called ‚Äúmitaps‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  <i>We are going to do something similar, but not quite in the usual format: we want to gather ‚Äúdevops‚Äù and developers in a relaxed atmosphere, to tell the story of building our own DevOps in fast track mode and listen to you, those for whom we did : developers, automators and testers.</i> <br><br>  <b>We are waiting for you on Op!
