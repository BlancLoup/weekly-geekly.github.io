Its meaning is that if you purchased a computer or laptop with Windows 7 on board, and any version other than Starter, from June 2, 2012 to January 31, 2013, then you will most likely be able to take advantage of the upgrade offer to Windows 8 professional for only 469 rubles.  More I recommend to look at the site.  I was interested in this offer because the version I had was Windows 7 Home Basic, x86.  But I really wanted 64 bits - because I increased the memory to 6GB.  In addition, the professional will be clearly more interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, it would be great to add screenshots, but there is personal data everywhere, so I will limit myself to an oral description.  I registered in the program about two months ago, indicated what kind of model, where and when I bought, and so on. <br><br>  It scared me that my 32-bit version could not be upgraded to 64x, moreover, I did not find definite answers.  Tech support scared answers that you first need to upgrade to 32-bit Windows 8, and then, waiting for the DVD (for extra money), reinstall completely.  Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with that.  Today, without waiting for a letter to email, I went with my order code, and saw that I was already waiting for a promotional code for the purchase, and a brief description of the acquisition procedure.  In order to buy Windows 8, you must first download the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D262205">update assistant</a> .  I started it, it went through a laptop, said that several programs are incompatible.  Yes, and not really needed, I am still going to rearrange under 0.  In the end, you have an offer to buy an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for 1290r.  We agree!  Enter personal data, then enter the plastic card data for payment.  At that moment I was very tense, because it seemed that 1290r would be written off from me now, and I missed the input of the promotional code somewhere.  Fortunately, everything worked out.  Finally, we have a long-awaited place to enter our code.  We enter it, and the price changes to 469r.  It is quite another matter!  Upon completion of the purchase, you are given a key, and a letter appears in the mailbox with congratulations and the same key.  Be sure to save it, it is still useful to us.  After that, the update starts downloading.  I figured that this was not our method, so I interrupted it, formatted the disk, and started the MSDN installation of the Russian version of Windows 8 Pro x64.  There is no drive in my laptop, so I used the excellent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/116799/">Zalman VE 200</a> device.  Everything went without any problems, and Windows was activated.  Now I am one of the first owners of the licensed 8th Windows.  At the same time got rid of the limitations of the memory of the 32-bit version.  As it seems to me, you can upgrade for such a price, even if you are an ardent fan of pirated releases.  Especially if you have a home version of Windows 7, as I did.  Successes! <br><br>  Supplement from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/LeeMiller/">LeeMiller</a> <br>  If anyone does not have MSDN, and if after placing the order an error about impossibility to check the time took off, it‚Äôs enough <br>  1. Go to the post office and in the letter Thanks for ordering Windows 8 (order # xxx), at the very bottom of the letter in small print says ‚ÄúAccess your account online.‚Äù <br>  2. Fill in the data they ask <br>  3. At the very bottom of the copy of the bill will be the link ‚ÄúClick here to download Windows 8.‚Äù
