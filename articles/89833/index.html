  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the data centers on?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The story actually happened to me and is by no means my invention or fantasy. <br><br>  One warm May day, perhaps even on Friday, employees of the service department of one organization, either in turn, or in pairs or threes, went out onto the balcony of their 6th floor, whose windows look out onto the backyard of the building.  They smoked and discussed the past holidays, complained to each other about the lingering spleen and thought about how to spend the weekend away from work.  Basically, the male part of the IT staff, from time to time, diluted the talkative employees of the accounting department, whose department was located in the opposite wing of this floor.  Who, dokurivaya - put out a cigarette in an improvised tin can-ashtray, who - thoughtlessly threw another burning cigarette butt out the window.  The day steadily passed for the second half, and the employees of the organization sedately tried to complete all their current affairs. <br><br>  Time seemed to stop, or if it did not stop, but it dragged on treacherously slowly. <br>  But it seemed only from the side. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At this moment, the flaming cigarette butt fell on the air conditioner on the 5th floor balcony, where the main server organization was located and along with it, the department of system administrators ensuring its work.  The warm air enriched with oxygen from the air conditioners inflated the ashes, and the plastic case began to glow.  Decay after 30 minutes turned into a small flame, which spread to a plastic, also opened by smokers, window, next to the air conditioner.  The window of the 5th floor flared, the flame rose to the window of the 6th floor and burst into the corridor. <br>  Strangely enough, there was no shouting ‚Äúfire!‚Äù - people appeared in the corridor every 5-10 minutes, no one has noticed anything yet. <br>  - after <b>6 minutes,</b> someone went into the corridor of the 6th floor, ran into a pillar of flame, and quietly returned to the room, telling colleagues that there was a fire in the corridor. <br>  - after <b>30 seconds</b> a fire alarm call was received in the building on one of the central streets of the city <br>  - after <b>2 minutes</b> in the building, no one but one room knew about the fire.  The floor staff walked chaotically and chaotically around the flames.  Someone called down the guard and reported the incident.  Someone suggested using plastic bottles to set water and extinguish.  None of those present knew where the fire extinguishers are located, and in principle, for some reason, did not think about them. <br>  - after another <b>1 minute, the</b> women from the accounting department, seeing and assessing the situation, began to leave the floor, while opening the doors of their rooms and leaving the windows to plow, headed for the eastern landing.  The western exit was already blocked by fire.  The created draft caught the flame with incredible force and pushed smoke out into the corridor towards the second exit. <br>  - after <b>2 minutes the</b> flame has already blocked all the moves of the 5th and 6th floors.  Part of the staff managed to retire, but the most courageous rushed for fire extinguishers or simply stayed on the floor to wait for the firefighters.  Not experienced blow to the floor at one of the two-storey fire extinguisher valve was broken, which made it impossible to further the process of extinguishing.  The second fire extinguisher did not work as, apparently, hung in the building from the date of its settlement. <br>  - in the next <b>30 seconds, the</b> security chief with two spare fire extinguishers climbed through the eastern staircase to the 5th floor.  Bursting into the corridor, he realized that he could not even hold out for 30 seconds in a flame and smoke, he threw fire extinguishers into the fire and jumped back.  At this time, on all floors from the 5th to the 8th there were people cut off from the exits of the building and trying to see salvation in the open windows. <br>  - after <b>1 minute</b> , and in the sum, 7 minutes after the call, a fire brigade drove up to the building.  Most of the windows on the 5th and 6th floors already blew smoke, forcing people to close and defend themselves in rooms free of smoke and fire. <br>  - after <b>1 minute</b> , just before firefighters rushed into the floor, firefighters administrators stopped the most basic database and application servers, closing in the server room and hoping to survive the same fire. <br>  - after <b>10 seconds</b> the building was turned off electricity, and stopped, just in case, the diesel generator - the firemen, having no better means than foam, began to flood the floors with water.

      Everything ended as quickly as it began. <br><br>  The fire spread in 7 minutes, you have been reading the article for 3 minutes, for the remaining 4 minutes, try to answer the following questions: <br>  - Do you smoke at work in the building? <br>  - Can you find a fire extinguisher on your floor in a short time? <br>  - Do you know how to use a fire extinguisher, how to press the valve to activate it? <br>  - Do you know where in your building the emergency exit? <br>  - would you open the window to take a breath of fresh air, thereby increasing the flames and the risk to other people, instead of locking the doors and windows, lying down on the floor and covering yourself with a thick cloth? <br>  - Are you ready to linger in a burning building, trying to fulfill your duty to the organization, and save documents / stop the server, taking into account that most often, brave men are on fire? <br>  - Will it come to your mind, first of all, to save not yourself, but the women and children in the building? <br><br>  and the main question: can people who are close to you count on you and not on the electronics of the fire extinguishing system? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89833/</a></p>
