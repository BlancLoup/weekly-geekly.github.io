  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Working standards in the web development market is a question for developers, not for the state.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Talking about the relationship between the state and the Internet in our country is endless.</b>  <b>Sometimes it seems that these things are not related.</b>  <b>However, there are people who are concerned not only with the transparency and civilization of the market, but also with high-quality government relations on it.</b>  <b>Today we talked with Alena Popova, the initiator of a large number of projects on cooperation between the Web and government agencies.</b> <b><br></b> <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e3/651/5b0/3e36515b0627140a8cfabe01f1243c46.jpg" alt="Alena Popova, especially for WebProfessionals" width="333" height="500">  <b>- Alena, hello, tell me, how do you see the current situation in the web development market?</b> <br>  - There are teams, there are projects, there is interest.  There is no single entry point for such initiatives.  In fact, you need to understand what kind of development and where it will be in demand.  For example, Ivan Begtin, an expert on open data, constantly writes which projects would be in demand in gov2.0. <br>  World experience is this: to reduce costs and greater efficiency, governments of different countries hold targeted competitions for developing applications based on open government data.  We will soon announce a similar initiative in Russia.  I believe that this will be efficient and logical. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>- Do you often have to act as a customer of web development services, or as a project manager within the development team?</b> <br>  - As a customer of services - more often.  Now we have developers - it‚Äôs like engineers in Soviet times: everyone needs them, but few stars.  And so the market has created insane demand for "hands"!  The salary of a good developer in Moscow is comparable, and - in some cases - even significantly more than the rate of his colleagues in the West.  Therefore, many now donate development to outsource to the regions.  By the way, many western startups created by Russians, development teams are left in Russia, and in the USA they open only sales offices.  Also, it is still believed that our developers are among the best in the world.  As for the management of development, this should be done by a professional or a person who can give control to all 8 hours.  For quality assessment is the main disadvantage of the Russian market. <br><br>  <b>- How transparent is the market?</b>  <b>Pricing understandable?</b>  <b>Clients in general, in your opinion happy or not?</b> <br>  - Customers are often not satisfied with the lack of system, high costs.  There are very few good teams.  In addition, there is a tendency of "floating personnel": developers often ply between competing companies.  I remember there was a case when one well-known runet, met the developer of his project in the office of a competitor.  To which he replied: - Well, if you don‚Äôt like it, I can leave you.  I am offered the best salary here!

      <b>- We recently conducted a study in conjunction with the RAEC, and it showed that 65% of customers choose a developer for the familiar.</b>  <b>Do you think this is a normal situation or is it better to hold a tender?</b> <br>  - I‚Äôm sure that proven people and a credibility rating in the development market in general is the main criterion if you don‚Äôt have a million money and are not ready to overpay for a brand.  And not the fact that the branded studio works better. <br><br>  <b>- In your projects there is a single standard for project management, project documentation?</b> <br>  - There is.  SCRUM, Redmine. <br><br>  <b>- How are your deadlines organized?</b>  <b>After all, it is no secret that web development is often uncontrollable in terms of setting and fulfilling deadlines ...</b> <br>  - The answer is above :) But, of course, there must be an excellent project manager.  Much depends on him.  Including an adequate assessment of the timing of work. <br><br>  <b>- Alena, do you think there will be any government regulation on the web development market?</b>  <b>Will working standards of project documentation be introduced?</b>  <b>Is it even necessary?</b> <br>  - In general, I do not see the point in any special control.  And working standards as a whole is a question for the developers themselves.  I think that market mechanisms are the right answer to this question. <br><br>  <b>- Tell me now, what are you doing to make the Web market cleaner and more understandable?</b>  <b>I heard about your project <a href="http://gov2project.ru/">gov2project.ru</a> ...</b> <br>  - Gov2project does not make the development market cleaner and clearer) This is a platform-aggregator of all civil projects in the Russian Federation in the field of e-government.  As for the development, this applies to our other initiative.  But I can announce her a bit later. <br><br>  <b>- Alena, can you formulate your wish to the web development market in one phrase?</b> <br>  - Better, more logical, more distributed! <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115231/</a></p>
