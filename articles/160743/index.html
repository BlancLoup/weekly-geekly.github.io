  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kickstarter vs white labels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Crowdfunding is gaining momentum all over the world, and along with global crowd-based platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product">‚Äúwhite labels‚Äù</a> , plug-ins and website templates began to appear, allowing you to create your own crowdfunding resource and set your rules without looking at the big crowd players. market, or fasten pages with the functionality of crowdfunding to existing sites.</i> <br><br>  Recently, the <a href="http://invested.in/">Invested.in</a> platform received an investment of about $ 1 million.  Invested.in not only offers templates for creating crowdfunding resources: it fully develops the interface and functionality and can create a website by making a mix of the features of Kickstarter and indiegogo, but it is also such.  And although the Invested.in slogan is ‚ÄúWe power crowdfunding‚Äù, the success of the projects hosted there is not yet impressive. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.launcht.com/">Launcht.com</a> offers various tools for several user categories: business, non-profit organizations and universities.  For the latter, a voting system has been developed that allows evaluating student projects in <a href="http://siu.launcht.com/campaigns/view/archive">an open mode</a> .  The problem faced by the creators of Launcht.com, lies in the social responsibility of customers and their honesty to their users, as long as the company can not conduct a thorough check.  So, they already had to refuse to producers of films for adults, but it is difficult to say how many more companies specializing in prohibited content will want to use the templates Launcht.com. <br>  Freeman White and Spencer Taylor, the creators of the system, set out to help start-ups, individuals and foundations to get money for various initiatives.  At the same time, the authors notice that they are not competitors to Kickstarter and other platforms.  Their activities only emphasize that crowdfunding is becoming increasingly popular, and more and more companies feel the need for this tool.  In fact, Launcht.com embodies the principle of ‚Äúif the mountain does not go to Mohammed, then Mohammed goes to the mountain‚Äù, inviting people to create their own crowdfunding system.  (Examples of Launcht.com: <a href="http://www.threerevolutions.com/">1</a> and <a href="http://www.inlieugiving.com/">2</a> ). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The latest development to bypass Kickstarter is <a href="http://ignitiondeck.com/id/the-origin-of-ignitiondeck/">Ignitiondeck</a> .  The company <a href="http://virtuousgiant.com/">Virtuous Giant</a> , which makes mobile apps, websites and games, has released a plugin for WordPress, which allows you to tie pages with a crowdfunding system onto sites.  The plugin costs $ 59, integrates with Twitter and Facebook, and payments go through PayPal, so Ignitiondeck holders can choose any currency that this aggregator supports. <br>  Having installed such a plugin on the <a href="http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen/">Star Citizen</a> game site, the game developers collected more than 4.7 million dollars, despite the fact that they collected half the size of the Kickstarter.  The author of the game had to create a project on Kickstarter due to the fact that his own website could not withstand the influx of users, and in order not to lose money, he had to start a parallel fundraising campaign.

      The reasons that pushed the authors to create Ignitiondeck are simple: they themselves once wanted to start a project on Kickstarter, but they came to the conclusion that there are too many restrictions and obligations associated with this.  In addition, they were not satisfied with the need to pay a service fee to the platform.  The fundamental difference between the Ignitiondeck and the Kickstarter model is the abandonment of the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù system, so the backer‚Äôs money is immediately deducted from the account and not frozen pending the end of the project. <br>  At the moment, more than 600 sites use this plugin, and its developers are talking about the continuous improvement of the system, and they want to achieve maximum functionality flexibility so that it suits a large number of companies regardless of the type of their activity. <br><br>  The creators of Ignitiondeck, unlike the creators of Launcht, want to compete with crowdfunding platforms, because they consider the existing system to be unfair.  They advocate that in the future crowdfunding be used by everyone, and that there is an opportunity to raise funds at the same time in several places - with the aim of obtaining maximum profit.  It is not clear, however, how potential project supporters will react to this: will they have a feeling that they are being used as a cash cow on all fronts?  Especially, this applies to Russia, where crowdfunding is just beginning to develop.  Domestic <a href="http://start.planeta.ru/">crowdfunding platforms</a> are making a lot of effort to popularize crowdfunding, so that users of Runet have increased confidence in the system of public funding, and they themselves are often ready to act as a guarantor of the projects for which they raise funds will be implemented. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160743/</a></p>
