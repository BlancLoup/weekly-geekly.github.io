SEO is an online marketing direction aimed at promoting products that are already in demand.  That is, SEO - this is not the tool that works on the formation of demand.  If you already have products or services for sale that are interesting to people and that you already know about, then SEO is the right direction to take.  For many companies, SEO gives the lion's share of all traffic that comes to the site.  And this is one of the most important reasons why you need to pay attention to the promotion of sites in search engines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each search engine uses ranking factors to generate search results.  Google, for example, has about 200 of them. Yandex has about 1000 factors built on the logic of machine learning.

    <h3>  SEO pyramid </h3><br>  The factors mentioned can be assembled into a so-called SEO pyramid.  The first level of the pyramid is the site and content: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b71/05b/de7/b7105bde7fcc405cb79c0ce364d593bd.jpg"><br><br>  For successful promotion, the site must meet a number of criteria, divided into categories: <br><br><ul><li>  Technical condition. </li><li>  Index (primary and secondary). </li></ul><br><h3>  Technical condition </h3><br>  "Technical condition" combines four basic requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  Current working structure. </li><li>  Continuous availability of the resource. </li><li>  No duplicate pages. </li><li>  Filter Optimization. </li></ul><br>  Let's look at each of these points. <br><br><h4>  Current working structure </h4><br>  Often, e-commerce sites have a rather complex hierarchy, many pages, many products.  What is meant by working structure? <br><br><ul><li>  All pages must be accessible. </li><li>  Important pages for us should be as close as possible to the main page. </li><li>  Missing pages with 404 pages error.  Not only is this annoying to users, but also the bots of search engines can get on these pages.  This negatively affects the conversion and ranking of the resource in search results. </li></ul><br><h4>  Availability </h4><br>  The site should always be available.  If you save on hosting and the site will periodically "lie down" due to maintenance, the search engine, when confronted with this, will downgrade the site.  And this is quite important.  Therefore, do not save on a hosting plan and choose proven hosting providers. <br><br><h4>  No duplicate pages </h4><br>  If the site has the same pages with different addresses, this will also adversely affect the ranking by the search engine.  This is expressed in the fact that none of the duplicates will fall into search results. <br><br><h4>  Filter Optimization </h4><br>  Filters serve as entry points that attract low frequency traffic.  For example, on your site there is a category "laptops".  To get to the top search results for this query is very difficult, almost impossible: the competition is very high.  Let you have filters "gaming laptops", "laptops for work", laptops for something else.  And by such requests it is already much easier to get to the top.  If the filters are optimized, then you can attract low-frequency and even mid-frequency traffic in search results. <br><br><h4>  Index </h4><br>  The index is the base of the search engine where the pages of your site are stored.  They are divided into "useful" and "useless" by the system.  The more ‚Äúuseful‚Äù pages there are, the better for you.  "Useless" pages worsen the rating of the site in the database. <br><br>  If we enter site: site.ua in Google, we get the total number of pages in the index corresponding to this request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97f/5de/127/97f5de1275fb4da2bc8f3633d2c2b505.jpg"><br><br>  Turning to the last page of pagination, you will see an alert that not all results and not all pages that the search engine sees are considered useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/979/e81/9b7/979e819b7db14bd69834fa26c577f25a.jpg"><br><br>  Clicking on the link "Show hidden results" will display those pages that from the point of view of the search engine carry a minimum of usefulness and semantic load.  This is the so-called sub-index.  And you must ensure that your site has as few pages as possible in this index.  Useless pages usually include those that: <br><br><ul><li>  Contain duplicate content. </li><li>  Do not contain content at all. </li><li>  They contain content, but are located very deep in the structure of the site.  Search bots sometimes can not even get to these pages, so you need to ensure that the additional index was as low as possible. </li></ul><br><h3>  Help in work </h3><br>  For communication with webmasters, Google and Yandex have two excellent and fairly simple tools: <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">www.google.com/webmasters/tools</a> and <a href="https://webmaster.yandex.ru/">https://webmaster.yandex.ru</a> .  If you register your site in these services, you can get useful information: <br><br><ul><li>  About errors on the site. </li><li>  About possible shortcomings in optimization. </li><li>  About markup. </li><li>  About the possibility of imposing sanctions on your site. </li></ul><br>  These services are almost must have for any webmaster involved in SEO optimization. <br><br><h3>  Content </h3><br>  The impact of content on SEO success is hard to overestimate.  For the best ranking of pages by search engines content should be of high quality and useful for visitors.  It would seem that this is an obvious, captain's truth.  But still a huge amount of commercial resources in the network contain pages filled with useless or copied from somewhere information.  And it hurts, first of all, the assessment of the resource itself by search engines. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Availability</b> .  Content can be any: text, images, video, any other types of content.  That is, at least some content must be present on the page.  If not, then you should not expect the site to be ranked high.  Even if you increase links with very reputable resources, you still will not get into the results of the issue. </li><li>  <b>Uniqueness</b> .  It is highly desirable that the content be unique.  That is, it should not be repeated on other resources.  For example, it is not necessary to copy very good product descriptions from competitors in the hope that you will take off in the search results and customers will rush to you.  Search engines have long used protection against such frauds, so you need to create your own content that will help you to rise in the ranking. </li><li>  <b>Relevance</b> .  Content must match the theme (or themes) of your site.  For example, if you are selling windows and doors, it will be a mistake to promote the main page for the query ‚Äúwindows and doors‚Äù.  It is advisable to have two pages, separately for windows and doors, and the main page should serve as an entry point and contain information about the company, products and services, or merge a catalog.  On the "window" page should be placed relevant information about the window: designs, dimensions, materials, etc.  The same goes for doors.  You do not need to combine all the directions, try to break the assortment and fill the pages with the most relevant content. </li><li>  <b>Quality</b>  Speaking of quality, you need to remember that you are creating content for the user.  Despite the fact that you are engaged in search engine optimization, your task is to offer products that are most useful for people.  And secondly, you should sharpen your articles and content for search engines. </li><li>  <b>Updates</b> .  Content must be updated periodically.  If the site was created in 2009 and since then no pages, news about the company, promotions or assortment have been added to it, the search engine will be less and less likely to go to it, which will negatively affect the ranking.  Of course, the site will not be completely filtered out, no sanctions will be imposed on you, but still it is recommended to periodically update the resource. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Content plan </h3><br>  If we talk about e-commerce sites, the first step is to generate content for: <br><br><ul><li>  Category pages. </li><li>  Pages subcategories. </li><li>  Filter pages. </li><li>  Pages with cards of popular products.  It is impossible to write unique text descriptions for all products, therefore it is necessary to concentrate your attention on those products that are popular either now or become them in the future. </li><li>  Transactional articles for the blog.  These are informative articles that provide useful tips on the selection of goods and services, interesting descriptions.  In this case, the text must refer to the catalog, thereby increasing the likelihood of related purchases.  It is important to follow the measure so that the text is not filled with hyperlinks.  In addition, the number of transactional articles also should not be too large, there is no need to turn your mini Wikipedia site.  When writing such articles it is better to focus on products with good demand. </li></ul><br><h3>  Help in work </h3><br>  We have already mentioned two services from Google and Yandex that help identify non-unique headers and identify duplicate content.  You can also recommend the services <a href="http://advego.ru/plagiatus/">http://advego.ru/plagiatus/</a> and <a href="http://www.content-watch.ru/">http://www.content-watch.ru/</a> , allowing you to check the content for uniqueness. <br><br>  Two more services will help you to check the structure of the site: <a href="http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/">http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/</a> and <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html">http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html</a> .  They will scan your resource and point out shortcomings in the structure, possible problems, technical issues that need to be corrected that may affect the ranking of your site. <br><br><h3>  The second level of the pyramid: key queries </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/304/9b2/755/3049b27559d64652813c8a9db08955f0.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike SEO, contextual advertising makes it much more accurate to work with an audience selectively.  For SEO-promotion, this level of accuracy is still unattainable.  However, we still have access to certain targeting tools, and first of all, key queries. <br><br>  Key requests are classified by nature: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Navigation</b>  If you are a big brand, then the key inquiries for which you are searched is the name of the brand. </li><li>  <b>Informational</b> .  If you are an information portal, or you have some kind of news section, then it is advisable to focus on the requests of the relevant topics. </li><li>  <b>Transactional</b> .  If you are a company selling goods and services on the Internet, then you need to navigate the transaction requests and develop the site for them. </li></ul><br>  and by region: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>General</b> .  Such requests do not indicate the name of the settlement, district, subject of the Russian Federation, etc., for example, ‚Äúbuy a phone‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>Regional</b> .  These are already more accurate, more relevant queries, which indicate some kind of geo-referencing.  For example, ‚Äúbuy a phone Moscow‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br>  When choosing key requests and distributing them across the pages of the site, you must firmly adhere to three criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Compliance with the pages of the site (relevance)</b> .  Above has been given an example with windows and doors.  Similarly, you need to do for other areas of business that you can do. </li><li>  <b>Maximum segmentation by pages</b> .  Avoid situations where multiple pages are targeted to promote on the same request.  That is, the more your semantic query core, the more relevant landing pages should be for your site, and the more likely it is that your site will be ranked in free search results. </li><li>  <b>Limited number of requests per page</b> .  It is impossible to optimize the page for 100 key phrases, so you need to concentrate on a small number of requests that will benefit: leads, targeted traffic.  Ideally, each page should have one request. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Regional ranking </h3><br>  Issued by the search engine page must meet the user's requests.  And how do most sites work today?  There is a section, subsection, filters, products, and the main site is immediately tailored for specific cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, etc.).  But it is quite difficult to promote at once by many regional requests, and sometimes it is not at all possible. <br><br>  Therefore, in order to segment information on the site as much as possible useful for users and for the search engine, divide the site into regional subdomains.  For example, msk.site.ru, spb.site.ru, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/368/dcd/997/368dcd997ae3415285526c3511d3b7a1.jpg"><br><br>  When working with key queries, the following services will be useful: <br><br><ul><li>  Selecting Google keywords: <a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner">https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner</a> </li><li>  Selection of keywords Yandex: <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.ru/">https://wordstat.yandex.ru/</a> </li><li>  Trend Assessment: <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">https://www.google.com/trends/</a> </li></ul><br><h3>  Third Level Pyramid: Link Marketing </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/731/2f0/43b/7312f043bcaa4c4d8d38e834279354f3.jpg"><br><br>  The term ‚Äúlink marketing‚Äù refers to the activity of optimizing links and quoting your site.  That is, it should lead to links from other resources. <br><br>  If you want to promote your website, it is very important that the reference mass looks as natural as possible and as useful as possible.  Many people buy links on link exchanges so that the site can be ranked in the search results.  And it seems to be good.  The site sells, brings traffic.  But representatives of search engines argue that this approach has no future.  It is necessary to give and build up useful links. <br><br>  The reference weight must satisfy the following criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Variety</b> .  Your project should have links from blogs, forums, articles, catalogs, ratings.  The diversity of the reference mass gives naturalness.  This is quite important. </li><li>  <b>Regularity</b>  Suppose that you do not have any infopowder, but the number of links to your site grows.  For example, you posted a link in 200 forums, and the traffic went.  But the search engine algorithms will see this, and there will be a suspicion that the reference mass is unnatural.  Therefore, if there is an opportunity, you need to distribute the placement of links for two months, for a month, and not to post them in a day.  Otherwise, the search engine may suspect your site in black SEO. </li><li>  <b>Environment</b> .  Links should be placed in some relevant articles, relevant sections of forums.  It often happens that SEO specialists promote some ‚Äúwheelchairs‚Äù and place links on a building forum.  It is generally out of hand.  It is necessary that the themes of the reference mass and your site match the themes of the donors, that is, the sites where you are located. </li></ul><br>  As tools for working with links, we can recommend the following services: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">www.google.com/webmasters/tools</a> Displays links leading to your site. </li><li>  <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">https://ahrefs.com/</a> Shows graphs, segmentation by key phrases, by landing pages, in other areas.  You can get a very detailed reference profile of your site and understand how good or bad it is, as well as conduct a more detailed analysis. </li><li>  <a href="https://majestic.com/">https://majestic.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.linkpad.ru/">https://www.linkpad.ru/</a> are analogues of <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">https://ahrefs.com/</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  The fourth level of the pyramid: behavioral factors + brand quoting + social signals </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e23/756/a1e/e23756a1e4f44cc2a9fe643d177934ca.jpg"><br><br>  These are brand and social factors.  Search engines introduce new signals that help determine how the site is relevant to the subject, how well it is qualitative. <br><br>  Suppose you visited a resource and found an interesting article there.  You probably want her to share with anyone.  That is, it is useful content for you.  This is the first signal. <br><br>  The second signal is convenience.  The user came to your site, found a convenient order form, information about travel and other information.  And if your competitors do not have all of this, then the search engine will give preference to your site when forming the issue, because it provides more detailed information, has a convenient interface, and in general this product is made for people. <br><br>  The third signal is the mention of your brand.  Search engines love brands, that is, those sites that are most often linked to.  It may not even be links, but some textual references, but Google and Yandex also use them when ranking.  Therefore, the more often your site is cited, the higher the likelihood that search engines will love it. <br><br><h3>  Modern realities </h3><br>  Time easy SEO passed.  Now you should not expect any quick results from SEO.  This is not a panacea, which will bear fruit tomorrow.  If you are promised this, then do not believe these unfortunate SEOs, because instead of the result, you will receive only negative from the search engines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/6b6/76a/ec26b676ac0a4a3a8c5dedd970ea0f47.jpg"><br><br>  If we talk about really proper SEO, about forming the right link profile, about shaping the right content strategy, about eliminating technical problems, then this work will begin to bring first results in at least three to four months.  This is the first stage, which will give some results.  After six months, SEO will start to pay off.  And only during the year you will be able to get some significant results, some rather interesting share of traffic, bringing sales, transactions or conversion, depending on what you are tracking and what you do. <br><br><h3>  Interesting case </h3><br>  Finally, I want to talk about one interesting and illustrative case of SEO-promotion, which took place in my practice.  We are talking about the online store of toys <a href="http://planettoys.ua/">planettoys.ua</a> .  Initially, the client set a goal: to start work on SEO and increase sales through the site.  Absolutely commonplace goal for any selling business.  He does not need traffic and positions in search results, he needs sales, leads, some kind of target transitions.  SEO experts often do not understand this and are chasing some abstract indicators that result in nothing. <br><br>  First, the following work was carried out: <br><br><ul><li>  Conducted SEO audit.  This is a certain foundation that lays the foundation for the development of the site. </li><li>  Analyzed the possibility of expanding the structure of the site. </li><li>  Formed a technical task for implementation, quality control and results. </li></ul><br>  Then practical steps were taken: <br><br><ul><li>  Eliminate duplicate pages on the register: </li><li>  <a href="http://shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/Radioupravlenie">shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/Radioupravlenie</a> <b>=&gt;</b> <a href="http://shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/radioupravlenie">shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/radioupravlenie</a> </li><li>  At the end of all links added a slash. </li><li>  Removed intermediate directories when two different addresses led to the same page: </li><li>  <a href="http://shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop">shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop</a> <b>/ kukly_i_aksessuary</b> / kukly_paola_reina / <b>=&gt;</b> <a href="http://shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/kukly_paola_reina/">shop.planettoys.ua/ru/shop/kukly_paola_reina</a> </li><li>  Adjusted category names.  Going to the site of toys, we found the section "tree".  The search engine, unfortunately, does not understand that these are wooden toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/e30/476/94de30476fa84456bbbd6f1734ff29f2.jpg"><br><br>  Wood =&gt; Wooden Toys </li><li>  Created additional pages, that is, expanded the structure of the site.  Previously, there was only a section of Lego.  But people are looking for different Lego series: there is Lego Movie, Lego Cars, Lego Star Wars, and the site did not have this division.  New subsections gave additional traffic, additional transitions to the site.  This is one of the ways to expand the structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/130/b7e/7a0130b7e46945e39de4019d3d344ca7.jpg"><br></li><li>  Optimized filters.  As a result, additional landing pages were created that were optimized and filled with useful content, which also gave additional traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/084/3fc/dbb/0843fcdbbd584fb1bacbeb71c92aa434.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/a8a/71c/f61a8a71ce4a47e0924fb73b09536621.jpg"></li><li>  Formed templates meta tags.  It is difficult to manually register them, so for e-commerce sites you need to do template optimization, at least at the first stage of work.  This will help to optimize and make unique website headers and landing pages. <br><br>  <b>Title</b> : Buy toys for children <b>{Filter name - Age}</b> |  Online store of children's toys PlanetToys <br>  <b>Keywords</b> : toys for children <b>{Filter Name - Age}</b> , PlanetToys <br>  <b>Description</b> : A huge range of toys for children {Name of the filter - Age}, from PlanetToys.  High quality, fast delivery. <br>  H1: Toys for children <b>{Filter name - Age}</b> </li><li>  Improved scanning of landing pages.  It often happens that for the sake of the beauty of the design they sacrifice the navigation elements of the page numbers, leaving only buttons like ‚ÄúShow all‚Äù, ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b81/9d1/ebc/b819d1ebcab24f05be73e16cc565b9e2.jpg"><br><br>  And it turns out that the search engine simply does not see the goods that are loaded by the script.  That is, there are no links, the search engine sees only those positions that are presented by default, and does not receive any ranking, any weight, which damages the rating of the site.  Therefore, pagination was made for this project. </li><li>  Eliminate internal duplication of content.  On this site, the content was duplicated on the filters page, on the pagination (transition) pages, in delivery blocks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/789/88f/50f78988fbd541adbd88b4aeb11f36e0.jpg"><br><br>  By eliminating these duplicates and making unique landing pages, we have improved the attractiveness of the site from the point of view of the search engine. </li><li>  Additional improvements.  Remember that you need to customize Canonical, customize robots.txt, eliminate non-informative headers, optimize external links, develop and refine microformats that help the search engine understand what this site is, what products are there, whether they are available.  This is quite important.  And, of course, you need to optimize the load and download speed of the site, because the faster it loads, the better the search engine scans it. </li></ul><br>  The first works were carried out in October, which immediately began to affect attendance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a21/891/321/a2189132144149f08b47c6996d6a1f2a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ab/0b5/b68/1ab0b5b68b7c431e9d9654b0766a70c8.jpg"><br><br>  In the end, an increase of 568%.  Not bad enough, considering that the graphs reflect only the first stage.
