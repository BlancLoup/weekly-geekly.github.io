Everything has changed with the adoption of certain laws and the availability of the Internet, now your every word on the Internet will be used against you and your loved ones.  Any link, any statement, any status, any song, any picture or video - everything can ultimately harm your reputation both before people and before the law. <br>  The time of the Internet is gone, it is the time of countless kittens, ridiculous tumbles, social networks, twitter, online stores with different heresy, degradation. <br><br>  All our data on virtually any site is duplicated on hundreds of different servers, hundreds of sources of compromising data.  Any your word is drunk on a regular social network - it will last forever, your every word can lead to a series of troubles. <br><br>  Do you remember dialup, fidonet, dc, forums, locale, local games, file balls, local communities, local torrents, meetings, chats?  To all this, the end, with every second their number decreases, only the old millennium past olds who are stubbornly fighting for freedom and their old interests remain.  Melancholy, nostalgia, illness of many of us. <br>  We are dying out and resigned, a new generation is growing, for whom it is in the order of things to be under the supervision of the whole world, for whom it is normal to be in the environment where they were born, to be normal ...

      Many of us have already had children, a wife, decent work for a long time, but that pimply teenager, who first tried to put Linux (/ FreeBSD) for interest, lives in each of us for interest, each of us tried to build his own Fido, each of us remembers LAN by name, each of us remembers the beginning of bash-org, each of us started our IT career with this, each of us dreamed of being Gates or Zuckerberg.  But everything turned out differently, we are beardy and not, everyone has above-average wealth and holidays abroad once a year.  Sad friends.  Time is running out and we, just like the IT people of our time, in dirty sweaters go to far corners of memory and retire, we never understood them, but listened, did not understand their mania to the first PCs and the first networks interconnections in the Internet. <br><br>  We are morally and technically outdated, our time is gone, as well as the time of our Internet. <br><br>  Schoolchildren who so annoyed us ‚Äî they got academic statuses a long time ago, many of them took our places at our previous jobs, they became adult administrators, programmers.  And they also look at us, as we looked at those strange people in sweaters in our time. <br><br>  We are the latest generation of free Internet and PC technology computers, now we all have Android, touchscreens, iPhones, google voices.  They don‚Äôt know how to manage it on the picture while it is loading, they don‚Äôt know about the exchange of winchesters and floppy disks, they don‚Äôt know what a bit is, they don‚Äôt know about the Assembler, they don‚Äôt know about the locale, they don‚Äôt know for a long time there are clouds and ignorance of what it is and what it cost us. <br><br>  A moment of silence, please, Lord for a lost era, freedom and youth. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186512/</a></p>
