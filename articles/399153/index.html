      Sony is counting on its console.  Fifty games are adapted for it, new matte controllers with backlighting and various other nishtyaki are provided for it.  So far, the replacement of the usual PS4 is not mentioned, but in the future the games will be developed with 4K and HDR, and our ‚Äúold woman‚Äù, released in 2013, does not support such fashionable abbreviations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">PlayStation 4 Pro Features</font> </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Black colour <br>  Size: 295x55x327 mm <br>  Weight: 3.3 kg <br>  Start of sales: November 10, 2016 <br>  Processor: 8-core x86-64 AMD "Jaguar" <br>  RAM: 8GB GDDR5 <br>  Graphics chip: 4.20 TFLOPS, AMD Radeon <br>  Hard Drive: 1 TB <br>  Connectors: one AUX line input, three super speed USB 3.1 Gen.1 ports <br>  Network: Ethernet port, Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac, Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  Drive: BD / DVD <br>  Power supply: AC 100V, 50 / 60Hz <br>  Power consumption: max.  310W <br>  Video output: HDMI with 4K / HDR support, digital (optical) output <br></div></div><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YO2ImSnGDlw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Exterior and Ports</font> </h2><br>  The device turned out to be large: it is much larger than the usual PS4, and only slightly inferior to the well-fed Xbox One.  Due to the size of the company, it was possible to insert an extra USB port here and increase the power connector on the rear panel.  Now he is almost like a PC here.  But to install games on an external hard drive, as in the Xbox One, it is still impossible. <br><br>  The simple PS4 was divided into two distinct fragments, between which ran a thick black line.  What to hide, it looked very cool.  In PS4 Pro, without thinking twice, they decided to stick another piece on top.  The prefix has become a three-tier.  If you look at the PS3 -&gt; PS4 -&gt; PS4 Pro conversion history, you get the feeling that Sony is creating a sandwich. <br><br><blockquote>  On this occasion, the mass of memes is already roaming the network: it‚Äôs clear that in the fifth version of these ‚Äúcake layers‚Äù there will be four, and then - incrementally. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/525/7c8/1c0/5257c81c0d434708a0780915f99159bb.png"><br><br>  Buttons in front are now physical, instead of sensory.  They were made larger and divided so that they would not accidentally miss a finger at night. <br><br>  Two USB ports are well suited for recharging controllers, the rear USB connector is designed for PS VR virtual headsets.  Near the HDMI interface is the output for the camera, the Ethernet input and the optical audio port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d2/c43/72a/0d2c4372a0304ad5b5737c97163c3d9e.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Interface</font> </h2><br>  There are almost no changes in the interface.  This is the same inner beauty of the PS4, only adapted to the clarity of 4K and visually enhanced with HDR.  The console is an accelerated adapter Wi-Fi 802.11a (useful when downloading games in the future weighing 100 GB +).  SATA III interface is supported for a hard disk with a bandwidth of 600 MB / s.  But the prefix still does not know how to play 4K-content with blyureya.  High definition video can only be downloaded online.  If the Internet is weak or there is no access to suitable services, the main feature of the console disappears.  But the PlayStation 4 Pro beats its predecessors as streams and videos.  You can record your game adventures in 1080p at 60 fps. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Iron</font> </h2><br>  The graphics processor runs twice as fast, the CPU is faster, games are available 1 GB more real RAM.  Productivity PS4 Pro - 4,2 teraflops.  This is again 2.28 times more than the PS4. <br><br>  Understandably, such a monster generates a lot of heat, and it all comes out from the back of the console.  In the room where they play with the PS4 Pro all day long, there is definitely no need for a heater ... Plus, this or a minus is hard to say, but at least the fans are noisy about the same as that of the Xbox One / PS4, which means you can live. <br><br>  And here's an interesting detail: <blockquote> the power of the set-top box has increased 2 times, but the transition from Full HD (1080 pixels horizontally) to 4K (from 4000 pixels) requires a fourfold increase in power, otherwise the system will not cope with processing all this beauty.  Math doesn't fit ... </blockquote><br>  Sony responds that the AMD Polaris architecture gives it some kind of hidden reserve.  And for the most difficult games, where the processor is not enough, a new drawing method will be used, with neat upscaling.  On the eye of the "natural" 4K can not be distinguished.  On those games that have already been adapted to the new console, the difference between Full HD and 4K in static frames is immediately visible, so there is no catch from Sony. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">What to play</font> </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDTaxlyMWwk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is clear that the console needs taytly its level, otherwise it is just a piece of iron.  So far, no new games for PS4 Pro have been announced.  Sony threw all its strength into remastering the most popular options that already exist for the PS4 - now they will be available in 4K and HDR.  Games received graphical updates, and for some it is possible to transfer save files to a new console.  So far, so adapted 45 games, including Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Dishonored 2, FIFA 17, Mafia III, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Smite, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Titanfall 2 and many others.  The full list, with constant updates, is in the Sony blog. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kdyg3Dfx54" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  By the end of 2016, the corporation promises to transfer Watch Dogs 2, Final Fantasy XV, Killing Floor 2 and The Last Guardian games to PS4 Pro.  In early 2017, Resident Evil 7, For Honor and Nioh will increase their resolution. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">The virtual reality</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abf/58b/d2a/abf58bd2a9bc4ce8ac4fb8a6211c2252.png"><br>  The prefix serves as an ideal platform for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DE9DY8S/ref%3Dpd_sim_63_3%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pd_rd_i%3DB01DE9DY8S%26pd_rd_r%3D8N5DT971ZFP4E13P0N02%26pd_rd_w%3DuwjzQ%26pd_rd_wg%3DPYSkb%26refRID%3D8N5DT971ZFP4E13P0N02%26th%3D1">PlayStation VR</a> virtual reality helmet, which has the greatest chances of success due to the relatively low cost ($ 399) and the release of the device "under it".  The load for the games in the helmet, in good quality and without falling of the frame rate can only be sustained by local iron.  The headset will not slow down here, and the movement joysticks will work more precisely.  True, the VR system cannot handle HDR-quality video, since Sony did not install several graphics accelerators (the price of the device was rather big).  You have to choose: either HDR or VR. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX4-GGUzpdI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">About picture quality.</font>  <font color="#ff8300">HDR and 4K</font> </h2><br>  Sony is offended when reviewers say that all that is in PS4 Pro is 4K.  From a firm's point of view, HDR technology is almost as important here, it's just harder to evaluate.  The bottom line is that with the new image processing technology, the image becomes more realistic, almost like in real life.  The black color becomes really black rather than grayish, other colors have more shades and nuances.  In general, Sony talked a lot about HDR at its conference, and it is obvious that the technology is good - all TV manufacturers are now introducing it.  But in practice, the untrained eye is unlikely to notice the differences.  Even if you put the screens next to each other, the brain does not feel big changes. <br><br>  4K is still much more visible, especially when viewed on a 4K TV.  Objects in the distance look much clearer, you can discern fine details in the grass and trees, you can see some wrinkles on the faces of the characters.  True, as soon as the dynamic scene begins, and chaos begins to occur on the screen, the advantages of high definition also become invisible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/92e/f9e/dee92ef9eca24782adce13199ae960cd.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Pros PS4 Pro:</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  best performance </li><li>  free upgrade of old games </li><li>  a noticeable improvement in pictures with 4K resolution </li><li>  good job with PS VR helmet </li><li>  another year before the release of the new console from Microsoft, but on something you need to play. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Cons PS4 Pro:</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  HDR will be felt only by connoisseurs. </li><li>  Full HD 4K-resolution cannot be seen on TVs with Full HD clarity, and such TVs are the majority </li><li>  no 4K blues, content needs to be searched and streamed or downloaded </li><li>  Some games have not yet been updated, and the old and the little-known ones will hardly ever get 4K support. </li><li>  not one hundred percent "scary" 4K, Sony slightly cheats. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/708/0cb/ae67080cb4c04da79d35623236bc5eb3.png"><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">And in short ...</font> </h2><br>  Do I need a PlayStation 4 Pro at all?  If you have a PS VR - definitely needed.  If you have a 4K TV - yes, you need it, it makes sense to replace your old console with it.  But if you don‚Äôt have such a TV, it‚Äôs better not to spend money and wait for Microsoft to show us with the Scorpion project next year (according to rumors, there will be 6 teraflops, and a bunch of new games as well).  On a simple TV, the charms of PS 4 Pro cannot be felt, and an upgrade is not necessary at all. <br><br>  In Russia, the PlayStation 4 Pro is sold for 35 thousand rubles, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LOP8EZC%3Ftag%3Dprice124490d-20%26ascsubtag%3Dwtbs_5824448e7ff98d326750e986%26th%3D1">in the US - 35% cheaper</a> (for $ 399 or 26000 rubles).  The same story with the PlayStation VR headset: we have it - 35 thousand, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DE9DY8S/ref%3Dpd_sim_63_3%3Fie%3DUTF8%26pd_rd_i%3DB01DE9DY8S%26pd_rd_r%3D8N5DT971ZFP4E13P0N02%26pd_rd_w%3DuwjzQ%26pd_rd_wg%3DPYSkb%26refRID%3D8N5DT971ZFP4E13P0N02%26th%3D1">in US online stores</a> - $ 399.  As usual, buying equipment in Russia is a trauma for the wallet.  <a href="https://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_PS4%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Banderolk</a> will help alleviate suffering: you buy new items in the US, we quickly deliver them, and with the money saved you can buy a couple of good games or send them to a 4K TV box. <br><br> <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/user/register%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_PS4%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/1f7/02d/b081f702d699411cbfd09b649e7f4258.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399153/</a></p>
