And also considered alternative options.

      In this part, I will try to most clearly describe what real value is.  And then, I hope, it will become clear why the existing money cannot be a value (that is, it cannot be a reliable means of accumulation due to their lack of security). <br><br>  And so, we will continue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  From everything written in the previous section, it follows that a new reliable payment system should be offered with clearly defined emission rules.  But the question is how to distribute new money in the system?  In Bitcoin it is distributed, one might say, randomly - it does not suit me.  You need something better than a stupid selection of a beautiful hash. <br><br>  At first I thought to distribute new money among the participants of the system evenly, but everyone can add millions of wallets.  So this is not an option.  Then I wondered for a long time that you could somehow tie up the data transfer and distribute new money as a reward for ensuring the data transfer in the system (that is, actually paying for the Internet to work).  To do this, mentally sorted out the options with encrypted packets (I2P) and scoring some points for the transfer of a certain number of packets with confirmation of delivery from the recipient.  But I considered all the options - they were all good for nothing.  The system can be made, but by agreement a dozen nodes will simply generate empty traffic with a wrap of points. <br><br>  Now I have an idea how to distribute the new money in the most fair and correct way (to issue).  But before describing the essence of the system, you need to decide what value is there at all. <br><br><h4>  What is the value? </h4><br>  I propose to draw attention to labor * (or rather, to the result of labor), as to a truly real value.  But how to evaluate the work?  Evaluate the amount of energy energy spent or the amount of time spent is not.  To implement this idea you need to use a crowdfunding system.  That is, to distribute new money for the implementation of real projects that people need. <br><br>  * Wikipedia: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D2%25F0%25F3%25E4">Labor</a> - appropriate, conscious human activity, aimed at meeting the needs of the individual and society. <br><br>  In Marx's work there is the concept of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">surplus value</a> (or rather, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">surplus value</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4">surplus labor</a> ).  The meaning of Marx's surplus value is that the final value of the goods produced consists of the value of the material resources spent on the production of this commodity and some surplus value.  The surplus value here is the labor of the worker. <br><br>  At the same time, the labor of a worker, on the one hand, is sort of like the cost of 1 hour of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">labor</a> in the market for workers in this specialization.  The cost of labor is determined, like the cost of any other commodity, by the costs of its production. <br><blockquote>  "... I ... have to hit you," he says, "a statement that will seem like a paradox to you ... There is no such thing as COST OF WORK in the usual sense of the word ... What a worker sells is not his work directly, but is his WORK POWER, which he places under the temporary order of the capitalist. " <br>  <a href="http://www.usoff.narod.ru/Us1.htm">Criticism of the "Capital" of Marx</a> <br></blockquote><br>  But on the other hand, labor is not just time spent, but PUBLICALLY USEFUL efforts. <br><br><blockquote>  A surplus value is created, which is at the disposal of the capitalist.  Where does this surplus value come from?  Does not capital itself generate it, just as a hen lays eggs or how do apples grow on an apple tree? <br>  <a href="http://www.lufa-molop.ru/a8tvormdwhoko-6fqhhmf6/">Surplus value</a> <br></blockquote><br>  Among these terms and quotations, one can easily lose the meaning of surplus value.  Namely: the price (cost) and value - this is not the same thing.  I propose such a definition of the value of the result of labor (product or service): <br>  <b>Value = Cost + Incremental Value</b> <br>  Where <br>  Surplus value is a socially useful effort of the employee. <br><br>  At the same time, I would like to point out that not every work is useful and not every work is public (that is, necessary for someone else).  An example is the opposite of work - a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8">hobby</a> , as an activity that (mostly) is not a socially useful effort.  And so the hobby does not create surplus value. <br><br>  Now the question arises how to quantify socially useful work (human labor).  A very simple.  It is necessary to give other people the opportunity to evaluate the activity (or rather, the result of labor) and so it is possible to determine who worked better and who is worse and by how much.  In this case, only completed projects with a known cost can be more or less adequately evaluated. <br><br>  I note that the real value (Costs + Surplus Value) and the value suggested by advertising and other methods are, as they say, two big differences.  However, the market as a whole more or less independently balances the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the value of goods / services and the value of these goods / services imposed by marketers.  Naturally, marketers will continue to wind up value in all sorts of ways (the next new super-duper smartphone, etc.), but after some time the value of value and value is all the same balanced. <br><br>  Next, I will try to describe how to calculate surplus values ‚Äã‚Äãand how to tightly tie the issue of new money to surplus value (surplus value).  Just want to note that the new money in the issue will be provided with surplus value.  That is, in fact, they will be provided with the socially useful work that was accomplished during the implementation of the project.  Not secured money will not be! <br><br><h4>  Manifesto </h4><br>  1. The right to issue belongs to all users. <br>  2. The emitted new money is distributed only for the socially useful work performed. <br>  3. To receive the emission, you need to successfully implement a socially useful project. <br>  4. The usefulness of a project is determined by open voting. <br>  5. Voting is carried out after completion of the project for a fixed period of time. <br>  6. All users of the community can participate in the voting. <br><br><h4>  Basic principles </h4><br>  0. The main objects in the proposed system are ‚ÄúUser‚Äù (wallet, account) and ‚ÄúProject‚Äù. <br><br>  1. Ordinary payments and an issue of notes to realize approximately as in Bitcoin.  That is, once a cycle, generate a block in which to record all transactions, as well as to record transactions (transactions) for issuing new money.  One cycle, for example, may be equal to 256 seconds, which is about 4 minutes. <br><br>  2. A project in the system is a record of the fact that a particular user has created a proposal for the implementation of a useful activity with a stated amount, indicated the deadline for the collection of funds and other parameters.  The minimum and maximum time for raising funds can be limited by the algorithm.  For example, from 10,000 to 20,000 cycles, which is equivalent to an interval of 1-2 months. <br><br>  3. As you know, the most rational people distribute NOT YOUR money to NOT YOUR need.  This is a rather important psychological feature of all people.  So, if we could make it possible in the system to ‚Äúvote‚Äù for projects you like, NOT with your money, but not with money, but simply giving preference to a project, then you could count the number of ‚Äúvotes‚Äù for a project and distribute new ones. money to the authors of these projects. <br><br>  4. To reduce the influence of ‚Äúvotes‚Äù markups, you need to introduce the concept of ‚Äúvoice weight‚Äù and determine it depending on a certain indicator of ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù of the voting user.  In fact, I offer some semblance of karma, as it is implemented on Habr√©.  In this case, there will be a separate "karma" of the project and the "karma" of the user.  Having great authority and having voted for a certain project this project will add more money than the project for which the user with a small authority has voted. <br><br>  5. Emission of a certain amount of new money must be distributed among all projects in proportion to the votes received.  The issue will lead to an increase in the money supply.  Although new money will be provided with surplus value, there will still be some inflation (increase in the money supply).  At the same time, it is necessary to consider that the inflation rate is not very small, but it is not too large.  According to my personal observations, inflation at 2..15% is quite adequate.  At the same time, the more inflation - the more incentive not to keep money, but to spend it.  But inflation should not be very high, so that the money does not "shrink".  In this way, conditions will be provided so that it is not very profitable to keep a lot of money in the ‚Äúpot‚Äù.  We need a system for payments and as a platform for the development of projects, and not only as a deposit bank for savings. <br><br>  Once again, the increase in the money supply without an increase in real goods (goods and services) leads to inflation.  But in our case, the benefits are actually completed projects approved by the community.  That is, the community itself plus the project declares the work done by real value (surplus value). <br><br>  Continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179715/">KriyaMoney.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179715/">Part 3.
