      For authors who have difficulty starting work on the post, it will be incredibly useful to look at the scientific approach to the formation of habits. <br><br>  Each habit consists of three parts: <br><br><ol><li>  Signal - what starts the program. </li><li>  Combination - what actions you perform. </li><li>  Reward - what is the immediate benefit of the procedure brings you pleasure. </li></ol><br>  Put them together and get the "habit cycle". <br><br>  <b>How to develop the habit of writing.</b>  Having dealt with the loop of habit, you can use it to form new skills, no matter for writing texts or something else. <br><br>  <b>The first element</b> is the choice of a ‚Äúsignal‚Äù for writing texts. <br>  The trigger should be something that happens often. <br><br>  Many things can serve as a signal: <br><ul><li>  alarm clock; </li><li>  food intake; </li><li>  check email; </li><li>  turning on the light in the room; </li><li>  action like stretching or meditation; </li><li>  the song that you listen to until the end. </li></ul><br>  The key may be anything you wish, but try to choose the phenomenon that will occur (or you can influence it) at a certain time just before you want to start writing. <br><br>  For example, if you like writing in the morning, grab it after breakfast. <br>  Or get to work by checking your mail. <br><br>  <b>The second part</b> is a combination. <br><br>  Clearly, you already know how to write. <br><br>  The key, at least in the first month or so (the whole process takes 1-2 months), is simply to write.  Even if it takes only 5 or 10 minutes.  You are just <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-chalzom-dakhiggom-kak-sila-privychki-mozhet-pomoch-dostich-svoikh-novogodnikh-tseley/">trying to create a habit</a> . <br>  Having created a skill, write longer. <br><br>  Finally, you need <b>some kind of reward</b> . <br><br>  The biggest problem with creating a great post is that you are not receiving immediate rewards.  It may take weeks, if not months, before the publication and response. <br><br>  The long-term benefits of seo-traffic at a particular post may become noticeable only after a few months. <br>  The alternative is simple: create your own reward. <br><br>  Some simply say ‚Äúwell done, good work‚Äù. <br>  For others, the reward can be a game lasting several minutes or a small snack from a favorite dish. <br>  Find a promotion that will help to associate a letter as an action with a good result. <br><br>  Adhere to this 3-step program, and you will manage to unnoticeably form a new strong habit. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Do not strive for perfection, do so better.</font> </h2><br>  You are trying to create great content, right? <br><br>  Texts that will bring real benefits to readers. <br><br>  If so, then we congratulate you: this is exactly what marketing should look like at every opportunity. <br>  But he has another side, which is not customary to talk about. <br><br>  You can easily focus on creating such a post, which only a person can do - perfect. <br><br>  But such a desire can "freeze" the author. <br>  When perfection becomes your goal, everything that does not fit into this concept turns into failure.  Even what is done well. <br><br>  As you probably know, most people have an <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/3-uprazhneniya-kotorye-pomogut-vystoyat-v-trudnye-vremena/">innate fear of failure</a> (of different strengths). <br><br>  It is because of him that when you write a post, you freeze or get upset if the thought ‚ÄúHow can I make a text perfect?‚Äù <br><br>  But there is a solution that you can use right now. <br>  Simple strategy for productivity and quality.  To begin, understand: there is no such thing as a perfect post, and your readers do not need perfection. <br><br>  A very good article will bring about as much benefit to your public as ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù <br><br>  But what does value depend on? <br>  From content design?  <b>Little.</b> <br><br>  From the selection of words?  <b>Little.</b> <br>  From the meaning hidden in the text?  <b>To a great extent.</b> <br><br>  If you really have something to say, no matter how good a writer you are.  You can still influence people who read your text. <br><br>  The main thing is the transfer of valuable knowledge. <br><br>  This does not mean that the writing style and formatting do not play any role.  It means that you just need to concentrate on making the valuable message as clear as possible. <br><br>  And you will not be able to achieve this with the help of "perfect" words. <br>  Therefore, instead of torturing yourself, wandering for minutes in constructions and thinking over the best way to build a phrase, make each sentence as clear as possible. <br>  Simple words quickly come to mind, and it is easier for readers to understand them. <br><br>  Your goal is not to create a work of art.  You need to write something that will bring more benefits to readers, which means that they need to understand your message. <br><br>  Will it be perfect?  Well, no ... <br>  Will it be normal?  I would like to hope so, but not necessarily. <br><br>  If you write down what comes first to your mind, sometimes a completely acceptable text is obtained.  In other cases, you will carry nonsense and pour water that does not add anything to the main idea that you are trying to express. <br><br>  Would you be surprised to know that most top authors do this? <br><br>  The difference between them and average copywriters (except for practice) is in editing. <br><br>  By writing a post, you can correct it to remove all the water. <br>  Using this simple method of writing texts, you will end up with an article of higher quality than the one you could create, striving for perfection. <br><br>  1. Record everything that comes to mind. <br>  2. Take the time to edit. <br><br>  During the adjustment, seek not perfection, but clarity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Four aspects of the author‚Äôs optimal environment</font> </h2><br>  Most of what we considered before was focused on improving your approach to writing text. <br>  But we did not touch on how to create a good atmosphere for such an activity. <br><br>  Imagine how hard it would be to write if a company of noisy babies was running around you.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-sposobov-ostavatsya-sosredotochennym-v-mire-polnom-otvlekayushchikh-faktorov/">Almost impossible to concentrate</a> . <br>  And even if you do not have the opportunity to choose the perfect environment for writing texts, there are 4 simple rules, the implementation of which will simplify the creation of excellent content. <br><br>  <b>1. Create your own work space.</b>  We do not doubt, at least part of the tasks you perform at home.  But you may find yourself becoming less productive because of the space you are in. <br>  Our brain creates connections between places and actions. <br><br>  For example, we associate a bedroom with a dream.  But studies have shown: working in bed (or even just in the bedroom) weakens this association. <br><br>  Work in bed will not only lead to problems with falling asleep, but productivity will also decrease.  You will always have a strong association with sleeping in the bedroom, so do not be surprised if you feel a little tired or too relaxed while working there. <br><br>  The same concept applies to other areas. <br><br>  Do you always play in a particular room? <br><br>  Do you always communicate via Skype or go to social networks in the same place? <br><br>  Your mind creates associations between actions and premises, which means you will be more likely to do other things than to write texts in a similar environment. <br><br>  Decision?  Create a specific space used only for work. <br>  You do not need to make it too big, but it must necessarily be different from the rest of the premises, so that over time you will begin to associate it with the creation of posts. <br><br>  Gradually, you will begin to notice that working there, you begin to write automatically, without forcing yourself. <br><br>  <b>2. Breaks are not evil.</b>  It's a vicious circle.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/skrytye-posledstviya-pereryvov-vo-vremya-raboty/">You do not want to be interrupted</a> because you want to spend more time on work to increase productivity. <br><br>  But by doing this, you get tired faster, lose focus and as a result write slower, which decreases performance even more. <br><br>  In addition, because of constant sitting for a long time, back pain can occur and even deadly blood clots can form. <br><br>  Ideally, you should take short (2‚Äì5 minutes) breaks every half hour.  And do not work without rest for more than an hour. <br>  During such breaks, walk away from the computer. <br><br>  Stand and stretch or engage in something that requires movement. <br><br>  With Google‚Äôs ‚Äústretching exercises program at work,‚Äù you can find many simple courses you can try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ce/3fc/df4/0ce3fcdf46bc4b7f810b0842745d1233.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This will have a good effect on physical health and increase productivity. <br><br>  Studies have found that brief deviations from a particular task noticeably improve concentration in the following periods of work. <br><br>  <b>3. Sitting matters.</b>  When you are ‚Äúon strike‚Äù, all your attention belongs to the task that you are performing.  But if you sit in an uncomfortable chair, it will constantly distract you. <br><br>  It does not matter if we are talking about general discomfort or pain, the result will be the same. <br><br>  As an author, you probably spend at least 20 hours a week in your chair, which is almost 1000 hours a year. <br>  This is too much to bear the inconvenience, besides, it costs you a lot of productivity. <br><br>  If you have at least some opportunity, buy a nice and comfortable office chair. <br><br>  The most famous of them is Aeron from Herman Miller.  Yes, it costs a little more than $ 900, but this is one of the most comfortable and ergonomic chairs that you can use. <br><br>  Another option could be the desk. <br>  Many studies have recently revealed the dangers of long-term sitting in a sitting position.  One of them showed that people who sit (on average) more than 6 hours a day, the mortality rate is 20% higher than those who sit less than 3 hours. <br><br>  Other studies have concluded that people who have been sitting for a long time are 50% more likely to die for any reason and 125% more likely to have cardiovascular diseases (for example, heart attacks). <br><br>  One of the good options is to use the desk instead of a regular table - this will also help you maintain concentration. <br>  A word of caution: although the studies on the desks began quite recently, some of them demonstrated that standing for a long time is also harmful. <br><br>  It may be advisable to propose to implement both options, if possible, to minimize the risk to health and preserve the convenience and level of performance. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not strain your eyes.</b>  Finally, a whole day behind the monitor is a test for your eyes, especially if you work at night. <br>  A simple solution for reducing stress and eye strain is to install the free f.lux program. <br>  It changes the intensity of the glow of the screen, and this not only reduces eye strain, but also, according to some reports, helps to sleep better. <br><br>  At first it will look unnatural, but soon you will get used to it and start wondering how you lived without it before. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Although it takes time to write a great article, there is no reason why it would take all day. <br>  Most of those who write, using all the tactics from this post will get the opportunity to double or triple their results, and this is great. <br><br>  You do not need to test them all at once right now.  Identify your main problems and use the appropriate tactics from those described above to combat these particular difficulties. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-teoriya-zadach-kotorye-nuzhno-vypolnit-sposobna-izmenit-vash-podkhod-k-osmysleniyu-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">How the theory of ‚Äútasks to be done‚Äù can change your approach to understanding your own life</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298812/</a></p>
