  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian server market: real ways to save</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Habr!</b>  As shown by past ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pc-administrator/blog/263283/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pc-administrator/blog/265053/">2</a> ) articles on servers, the topic of reconditioned equipment is more than relevant.  And the current exchange rate of the ruble only warms up the interest, as evidenced by the tremendous interest in our undertakings from both the colleagues from the IT sphere and from other areas.  So we continue the topic.  If last time we talked about how the global server market is changing due to refurbished equipment and what practical savings the end customer receives, today we will say a few words about the Russian one. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36b/e3e/14e/36be3e14e79145fcbb8d2521c6ee54e2.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Year 2014. Figures</font> </h2><br>  Here's what, according to analysts at IDC, was the Russian server market by the end of 2014: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>-5.6%</b> - reduction in the supply of servers of all types; </li><li>  <b>+ 2.4%</b> - the overall growth of the server market in monetary terms; </li><li>  <b>+ 9.4%</b> - increase in the supply of Unix-servers; </li><li>  <b>$ 926 million</b> is the annual volume of the server market in Russia. </li></ul><br>  As you can see, economic sanctions and the "rollback" of the economy have done their job.  The market went down.  However, exchange rate fluctuations allowed him to grow in monetary terms.  Despite this, the trend is on the face.  But more on that later.

    <h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Leaders 2014</font> </h2><br>  According to IDC, the top five leading server hardware vendors look like this: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>HP</b> </li><li>  <b>DEPO Computers</b> </li><li>  <b>Aquarius</b> </li><li>  <b>Dell</b> </li><li>  <b>Ibm</b> </li></ul><br>  In total, they "closed" 70% of the supply of new equipment.  However, there was no rapid growth.  On the contrary, sales of leaders are becoming increasingly stagnant. <br><br>  Who adds?  Chinese manufacturers.  AIC, Gigabyte, Huawei, Inspur, Lenovo - they showed the greatest growth.  This is not surprising, because with the collapse of the ruble prices for servers of top companies turned out to be biting, to say the least. <br>  Given today's realities, the situation will only get worse. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in Russia, the market for the recovered server hardware has not been properly formed (yet).  Therefore, there is no exact statistics on it.  But for our part, we can note that interest in it is growing exponentially, which, in general, is not surprising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/196/4bd/124/1964bd1244f1485f8e4a7c631690b313.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Year 2015. Figures</font> </h2><br>  But what IDC analysts tell us about the situation on the server market in the first quarter of this year: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>-44.7%</b> - market decline in unit terms; </li><li>  <b>-28.4%</b> - market decline in monetary terms; </li></ul><br>  The top five also changed, and there was a little sensation here.  Chinese Lenovo has increased sales by more than 6 times, eventually displaced Dell from fifth place in the ranking of server hardware providers!  However, it is necessary to take into account that IBM has stopped the release of servers, but now Lenovo produces the same servers. <br><br>  There are no all-Russian data on the restored servers, however, based on our own statistics, the profile for HP, Dell and IBM go in the following sequence: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>47% - Dell</b> </li><li>  <b>28% - HP</b> </li><li>  <b>20% - IBM</b> </li><li>  <b>5% - Supermicro</b> (non-core) </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/b81/d28/d29b81d28b8a465cb4777f8274207585.png" alt="image"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Perspectives</font> </h2><br>  As they say in financial markets, the outlook is negative with a tendency to further decline.  Alas, but so far all this contributes to this: a downturn in the economy, a collapsed ruble, external conjuncture ... <br><br>  According to all the same IDC analysts, the IT equipment market in Russia this year will drop at least another 8% in ruble terms.  The forecast in dollars no one dares to give due to the unstable rate. <br><br>  Naturally, the main reason for the fall is a sharp jump in prices.  Over the past 2 years, server hardware has risen in price by about 1.5 times.  Given the recent rally of the ruble down, this is not the limit, and prices for servers will soon crawl up again.  And suppliers do not hide it. <br><br>  However, Russia is not alone here.  The situation is similar in the entire Customs Union (Kazakhstan, the Republic of Belarus, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan).  We know this firsthand, and from the first hand, from partners and customers in these countries. <br>  So what is the result? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Alternative</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/a5f/a23/836a5fa231ae43c9a34daaccb98c8bda.png" align="right" alt="image">  By the way, remember, last time we talked about the fact that it was the crisis of 2008-2009 that gave a powerful impetus to the growth of the market of restored servers in the USA and Europe?  But Russia today is precisely in this situation: high-quality equipment is extremely necessary, while neither the desire nor the ability to overpay for it is not.  And here the restored equipment enters the arena.  After all, with it you get a product of the same quality as the new one, but much cheaper.  As it has already been said more than once, refurbished solutions are famous for the fact that they are almost as good as new solutions, which confirms the long warranty period (up to 5 years).  However, with a guarantee of a special story.  Having studied the experience of the main players in the market of refurbished equipment from the USA, we work according to the principle - we solve warranty cases directly at the client.  And believe me, we do it very quickly. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Is it worth it?</font> </h2><br>  Many customers of our <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">company</a> appreciated the level of service and the benefits they receive when buying refurbished - equipment. <br><br>  Below are two simple comparisons of new solutions and recovered ones: <br><br>  <b>Example 1:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/1f4/d81/07f1f4d812894986a5c68f1f53812d4e.jpg"><br>  <b>Savings:</b> ‚âà from 283,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Example 2:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17c/7e5/35e/17c7e535e68546f1a892578ea2739f52.jpg"><br>  <b>Savings:</b> ‚âà from 83 000 rubles <br><br>  We think you will make your own conclusions.  On this we have today. <br><br>  <i>And, as usual, we are waiting for questions in the comments.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265475/</a></p>
