However, we all know what subjective opinion is.  Therefore, it is not always the article that caused a storm of delight from one user and recommended them for reading without fail will be of interest to everyone else.  The collective mind, no matter how abused it is for its eyes, is always much more objective in its assessment than one, even the most developed brain. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then we had an idea: to create a resource where collective intelligence will dominate, accumulating clever thoughts and useful articles. <br><br>  <b>There is a task.</b>  <b>How to implement?</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After thinking about possible options, it was decided to develop the idea in 2 directions: blogs and tips. <br><br><img src="http://system.tryto.ru/upload/paren1.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  <a href="http://tips.rindo.ru/">Tips</a> is a webmaster tutorial.  All the same three sections (creation, promotion and earnings) will consistently receive the necessary information.  We have undertaken all the work on creating favorable conditions for filling the system with useful things.  Useful things are the task and privilege of our users. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tryto.ru/">Blogs</a> have become a place where everyone can write an article that turned out to be useful or interesting for him, and which could be useful to other users.  If users rated the article, then the further path of the article passes through the moderator. <br><br>  By the way, the article will not be published without the consent of the author: after checking the article by the moderator, a letter is sent with a unique link to the author's box.  If the author agrees, he follows the link and adds the address of his site (a nice bonus). <br><br>  The article appears in the boards, the author receives universal recognition and a link to his site, and the webmaster a useful article. <br><br>  <b>Blogs?</b>  <b>IT blogs?</b>  <b>One more ?!</b> <br><br>  Yes.  One more blogs, but which are radically different from Habr and other similar services.  We have no advertising, no companies, no personal blogs, no karma.  And this is not lifejournal. <br><br><img src="http://system.tryto.ru/upload/paren3.jpg" align="right" alt="image">  There are 12 sections, each section contains thematic blogs.  These blogs are created by users who reach a certain rating.  Rating is an indicator of the strength and dexterity of your mind and experience.  A 3rd level domain is assigned to a blog, which simplifies access to the information you are looking for, eliminating the need to constantly view the entire diversity of blogs and posts. <br><br>  Blogs Truto is a non-profit project.  On the pages of the Truth Blogs you will not see banners and ‚Äúsales‚Äù menu items, nor will we sell articles. <br><br>  Freeing users from annoying and annoying ads, we went further, giving them free speech and registration.  We have no effect on the content of the site, tracking only violators of the user agreement.  What we do with them is a separate topic, but in general we are humane and reasonable.  Otherwise, write everything that seems to you worthy of publication, as long as the other users appreciate it. <br><br>  As a bonus, Blogs Truto offer to make money on their articles.  We will allow every author and blog owner to do this.  To each.  Inside each page will be placed a block of contextual advertising and the author will receive 90% of the "clicked".  The remaining 10% will go not to us (as you might think), but to the owner of the blog.  So you have 2 ways: to write, write and write again, or become the owner of a blog, promote it and encourage others to write in your blog. <br><br><img src="http://system.tryto.ru/upload/paren2.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>What are we all about?</b> <br><br>  I would like to hear constructive criticism from habrasoobschestva. <br><br>  And get help filling out tips for web developers. <br><br>  If you want to see the authors of this project on Habr√©, then those who wish to send an invite write to the PM </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95374/</a></p>
