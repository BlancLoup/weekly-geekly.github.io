      In the beginning was the number.  And this number started at 8-800. <br>  Such is every medium-large office, it is necessary <i>for direct communication and emphasizes the customer focus of your company</i> - any marketer will tell you.  For all calls coming to such a number the company pays.  And sometimes seven-figure amounts. <br>  We sell such numbers ourselves - do we not know? <br>  Calls come to 8-800 from PSTN, intercity or from mobile - therefore they cannot be cheap at all. <br>  You are melons!  Idea!  And what if you try to bring calls to the company through SIP?  It will turn out much cheaper.  Yes, almost all free! <br>  But how?  Via softphones?  Through a web interface with a browser extension? <br>  No, not that.  Quickly came to the conclusion that you need: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2. Application for mobile</b> <br><br>  Probably, you need to be a very strong-willed and principled person in order not to get into digital networks and today do not use a smartphone.  Always on hand mail, calendar, messengers, scheduler, tudu list, social networks and camera ... But what am I telling you?  You know yourself. <br>  And since we all already have smartphones, you can make an application that will call via SIP.  The application can be made for any company that will distribute it to their customers.  Free, of course.  In essence, an application is a button, clicking on which a customer calls to his company.  Simple, fast and free for the customer.  Many times cheaper for the company. <br>  There is a minus - a call via the Internet works, of course.  That is, traffic will eat. <br>  But there is a plus - you can call not only from Russia, but from all over the world.  When traveling, it‚Äôs enough to find free Wi-Fi or buy a local SIM card with inexpensive 3G. <br>  Want to call your tour operator from Brazil, for example?  Is free?  Through the hotel Wi-Fi can, yes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/c64/5a9/09ec645a9b2f4344be21f645b58b62d6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Trial of the pen</b> <br><br>  In application development, we were no longer novices.  The process is clear - we drew the interface, screwed the button.  They tested it on themselves, straightened it, remade it, twirled it, processed it with a file.  We learned how to quickly finish applications under the corporate identity of the customer - the logo, colors, that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d1/5ab/f3d/3d15abf3d39442d1bdbcf922d074b839.jpg"><br><br>  Began to sell slowly.  And collect reviews. <br>  Everything?  It was not there. <br><br>  <b>4. What to add?</b> <br><br>  - Guys, you have a whole application, and can only call the company!  Weak something else to screw? <br>  So said in the AppStore when you post there Hotline. <br>  And, really, we thought.  Let's add something.  For example, feedback.  From company to customer. <br>  Incoming call?  No, better message.  For sure.  Push messages that come from the company to the client‚Äôs application.  With the necessary information that will remain and can be viewed again. <br>  Great, we do.  General messages for all customers with an installed application - good.  But what about personalization?  The only option is to log in.  The easiest way to mobile number.  So we have a registration number.  Maybe not very convenient - but the company can send personal messages.  Protected to the same.  Banks, for example, send messages about transactions.  And ok. <br><br>  <b>5. On the other hand</b> <br><br>  When the client had the application with one button, the company had enough any PBX and call center operators to handle incoming calls.  But when messages appeared, it became clear that an interface was needed to send them.  Once the interface for messages is still going to be done, it is possible to draw immediately for processing incoming calls.  To not get up twice.  This is how the operator interface appeared.  In it you can now see the queue of calls, put on hold, answer and forward calls to colleagues and send messages.  It works through a web interface, that is, call center employees can work remotely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/387/0c6/10d3870c6160454a91cb7c72b89845c1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What is the result?</b> <br><br>  We offer companies a service that complements the existing 8-800 number and SMS messaging.  Cheaper at times.  With its call center interface and application interface in the company's corporate style. <br>  This is how a small call center turned out from a small application. <br>  Think now all?  Not.  There are more ideas that can be altered and added.  But more about that next time. <br><br>  And yes, a link for those who want to test the Hotline Intellin: <a href="http://www.intellin.ru/service/detail/FON/"><b>right here.</b></a> <br>  Androidovody can install just from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dair.com.hotline.intellin%26hl%3Dru"><b>PlayMarket</b></a> <br><br>  Good luck everyone, see you there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292288/</a></p>
