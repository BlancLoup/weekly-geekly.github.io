In the field of design, this trend has resulted in the whole industry of UI / UX-specialists and studios, who develop special methodologies and set the structure for the creative process of finding the desired design. <br><br>  This approach allows you to justify the adoption of certain design decisions based on data - the number of transitions to complete the task, feedback from field testing, and so on.  We hold the same opinion when developing <a href="https://1cloud.ru/">our IaaS provider</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/293644/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebb/b8c/0ab/ebbb8c0ab3a54dd08cc088ba7755be38.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/yandle/3857114163/in/photolist-6SQHEk-9dYF3z-pceuNp-474RTv-o6vUDY-46NJyH-7WGpgp-pcfjyU-o8pNoF-dQkgn7-o4Aibh-781yRh-ptsnh2-6UESay-dLGcw5-fjbXo5-7XrGrk-5VwjCK-bFj5eZ-nC1mb-85aQtB-6uf9Ah-cQKcAf-bT9ugM-6SUPGL-2vyF2V-7Uj9X4-frEcrQ-7XrFUB-ciuuP1-7XuVCw-7XuV7A-46RHB4-nP9mGJ-iiKsy1-8kMyaw-4eXTtX-o6vUqw-7XrGMD-4VguA1-e6vGNu-765aeY-6cKy8L-2iaJFi-8aNN4g-bRjj4k-7WGmpa-6Juv6q-o4AhZW-85aPPV">photo by yandle cc</a>

    <h3>  Where to begin </h3><br>  As soon as we started work, we faced obvious difficulties that arose among non-specialists in the field of IT.  Our support service was overwhelmed with appeals and questions. <br><br>  This problem prompted us to actively work on the creation of practical materials and manuals.  A blog on Habr√© in a similar way helps us share the experience of service upgrades, which makes our work understandable and transparent to customers. <br><br>  Here you need to understand that in advance it is impossible to create universal solutions that suit all groups of users.  The optimization process begins after launch and goes on constantly. <br><br>  At the start of the project, managers love to extol its complexity and boast about the number of lines of code, or vice versa - emphasize minimalism.  Here it is necessary to find a balance, because the client does not care about these details - he needs to solve his problems. <br><br>  For this, most customers already have familiar tools.  Not many people will want to switch to something new if they are not sure that it really works, and not just looks like something fashionable and technologically complex. <br><br>  It is very important to provide the user of your product or service with a familiar environment.  This technique is used by developers of many applications, including for working with documents, focusing on the interface of popular packages from Microsoft.  This approach helps to reduce the time to learn a new service and reduce the level of customer stress. <br><br><h3>  Attention to detail </h3><br>  One of our main principles of work is that we are working to provide simple and understandable tools, which even those who have not previously encountered the topic of IT infrastructure can understand. <br><br>  To this end, we have developed utility services that speed up the installation and configuration process.  For example, you can deploy a new server in just a couple of minutes and for this you will not need to write a huge number of commands and configure something. <br><br>  In a number of our products, we have implemented pre-installed packages that allow you to immediately customize the contents of your website, if all you need is to create a business card site. <br><br>  In addition, we have implemented a special calculator right on the main page.  It allows you to quickly determine how much resources you need, and to understand the level of costs for the rental of these facilities. <br><br>  The interface of a product or service is something that people work with over and over again.  It cannot be replaced solely by marketing.  One way or another, few people will be hindered by openness and regular exchange of experience with the community.  This helps to understand what really needs to be implemented, and which part of the interface you can simply refuse. <br><br>  PS A little about the work of the virtual infrastructure provider <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/">1cloud</a></b> : <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/281889/">How to create a virtual infrastructure provider: Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/280748/">Client-oriented "cloud": Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278479/">Photo tour of the "cloud" of 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278055/">A little about data storage and experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/277155/">UI Optimization: Experience 1cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293644/</a></p>
