The conference is aimed at professionals in the field of software development in Java.  Participants are expected by more than 30 reports from Java-development gurus in Russian and English, the stands of leading companies in the field of Java-development and a free communication zone where you can chat with friends and colleagues or just relax. <br><br>  What awaits participants: <br><ul><li>  October 14: master classes </li><li>  October 15: 4 tracks, 30 reports </li><li>  October 16: closed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">Unconference</a> ! </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br>  At the moment, the conference program is formed by about three quarters.  We offer you a <b>preliminary</b> program of reports from among those already approved by the <s>severe Java-fascist</s> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/real_ales/" class="user_link">real_ales</a> .

    <h4>  What we guided </h4><br>  A few simple rules: <br><ul><li>  the first hall is the largest, which means we put the most popular reports in it (according to the results of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/codefreeze/blog/192594/">survey in the Habr√©</a> and in our newsletter); </li><li>  reports are divided into pairs, there are small breaks within the couple, and between the pairs - large ones, so that the people can communicate; </li><li>  reports within the couple should be close to the subject in order to minimize the likelihood that inside the couple people will move from room to room and will not have time to go somewhere; </li><li>  you need to start no earlier than 10:00, and finish no later than 19:00.  In this case, 8 reports should fit into the track. </li><li>  keynotes, many do not like, so nafig it.  Better shove more reports instead! </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Tickets </h4><br>  The ticket price is <b>5000 rubles</b> in case the organization buys it (legal entity).  If the organization does not want to pay the employee a ticket, and he himself buys a ticket for his money, then we give him a small discount: the cost of a ticket for individuals is <b>4,000 rubles</b> .  In addition, a discount for tickets is received by representatives of sponsoring companies. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  To whom </th><th>  how many </th><th>  Where can one buy </th></tr><tr><td>  Individuals (we buy ourselves) </td><td>  4000 rubles </td><td>  <b><a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/71718/">here</a></b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Legal entities (buys office) </td><td>  5000 rubles </td><td>  <b><a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/79511/">here</a></b> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  We have already tried this method (different prices for legal entities and individuals) at <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">JPoint</a> .  Practice has shown that some <s>unfamiliar</s> offices give direct instructions to their employees to buy tickets as physical persons, and then return them to the cost of the ticket.  To run after such offices and grab them by the hand, we probably will not - we have a lot of other things :) <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  All 4 tracks will be recorded on video.  Whether we will give access to this video to anyone who wishes is not yet clear.  On the one hand, our greed tells us that if the video is not published in the public domain or stupidly not removed, then <s>we</s> will <s>be the fourth to</s> get more people to the conference.  On the other hand, we are well aware that it may be too expensive for people from other cities to spend 2-3 business days on our conference (plus train / plane, plus hotel). <br><br>  Video recording of all conference reports will be exactly available to conference participants.  Perhaps for the rest it will be paid.  Let's take a closer look. <br><br><h4>  Master Classes </h4><br>  The day before the conference, October 14, some of our speakers will hold paid workshops.  Some of them are worth tangible money (7000 p.), And some - mere pennies (1000 p.).  Initially, the idea was to make the latter free at all, but it became unclear how to regulate the number of people.  Here is the logic: <br><ul><li>  the number of places at master classes is always limited, which means that registration for master classes should be closed as soon as the places run out. </li><li>  The practice of meetings <a href="http://jug.ru/archive">JUG.ru</a> and <a href="http://codefreeze.ru/">CodeFreeze</a> shows that 40 to 70 percent of registered users come to free events.  Thus, it is not clear how many people will come.  Moreover, on a weekday. </li><li>  Participants of master classes should be placed somewhere (rent a hall) and something to feed.  Hall rental and food cost money :) </li><li>  Finally, when a person pays (especially from his own pocket, and not from the pocket of his office), then he begins to take a responsible attitude to the training.  In particular, to do more, listen and record and less blunt the phone or sleep. </li></ul><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Who conducts </th><th>  Theme </th><th>  Cost of </th></tr><tr><td>  Pawe≈Ç Lipi≈Ñski </td><td>  <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/77345/">Test Driven Development in Java</a> </td><td>  7000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  Yevgeny Borisov </td><td>  <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/80445/">Spring 3.2 - we dig to the core</a> </td><td>  7000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  Evgeny Krivosheev </td><td>  <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/80808/">Designing Reasonable Architecture</a> </td><td>  7000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  Gil tene </td><td>  <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/81231/">How NOT to Measure Latency</a> </td><td>  1000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  Nikolay Chashnikov </td><td>  <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/77346/">Working at IntelliJ IDEA for professionals</a> </td><td>  1000 rubles </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>  Unconference </h4><br>  And now the fun part!  The day after the Joker conference, that is, October 16, will be <b>Joker Unconference</b> . <br> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/34e/db4/a07/34edb4a079f8b1c9e6a5b97bcae7994c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Unconference</b> is an event where the participants themselves form topics for discussion.  We organize the space in such a way that <br><ul><li>  Any participant will be able to suggest any topic related to Java for discussion.  For example, write it on some kind of common board; </li><li>  members will be able to vote for topics they like.  For example, putting positive signs on the above-mentioned board opposite to topics of interest to them; </li><li>  as soon as a certain number of people are recruited (for example, 10 people) who want to discuss a particular topic, everyone wishing to listen or participate in the discussion goes to the nearest table, take seats and begin to discuss the topic; </li><li>  each such situational discussion is assigned a moderator who keeps track of the timing and that the participants <s>do not sleep</s> do not leave from the given topic; </li><li>  all this tops lasts from 11 am to 6 pm with a lunch break; </li><li>  closer to 5 pm begin to pour, and of course </li><li>  it all ends with a grand drunk! </li></ul><br><br>  This will be a private event, the entrance to which will be carried out strictly by invitation.  Invitations will receive or have already received <br><ul><li>  all speakers of past meetings JUG.ru and CodeFreeze; </li><li>  everyone who helps us do JUG.ru; </li><li>  JPoint speakers; </li><li>  Some of the participants in the August OpenJDK TestFest; </li><li>  Joker conference participants who our speakers will want to see at the Unconference. </li></ul><br>  The last point means the following.  Each speaker of the Joker 2013 conference will have 3 or 4 invitations to the Unconference, which he will distribute as he pleases.  Here is what each speaker can do with his wildcards: <br><ul><li>  give to friends </li><li>  give to colleagues </li><li>  hand over to the first comer </li><li>  play the lottery </li><li>  give the conference participants who will ask interesting questions </li><li>  give a pretty girl </li><li>  sell for money </li><li>  to burn </li></ul><br>  Actually, this is the main intrigue for me personally.  How many people will come to the unconference on Wednesday?  What kind of people will they be?  What will they talk about?  Will they be satisfied <s>or will they have to smoke</s> ?  I do not know yet.  But I think it will be cool! <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  We have been preparing the Joker conference since the beginning of July, and we are spending a huge amount of time and effort on it.  And we will be very happy to see you all on it!  Come - it will be interesting! <br><br> <a href="http://jokerconf.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2f6/ce1/581/2f6ce1581fcdc83e89eee3373d121775.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193856/</a></p>
