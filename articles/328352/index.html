The article can be useful even for experienced developers, because they also make such mistakes as support for very heavy settings or name conflicts in static resources. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Django is a free, open source network Python framework that helps solve common problems in development.  It allows you to create flexible, well-structured applications.  In Django, there are already many modern features out of the box.  For example, for me, features such as Admin, the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, Routing and Templating, make Django the first candidate for choosing a development tool.  Creating an application requires a lot of effort, and enjoying my work, like any developer, I want to spend as little time as possible on routine tasks.  Django helps a lot with this without sacrificing the flexibility of the application. </p><br><p>  Django's killer feature is a powerful configurable admin interface that is automatically (automagically?) Generated based on your model's scheme and admin models.  You feel like a magician.  Using the Admin interface, a user can configure many things, including an access control list (access control list, ACL), permissions and actions at the row level (row-level), filters, sort orders (orders), widgets, forms, additional URL helpers and more.  I believe that the admin needs every application.  It is only a matter of time when such a panel will be needed by your main application.  In Django, it is created quickly and conveniently. </p><br><p>  Also in Django there is a powerful ORM, working out of the box with all the major databases.  It is "lazy": unlike other ORMs, it accesses the database only as needed.  It has support for basic SQL statements (and functions) that you can use from your source Python code along with all the other features of the language. <br>  Django has a very flexible and powerful templating engine.  Many standard <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/builtins/">filters and tags</a> are available, you can also create your own.  Django supports other engines as its own templates, provides an API for easy integration with other engines through standard shortcut-functions for processing templates. </p><br><p>  The framework has many other important features, such as a URL router, which parses incoming requests and generates new URLs based on the routing scheme.  In general, Django is pleasant to work with, and when you need help, just read the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">documentation</a> . </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--1-ispolzovanie-dlya-proektnyh-zavisimostey-globalnogo-okruzheniya-python">  Mistake # 1. Using Python Global Environment for Project Dependencies. </h2><br><p>  Do not use the global Python environment for your project's dependencies, because this can lead to dependency conflicts.  Python cannot work with multiple versions of packages at the same time.  This will become a problem if different projects need different, incompatible versions of the same package. </p><br><p>  Usually this error is made by newcomers to Python and Django development, who are not aware of the isolation features of the Python environment. </p><br><p>  There are many ways to isolate the environment, the most common are: </p><br><ul><li>  <strong><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtualenv</a></strong> : a python package that generates a folder with the environment.  It contains a script for (de) activating the environment and managing the packages installed in it.  This is my favorite and easiest method.  I usually create an environment closer to the project folder. </li><li> <strong><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtualenvwrapper</a></strong> : a Python package that globally installs a set of tools for creating / deleting / activating, etc. virtual environments and provides access to this set.  All environments are stored in one folder (it can be rewritten using the WORKON_HOME variable).  I see no advantage in using <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> instead of <code>virtualenv</code> . </li><li>  <strong>Virtual machines</strong> : there is no better isolation than a whole virtual machine dedicated to your application.  There are plenty of tools available, for example <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (free), <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> , <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> and <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> (my favorite, there is a free version).  Combined with a virtual machine automation tool like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant,</a> this can be a very powerful solution. </li><li>  <strong>Containers</strong> : in recent years, I have been using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> in almost every project, especially in new projects starting from scratch.  Docker is an incredible tool with many features.  A bunch of third-party tools are available for its automation.  Docker has layer caching, which allows you to recreate containers extremely quickly.  In them, I use the global Python environment, because each container has its own file system and projects are isolated at a high level.  Docker allows new team members to quickly begin work on a project, especially if they have experience with this technology. </li></ul><br><h2 id="oshibka--2-otsutstvie-privyazki-zavisimostey-v-fayle-requirementstxt">  Mistake number 2. No dependency binding in the requirements.txt file </h2><br><p>  Each new Python project must begin with a <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">requirements.txt</a> file and a new isolated environment.  Usually you install all packages with <code>pip/easy_install</code> , without forgetting the <code>requirements.txt</code> .  It is usually easier ( <strong>perhaps more</strong> correctly) to deploy projects on servers or on team members' machines. </p><br><p>  It is also important in the requirements.txt file to <strong>bind</strong> (pin) specific versions of your dependencies.  Typically, different versions of a package provide different modules, functions, and function parameters.  Even in younger versions, dependency changes may be such that it breaks your package.  This is a very serious problem if you have a live project and you plan to deploy it regularly, because without a version control system your build system will always install the latest available version of the package. </p><br><p>  In production, always bind packages!  I use a very good <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools">pip-tools</a> tool for this.  It provides a set of commands to help manage dependencies.  The tool automatically generates <code>requirements.txt</code> , in which not just your dependencies are attached, but in general the entire tree, that is, the dependencies of your dependencies. </p><br><p>  Sometimes you need to update some packages in the list of dependencies (for example, only the framework or utility).  If you resort to pip freeze, then you do not know which dependencies are used by which packages, and therefore you cannot update them.  The pip-tools tool automatically binds packages according to the dependencies you attach, and so it automatically decides which packages to upgrade.  And thanks to the comments used in <code>requirements.txt</code> you always know which package came from which dependency. </p><br><p>  If you are even more careful, you can backup the source files of your dependencies.  Keep a copy in your file system, Git-folder, S3-folder, FTP, SFTP - anywhere, just to hand.  There are situations when an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4bjss2/an_11_line_npm_package_called_leftpad_with_only/d19vjcm/">exception to the list of a relatively small package breaks a large number of packages in npm</a> .  Pip allows you to download all the necessary dependencies as source files.  Read more about this by running the <code>pip help download</code> command. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--3-ispolzovanie-staromodnyh-python-funkciy-vmesto-predstavleniy-klassov-class-based-views">  Mistake number 3. Using old-fashioned Python-functions instead of class representations (Class-based Views) </h2><br><p>  Sometimes it is advisable to use small Python functions in the application file <code>views.py</code> , especially for test or utilitarian views.  But usually in applications you need to use class-based views (CBV). </p><br><p>  CBVs are general-purpose views that provide abstract classes that implement common web development tasks.  CBVs are created by professionals and cover most of the sought-after behaviors.  They have a well-structured API, and CBV will give you the opportunity to enjoy all the benefits of OOP.  Your code will be cleaner and more readable.  Forget about the difficulties of using standard Django view functions for creating lists, CRUD operations, form processing, etc. You can simply extend the suitable CBV to your view and override functions or class properties that configure view behavior (usually the function returns a property, and you can add any logic that can turn your code into spaghetti, if instead of CBV you resort to presentation functions). </p><br><p>  For example, you can use different mixins in your project that override the basic CBV behaviors: creating view contexts, checking at the row level (authorization), automating template paths based on application structures, integrating smart caching, and more. </p><br><p>  I created the <a href="https://github.com/phpdude/django-template-names">Django Template Names</a> package, which standardizes the template names for your views based on the application name and the name of the view class.  I use it every day and save a lot of time when choosing names.  Just paste the mixin into your CBV - <code>class Detail(TemplateNames, DetailView):</code> - and it will start working!  Of course, you can redefine my functions and add mobile responsive templates, other templates for user-agents or something else. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--4-napisanie-tolstyh-fat-predstavleniy-i-tonkih-skinny-modeley">  Mistake number 4. Writing "fat" (fat) representations and "thin" (skinny) models. </h2><br><p>  If you have application logic transferred from model to view, it means that the view contains code belonging to the model.  That is, the presentation becomes "thick", and the model - "thin." </p><br><p>  And you need to write "fat" models and "thin" representations. </p><br><p>  Break logic by small methods in model.  This will allow to use them repeatedly and from numerous sources (admin user interface, frontend user interface, API endpoints, numerous views).  It takes only a few lines of code, and you don’t have to copy-paste a bunch of lines.  The next time you write the functionality of sending a letter to the user, expand the model using the email function, and do not write logic in the controller. </p><br><p>  This will make your code more convenient for unit testing, because you can test your email logic in one place, rather than doing it in each controller.  Read more about this issue in <a href="http://django-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications.html">Django Best Practices</a> .  The solution is simple: write “thick” models and “thin” representations.  Start it in the next project or refactor the current one. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--5-ogromnyy-nepovorotlivyy-fayl-nastroek">  Mistake number 5. Huge, bulky settings file </h2><br><p>  Even in the new <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/conf/project_template/project_name/settings.py-tpl">Django-project settings file there</a> are a lot of these settings.  And in real projects, the file grows to 700+ lines that are difficult to maintain, especially when development, production and staging environments need different configurations. </p><br><p>  You can manually split the configuration file and create separate loaders, but I want to recommend a great, well-tested Python package <a href="https://github.com/sobolevn/django-split-settings">Django Split Settings</a> , of which I am a co-author. </p><br><p>  The package provides two functions — <code>optional</code> and <code>include</code> , which support wildcards for paths and import your configuration files into the same context.  Because of this, you can simply create configurations by declaring configuration records in previously uploaded files.  The package does not affect the performance of Django and can be used in any projects. </p><br><p>  Here is an example of a minimal configuration: </p><br><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> split_settings.tools <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> optional, include include( <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'components/base.py'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'components/database.py'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'components/*.py'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># the project different envs settings optional('envs/devel/*.py'), optional('envs/production/*.py'), optional('envs/staging/*.py'), # for any local settings optional('local_settings.py'), )</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h2 id="oshibka--6-prilozhenie-vsyo-v-odnom-plohaya-struktura-prilozheniya-i-nekorrektnoe-razmeschenie-resursov">  Mistake number 6. All-in-one application, poor application structure and incorrect allocation of resources. </h2><br><p>  Any Django project consists of several applications.  In the terminology of Django, an <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/applications/">application</a> is a Python project containing at least <code>__init__.py</code> and <code>models.py</code> .  In the latest versions of Django, <code>models.py</code> no longer needed, just <code>__init__.py</code> enough. </p><br><p>  Django applications can contain Python modules that are <a href="http://django-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications.html">specific to Django modules</a> (views, URLs, models, admin panel, forms, template labels, etc.), static files, templates, database migrations, control commands, unit tests etc. You need to break your monolithic application into small <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/reusable-apps/">reusable applications</a> with simple logic. </p><br><p>  You should be able to fully describe the purpose of the application in one or two short sentences.  For example: "Allows the user to register and activate his account by mail." </p><br><p>  It is recommended to name the project folder project and put the application in <code>project/apps/</code> .  Then put all application dependencies in your own subfolders. </p><br><p>  Examples: </p><br><ul><li>  Static files: <code>project/apps/appname/static/appname/</code> </li><li>  Template tags: <code>project/apps/appname/templatetags/appname.py</code> </li><li>  Template files: <code>project/apps/appname/templates/appname/</code> </li></ul><br><p>  Always add application names as prefixes to subfolder names, because all static folders are merged into one.  And if two or more applications have a <code>js/core.js</code> , then the last application in <code>settings.INSTALLED_APPLICATIONS</code> override all previous ones.  Once I ran into such a bug in my project and spent about six hours debugging, until I realized that another developer redefined my <code>static/admin/js/core.js</code> , because the team members implemented the custom admin panel and gave their files same names. </p><br><p>  Here is an example structure for a portal application containing many resources and Python modules. </p><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">root@c5b96c395cfb:/<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">test</span></span><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># tree project/apps/portal/ project/apps/portal/ ├── __init__.py ├── admin.py ├── apps.py ├── management │ ├── __init__.py │ └── commands │ ├── __init__.py │ └── update_portal_feeds.py ├── migrations │ └── __init__.py ├── models.py ├── static │ └── portal │ ├── css │ ├── img │ └── js ├── templates │ └── portal │ └── index.html ├── templatetags │ ├── __init__.py │ └── portal.py ├── tests.py ├── urls.py └── views.py 11 directories, 14 files</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  Thanks to this structure, you can at any time export the application to another Python package and use it again.  You can even publish it in PyPi as an open source package or move it to another folder.  You will get something like this project structure: </p><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">root@c5b96c395cfb:/<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">test</span></span><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># tree -L 3 . ├── deploy │ ├── chef │ └── docker │ ├── devel │ └── production ├── docs ├── logs ├── manage.py ├── media ├── project │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── apps │ │ ├── auth │ │ ├── blog │ │ ├── faq │ │ ├── pages │ │ ├── portal │ │ └── users │ ├── conf │ ├── settings.py │ ├── static │ ├── templates │ ├── urls.py │ └── wsgi.py └── static └── admin ├── css ├── fonts ├── img └── js 25 directories, 5 files</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  Of course, the real project will be more difficult, but such a structure simplifies and makes many aspects more transparent. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--7-staticfiles_dirs-i-static_root-smuschayut-novichkov-v-django-razrabotke">  Mistake number 7. STATICFILES_DIRS and STATIC_ROOT confuse newcomers to Django development </h2><br><p>  Static files are assets that do not change as the application is used.  For example, JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, etc. In Django, they “accumulate” in a public directory during deployment. </p><br><p>  In development mode — <code>python manage.py runserver</code> — Django searches for static files using the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/">STATICFILES_FINDERS</a> setting.  By default, it tries to find the requested file in the folders listed in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/">STATICFILES_DIRS</a> .  If it does not find it, it searches using <code>django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder</code> , which checks the <code>static</code> folder of each application installed in the project.  This scheme allows you to write reusable applications that come with their own static files. </p><br><p>  In production, you distribute static data through a separate web server, for example nginx.  It does not know anything about the structure of the Django project applications or about the folders in which your static files are distributed.  Fortunately, Django provides us with the collect static management command - <code>python manage.py collectstatic</code> , which runs through <code>STATICFILES_FINDERS</code> and copies all static files from the <code>static</code> applications folders, as well as from the folders listed in <code>STATICFILES_DIRS</code> , to the one you specified. in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/">STATIC_ROOT</a> directory.  This allows you to resolve (resolution) resources in the form of static data using the same logic as the Django server in development mode, and collect all static files in one place for the web server. </p><br><p>  Do not forget to run <code>collectstatic</code> in your production environment! </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--8-ispolzovanie-v-production-staticfiles_storage-po-umolchaniyu-i-zagruzchikov-django-shablonov">  Mistake number 8. Use in production STATICFILES_STORAGE by default and Django template loaders </h2><br><p>  Let's talk about asset management of a production environment.  We can provide the best UX if we use the “never fail to expire” policy for assets (we can read more about it <a href="https://css-tricks.com/strategies-for-cache-busting-css/">here</a> ).  This means that all our static files must be browsed for weeks, months, or even years.  In other words, users only need to download resources once! </p><br><p>  A cool idea, and it can be implemented in just a few lines in the nginx configuration for our folder with static files.  But what about checking the relevance of the cache?  If a user downloads our resource only once, what should you do if you update the logo, fonts, JavaScript or the text color in the menu?  To solve this problem, you need to generate unique URLs and names for each static file every time you deploy! </p><br><p>  To do this, you can use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/staticfiles/">ManifestStaticFilesStorage</a> as <code>STATICFILES_STORAGE</code> (be careful, hashing is enabled only in <code>DEBUG=false</code> mode) and issue the <code>collectstatic</code> command.  This will lead to a decrease in the number of requests for resources from your production-site and make its drawing much faster. </p><br><p>  Cool feature Django - cached template loader.  It does not reload and parses template files each time it is drawn.  Parsing a template is a very expensive operation, it requires a lot of computational resources.  By default, Django templates parse with every request, which is bad, especially in production, where thousands of requests can be processed in a short period of time. </p><br><p>  In the configuration section <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/api/">cached.Loader</a> you can find a good example and details of the solution to the problem.  Do not use the bootloader in development mode, because it does not reload the parsed patterns from the file system.  You will need to restart your project using <code>python manage.py startapp</code> every time you change the template.  This can be annoying during development, but ideal for a production environment. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--9-chistyy-python-dlya-utilit-ili-skriptov">  Mistake number 9. Pure Python for utilities or scripts </h2><br><p>  Django has a great feature - <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/custom-management-commands/">management teams</a> .  Use them instead of inventing a bicycle in the form of writing scripts in pure Python for the utilities of your project. </p><br><p>  Also pay attention to the <a href="https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions">Django Extensions</a> package, which is a collection of custom extensions for Django.  Perhaps someone has already implemented your team!  There are many common target teams. </p><br><h2 id="oshibka--10-velosipedostroenie">  Mistake number 10. Cycling </h2><br><p>  There are thousands of ready-made solutions for Django and Python.  Refer to the search engines before writing something that is not at all unique.  Probably already have a solution. </p><br><p>  No need to complicate.  At first - we google!  Install the quality package found, configure, extend and integrate it into your project.  And if you can, contribute to open source. </p><br><p>  Here is a list of my own Django packages to get you started: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/phpdude/django-macros-url">Django Macros URL</a> : using macros makes it easy to write (and read) URL patterns in Django applications. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/phpdude/django-template-names">Django Templates Names</a> : a small mixin that makes it easy to standardize the names of your CBV templates. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/sobolevn/django-split-settings">Django Split Settings</a> : allows you to distribute Django settings across multiple files and directories.  Easily overrides and modifies settings.  Uses wildcards in file paths and marks configuration files as optional. </li></ul><br><p>  Don't repeat yourself (DRY)! </p><br><p>  I am a supporter of the DRY-concept, so I created <a href="https://github.com/phpdude/docker-django-webpack-skeleton">Django skeleton</a> - a handy tool with a number of nice features already out of the box: </p><br><ul><li>  Docker images for developing / production, managed by docker-compose, which makes it easy to orchestrate with a list of containers. </li><li>  A simple fabric script for deploying to production. </li><li>  Configuration for the package <a href="https://github.com/sobolevn/django-split-settings">Django Split Settings</a> with the settings of the base and local sources. </li><li>  Integrated into the Webpack project - when executing the <code>collectstatic</code> command, Django will only collect the dist folder. </li><li>  All main Django settings and features like Django templates cached in production, hashed static files, an integrated toolbar for debugging, logging, etc., are configured. </li></ul><br><p>  This is a ready-to-use Django-skeleton for your next project, created from scratch.  I hope it will save you a lot of time.  Webpack has a minimal base configuration, but pre-configured .scss files are also configured using SASS to it. </p></div>
