As part of the competition, we proposed developers to come up with an idea for an innovative application or function for the Nokia Lumia 1020 based on the Nokia Imaging SDK toolkit or the native Windows Phone API for working with the camera and applications.  If you are interested in how events developed further and who became the winner, welcome to cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/639/d92/f56/639d92f563706d819008aba3b1d6a2e8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How it was? </h4><br>  By July 31, the deadline for accepting work, we received more than 1000 different ideas from developers from around the world.  Of these, the strict jury of the competition managed to select 10 finalists: four teams of two people and six singles.  Even though the contestants had to work on the same subject, all the ideas of the finalists were fundamentally different from each other in their concept.

It was he who had to decide who deserved the most victory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fd/08d/0b7/4fd08d0b72d1d6c398d1705666a3ea52.jpg"><br><br>  And on Saturday, August 31 at 9 am, the 27-hour coder marathon was launched.  The guys approached Hackathon very seriously: most of them worked on creating their own application around the clock, almost without interruption for sleep and rest.  But we helped them in this difficult task: the developers could at any time turn to Nokia experts who participated in the development of imaging technologies and related software.  In addition, each participant or team, on arrival were transferred to the new Nokia Lumia 1020, so that everyone had time to experience the functionality of the smartphone on personal experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec3/0a6/624/ec30a66249aacd54987431e6d2cce7c4.jpg"><br><br>  You can see how Hackathon went on in the <a href="http://futurecapture.tumblr.com/">blog of</a> one of the participants, as well as in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/59w7ZFMstQM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhhNl64vIG-zhyNE0oFnoigxic6JRA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Summing up the story about the contest itself, we can say that after many hours of hard work, all 10 developers managed to complete the task and create a working demo version by the end of Hackathon.  However, our jury still needed to determine who is the best of the best ... <br><br><h4>  Winners and finalists </h4><br>  Before you talk in detail about the winners and their applications, it is worth mentioning the news story that served as the reason for writing this post.  The applications of the winners and most of the finalists of Future / Capture were finalized before the final release and presented in the Windows Phone app store. <br><br><h5>  Winners: </h5><br>  The Grand Prix of the competition was given to the developers Shida Lee and Rudi Chen, friends and students of the Canadian University of Waterloo, who offered a truly unique application <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/smart-resize/d641c21c-b4dd-4cb3-93d5-1719897f5d9f">Smart Resize</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a4/042/b75/1a4042b75a7d2a65d5e7bcb864268af9.jpg"><br><br>  Using the algorithm for determining the amount of data, the Smart Resize application itself distinguishes the most and least important parts of the image, allowing users to cut off unnecessary details, while maintaining the high quality of the main elements in the image in the right size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/350/f77/ac7350f7745fa8b79541f0571dfcb311.jpg"><br><br>  The Smart Resize application is not a typical graphic editor that allows you to cut the application from one side or another.  Smart Resize users themselves choose which part of the image and which elements are important in the cropped image, regardless of their location.  After that, Smart Resize forms the final image based on the selected preferences. <br><br>  How the Smart Resize application works, as well as look at the developers themselves, on this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEZZ44ncnWI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3cUDPsO5c8PbFWO_GDH_fTWTXgQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Second places: </h5><br>  Jason Podvoiski‚Äôs <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/social-scene/e98cd5ba-a0e4-4955-a7f9-f29bf7848031">Social Scene</a> application from the geoLog UK development team redefines the concept of timelapse filming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f1/5bf/160/6f15bf160c0ec687a063f77eb5916d72.jpg"><br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis application is its ‚Äúsociality‚Äù: some users take pictures of certain places, and the rest do their bit by photographing the same places, but in other conditions.  After that, the pictures are combined in certain series, when viewing which has the effect of slow-motion filming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/359/4b1/ba63594b1302a74c3c9683a4d26451db.jpg"><br><br>  Another unusual use of this application: the creation of visual routes, for example, in order to show how to get to your organization. <br><br>  South Africa‚Äôs Matt Kavan‚Äôs RogueCode team‚Äôs TapShoot app allows you to use your smartphone as a remote camera control on another device on Windows Phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/f97/17a/52ff9717a1ccee8763c628d7921b9430.jpg"><br><br>  To combine two phones into one work circuit, the application can use both Bluetooth and NFC connection.  According to the latest trends of photo applications, TapShoot has a set of photo filters. <br><br><h5>  Applications finalists: </h5><br>  Other applications created during the Hackathon and which are available in the Windows Phone store are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ analogue application Tap Shoot - <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/remote-shot-beta/a8734b2b-21a3-4b41-b60a-1cb141a0c55f">Remote Shot Beta</a> ; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98c/aa9/63b/98caa963bb30c7a2c601cf006fcb27cc.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/panna-paint/640542df-3244-41f0-bb82-21d0a18db78b">Panna Paint</a> - the application allows you to create digital patterns based on object tracking technology; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/56d/8fe/79856d8fea55f2fdcffe52c27cb2a558.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/beetle/5b9c6145-affb-4665-9728-2489a647e663">Beetle</a> - a unique application for farmers and agronomists, allowing to identify certain types of diseases in cultivated plants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3b/533/9c0/b3b5339c04e30f7a9afd72a01415512c.png"><br><br>  If you missed the opportunity to participate in Future / Capture, then we inform you that you can try your hand at developing all kinds of applications for Windows Phone by another Nokia Create contest.
