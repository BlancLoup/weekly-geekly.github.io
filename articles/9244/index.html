And most importantly, the notoriety of the full moon is reinforced by numerous stories about werewolves and the activation of other evil spirits. <br><br>  Did you yourself not notice that people are becoming more nervous, irritated under the influence of the full moon? <br>  Often, during this period, the current working environment is disturbed.  If on ordinary days colleagues could quite calmly discuss rather controversial issues, now with the onset of the full moon even simple situations often result in serious conflicts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you can see, this is not the best time to conduct volitional decisions and put pressure on colleagues or subordinates with an unstable emotional-psychological state.  Let the full moon end.  For the signing of business contracts, the start of a new full moon business is also a short time.

      Wait for the new moon. <br><br>  Have you paid attention to reports of incidents during the full moon?  Police, firefighters and ambulance services in one voice declare that they have the hottest time.  Studies show that the general emotional background rises and this in turn is the cause of violent reactions in many people.  It is during the full moon that the peak of conflicts, accidents, fights, suicide attempts and murders. <br><br>  In other words, our emotions go out of control and overwhelm us, knocking out the usual measured life.  How to survive this time with the least loss?  Try to observe yourself, your emotions and understand how seriously the full moon has on you.  It is possible that you are one of the few who remain imperturbable regardless of the phases of the moon and the time of year. <br><br>  But, if such Olympic calm is not your strong trait, then it is better to use some tips. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Try to control your emotions, knowing the approach of the full moon. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not let others drag you into arguments and conflicts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remember that alcohol and drugs are not helpful to you in this situation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not sort out relationships with loved ones, even if it seems to you that this needs to be done urgently and immediately.  Let the full moon end. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is very useful to show tolerance and mercy towards those who have really serious problems.  Perhaps your help can have a beneficial effect not only on those to whom it is directed, but also on yourself. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If you have an operation, it is better to wait for a new moon, because  there is a danger of increased bleeding under the influence of the full moon. <br>  ‚Ä¢ During the full moon, the level of susceptibility and sensitivity of not only the nervous system, but also the whole body increases.  There is the possibility of allergic manifestations. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Full Moon - the best time for fasting with the purpose of losing weight, because  due to the increased ability to absorb, absorb our body, without getting nutrition, can burn more calories at this moment. <br>  ‚Ä¢ At full moon, seeds germinate better and produce a good harvest. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Leaders and leaders at all levels are advised not to make meaningful decisions and not to make ill-considered decrees so as not to provoke serious conflicts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ No need to tune in to the negative on the eve of the next full moon.  It is not necessary that trouble will overwhelm you every time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If everyone around you becomes, in your opinion, completely unbearable in your irritation and nervousness, retire, take pacification, listen to pleasant music, watch a good movie (better comedy), stay in nature. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Think (only calmly) that in fact the full moon is not the greatest threat to this world.  There are many other, really serious problems, but we continue to live, love and hope for the best. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9244/</a></p>
