  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stereotypes when choosing a job</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time there were people, and people had a small problem.  They could not afford to add up the prices.  Or rather, sell yourself well.  Selling well is not necessary to cheat, but just to rely on your strengths and individual characteristics.  That's when the employee is satisfied, and the employer is happy.  But alas, people couldn‚Äôt identify and realize their own strengths, but the reason was - including - some very common stereotypes. <br><br>  I propose to get rid of them slowly, and we start with those that are often discussed in Habr√©. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first stereotype.  ‚ÄúIn projects, not only generators of ideas are needed, but also performers.‚Äù <br>  No, for God's sake.  If it is meant that someone should also work, and not just gush of ideas, then who will argue.  But most often this phrase comes from the lips of all kinds of bosses and other great specialists.  That is, it is assumed that the project already has brains - it remains to collect hands.  Do we need to say that such a project awaits, at best, several months of dismal work according to the ‚ÄúI am the boss - you are a fool‚Äù scheme, and an inglorious demise with the search for the guilty?  And it is not surprising - from the very stereotype it turns out that people who do not generate ideas are recruited into the project.  And these are either vegetables, or zombies, or specialists from those for whom the project is not at all interesting.

      The second stereotype.  ‚ÄúA stylish office is an opportunity to show your individuality.‚Äù <br>  Well yes.  And chickens - as an element of culture.  Swam, we know.  What does it have to do with individuality?  Is she really showing something better on marble slabs, in the mahogany armchair?  In my opinion, people are divided into three categories - those with a bright personality;  those that ‚Äúgray mouse‚Äù - and all the rest.  But what about the office?  No, really.  Of course, it is not bad to have a thoughtful infrastructure of a modern (with a dining room, a sports section, and so on) an office, with which the designer also worked successfully (which is rare) - but let's not be confused.  The style of the office does not affect your personality in any way. <br><br>  The third stereotype.  ‚ÄúHaving a planned free working time is a contribution to the development of employees.‚Äù <br>  This is the ideal.  But in practice - this is an extra half hour on blogs and forums.  So it turns out that not every employee can, firstly, organize a self-study session for himself, and secondly, not everyone can do this, say, at the end of a rather busy day.  And the point is not that blogs are evil, but a tired employee is a fool.  The bottom line is that if you want the development of an employee, then supportive resolution and an hour in time tracking is not enough.  We need an individually agreed with the employee schedule;  maybe even a certain schedule of internal seminars ... well, you get the idea. <br><br>  Any objections?  I will ask in the comments </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128578/</a></p>
