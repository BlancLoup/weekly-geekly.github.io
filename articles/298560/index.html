I had no idea that such games and experiments with new marketing tools could result in a full-fledged project that could attract investments.  Everything, as, indeed, always, was started as an experiment on its own forces.  Having worked in the media for a long time, having moved to Israel, having studied the market, I wanted to create an interesting and useful resource, with which there will be no competition.  Or it will be insignificant, but somehow it understood that the creation of such a resource is worth a lot, and money and energy.  However, as I understood later, this should not always be the case. <br><br>  <b>But let's order</b>

      I live in Israel, I work in an office as an online marketer in the wonderful city of Tel Aviv, which, by the way, never sleeps.  In this modern metropolis there are a lot of professionals of my level and above, often there are meetings, seminars, teaching experiments and, most importantly, Israel is the second largest camp, where the frequency of start-up launches is almost equal to the number of jellyfish in August (and believe them a lot). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You can compete in this area, the main thing is to find your niche, develop a strategy, attract a good team and work, work and work again. <br><br>  Actually, I never went in this direction, it just happened. <br><br>  <b>How did it all start?</b> <br><br>  It all began with inquisitiveness, awareness and, of course, interest to derive some kind of promotion formula on the Internet.  By happy coincidence, at that time, I began to work with the college in Tel Aviv and took the lead in two full-time groups, which I successfully taught the basics of marketing and running a business.  Most of my students are businessmen who have their own business.  And we built the course for their tasks. <br><br>  But those were not all.  In order to create a live site platform, I created an online magazine about Israel, bought a template, wrote a couple of articles, and started to create a training plan for students. <br>  The first task I set was to learn how to develop the ideal strategy for a specific project.  This is what happened, for our online magazine, we derived a strategy and began to implement it, not counting on the result, much less any income. <br><br>  So, three months of work on the site, optimization and implementation of some strategic elements took place - they looked at how it works, what result it gives.  We played with different domain names, in order to understand that not all domains are well indexed, they played with content on the subject of people's reaction.  Played with the reactions. <br>  They registered the community on Facebook and did not actively develop it at all, trying to understand the relationship and impact on the index of search engines, publications in social.  Networks.  Initially, we were interested only in the technical part. <br>  Written off with some authors who gladly wrote useful articles for us.  We conducted a mini-study of current issues in Israel and created a number of articles on these topics.  I did various Internet marketing tricks, I‚Äôd not describe in more detail, I‚Äôll just say that we have not only received a positive result for all the time, and it was great. <br><br>  <b>What next?</b> <br><br>  And then we began to notice the reaction of people to the site, that our articles are gaining popularity, and the site is visited.  Began to catch interesting topics and write about them.  Some articles were scattered in an hour and scored more than 3,000 views due to the fact that they were shared by users. <br>  Our quiet joy and complacency was not side chapel.  We were not going to invest money in this experiment, more than necessary, strength, etc.  Until a man appeared on the threshold and did not offer us to find an investor. <br><br>  Thinking, considering, we agreed. <br><br>  They came to the meeting with prepared information about the project, presentation of the potential audience and possible channels of income.  They also painted a plan for the implementation of additional projects that border on ours to increase returns after the investment.  Everything went well, the investor (and he finds himself in the media understands more of ours) had fewer questions than we expected, which meant that we prepared well. <br><br>  So, after a while we had investments.  Now we are preparing a site redesign and full remarketing.  We are preparing in parallel new projects, which themselves are starting to live in our ideas and our calculated (still in time experiment) strategic plan. <br><br>  Investments do not fully cover our ambitions, but this is only the beginning, right?  Now we are simultaneously considering another investment proposal. <br><br>  I will definitely share the results and obtained skills.  The experience for me and my team is very unusual and it will probably be useful to someone. <br><br>  At the moment, I have no idea how to form the fate of our experiment, but perhaps the lack of expectations initially makes this ignorance the easiest. <br><br>  With best regards, <br>  Andrew! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298560/</a></p>
