      Recently, my friend, the father of the family, can not agree with his son about walking a dog.  In the family, it is a common practice that all family members take turns walking with the dog.  But when the turn comes to the little son, - the little boy at the first opportunity fools the parents, staying at home and saying that he was walking the dog.  There were several conversations between father and son, and the teenager as a whole explained his position: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to take responsibility for your decisions with my mother!‚Äù Parents are adamant in wanting to teach their son to take responsibility. <br><br>  Of course, the parents here are caring teachers, and the boy is a good fellow, defends his own interests ... But the dog is just a pity. <br><br>  But the good news is that if the family does not solve the issue of dog walking through negotiations, there will still be a solution anyway.  The Internet of Things (IV, Eng. IoT) will provide a family with a solution to their problem - the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRZ3Qz48lK9M">ability to walk a dog without human intervention</a> , leaving only the optional function of monitoring a dog! <br><br>  Here I would like to talk about the bright near future and about a no less interesting present, in which the benefits of IW are already commonplace, both in the consumer sector of use (as in the example above) and in the corporate-industrial segment of the application.  And in general to tell simply and accessible about the Internet of things. <br><br><h2>  From dogs to plants: The Internet of Things is a source of explosive benefits. </h2><br>  ... and here - the drone is walking the dog in 2017.  I think that very few of us in the 90s expected such a rapid development of events.  At that time <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendy">Dandy was</a> still popular, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">radio telephones</a> were a novelty, but the revolution in software development and the Internet had already begun.  The innovators of that time, looking into the future, predicted the greatness of the Internet.  How cool and incredibly exciting it was to correspond through the electrical network, being in different cities! .. And now - the drone is walking the dog in 2017. <br><br>  Living in the post-Soviet 90s, everyone was happy about the new, surprised that they live in the era of a breakthrough.  It was very cool and exciting to exchange text messages from different cities.  Innovators have found many opportunities on the Internet.  But no one suspected that breakthrough technologies would begin to change our lives as quickly as they are now.  You can not always believe your eyes when you look at the new opportunities that IV gives in our life - the real world of the Internet of things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb2/284/4b9/fb22844b9ed644108900603382311636.png" alt="Ecosystem of Consumer Internet of Things"><br>  <i>Ecosystem of consumer Internet of things.</i>  <i>Source: Plumchoise (English plumchoice)</i> <br><br>  And besides the obvious influence on our daily lives, IW represents a source of explosive benefits for business.  Moreover, - the greatest economic effect lies precisely in the field of corporate and industrial Internet of things (PIV, IIoT).  The prestigious consulting company McKinsey in 2013 included the Internet of Things (IW) in the list of breakthrough / disruptive (English disruptive) technologies, talking about the enormous influence of the Internet of Things technology on the economy.  Later, this vision was revealed in terms of economic effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e86/1d3/8e8/e861d38e835c400783e04f125885c458.png" alt="The economic effect of the introduction of technology of the Internet of things"><br>  <i>The economic effect of the introduction of technology of the Internet of things.</i>  <i>Source: McKinsey and Company (McKinsey &amp; Company)</i> <br><br><h2>  The essence of the Internet of things </h2><br>  But let's go back a step and realize the very essence of technology. <br><br>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new opportunity to massively and inexpensively connect to the information network (for example, the Internet) any physical object and control system for these objects.  Previously, the focus of IT lay on interaction through a network of PCs, servers and mobile phones, and the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) proposes to significantly expand this series to any object in which a ‚Äúprocessor‚Äù, ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù and ‚Äúsensor‚Äù are embedded.  This is not always useful, not always cost-effective, not always safe, but the range of useful applications is huge and continues to grow. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Internet of Things is likely to fundamentally change our interaction with the outside world.  The ability to electronically track and control physical objects allows you to embed data-based decision making into new activities ‚Äî optimize systems and processes, save time for people and businesses, and improve the quality of life.  From monitoring equipment in the factory to tracking ship logistics at sea ‚Äî sensors can help companies get much more from their physical assets ‚Äî improve machine performance, extend their service life, and learn how machine can be improved.  Using wearable devices and portable monitors, the Internet of Things can significantly improve the quality of healthcare services, especially in the treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes, which now cause tremendous humanitarian and economic damage. ‚ÄùMcKinsey reveals his vision (see <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%2520Functions/McKinsey%2520Digital/Our%2520Insights/The%2520Internet%2520of%2520Things%2520The%2520value%2520of%2520digitizing%2520the%2520physical%2520world/The-Internet-of-things-Mapping-the-value-beyond-the-hype.ashx">McKinsey &amp; Company. The Internet of Things: Mapping the Value Beyond the Hype</a> ). <br><br>  This picture can only be supplemented with a little more by the fact that there is an Internet of things market and where exactly the capabilities of the Internet of things apply ... <br><br>  <i>Click for full size view.</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/572/e74/827/572e748276b3453ebcd0abbe71063ade.png" alt="Corporate and Industrial Application of the Internet of Things"></a> <br>  <i>Corporate and industrial application of the Internet of things.</i>  <i>Source: Rostelecom</i> <br><br>  ... and also - what benefits does the internet of things in Russia promise us ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f7e/6eb/48d/f7e6eb48d4f24b6ea1339602964af246.png" alt="Expected benefits from the introduction of IoT"><br>  <i>Expected benefits from the introduction of IoT.</i>  <i>Source: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</i> <br><br>  The Internet of Things (IW) as a whole promises literally every citizen and every company regardless of the industry - its own set of benefits and improvements, savings and growth, the release of time and new opportunities.  Considering this, the key reason for the hype, hype and hyip around IW becomes absolutely clear - ‚Äústeadily increasing marketing efforts are being made to promote their new strategies, products and services‚Äù (source: <a href="http://iotintelligence.ru/posts/2587949">Tehnoklad Analytical Community</a> ). <br><br><h2>  What is the coming day preparing for me? </h2><br>  Returning from the market and business to our daily life, I would like to get an unequivocal answer: ‚ÄúWill the Internet of Things directly change my life?‚Äù Research centers, analytical agencies and experts, with care about us, have already given their assessments - ‚ÄúYes - they will.  Already changes. "Moreover, the researchers unequivocally state that" the Internet of things will become like electricity in people's lives - omnipresent and imperceptible ", and that" a number of fundamental human actions - such as learning, thinking, working and spending time with other people - will be changed under the influence of the Internet of Things ‚Äù(source: <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/31/what-will-digital-life-look-like-in-2025-highlights-from-our-reports/">Analytical Agency Pugh Recech Center</a> ). <br><br>  But concreteness and constructiveness are important to us - it is unacceptable to fall for biased statements.  Therefore, let us land these statements on concrete changes in our lives. <br><br>  <i>Already,</i> we can automate our lives at home and free up time for really interesting and important things: <a href="https://lifecontrol.ru/devices/plant-sensor/">caring for plants</a> , <a href="https://ilovepudding.ru/">babysitting</a> and <a href="https://planeta.ru/campaigns/animo/about">healthy feeding of pets</a> - all this is automated and with remote control function.  Many of the worries that previously took time on a regular basis, we reassign robots and machine guns. <br><br>  <i>After 5 years,</i> our clothes (shirts, blouses, boots and shoes) and things worn on the body (watches, pendants, bracelets) will be equipped with a variety of sensors to monitor body parameters, and will not only provide doctors with a statistical summary of your health, but also notify about the health risks of chronic diseases, recommending that you take action or consult a professional (see <a href="http://izitherm.ru/">smart heart</a> <a href="http://cardiopatrol.ru/">monitor</a> , <a href="http://izitherm.ru/">smart thermal monitor</a> and <a href="https://knopka24.ru/kak-rabotaet-knopka-zhizni/">alarm button</a> ). <br><br>  <i>After 10 years,</i> driving schools will start losing customers ... As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4Afk82PW_Y4">with automatic driving, a</a> person no longer needs to know the traffic rules.  Many people will refuse to own a car - it will be cheaper and more convenient <a href="https://colesa.com/about">to rent a car (car sharing)</a> .  Motorists will be able to <a href="http://ru.ezway.pro/economy/">remotely monitor the condition of the car</a> , and the car itself will self-diagnose based on the analysis of data on the state of components and assemblies from the sensors and offer repairs. <br><br>  Thus, although "the future is not predetermined," but the expectations of experts are very realistic: most likely the Internet of things will radically change our lives.  I support this forecast. <br><br>  There was only one key question that remained unanswered: who will walk the dogs - are we or the drones?  I believe that we will not lose such pleasure. <br><br><h3>  Sources </h3><br>  1. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%2520Functions/McKinsey%2520Digital/Our%2520Insights/Disruptive%2520technologies/MGI_Disruptive_technologies_Full_report_May2013.ashx">McKinsey and Company.</a>  <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%2520Functions/McKinsey%2520Digital/Our%2520Insights/Disruptive%2520technologies/MGI_Disruptive_technologies_Full_report_May2013.ashx">Breakthrough technologies: Progress that will change life, business and the global economy</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%2520Functions/McKinsey%2520Digital/Our%2520Insights/The%2520Internet%2520of%2520Things%2520The%2520value%2520of%2520digitizing%2520the%2520physical%2520world/The-Internet-of-things-Mapping-the-value-beyond-the-hype.ashx">McKinsey and Company.</a>  <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%2520Functions/McKinsey%2520Digital/Our%2520Insights/The%2520Internet%2520of%2520Things%2520The%2520value%2520of%2520digitizing%2520the%2520physical%2520world/The-Internet-of-things-Mapping-the-value-beyond-the-hype.ashx">The Internet of Things: Uncovering the Value, Leaving the Hype</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://files.runet-id.com/2015/iiot/presentations/15oct.iiot15-1--glazkov.pdf">Rostelecom.</a>  <a href="http://files.runet-id.com/2015/iiot/presentations/15oct.iiot15-1--glazkov.pdf">Industrial Internet of Things: Rostelecom Initiatives</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://www.pwc.ru/ru/communications/assets/the-internet-of-things/PwC_Internet-of-Things_Rus.pdf">PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</a>  <a href="http://www.pwc.ru/ru/communications/assets/the-internet-of-things/PwC_Internet-of-Things_Rus.pdf">Prospects for the development of the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù in Russia</a> <br>  5. <a href="http://iotintelligence.ru/posts/2587949">Technocouple.</a>  <a href="http://iotintelligence.ru/posts/2587949">The most influential companies of the Internet of Things in Russia and the EAEU</a> <br>  6. <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/31/what-will-digital-life-look-like-in-2025-highlights-from-our-reports/">Drink Resek Center.</a>  <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/31/what-will-digital-life-look-like-in-2025-highlights-from-our-reports/">What will digital life be like in 2025?</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337456/</a></p>
