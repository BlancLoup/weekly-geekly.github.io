At the same time, we focused on the fact that the new version will introduce significant changes that bring it closer in level to professional systems.  So, I am happy to announce that this has happened and Ivideon Server 3.0 is available for <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/downloads/">download</a> .  So far, the update has been released for the Windows and Mac OS X versions. In the near future, we will also post the <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/ivideon-dlya-linux/">Linux version</a> .  For those who are interested under the cut history of changes and some pictures. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Ability to install as a Windows service.</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b82/562/f12/b82562f12ea0f51dcf5842d08de63208.png"><br><br>  Perhaps one of the most frequently requested options.  That Ivideon Server was loaded and worked before the user logs in.  It should be said that it was one of our biggest flaws in Ivideon Server for Windows (the version for Linux already works like a demon, just like the version for Mac OS X).  Now we have eliminated it.  During installation, you must tick "install as a service."  Just remember that to install applications in Windows as a service, you need to have more rights. <br><br>  <b>Setting exclusion zones from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmotion detection.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/095/3fe/0fd/0953fe0fdce18111ced6ed86ef47df10.png"><br><br>  Obviously, if you use Ivideon as a video surveillance system, you do not want to view many hours of archival records looking for the right event.  Therefore, we have provided a software detector, recording in the archive only the video where there is motion in the frame.  But very often in the frame there are many ‚Äúmoving‚Äù elements that should not lead to the triggering of the detector.  Clock, flashing lights, treetops, cars outside the window.  Now you can easily exclude them from the detection area by selecting them in the frame when setting up the Ivideon Server detector. <br><br>  <b>The implementation of scheduled recording.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00a/449/8dc/00a4498dc5a4cb149876d380985eeacd.png"><br><br>  Allows you to flexibly program the recording mode for each of the cameras by day of the week.  For example, I want one of the cameras to record video on a motion detector only at night, and during the day a permanent recording will be activated.  At the same time, the output can be turned off at the weekend. <br><br>  <b>Ability to connect Line In microphone to video from IP-camera.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e8/3b2/f76/8e83b2f76f1a4ecfa73014033ba48d20.png"><br><br>  We really like that Ivideon began to use radio stations and musicians to broadcast videos on their sites.  Some of them asked us to add the ability to combine video from an IP camera and the sound of a computer's line-in.  In order to broadcast video from the studio, and as the sound to connect the one that goes on the air.  Actually in Ivideon Server 3.0 it became possible. <br><br>  <b>Supports JPEG cameras and devices that produce images as separate JPEG frames.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f98/8a7/087/f988a70875bc9f9126eba60acbcdd010.png"><br><br>  The first camera models of D-Link, Trendnet and other manufacturers did not support either RTSP or MJPEG.  And they could only give one JPEG frame for a given HTTP request.  We added support for such cameras in the new version of Ivideon Server.  Some of them are already in the list, which is available when adding a camera.  If your device is not listed, you can add it yourself.  To do this, simply select ‚ÄúOther manufacturer‚Äù and set the link manually.  Note that for JPEG cameras, it should start with the jpeg: // prefix.  Just as previously, the prefix mjpeg: // was provided for motion jpeg cameras. <br><br>  <b>Sound support from AMR and AAC encoded IP cameras.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/153/064/048/153064048c44bfab9ecfbaf808f43032.png"><br><br>  In the AMR format, new D-Link and Vivotek camera models transmit sound.  And the AAC format is supported mostly by top cameras, such as Axis, for example.  It is interesting because, unlike other codecs used in IP cameras, it is possible to encode sound with a higher sampling rate than 8‚Äì11 KHz.  The result is a really good sound and ‚Äúspeech‚Äù recognition.  Most often, these cameras are set to monitor cash registers, casinos and other places where the soundtrack of what is happening is very important. <br><br>  <b>Preview video from IP cameras.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2e/1f1/483/d2e1f148399d1014050e79f7e0c08571.png"><br><br>  In previous versions, unfortunately, it was not possible to watch videos from an IP camera directly in Ivideon Server.  Whereas the need for it was great.  Of course, you must immediately verify the performance of the camera after it is connected.  In Ivideon Server 3.0, you can double-click on the IP camera in the camera tree and a preview window will open. <br><br>  <b>Visual setting of the motion detector with viewing of the detection result.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aed/044/584/aed0445849ab86331753beba5cf887a2.png"><br><br>  Perhaps also one of our main innovations.  If earlier the sensitivity of the detector was adjusted exclusively by moving the slider and it was not clear what it affects, now a preview has appeared in the settings window, which allows you to see in real time how movement in the camera's field of view is detected depending on the detector settings. <br><br>  <b>An audio detector has been added that triggers recording when sound exceeds the threshold.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d64/b99/8d0/d64b998d0b8b9b6a070d0d5bcf538660.jpg"><br><br>  So far this is only the first version.  We have plans for adaptive noise reduction and speech search in the audio stream.  In the meantime, set the threshold for triggering and your recordings will be replenished with videos where people may not be in the frame, but their voices will be present. <br><br>  <b>Update and optimize the RTSP module.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff8/d8b/7c7/ff8d8b7c792fd091f6b1a74dea112ae9.png"><br><br>  It sounds like a normal formality, but in fact it is not.  We really significantly reworked the RTSP module.  And all because, despite the fact that there is such a thing as a standard, not all camera manufacturers follow it.  This is especially true for Chinese cameras that are very attractive for their low cost.  For example, we came across those who reported when passing the Content-Length parameters in this form: ‚ÄúContent-Length5340‚Äù.  But it would be fine if there was not only a colon and a space.  The value itself actually corresponds to 534, not 5340. <br><br>  <b>WAV audio support for some D-Link cameras.</b> <br><br>  Very often, people do not look at the characteristics of the camera, but at its value.  That is why a lot of D-Link MJPEG cameras are connected to our service, which do not give the best picture, unlike the Microdigital or Sarmatt cameras presented in our <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/shop/">store</a> , but they are cheaper.  That's just in the standard predachi MJPEG not provide audio transmission.  Each manufacturer of MJPEG cameras implements it in its own way.  In the case of D-Link cameras, a separate WAV stream is available.  Previously, we did not support it, but now it is available for a number of camera models. <br><br>  <b>Adding new supported devices.</b> <br><br>  The list of devices has been replenished with at least two dozen cameras and a DVR.  Thanks to the users who send us data on their cameras. <br><br>  <b>Error correction.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfb/9b1/cb8/bfb9b1cb8c9092e0f6bbd1ba3d61173e.png"><br><br>  Well, without this, of course, nowhere.  We really hope that the stability of Ivideon Server with each version only gets better and our users see it.  But we still understand that there is a likelihood of new errors.  We will be very grateful if you tell us about them and help to fix it!  Thank you for reading to the end and a good work week! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156475/</a></p>
