Television died</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Today, people watch TV more than ever. <a name="habracut"></a>  They began to watch it more often and longer, which means that television advertising has never been so valuable.  True, the audience spread has increased.  People consume TV content on multiple devices.

      So TV continues to live, but we should have enough wisdom to switch attention from TV to video.  After all, the video opens up new opportunities for marketers, which, alas, are inaccessible to the channel that supposedly died. <br><br>  <b>2. The consumer wants to communicate with brands</b> <br><br>  This phrase, taken out of context, is often used to manipulate the audience.  However, this statement is not based on any facts or observations of user behavior. <br><br>  We can see a handful of comments on Facebook that can be considered a dialogue between the producer and the consumer.  But much more often you can find tweets of dissatisfied and very annoyed customers.  The consumer has no need to communicate with the brand, because in most cases he is interested only in the result, decision-making and additional information. <br><br>  <b>3. Brands must create great content.</b> <br><br>  No need to take content marketing as a solution to all the problems faced by brands.  We live in an era of boundless and simply fantastic content, in a world where smartphones give access to everything that has ever been produced.  In this case, at any time convenient for us and, as a rule, absolutely free.  Each brand must gain its own voice in a world in which people want to minimize distractions while constantly searching. <br><br>  Yes, the content should provide purchasing power, but it is not at all as easy as it may seem at first glance.  Successful content should be exclusively personal, spread through social networks, and also be dependent on time and context. <br>  Branded content is not meritocratic - we cannot say that some part of it is better than any other.  The best test of content is to see how it works, what kind of audience coverage it provides and how effective it is in terms of consumer activity. <br>  <b>4. Advertising is a storytelling</b> <br><br>  Advertisers are great sellers - they are so good that they make us buy our own lies. <br><br>  Some brands in certain markets can be safely thought of as narrators of interesting stories.  But let's not fool ourselves that advertising is pure storytelling, not banal sales. <br><br>  <b>5. Advertising expenses should correspond to the time that the consumer spends on the media.</b> <br><br>  As an industry, advertising is obsessed with reaching out to all people, wherever they are.  But at the same time, professional advertisers never put themselves in the place of potential consumers in order to understand how relevant an advertisement is at one time or another.  It is a question of emotion, understanding, and even sympathy. <br><br>  In advertising, everything is more pragmatic: the whole world sits buried in mobile gadgets, and from this you can benefit.  Calculations of advertising expenses for the future have nothing to do with real forecasting, because they cannot say what will work and what does not, and how you can effectively spend money in general. <br>  Do not forget that sometimes an obvious delusion becomes true with time.  And the greatest enemy of knowledge can be considered not at all misleading, but the reluctance to change, experiment and achieve success. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297550/</a></p>
