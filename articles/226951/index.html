They are beaten to death, and then drowned in water or forgotten in public places.  For their sake, they are starving and even commit actions that fall under a whole series of articles of the Criminal Code ... Flagship smartphones, devices standing on the top step of electronic evolution ... And if without pathos, then we have Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and Sony Xperia Z2 in the review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This time we decided to move away from the usual scheme - direct comparison of devices - because you probably already know everything about them.  Moreover, these flagships are designed, it can be said, on a single mobile platform, and represent the evolutionary development of smartphones of a particular brand.  But, of course, they have differences.  For each of the devices, we will list five chips, thanks to which you can make your choice. <br><br>  <b>Samsung Galaxy S5</b> - we waited for it for four years - if you count from the moment the first model appeared in the Galaxy S line. As is the case with iPhones, the owners of the Galaxy S4 are unlikely to leave everything and run to exchange their junk for a supernova.  But for lovers of antiques like S3, and even more so for the antiquities of the first two generations, we would quite recommend to look at the "five".

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ba/fc6/4c5/2bafc64c51dabba364974585682d19da.png"><br><br>  <b>Samsung Galaxy S5</b> <b><br></b>  price: from 19 500 rub. <br><br>  <i>OS: Android 4.4.2</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processor: Snapdragon 801, 2.5 GHz (4 cores)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Video: Adreno 330</i> <i><br></i>  <i>screen: 5.1 ", 1920x1080, SuperAMOLED</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 2 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>memory: 16/32 GB (+ microSD - up to 128 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3G / LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Camera: 16 Mp / 2 Mp</i> <i><br></i>  <i>battery: 2800 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>dimensions, weight: 142x72,5x8,1 mm;</i>  <i>145 g</i> <i><br></i>  <i>degree of protection: IP67</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64f/350/95b/64f35095b1ef58a43d514c2a0100c0e1.png"><br><br>  1. In the first place - the <b>camera</b> .  The 16-megapixel S5 module can hardly be called out of the ordinary, but today the Five has one of the best cameras in its class.  An excellent symbiosis of hardware and software gives high-quality images.  For example, what it costs is only one HDR mode.  Now, if only for this camera and a separate button, well, the menu is simpler ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/877/9c7/3438779c7678678a2ea92b23bee83348.png"><br><br>  2. The next chip is the <b>power saving mode</b> .  There are two of them here - in both the screen becomes gray, moving to a particularly economical state.  Plus one or another set of functions is disabled.  In the mode of maximum energy saving smartphone can stretch the remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãof the charge for more than two days.  A similar mode exists in HTC, but Samsung seems to have learned how to squeeze everything from the battery to the last electron. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf1/6c8/0be/bf16c80be88a1353727e7fdfa010908c.png"><br><br>  3. Next.  <b>Fingerprint scanner</b> , built into the Home button.  Let the chip and not unique, but one of a kind for "androids."  Often it works the first time, less often - the second, quite rarely - the third. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/757/ef9/899/757ef98995e45873bc1f100bdd9a9fdd.png"><br><br>  4. This chip is rarely paid attention, but who knows, he understands.  Take a look at <b>Samsung Gifts</b> - there are about two dozen programs and services by downloading which you can save a considerable amount.  For example, Samsung offers a whole year of free subscription to the Yandex service.  Music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/89e/8ea/aa789e8eace4400be6181c8efafd51d0.png"><br><br>  5. Finally, <b>fitness chips</b> .  Why additionally buy some sensors, if Samsung already has a pulse sensor and a pedometer.  Naturally, this is not a Fitbit or FuelBand, but if you are not going to Rio for the 2016 Olympics, the built-in features should suffice with your head. <br><br>  <b>HTC One M8</b> - perhaps the most balanced of the three flagships.  By this we mean the unity of form and content, hardware and software.  There were, however, no dubious improvements, such as transferring touch buttons to the screen.  And the camera of the One M8, despite a fairly high level of implementation, sags in comparison with other flagships due to its low resolution - even if special ‚Äúultra-pixels‚Äù are used here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e15/dee/173/e15dee1730f6ea1c23d154d93c5e0314.png"><br><br>  <b>HTC One M8</b> <b><br></b>  price: from 21 500 rub. <br><br>  <i>OS: Android 4.4.2</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processor: Snapdragon 801, 2.3 GHz (4 cores)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Video: Adreno 330</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Screen: 5.0 '', 1920x1080, Super LCD 3</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 2 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>memory: 16/32 GB (+ microSD - up to 128 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3G / LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC</i> <i><br></i>  <i>cameras: 4 MP (UltraPixel) / 5 MP;</i>  <i>depth of field sensor</i> <i><br></i>  <i>battery: 2600 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>dimensions, weight: 146.3 x 70.6 x 9.4 mm;</i>  <i>160 g</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c4/8d3/373/2c48d337391ee61790b3a07e159f77fe.png"><br><br>  1. Let's start with the <b>design</b> .  It is clear that there are as many opinions as many people, but the all-metal case is a really powerful claim to success in the realm of plastic ‚Äúandroids‚Äù.  Yes, this is not the most practical option, if you keep your smartphone interspersed with keys, nails and piercing-cutting, but the brutality of this performance is off scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53f/38c/c36/53f38cc36dfda67e6520cdc6cff1f339.png"><br><br>  2. Next - the <b>sound</b> .  In spite of the fact that the Beats Audio and HTC tracks-paths finally diverged last year, the company's engineers managed not to lose the sacred knowledge concerning audio components.  It was possible to keep stereo speakers, which can scream and not wheeze - but this is not possible for everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ba/c1f/25b/8bac1f25b35b9af09449941486c696ed.png"><br><br>  3. Chip number three - an updated <b>interface HTC Sense 6.0</b> .  And again the word "balanced" is appropriate here.  If the Galaxy S5 looks overloaded, and the Z2 is somewhere even ascetic (and at the same time awkward, aha, that happens), then HTC One is all in its place.  A great bonus is Motion Launch, a set of gestures to unlock a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb1/d91/9cc/fb1d919cc0f89dcf2ad8e2457c21501d.png"><br><br>  4. The next tempting feature is the <b>Wallet</b> app.  In fact, a bank card tied to your phone.  Partner is a fairly well-known Russian bank.  The system is initiated in 5-10 minutes.  The account replenishes easily.  To pay, simply touch the PayPass terminal with your smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78b/c27/fad/78bc27fadb96c77027c753254e75ec9c.png"><br><br>  5. The most unexpected feature is a <b>perforated case</b> .  The solution is unexpected and so simple that all competitors, hiding in offices, bite their elbows.  This useful accessory looks like an ultra-modern art object, displays the most necessary information and allows you to answer calls without opening the case.  Minus - the price is under two thousand. <br><br>  <b>Sony Xperia Z2</b> - the most ambiguous of the current flagships.  On the one hand, it is a powerful smartphone, overtaking both the Galaxy S5 and One M8 in a number of settings.  On the other - no longer always means better.  The new flagship, in fact, is more correct to consider a modified version of the Z1, and not an absolutely new smartphone in the line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/652/b5a/41f/652b5a41f3daed326d42501b279b8977.png"><br><br>  <b>Sony Xperia Z2</b> <br>  price: from 22 700 rub. <br><br>  <i>OS: Android 4.4.2</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processor: Snapdragon 801, 2.3 GHz (4 cores)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Video: Adreno 330</i> <i><br></i>  <i>screen: 5.2 '', 1920x1080, IPS Triluminous</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 3 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>memory: 16 GB (+ microSD - up to 64 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3G / LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Camera: 20.7 MP / 2.2 MP</i> <i><br></i>  <i>battery: 3200 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>dimensions, weight: 146.8x73.3x8.2 mm;</i>  <i>163 g</i> <i><br></i>  <i>degree of protection: IP55 / IP58</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a37/49b/b16/a3749bb166893ce2cb553aa09b3612d9.png"><br><br>  1. So, five chips for Xperia Z2.  In the first place, clearly, <b>protected housing</b> .  And this is the only one of the three super smartphones that you can safely take with you even to the Crimean beaches, even to Icelandic fjords.  Immortality, they say, was achieved only by Nokia developers, but the Z2 is in any case more likely to survive in the struggle with the elements.  Standards IP55 / IP58 guarantee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/def/e6e/707defe6e711ea1e1aa00f41611e7cb3.png"><br><br>  2. The second is clearly a positive feature of the new Xperia - the <b>amount of RAM</b> .  Even people far from scientific and technological progress know that the power of a smartphone is not only in its processor.  Inside Z2 - attention!  - three gigabytes of RAM.  Only here the developers did not achieve a clear performance gain.  Let's try to wait for the firmware update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e0/c7d/ce5/0e0c7dce5786cce73f7b95750aeab7c3.png"><br><br>  3. <b>The volume of the battery</b> at the flagship of Sony - 3200 milliamp-hours.  And in this respect, Z2 again puts on the blades and S5, and M8.  Even if your bullying your smartphone will be particularly sophisticated, it can last from dawn to dusk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52c/676/bda/52c676bdafa3440037623b6d080bdc08.png"><br><br>  4. Another feature is a <b>camera</b> with a 20.7 megapixel sensor.  The module was borrowed from the Z1, but Sony polished the photo processing algorithms and expanded the range of settings and modes.  However, the user is unlikely to appreciate the possibility of shooting 4K video or augmented reality mode, but he will thank for a separate photo button for sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/722/197/d2e/722197d2e93e47628df0b5ccfffda0b5.png"><br><br>  5. Finally - the <b>screen</b> .  Yes, this is the usual IPS-display, not devoid, however, branded improvers from Sony.  This technology is included in the gentleman's set of modern flagships.  But if you recall the budget matrix Z1, then the updated screen really becomes a chip that can affect the consumer choice. <br><br>  In general: Samsung is evolving cheerfully, HTC has made a qualitative leap, and Sony has done a decent job with the bugs.  What will be their fate?  The S5 will be the most popular flagship, the M8 will be acquired by people with plastic allergies, and the Z2 will be beach lovers and brand fans.  It's simple. <br><br>  Subscribe to the <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">Geek to the Future</a> channel, join groups in social networks and do not forget - the future is in our hands! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226951/</a></p>
