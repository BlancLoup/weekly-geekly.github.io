The device is positioned to work in medium-sized workgroups, allows working with the A3-format, provides a harmonious color reproduction of images and clarity of graphic materials. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>APPEARANCE</b> <br>  The device is made in a white case.  Hardware parts most susceptible to pollution - auto feeder, panel <br>  and the niche of the output tray is made of black plastic.  The plastic used in the product is easy to clean.

      Sophisticated ergonomics allows the use of multifunction devices in any, even limited space.  So, the stapling finisher (option) is attached to the side of the machine and takes up much less space than floor finishers. <br>  For easy operation, the MFP can be mounted on a cabinet equipped with wheels, the inner space of which is provided for storing paper.  Execution under color of the device does it almost imperceptible. <br><br>  <b>PAPER FEED</b> <br>  The capacity of the paper trays is calculated on the basis of a maximum sheet thickness of 0.11 mm.  The MFP in its basic configuration is equipped with a duplex, a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, a 500-sheet cassette and a multifunctional tray.  The ability to work with A3 format and print in color on paper with density from 60 to 256 g / m2 allows you to perform <br>  up to 80% of office tasks, including in marketing departments.  Additionally, you can purchase a second cassette by increasing the paper supply to 1600 sheets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcc/2fc/a3c/dcc2fca3c928149201c93c5ec43f1e0c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b> <br>  The noise level at work is comparable to the noise of desktop models.  In the basic configuration, the device offers network printing, copying, network scanning and (optional) fax.  Driver installation and device connection are standard and take a minimum of time. <br><br>  The driver is Russified, as well as the device itself (we had a new MFP on the test with a non-Russified control panel, however, for the Russian market, the models will be completely Russified). <br><br>  Management - intuitive.  The device is equipped with a wide touch panel with a detailed illustrated color menu with step-by-step navigation, thanks to which the user can easily find the function he needs.  The "back" function also works step by step.  For the most frequently used functions, a quick access setting is proposed.  Printing from USB drives is supported, for which there is an appropriate connector on the device panel. <br><br>  The FS-C8025MFP prints grayscale, fine graphics, color images well.  It is important that the MFP has a real toner saving mode when printing and copying, the use of which reduces toner consumption by a third.  The device supports many functions of printing and copying - they are respectively selected in the driver or on the control panel. <br><br>  When copying provides the ability to interrupt jobs, electronic sorting, copying <br>  with separation, there is even the prevention of accidental overruns of toner (for example, when printing white texts on a black background).  The model easily handles not only printed but also digital documentation.  Can scan to PDF, compress and encrypt files.  Scanned documents can be easily sent to a folder on a computer, to an FTP server, by e-mail, saved on a USB drive. <br><br>  As standard, the MFP is equipped with an authentication system that provides access to documents only to a specific user, which helps maintain confidentiality.  There are options for secure deletion of stored information. <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt detect the stopwatch time, but during the test it became obvious that the device quickly processes the tasks <br>  and printing / scanning / copying large files goes to the stated figures.  The time specified by the manufacturer for the first copy to be released is no more than 13.6 s, the printing speed in color or in monochrome is 25 ppm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/e3b/1a6/2c5e3b1a6e4ce8765ea8f9589506c645.jpg"><br><br>  <b>SERVICE</b> <br>  All Kyocera devices are easy to maintain.  And taking into account the duration of the resource consumables and repair kit rarely have to contact the service.  The design of the device allows you to easily replace the toner, load the paper and even pull out the jammed in the "stove" sheet.  By the way, the car turned out to be resistant to "provocations": the jam was able to cause <br>  not the first time - even a sheet folded on the long side, loaded into the automatic feeder, easily passed through the printing path. <br><br>  But if the sheet is still stuck, information about the jam will be displayed on the control panel with detailed instructions for removing it.  Considering the tendency of the Russian users to use ‚Äúpower techniques‚Äù, Kyocera has made it easier to remove the sheet from the fuser ‚Äî rather slowly pulling the sheet toward us, no manipulation in the form of squeezing the ‚Äúlevers‚Äù is required.  The ‚Äústove‚Äù itself is also easily removed if necessary. <br><br>  Finally, you should focus on the capacity of the toner.  Starting black is designed for 3000 prints, color - for 1500;  The standard toner should be enough for 12,000 monochrome pages and 6000 color pages.  If the color toner has run out, the machine will continue to print in monochrome.  The only recommendation for using this model is to open the tray with paper, you should lightly press on its handle, then the cassette will open. <br><br>  The ‚Äúplus‚Äù of this design - during transportation of the device, the cassettes will not ‚Äúfly out‚Äù, which, of course, is convenient.  "Minus" - some users will still try to "pull out" the tape from the machine without pressing, breaking the internal holders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0b/546/706/b0b54670652d76adabb2282e7ae9cc85.jpg"><br><br>  <b>FINDINGS</b> <br>  The MFP FS-C8025MFP is a convenient, functional, high-speed machine for office work of up to 50 people.  Working with various media, printing in color, as well as finishing paperwork will make it a great business assistant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149889/</a></p>
