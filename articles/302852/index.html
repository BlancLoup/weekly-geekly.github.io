    <h1>  <font color="#0071c5">"Free your inner strength", Day 3: Go ahead to your new life</font> </h1><br>  In the morning, before the third day of the seminar, I recorded another short video in my hotel in New Jersey. <br><br>  Here is a minute plot: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlHbW8JAtOk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYAO7Wlw73dljWbS4vOxYSE1JFWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Wheel of life</font> </h2><br>  One of the first things affected by Tony Robbins was the so-called Wheel of Life, illustrating various aspects of the human world.  Tony highlights the following areas: <br><ul><li>  physical form; </li><li>  emotions and intentions; </li><li>  relations; </li><li>  time; </li><li>  work / career / vocation; </li><li>  finance; </li><li>  glorification and sacrifice: religious perception. </li></ul><br>  We performed a fun exercise that helped us understand what our position is in each of the areas, and evaluated each of the aspects on a 10-point scale, where 10 meant that we are exactly where we want to be.  Some have a high level of physical form, while other areas - for example, finance - are less developed.  Man is always stronger in some areas, but weaker in some areas.  This is usually determined by the amount of attention given to each aspect. <br><br>  For example, if you are in good physical shape, then most likely this is due to the fact that you are focused on this.  If you are doing well with finances, then you concentrate on them.  The areas in which you are not successful, do not receive enough attention, and therefore suffer. <br><br>  <b>What is in focus, energy is wasted!</b> <br><br>  Tony talks about the meaning of balance, and that we need to constantly develop and improve every sphere of life.  He calls it the three pillars of progress. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3 progress pillars</font> </h2><br>  In the review of the first day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù I mentioned that, according to Tony Robbins, it is progress that makes us happy.  If you are developing, then you feel alive.  And if there is no progress, then it seems to you that you have internally died.  Tony declares: if you develop some sphere of your life (or want to do it), then for this there are 3 keys. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Use a laser sight, make your target clear and attractive.</font> </h3><br>  The first step is clarifying the results you are aiming for.  What is your definition of a wonderful life?  What do you need to do to reach a new level?  Without a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-pereyti-ot-mechty-k-delu-4-shaga-k-motivatsii/">clear and attractive dream</a> of what you want today, you will not be able to find a goal called ‚Äúlong happiness‚Äù, much less hit it.  If you have the courage to admit where you are, then you will find the way to what you want. <br><br>  For each sphere of your Wheel of life, you need to know what you want and why.  This brings us back to the Formula of Ultimate Success, mentioned in the second day's review of Unleash The Power Within. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2. To achieve results, use the best tools / map / strategy / training</font> </h3><br>  When you define your goal, you will need an effective and rational plan to achieve it.  To close the ‚Äúhole‚Äù between your current situation and the desired result, you need a reliable map, a strong mentor and training that will force you to act. <br><br>  To find an effective strategy or map, it is best to find a teacher or coach.  Pick someone who has already achieved the results you need.  For example, if you strive to create a delightful body, find the one who already has it, and use its strategy and methodology.  By repeating his actions, you will get similar results.  The same can be said about finances, relationships, or any other area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife. <br><br>  <b>DO NOT try to reinvent the wheel.</b>  There were many situations in my life when I refused to look for a coach or mentor, and that was what was limiting and slowing me down.  The truth is this: if you think ‚ÄúI can do everything myself,‚Äù then why haven‚Äôt you done it so far? <br><br>  For me, it was the secret to quickly achieving success in various areas of my life.  Over the years I have had many personal growth coaches, for example, Jarek Robbins.  I had diet / nutrition instructors like Dr. Joe Klemchevski, personal trainers, dating / mentor mentors, business coaches, etc. In whatever area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife I wanted to succeed, I am looking for mentors / coaches. <br><br>  And that's not all: in the search for the right strategies and ways, I attend seminars, use <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-setevykh-servisov-povyshayushchikh-produktivnost/">online programs</a> , audio / video tutorials and books. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Get to work!</font>  <font color="#0071c5">Unleash and use compatibility and integration</font> </h3><br>  But sometimes tools alone are not enough: you need to get rid of what blocks you and release your power.  Why sometimes we know what to do, we have a great motivation for change, but we still can not finish it? <br><br>  We lose sight of the practical aspect of human psychology: why we do what we do and how to fix it.  Understanding your personal scenario, the reasons forcing you to think, feel and act in a certain way, as well as how you create emotions and intentions, you can not only get answers to these questions, but also learn how to create lasting changes and experience satisfaction. . <br>  Sometimes we are blocked by some of our internal conflicts.  For example, these are thoughts like ‚ÄúI want to be a millionaire, but at the same time I want to sleep before noon‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to have a press with cubes, but I never want to do it‚Äù.  None of them works, and therefore does not allow you to take large-scale actions. <br><br>  When your beliefs and mindsets become correct, it will be easier to act. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Peak state of absolute certainty</font> </h2><br>  During the whole event, we constantly form our emotional mood.  One of my favorite episodes of the third day was the moment when Tony Robbins introduced us to a peak state of absolute confidence.  When you are in it, nothing can stop you.  All fears and limitations disappear.  And if you introduce yourself into a state of confidence, you can do ANYTHING that was shown on the first day of your walks over the fire. <br><br>  Think about your goal or desire in this state of absolute certainty, and you will either find the path or create it. <br><br>  Many things seem completely impossible!  But if your mind is obsessed with getting things done, and you have complete confidence and creativity, then EVERYTHING you want can happen ... even what seems impossible.  Do you want this badly enough?  Will you do everything necessary for this? <br><br>  You should be ready when the opportunity arises.  You must be ready to create an opportunity and use it. <br><br>  How do we tune into maximum confidence?  In my review of the first day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength,‚Äù I talked about the Emotional Triad. <br><br>  Tony Robbins mentions that confidence ‚Äî like any other emotional state ‚Äî is a strategy.  At the event we did an exercise: breaking up into pairs, we entered a state of maximum confidence, and our partners told us what we did with our body to create such an attitude.  For example, at the moment of absolute certainty, you straighten your shoulders, stick out your chest, breathe deeply, move and speak in a certain way, take up more space, and your gestures become more abrupt, etc. If you repeat the "dance" of confidence, you can feel it in any moment. <br><br>  Another of my favorite exercises: being in a state of confidence, we walked around the room and looked into the eyes of people with similar feelings.  It was cool! <br><br>  The main thing that I learned from this day: I need to FORMY a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/6-privychek-uverennykh-v-sebe-lyudey/">mood of confidence on a</a> daily basis.  The more often I do this, the more natural it will become.  I can literally live with this feeling all day if I practice well. <br><br>  How to create confidence?  Here are some ways ... <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Spells</font> </h3><br>  This is usually the emotional rendition of their new inspirational beliefs.  For example, you can recite again and again: ‚ÄúI am absolutely sure!  I can not stop! ".  This should be a daily ritual. <br><br>  Schooling is the way I force myself to do everything to the end. <br><br>  Whether you keep things going or not depends on the state in which you are used to being. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2. The use of physiology</font> </h3><br>  You need to engage your physiology in your daily mood for maximum confidence.  This implies the inclusion of music, forcing oneself to move, pronouncing aloud the words ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù, Certain actions, deep breathing, etc. In order to achieve automatism, one must repeat this often and for a long time. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Focus tracking</font> </h3><br>  Another way is to use concentration for a daily transition to a state of confidence.  I can remember and imagine situations from my life when I was absolutely sure of myself.  Or I can ask myself: ‚ÄúWhat should I focus on in order to experience absolute confidence?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHow can I evoke a feeling of complete confidence right now?‚Äù <br><br>  It is important to do it DAILY, as if you are training muscles in the gym.  You need to push yourself when you are uncomfortable or do not want to do it.  Growth and development depend on it. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pomeshatelstvo-na-pochve-sobesedovaniy/">Insanity based on interviews?</a>  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pomeshatelstvo-na-pochve-sobesedovaniy/">How to restore self-confidence, moving up the career ladder</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302852/</a></p>
