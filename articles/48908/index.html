  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We work with managers remotely</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We live in Russia, and we are proud that our country is the largest in the world!  Incredibly huge piece of the planet, allows you to reach a very large number of customers.  Who knows, maybe your client is in Khabarovsk, while you are looking for him in St. Petersburg.  In the 21st century, the distance has lost some power, and communication is now available regardless of the distance, but before you communicate with the client, you need to find it, and it‚Äôs not always easy to communicate on the Internet with the client.  Hence the conclusion: in order to organize normal work with a client from another city, you, in this city, need your own person.  That is - the manager.  In this article I will try to tell you how to find managers in different parts of our country, and to work with clients through them.  Everything written further relates to the organization of work of web-studios. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is the salt? </h4><br>  And the whole point is that if we throw aside geography, Russia is far from one country, for you, in Moscow or St. Petersburg, have the same living conditions, we, in Vladikavkaz, are completely different.  In general, in the article, I will call the Moscow studios Moscow, and the Vladikavkaz provincial ones, because in due time I worked in those and in those.  From here, two interesting features arise: <br><ul><li>  In the provinces, the level of site creation is quite low, but there are cool companies that can pay a good amount for a decent website, and local studios cannot offer a site of this level. </li><li>  In large cities, website development costs a lot of money, but there are small firms that cannot pay such money, and an average website would suit them, at a low price, exactly what the provincial studios offer. </li></ul><br>  And immediately two questions arise: <strong>Why is the level of site creation worse in the provinces and why are the sites cheaper in the provinces?</strong>  Here we have a two-edged fairy tale: in the provinces, salaries are much lower than in the capital, programmers do not receive more than 20 thousand in principle, and 20 thousand in the provinces are a very large salary, therefore all the best programmers and designers work either remotely for capital firms, or they do freelance, hence the poor quality of sites.  The average Vladikavkaz studio is one programmer, one designer (who has no idea what a design is, he graduated from an artist and can ‚Äúdraw a little‚Äù), and in rare cases, a project manager who manages these two unfortunates. <br><br><h4>  How to search for managers. </h4><br>  There should be no problems with finding managers.  At one time, within two days, I had a section called ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù with 52 new contacts, another thing is that after a month 90 percent of them I deleted, but even 5-6 managers in different cities can really improve your income.  Offer managers 10-15 percent of the contract amount, and in no case do not imprison them for wages, for it is stupid ... The manager should not have special knowledge, then I will tell you how to organize the work in such a way that the manager is only a means of communication.  His main task is to find a client and be an intermediary.  So practically every person who understands the Internet can become a manager, and who now does not understand the Internet?  Of course, the manager should be able to distinguish the corporate site from the business card, but if a person is interested in your offer, he will understand the basics, and if not ... why would you need such a manager?  In any case, you risk nothing, he will bring you a client, give him his interest, and earn it yourself; if you don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt earn it.  <strong>Attention: You shouldn‚Äôt take stupid ones either, remember, a client builds his opinion about your studio exactly by communication with your manager, and many irresponsible managers can really damage your reputation ...</strong> From personal experience I‚Äôll say that the best results are achieved by girls ... <br>  At the end of the article links to sites where you can search for managers.

    <h4>  Scheme of work </h4><br>  When I thought on the topic ‚ÄúHow to work with clients through managers,‚Äù I was based on the fact that a manager should not be technically savvy, this, first of all, should be a charming young person who can introduce a company which will make a good impression on the customer, and which will cause the customer a sense of trust, and then will be able to explain why we put the sites on this particular cms, and why the option of registering users is more expensive.  Here is my scheme of work: <br><ul><li>  The manager finds the client and tells you everything he knows about him. </li><li>  You send the questionnaire to the manager, with questions about the client's wishes for the functionality and design of the site, he passes the questionnaire to the client, the client completes it, the manager returns the questionnaire to you (link to the questionnaire at the end of the article). </li><li>  Based on the questionnaire, you write a technical task on the site, send it to the manager, it shows it to the client, the client approves. </li><li>  You send the contract to the manager with your signature (not electronic, real, paper), and a ready TK, the client signs for both documents. </li><li>  Prepay. </li><li>  According to the Technical Assignment, your designer makes a sketch of the design that the manager shows to the client. </li><li>  Next, the sketch is being finalized, in accordance with the comments of the client. </li><li>  After the approval of the design, we are working on programming the site. </li><li>  Minor improvements / corrections. </li><li>  The work is completed. </li><li>  Full payment site. </li></ul><br>  In the end, it turns out that your manager is a kind of icq through which you communicate with a client. <br><br><h2>  useful links </h2><br>  <a href="http://boliev.com//docs/client_anketa.doc">Questionnaire for the client</a> (I was not made, I found it in the internet about a year ago.) <br>  And here you can make announcements about finding managers: <br>  <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://weblancer.net/">weblancer.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://professionali.ru/">professionali.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48908/</a></p>
