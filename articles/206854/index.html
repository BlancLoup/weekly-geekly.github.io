All the pros and cons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> It is quickly discharged, often hangs, lacks the necessary functions ... Which of you has not encountered these "stories"? <br>  So I had a moment "x", when I decided on the procedure, hitherto unknown to me.  Firmware.  It would seem that can be difficult?  Download the firmware, download the utility, connect the phone and flash! <br>  Do you believe in fairy tales?  Me not.  And therefore, having begun this procedure, I was ready for a ‚Äúfabulous‚Äù adventure. <br>  Having broken a bunch of sticks, firewood, deposits of coal and other wooden resources, I still stitched the phone, and not just stitched it, but with a non-original core!  And still, after 3 months, delighted!  Why have I not done this before? <br>  In a nutshell - the phone just ‚Äúcame to life‚Äù! <br>  Next - what did I <b>get at the exit?</b>  Attention, many "bukav". <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I got: <br>  1. Stability. <br>  2. The increase in the <b>duration of work in 2 times.</b>  From one day of active use to two days. <br>  3. Received a <b>recording of telephone conversations from the line</b> .  It was the most important criterion.  Do you know what it is, <b>recording from the line</b> ? <br>  This is a way to record telephone conversations ‚Äúas if you are speaking in the same room and you are both recorded on a dictaphone.  Excellent to hear both interlocutors.  <i>ATTENTION, this function is not entirely legal in the territory of the Russian Federation.</i> <br>  4. New, improved design, optional. <br>  5. Unlimited freedom in choosing further "satisfaction". <br><br>  <b>So, you definitely decided</b> that your smartphone, having outlived its guarantee life, is ready for reincarnation, since the standard ‚Äúsoul‚Äù has exhausted its resources and capabilities.  Well.  If so, then I suggest first of all to get acquainted with the rules, or rather with the exceptions to the rules: <br><br>  <b>1)</b> Not all firmware are equally useful.  Or "firmware is not only 200mb of useful software ...".  ONLY the creator of a specific firmware / kernel knows what is ‚Äúinside‚Äù.  In other words - if you have secrets - custom firmware is NOT for you.  And what if the script for memorizing passwords from Yandex.Money is hidden deep in the firmware?  EXCEPT the author of the firmware - no one knows ...

      <br>
      <b>2)</b> Some firmwares are dangerous at all due to the fact that they can work with the custom core by increasing and decreasing the voltage on the processor, thereby "playing" with its frequency ... <br>  And the fool understands that there will be enthusiasts who are ready to <s>fool</s> us to experience extremely dangerous parameters on our devices with you in order to find out ‚Äúwill the bunny die if it is slightly inflated ...‚Äù often these experiments lead to an eternal reboot with which cope not every ordinary user.  And what else will these experiments lead to - nobody knows.  So download only those firmware, discussions of which are going well, with great popularity, which are made by a fairly famous team of enthusiasts (for example, the development team w3bsit3-dns.com). <br><br>  <b>3)</b> If, after installing the firmware, the initial launch takes more than 10 minutes (hangs on the initial recording, for example, ‚ÄúSONY‚Äù or ‚Äúandroid‚Äù, just do it all over again and take a closer look. Right from the very beginning. Do all kinds of discharges, wipes, cleaning and pour again, there is a chance that the second time everything will pass ‚Äúto Ur.‚Äù I happened to that. Experience ... <br><br>  <b>4)</b> Not all firmwares fit all kernels.  You can go "all-in", take a chance and try to flash with your kernel (as in my, successful, case).  And, it is quite possible that the firmware will work perfectly and stably despite the assurances of the author.  Or maybe not - in the process of combinations ‚Äúunknown to God himself‚Äù, the famous ‚Äúbrick‚Äù, ‚Äúeternal reboot‚Äù and so on can form.  In any case, you don‚Äôt lose anything much - change the core or take other feathers, of course, if the qualification is enough +))) <br><br>  <b>5)</b> Not all firmware fit the kernel laid out next to the firmware.  In the sense of the kernel, which indicates the author himself.  Yes, and it happens.  Maybe the author in this configuration all ‚Äúplows‚Äù well, but that you personally will have a lot of glitches in the form of lack of Wi-Fi, the operator‚Äôs network, etc.  - there are no guarantees.  That's why it is a ‚Äúcustom‚Äù firmware, so that ‚Äúat your own peril and risk‚Äù.  So learn "mat", what you are doing now;) <br><br>  <b>6)</b> It's not a fact that, if there are absolutely identical devices, if a neighbor got a flash on the X-firmware, it means that you will be lucky.  It is possible that you will get a brick that has become boring to everyone.  Although, if you have reached this point in a practical sense, then the ‚Äúbrick‚Äù is not so bad for you. <br><br>  <b>7)</b> It's not a fact that if a neighbor did NOT manage to flash at all, then you will not succeed, it is quite possible that the neighbor is doing something wrong. <br>  AND IN GENERAL (ostensibly allocated with DOUBLE bold), EACH COPY OF EQUIPMENT OF THE APPARATUS ON ITS UNIQUE.  This initially happens for millions of reasons.  The conveyor at the factory ‚Äúsglyuchil‚Äù, the filling of the device is defective or ‚Äúalmost‚Äù defective but allowed to be sold, physical damage to the device during transportation, illiterate handling in the showroom (which happens often) and so on.  This just means that if you take 10 identical devices, then there is no guarantee that all 10 will come up with this or that firmware with the kernel. <br>  Dare, only by experience you will check the firmware on your "body".  All assurances of the authors of the type "tested 100%" - flattering themselves.  100% does not happen.  Do not believe in miracles.  <b>WHEN FIRMWARE, be ready to go tomorrow to buy a new phone.</b> <br><br>  <b>8)</b> Well and, almost finally, if you pursue some specific goal - besides you and specifically your experiments, NO one will tell you which core you need for which model and which firmware gives a greater performance boost, ‚Äúbattery durability‚Äù and so on.  Please, <b>(Again, double FAT)</b> do not torture yourself, admins, and just like you, trying to find the necessary info in the infinity of pages of this or that forum, creating stupid topics a la "What core should be under" SONY arc Ice 2 R2 ".  Most likely you will not be answered, or, with enviable disgust, they will send the created topic SPECIALLY for you with ALREADY ‚Äúone hundred years‚Äù.  Use SEARCH.  Fortunately, he is everywhere. <br><br>  <b>9)</b> Remember that, as a rule, the higher the performance becomes, the less the device will hold the battery, and vice versa.  Do not believe in miracles.  You can not get from the original "mediocre" processor GAME-monster.  This is a fantasy and crazy dreams of the author of the firmware / kernel. <br><br>  <b>10)</b> There are firmware / kernels that can adapt to the needs of the user, that is, change the frequency of the processor "on the fly."  But even here there is a minus - in order to force the core to increase the frequency, it is necessary to ‚Äúload‚Äù it, that is, when you open, for example, the Opera or the game, the phone for a couple of seconds.  slow down, then everything will be like clockwork, quickly and smoothly, but the brakes will first be anyway.  And so every time after idle when the screen is off (optional).  Since at this point the frequency of the processor is reduced to a minimum.  And if you want high performance constantly, then see point 9). <br><br>  But, if you are still not afraid, then we ask you to proceed further. <br><br>  <b>All firmware will occur on the example of the phone Sony Ericsson Ark S.</b> <br><br>  So here we go.  I will try to write all the "average" to understand the language. <br><br>  <b>A way suitable for standard firmware if you want to upgrade your smartphone officially</b> <br><br>  1. Download and install on your computer: ‚ÄúFlashTool‚Äù.  It happens different versions.  It is better to download several at once.  Not all versions and do not always work. <br>  2. Download your favorite firmware 4.x.x.  Here all the internet is yours.  Look for the firmware on exactly your model.  Do not think that since the models look alike, the firmware will be interchangeable;).  This is not true.  Search only your model. <br>  3. We throw it (without unpacking in the format: .ftf) in the folder "FlashTool": c / flashtool / firmwares.  The directory may be different.  But these are details ... <br>  4. Start FlashTool, click on the lightning icon ‚Äî select flashmode.  Or something similar.  Depending on the version of the program, the inscription may vary slightly. <br>  5. select the firmware in the ‚Äúreview‚Äù and, it is necessary to put a tick on ‚ÄúNo Final Verification‚Äù, ELSE, IT WILL NOT GET ANYTHING !!! <br>  6. Click "OK" and after the appearance of the window with the proposal to connect the body (a couple of seconds) - <br>  (preferably without a sim and a memory card, it seems they wrote that it will save you from the subsequent lags of "ICS") <br>  Who does not know what "ICS" - be sure to google.  Suddenly you are looking for something completely different from what you want to find ?;) <br>  7. we connect the switched-off body (your phone) with the left back button (for ARC S !!!) clamped to the computer, <br>  On the "body" the green diode will light up and the firmware process will begin! <br>  You can release the "back" key. <br>  8. We are waiting for the end, in one of the last lines the program ‚Äúflashtool‚Äù will write: ‚ÄúFlashed finished‚Äù <br>  9. Disconnect the ‚Äúbody‚Äù from USB, load the device (wait patiently - <br>  The first download can last up to 10 minutes depending on the firmware) <br>  10. Enjoy the new firmware "ICS" !!!  (Google, if suddenly you are stitched, and not vkurse what exactly you are stitched). <br>  If an error like ‚Äúflashtool cannot access the phone‚Äù occurs, change the firewood in the device manager to ‚Äú01004‚Äù.  I would describe in more detail, but everyone has different phones with, only God-known, fillings. <br><br>  It also helps to change the USB port on the computer, for example, I refused to flash through USB 3.0 ports, and the RESET DOWNLOAD after each change of parameters (firewood, programs, utilities) also helps. <br><br>  <b>For non-standard firmware, you will need an unlocked bootloader.</b> <br>  How to do it on the example of the same Ark S <br><br>  Required tools and components: <br><br>  1. PC with Internet connection. <br>  2. Appendix ADB RUN (which can be downloaded and installed very easily by just downloading the program name). <br>  3. Sony / Sony Ericsson brand smartphone with a charged battery of at least 50% <br>  4. USB cable <br><br>  <b>Bootloader unlock instruction:</b> <br><br>  1. Go to the <a href="http://unlockbootloader.sonymobile.com/">Unlocking the boot loader</a> website <br>  2. Click the "Start unlocking the boot loader" below. <br>  3. In the window, see the Name, IMEI of the smartphone (for this type in it * # 06 #) and your email. <br>  4. In the sent letter the unlock code will be indicated, save it. <br>  5. Turn off the smartphone. <br>  6. Run the previously installed Adb Run program. <br>  7. When the smartphone is turned off, hold down the search button (usually the ‚ÄúDOM‚Äù button, the center button) and connect it to the PC using a USB cable. <br>  8. After installing the USB driver in ADB Run, go to the Manual menu to unlock Sony / Sony Ericsson (control ONLY using numbers and the Enter button). <br>  9. Select ‚ÄúAttached‚Äù if you received a reverse answer. 0.3 means the smartphone is connected correctly. <br>  10. Return to Sony / Sony Ericsson Unlock <br>  10 Select "Unlock Bootloader" and enter the code to unlock, received by mail, and press Enter. <br>  11. Restart the smartphone. <br>  12. Bootloader is unlocked. Now you can get Root rights or whatever else you might think of a defenseless smartphone. <br><br>  <b>Next we need to flash the kernel.</b>  After all, just custom firmware did not suit us. <br><br>  It is necessary: <br><br>  0. Find, select, <b>read reviews</b> , download the kernel for your smartphone. <br>  1. Drop the boot.img file itself into the folder with the USB flash drive installed. <br>  2. Connect the switched off bodies to the computer with the menu key held down (far right) <br>  3. Install standard firewood, disable tel. <br>  4. Open flashTool.exe from the name of the administrator. <br>  5. Connect the switched off bodies to the computer with the menu key held down (far right) <br>  6. Click on the "flash" in the flash menu. <br>  7. Select "Fastboot mode" (in the window that appears, select Seleck Kernel to Flash) <br>  8. Select our boot.img and click Open (if your file is not displayed, select * .img in the file type) <br>  9. That's all, if everything is done correctly, you will see at the end of the log of the program ‚ÄúOKAY [2.220s] finished.  total time: 2.498s ¬ª <br>  10. Disconnect the bodies from the computer, turn it on, rejoice. <br><br>  <b>Well, the climax!</b>  <b>Installing custom firmware!</b> <br><br>  <b>The main requirement</b> for installing custom firmwares is <b>UNLOCKED BUTLOADER!</b>  What we did in the previous paragraph. <br>  Without an unlocked bootloader, installing custom firmware is <b>IMPOSSIBLE!</b> <br><br>  1. CHARGING THE PHONE AT LEAST 70% <br>  2. Before the firmware, copy the archive with the firmware in the .zip format to the memory card (usually micro SD).  Can the root.  So even easier. <br>  3. Turn on the phone and often press the ‚Äúvolume down button‚Äù to enter the recovery - ClockworkMod Recovery (CWM) on the new core (!!!) Remember, yes, that we installed a custom kernel;) <br>  4. Move through the menu with the volume rocker, search and select the item ‚ÄúFactory reset‚Äù, confirm the selection with the HOME button (central).  It will reset to the factory settings of the phone. <br>  5. Shift through the menu and select ‚ÄúWipe data‚Äù or ‚ÄúWipe cache partition‚Äù (depending on the kernel), confirm the choice.  All data is cleared on the phone. <br>  6. Move to the menu and select "Install zip from sdcard". <br>  7. Further, the item ‚Äúchoose zip from sdcard‚Äù <br>  8. Select the "******. Zip" file with the firmware <br>  9. Confirm the selected action.  The firmware will not last very long. <br>  10. After the completion of the pouring process, we return to the CWM main menu and select reboot system now (restart the phone).  Reboot. <br><br>  <b>Congratulations, you installed the custom firmware!</b>  It remains to understand - why the heck do you need this;) <br><br>  <i><b>What I got from the custom firmware with the kernel:</b></i> <br><br>  1. The phone works quickly, if you give it 5 seconds.  for the "buildup." <br>  2. MUCH less battery is discharged due to the fact that the frequency of the processor in stand becomes only 233 Hz.  And in the load rises to 1600 Hz.  With a nominal frequency of just 1000 Hz.  In other words, when you start to use the phone actively, it starts to increase the frequency according to the needs, well, and starts to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the battery. <br>  3. More advanced management, menus, etc.  You can choose what and where to "put". <br>  4. And in general, you can further choose what, where and when to put. <br>  5. <b>I record all telephone conversations in excellent quality right from the line.</b>  At any time I can listen to the conversation with the "H" subscriber over the past year, if I have a 16GB flash drive.  <b>Is not it lovely?</b>  I would just flash the phone for this. <br>  5. You can not use the official technical support Sony Ericsson.  Such a loss ... Sadness and longing ... I'll go pump up the official firmware ... <br><br>  But in general, the taste and color of all ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù are different.  So, firmware is a personal matter.  Many will say - "Do you want it?"  Than you do not like the standard phone? "- And I will send such a user ... re-read this article;) <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206854/</a></p>
