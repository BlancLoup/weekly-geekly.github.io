  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rules for working with e-mail in our company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For four years, our team has grown from <b>3</b> to <b>70</b> people, three offices have appeared, plus communication with headquarters.  Therefore, along the way, I had to change both the style and the rules of work in the company.  As a result, in the field of communications, this resulted in the following set of rules - some can already be found in the literature on time management, some have come up with themselves.  Perhaps this will be useful for your company.  Suitable for companies where everyone has a computer and <b>e-mail</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In <b>ESET RUSSIA,</b> these rules are mandatory for everyone, they can be referenced and for their non-compliance you can receive a strict reprimand, etc. <br>  ================================ <br><br><ol><li>  There is no problem <b>until you write about it in an email</b> .  The letter is proof that you informed the boss about the problem.  If the problem is with the email itself, inform the system administrator orally.  (Example: ‚Äú <i>My phone does not work, please check if it works</i> ‚Äù.) </li><li>  In case of disputes such as: ‚Äú <i>I told him, but he didn‚Äôt answer me</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>I didn‚Äôt know</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>Nobody told me,</i> ‚Äù and so on - the manager will look at the <b>presence / absence of a letter on this issue</b> as well as the date / time of departure .  All letters are saved daily on our server, where the date is also indicated, and this will be a confirmation of the time of sending. </li><li>  If you wrote to someone on an important question, and he did not answer you (see Section 4), then you need <b>to check the receipt of the letter by voice on the phone</b> .  The important thing is all that concerns a person‚Äôs life (ill, late, etc.), company security (theft of info, etc.), money (financial issues from XXX cu), large clients (from XXX nodes), power and government agencies, as well as others at your discretion, which can significantly affect the operation of the company. </li><li>  If the letter contains an assignment, a task (from the manager), and the deadline is not specified - <b>indicate in the response a deadline</b> on the basis of your assessment.  (Example: ‚Äú <i>I can make it by Friday 12.00</i> ‚Äù.) </li><li>  <b>New orders do not cancel the old</b> , if the head does not indicate that this is so.  (Example: ‚Äú <i>This should be done urgently until 6 pm, put everything else away until tomorrow</i> .‚Äù) </li><li>  If you do not have time for this deadline, <b>be sure to inform your supervisor about this before the expiration of this deadline</b> , indicating the reasons and new term.  (Example: " <i>I screwed up, smoked a lot, drank coffee, read the news on the web and could not do your task in time. I can do it by the X date or ask me to dismiss for incompetence</i> .") </li><li>  If you received a letter from a colleague, partner, <b>in any case, write a response that he would know that the e-mail has been received</b> .  (Example: ‚Äú <i>Ok, understand, think</i> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <i>Received, answer tomorrow</i> .‚Äù) </li><li>  If this assignment conflicts with other works, projects, <b>briefly describe the situation and indicate the possible time limits depending on other projects</b> .  (Example: ‚Äú <i>Now I am working on project X, so I cannot make a date by the H. Specify what is more important</i> .‚Äù) </li><li>  If you receive an e-mail in which your address is in the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù field, it means that the <b>manager, a colleague wants you to be aware of events, and if there are questions</b> that require actions on your part, then you follow them .  (Example: " <i>Everyone who received this email should go to the personnel department and receive an</i> award.") </li><li>  If you receive an e-mail in which your address is not present, it means that the manager has put your address in the ‚Äúhidden copy‚Äù (blind) field.  He wants <b>you to be in the know, but he does not want the one to whom he wrote the letter to know about it</b> .  (Example: ‚Äú <i>Ivan Ivanovich, everyone has long known that the best antivirus is NOD32</i> .‚Äù) </li></ol></div>
