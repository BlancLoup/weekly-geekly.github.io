Having passed the next certification exam from Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/ru/ru/certification/mcitp.aspx">MCITP: Database Developer 2008,</a> I decided to share my, albeit not very large (so far only MCTS, MCPD and MCITP) experience in passing these examinations. <br><br>  Then I will talk about development and programming, but this fully applies to administration and other certifications (office, sharepoint, etc.). <br><br>  If you briefly answer the question "How to prepare for the exam?", Then I would answer it like this: <a href="http://xn-----clcksaplxf6byd3cyb.xn--p1ai/">Write the code, fucking</a> ( <i>you forgive me for the mat, but you can't throw out the words from the song</i> )

      If you want details and answers to the question "why do you need it, because the certificates are no longer fashionable?", I ask for a cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What for? </h5><br>  In truth, there are several reasons why people take certification exams: <br>  1. A person may not like those wallpapers that are hanging in his apartment or house and he decides to hide them under a layer of certificates in beautiful frames; <br>  2. A person seeks to prove to others that he is a cool specialist, not through dialogue and successful projects, but by laying out a bunch of certificates; <br>  3. the person really understands the question and wants to amuse his self-esteem "for show"; <br>  4. a person hopes to make a better impression on the employer with the help of certificates and to ask for a big salary; <br>  5. everyone got it, but what am I, red? <br><br>  More common combination of these causes. <br><br>  Personally, I initially had a combination of 3 and 4 factors.  And the 4th factor is secondary.  I would even say that certificates make it easier to get through the initial screening of candidates, help make your resume read and invited for an on-site interview. <br><br>  It all started for me on a boring autumn evening in October 2009, when at work all things were already completed, deadlines were not tied, bugs were fixed, and until the end of the sprint a few more days.  And we thought, would we test our strength and pass the .NET Framework 2.0 exam?  And they decided to pass.  And passed!  By the way, the most difficult exam of all that I passed. <br><br>  After passing the 6 exams from Microsoft in two years (in fact, after the first one - the others just confirmed this conjecture), I realized that there is another very important factor (even probably the <b>most important for me</b> ), which prompts me, as a professional, not take and prepare for these exams: <br>  <b>6.</b> You will never, under any circumstances, in practice, encounter all the tasks for which you are designed, for example, SQL Server Integration Services, or MS SQL Server Agent.  And <b>preparation for the exam allows you to systematize this knowledge in the form of hundreds or other theses</b> (each question is essentially one thesis, which very briefly shows how to use this technology or tool). <br><br>  So, we have dealt with the question ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, now the question remains ‚Äúhow‚Äù.  The wording of the question "how" can be several: <br>  1. How to prepare? <br>  2. How to prepare to pass? <br><br><h5>  How to prepare? </h5><br>  I will not describe here in detail the process of reading smart books and research of thematic sections msdn, rsdn, habr and others. <br>  Search in habr finds, for example such links: <br>  1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/123556/">Tips for beginners to self-prepare for Microsoft exams</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/81357/">9-year-old girl has become a certified Microsoft system engineer</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/53854/">Project Management Certification</a> <br><br>  Briefly, the essence is simple: either actually work in this area for more than a year, in which case you just have to look at which areas are affected in the exam and refresh them in memory, or study clever textbooks to prepare for a specific exam before blue brain. <br><br>  You can go to certified courses and listen to clever lectures, do laboratory work.  If the teacher is good, then after the courses you can immediately take the exam (checked personally). <br><br><h5>  How to prepare to pass? </h5><br>  In addition to the textbooks from the author of the tests, on the Internet you can find a lot of ‚ÄúReshebnik‚Äù for each test.  These programs, as a fighting club, cannot be spoken out loud, but everyone knows about them =) <br><br><h5>  How to take? </h5><br>  It's all very simple: look for the nearest certified center to you, register, pay and rent. <br>  If we talk about Moscow, then I would recommend the <a href="http://www.specialist.ru/">Specialist</a> .  I passed all the exams at the Radio training complex near MSTU.  N.E. Bauman.  Do not think for advertising, but they really have the atmosphere and attention to the customer at the height.  <i>And they always have cookies!</i> <br>  By the way, you can also go to courses for preparing for these exams. <br><br>  On the exam, the main thing is not to be nervous and calmly and very carefully read all the words in the question!  Often the meaning of one word affects the correctness of the answer.  Nowhere to hurry: time for 50-55 questions is given more than enough: 120 minutes, if your native language is English and another +20 minutes if not native. <br><br>  The most difficult question in the exam is at the very beginning to choose the right language of the exam: C # or VB.NET. <br><br><h5>  What exactly gives me passing exams and possession of certificates? </h5><br>  Firstly, in the process of preparing for the exam, I systematize my knowledge in the area that I know well.  Examinations sometimes make you focus on such trifles that you don‚Äôt think about on purpose. <br>  Secondly, I really find those moments that I do not know.  And I deal with them and, thus, find out more.  For example, when preparing for the last exam, I learned about the existence of not only NEWID (), but also NEWSEQUENTIALID (), learned about the appearance of the hierarchyid type and some other nuances of MS SQL Server 2008. <br>  Thirdly, I can amuse my self-love and tell myself that I can! <br>  And fourth, in my resume, I will definitely indicate a link to my transcript and a list of certificates.  This makes it easy to go through the resume distribution stage and go to an interview.  By the way, I got a job on the amount of money I was interested in because of the availability of certificates. <br><br><h5>  What's next? </h5><br>  And then I want more.  For example, I want to at least get the level of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/master-sql.aspx">Microsoft Certified Master on Microsoft SQL Server 2008</a> .  Unfortunately, while in Russia this exam can not be passed, and <a href="http://www.prometric.com/NR/rdonlyres/elgriuaivumajecwgyonz3obgn7nlqf22eaw3voujzmd7oiyckrcqbcqorwhpfv5dly4dyyj6kmk2gvnihdcw7v6f6h/088970listforonlineposting02222011.pdf">in the rest of the world the choice is not great</a> . <br><br>  But generally speaking, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-overview.aspx">here</a> you can see a description of all certifications and options to achieve them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132782/</a></p>
