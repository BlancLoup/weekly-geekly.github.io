More than 180,000 people and 4,400 companies came to Las Vegas to show and see the latest gadgets and technology.  Among those who boast of their technical advances will be Huawei, Intel, Samsung, LG, Asus, Qualcomm, Hyundai, TCL, Sony, Toyota and Hisense.  Some of them have already shown the devices with which they are going to surprise us in the new year, while others have released the long-awaited technologies that have been developed for many years. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><br><h3>  Intel finally announced its first 10 nm processors </h3><br><p>  The company introduced the user-defined Ice Lake, Lake Field and Cascade Lake series for servers, which are already working (the computers on them were presented on the stage).  It is expected another leap in performance that first touches the PC, and then mobile devices. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/oi/md/zzoimd_1y7rye3kxiogjycagrkk.jpeg">

      <br>
    <p>  Prior to this, the company, as is known, had difficulties with the transition from 14 nm process technology to 10 nm.  Work on the technology has been underway for more than four years (Cannon Lake's limited release does not count).  But now the last problems, sort of, have been eliminated, and the chips are ready for shipment.  New Intel processors will be able to deliver more power from 37% of the size of previous models.  The density of transistors is almost three times higher than that of 14 nm, more than 100 million per square millimeter.  It is expected that Ice Lake will give at least 15% more power than the current Coffee Lake, with the same power consumption.  Or, which is important for servers, - 30% less power consumption with the same performance. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/z0/i0/uyz0i08nuvf7uyxp1li452qnciw.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Processors will be on sale this year, so if you want to assemble a real monster, it‚Äôs better to wait a bit with the purchase of a chip for a PC.  Still, after Ice Lake to 7 nm, Intel, apparently, will go on for a long time. </p><br><p>  AMD on CES waited for the release of third-generation Ryzen, but so far it has only announced the appearance of its Ryzen 2 chips on mobile devices.  Most likely, the announcement of the Ryzen 3, we still see, but a little later.  And real fans, fingers crossed, are still hoping for news about AMD Navi. </p><br><br><h3>  HTC launches a new generation of VR glasses </h3><br><p>  The company has prepared several headsets at once.  One of them, HTC Cosmos, is not really known: the company showed a prototype that looks like an improved HTC Vive with two cameras, with ‚Äúeyes‚Äù in front.  It will work with PCs and ‚Äúother devices‚Äù. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/my/ag/gfmyaglf_yfiazqhmikuv9afpke.jpeg"><br><br><p>  And in the near future comes another headset - Vive Pro Eye, with the technology of tracking our eyes.  With glasses, only the area you are looking at will be rendered.  This, firstly, will allow you to create games with better graphics that will be less demanding on the hardware.  And secondly, it will become even easier to dive into VR: you do not have to turn your head to look a little to the side.  Just like in real life. </p><br><p>  Also, HTC promises to upgrade the usual sets of Vive Pro to Vive Pro Eye.  The launch is in the second quarter of 2019. </p><br><br><h3>  Asus Morthership GZ700, insanely powerful gaming laptop </h3><br><p>  Nvidia finally announced that its RTX video cards are starting to ship in laptops.  According to the company, the first 40 models with powerful graphics are ready to start since January 29. </p><br><p>  The first of them was shown at the exhibition model ROG Zephyrus S GX700, ultra-thin notebook with rabid characteristics.  For those who are often on the road, and want to pass the time on a plane or in a hotel.  Video card - up to RTX 2080 with 8 GB VRAM.  Any games, any settings.  The processor is also a match: 6-core Intel Core i7-8750H of the sixth generation with turbo boost up to 4.1 GHz.  And up to 24 GB DDR4-2666 RAM.  The screen is 17.3 inches, the weight is 2.2 kg, the thickness is only 2.35 cm. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fm/bb/jv/fmbbjvh2w7tm3jinzvkzkaq0fp8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Asus morthership gz700</i> <br><br><p>  The more crazy Asus laptop has become the Morthership GZ700.  With a Core i9-8950HK chip, RTX2080 graphics, and up to 32 GB DDR4.  The display is 17.3 inches, 144 Hz, 1920x1080.  It can detach, turning into a separate (weighty) tablet.  Since it is so heavy, there is a built-in flip-up stand in the case to make it convenient to watch movies and streams without holding your hand.  However, it is imperative to put up a stand every time the notebook is turned on, because all the hardware is on the screen, and without it, it simply outweighs the keyboard. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/cc/yf/zcccyfdewv_ugm2tgqtmse3zvke.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The real question is how fast will it be possible to fry eggs? </p><br><br><h3>  Huawei MateBook 13 - MacBook Air Killer </h3><br><p>  Huawei is now seriously at war with Apple in the field of smartphones and tablets, and wins on many fronts.  Apple's profit is falling, and Huawei is gradually winning back even the US market.  The leader is still Samsung, but its market share is falling (-14% in 2018), while the Chinese are growing (Huawei + 33%, Xiaomi + 21%).  And now, Huawei is aiming to kill its competitors in the laptop market.  MateBook 13 directly aims to compete with Apple.  The same form factor as the MacBook Air 13, very, very similar design, only more power and less price.  The thickness of the case is only 1.49 cm, also less than even the last Air (1.56 cm). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y4/vi/ua/y4viua2ohee7u2l1-sqvewrmdls.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The new MateBook 13 will run on Intel Core i5-8265U or Core i7-8565U processors, with 8 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage and Nvidia MX150 graphics.  All this under a 13.3-inch display with a 2K resolution (2160x1440) and touchscreen capabilities.  The cost in the US will start at $ 999 ($ ‚Äã‚Äã200 cheaper than Apple).  Sales will start on January 29 at Amazon and Newegg. </p><br><br><h3>  Samsung Notebook Odyssey - the most productive notebook company </h3><br><p>  Judging by everything, the manufacturers decided that the future of gaming is on laptops.  This year, quite unexpectedly, the main emphasis is on them.  At least, Samsung first decided to make a laptop specifically for this niche.  Its monster weight is from 2.36 kg (the older version has 3.5 kg), the case thickness is 1.99 cm, the display is 144 Hz and Full HD.  Inside, there is a six-core Intel Core i7 processor and a GeForce RTX 2080 video card. Judging by the name, it should help people not only enjoy the usual games on super settings, but also dive into VR with the new headset from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/hmd/windows-mixed-reality/xe800zaa-hc1us-xe800zaa-hc1us/">Samsung HMD Odyssey</a> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_-/oe/4o/_-oe4ox6adr38tl_doka8p427dm.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The version of the laptop with a 15-inch screen comes out in February, with a 17-inch one in April.  The price of the smaller version starts at $ 1199. </p><br><br><h3>  LG folding TV </h3><br><p>  Not really a gadget, but so far one of the most impressive technologies at the exhibition.  True, not very cool, that our TV takes up so much space in the room?  And attention is concentrated on itself, and the overall design is destroyed.  Nothing good.  So, the flagship LG TV in 2019 will have a screen that can roll into a small nightstand from the bottom.  Giant 65-inch panel does not physically take up space in the room. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ks/k_/06/ksk_06e3vegkktweh34mtztcano.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The whole TV is placed in a small shelf on the floor.  There even was a place for a powerful Dolby Atmos audio system.  Screen - 4K resolution, OLED, 3 mm thick.  Press the button, and he slowly enters its base.  Press again - and it gradually rises, in about 10 seconds.  Noise, the process is quite fascinating.  All ports - in the nightstand, behind. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/2x/pq/gc2xpqb2jfnsxzmsn5qwssslze4.jpeg"><br><br><p>  In general, now, when it is not necessary, the TV has learned to completely disappear.  The child will not break it, the dog will not jump on him.  And do not beat a hole in the wall, and then be nervous that he falls from there. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28a/b7a/e28/28ab7ae286e27e4a4e6c4fffb5ec32f9.gif" alt="image"><br><br><p>  The device looks cool, but the price of the novelty is likely to be like that of a good car.  Below $ 10,000 for this, no one expects (most likely, it will be much more expensive).  But this is only the beginning - if such "folding" TVs do not show any serious defects, and the mass market will pick up the idea, in five or six years we will be able to take it at the same price as now conventional devices with Smart TV and 3D . </p><br><br><p>  <strong>PS</strong> Buying gadgets in the US is profitable with Pochtoy.com.  Prices are 30-50% lower than Russian, especially on new items.  Delivery with us - <a href="https://www.pochtoy.com/calc/">from $ 11.90</a> per pound.
