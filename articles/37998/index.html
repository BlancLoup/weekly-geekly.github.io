I will try to make such collections monthly. <br><br>  <strong>10 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://tuddu.ru/"><img title="Tuddu.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/0d4/84b/e6d0d484b87b7075abf84b05bf8f0925.jpg" alt="Tuddu.ru" width="192" height="72"></a> <br>  <a href="http://tuddu.ru/">Tuddu.ru</a> <br>  A service that allows you to maintain your own task list without registration.  The service is made convenient, and it seemed to me more comfortable for them to control from the keyboard (with the help of hotkeys) than with the mouse.  In addition to its functionality, the project is notable without posting.  Now many are trying to minimize the registration procedure.  The creators of this project brought this idea to the absolute.

      <strong>Ilya Vasilyev (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúDespite my betta version, some pieces that I lacked in other services are embodied in tuddu:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Registration on sites has become boring already, it simply does not exist in tuddu</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- In tuddu, in order to add a task to the list, it‚Äôs not necessary to choose a priority for 10 minutes, register tags and choose dates.</em>  <em>Cases can be urgent and non-urgent.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚ÄúReal Russian interface, finally!‚Äù</em> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>9 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://design911.ru/"><img title="911 design" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/52a/984/cf152a984e4f1a0f72dd1c6a6ad19aff.jpg" alt=" 911" width="309" height="56"></a> <br>  <a href="http://design911.ru/">911 design</a> <br>  Very nice and progressive project (its design, by the way, was made in the ‚Äúdot-Com‚Äù studio).  The execution of the idea at a very high level, only the idea itself does not carry anything fundamentally new in itself.  In fact, this is a common job exchange for designers.  Not the first and not the last in Runet.  However, due to the good performance of the site can take a leading position in its niche. <br><br>  <strong>Vladislav Shvedov (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúWhy this project is interesting for us as a team of developers, this is how we decided to organize the workflow.</em>  <em>Namely, try out the extremal programming method.</em>  <em>And pair at the same time.</em>  <em>Fit the ideology of the project under Getting Real (and throwing away a ton of unnecessary functionality), optimizing the workflow and schedule (imagine: severely limited the working day. Now, no seats up to 10-12 at night!) -</em> <em><br></em>  <em>prepared themselves for a serious test and recreated the atmosphere of a startup (although I do not like this definition, but what else to call such joyful brainstorming?).</em>  <em>Plus, they tried to introduce a rule according to which before lunch (at the most productive time) - no talk and no ‚ÄúHey, check it out, what have I done‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>8 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://www.imobilco.ru/"><img title="IMobilko" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c90/fe6/f55/c90fe6f55437453d83031e4c9406524d.jpg" alt="" width="115" height="104"></a> <br>  <a href="http://imobilco.ru/">IMobilko</a> <br>  The design for this project was made by the great and terrible Artemy Lebedev.  This, in general, it is remarkable.  Under the wrapper Lebedev is a regular online store.  "Project cool" - perhaps this is the most capacious assessment for him. <br><br>  <strong>7 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://pavlikmorozov.ru/"><img title="pavlikmorozov.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/500/93f/7b950093f792007196f04cec76ce330f.jpg" alt="pavlikmorozov.ru" width="193" height="97"></a> <br>  <a href="http://pavlikmorozov.ru/">Pavlik Morozov</a> <br>  A service from e-generator that allows sellers and buyers to find each other through intermediaries.  While there, services are mainly sold.  The idea is not bad, everyone is interested in such a resource, and sellers who find it easier to sell the goods.  And buyers, which simplify the search for goods and services.  And intermediaries, and samservis, who receive their interest.  At first glance, this is a service for a very mutually beneficial cooperation. <br><br>  <strong>Andrei Shadrin (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúThe project is aimed at companies that are looking for original and new methods of active sales.</em>  <em>I also believe that cooperation with the project will be useful for young companies that are just beginning to recruit a customer base or offer unique services that require specific sales. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>6 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://votimenno.ru/"><img title="votimenno.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/0bf/ebe/9f70bfebe0eddd89fd480abd045f8bdf.jpg" alt="votimenno.ru" width="159" height="93"></a> <br>  <a href="http://votimenno.ru/">That's it</a> <br>  Risk free naming service.  Naming in general is now gaining momentum in Russia.  For example, I was visited by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same service after I first met the western counterpart (www.pickydomains.com).  At that time, it seemed to us with a partner that the RuNet was not yet ready to pay for naming in the domain.  Dmitry Davydov and his partner thought differently, and launched "That's it."  It is worth noting that it is they who own the ‚ÄúWestern counterpart‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Dmitry Davydov (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúThe project was completely written by my partner.</em>  <em>Or rather corresponded - the basis of the code is the PickyDomains.Com engine (our domain selection service for a western audience), but we had to make changes so that we could work with slogans and names, and not just domains.</em>  <em>The design of the caps helped make the man a barter.</em>  <em>He has an interesting project - Peegly.Com, but a small attendance.</em>  <em>Therefore, he made a hat for us, and I began to push the traffic back to him from the social networks.</em>  <em>By the time - we planned to do everything in a month, but there were unforeseen circumstances - car accidents and laptop breakdowns.</em>  <em>So the whole thing dragged on for two and a half months.</em>  <em>For money, no investment, only the domain and hosting "</em> <br><br>  <strong>5 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://www.geokontakt.ru/"><img title="Geo contact" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d45/c98/6cf/d45c986cf38a0a3d74708db32556dbfc.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="40"></a> <br>  <a href="http://geokontakt.ru/">Geo contact</a> <br>  Service location of friends with their mobile phones and with their consent ÔÅä.  What is interesting this project has grown from one of the services of another project - cardiostep.com. <br><br>  <strong>Artem Galeev (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúTo work with the service, you will need to install a special program on your phone that will inform the proxies of the user's location.</em>  <em>Positioning is performed based on the analysis of signals from cellular antennas, and in the future - Wi-Fi.</em>  <em>The originality of the project is that users themselves will be able to add a new locality to the base of the service.</em>  <em>We believe that this will make the service self-developing.</em>  <em>It will not be limited to any locality, but will be able to work wherever there is a cellular connection.</em>  <em>Subsequently, we plan to add the transmission of messages associated with the terrain.</em>  <em>For example, you can send the message ‚Äúwhen you are near the house, go to the store,‚Äù and the recipient will receive it when it really is near your house. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>4 Place</strong> <br> <a href="http://aroundme.ru/"><img title="Aroundme.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/f81/d3a/33cf81d3a1e190abdd3091a6e292bf12.jpg" alt="Aroundme.ru" width="216" height="71"></a> <br>  <a href="http://aroundme.ru/">Aroundme</a> <br>  The startup is strictly not Augustusky, but it was at the end of July at the beginning of August that this project launched a new version of testing.  ‚ÄúAroundMe.ru is a community of people who create instructions for using the city.  The developers have tried to give the user the opportunity to create together a transparent urban environment in which to dwell comfortably and just to navigate. <br><br>  <strong>Vladimir Dolgy-Rapoport (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúNow it (the project - author's note) is in the stage of open testing, that is, it does not work all the way it should.</em>  <em>Give us another week and we will be ready to talk, show off and respond to criticism.</em>  <em>In the meantime, I call everyone to look and settle down, if you are ready to condescendingly treat mistakes.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I also ask everything that you don‚Äôt like or, on the contrary, like it, send it to me by email - brain@aroundme.ru ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>3rd place</strong> <br> <a href="http://picfor.me/"><img title="Pickforme.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e3/a9c/f81/1e3a9cf81c85d5aa680cb2488fd2b963.jpg" alt="Pickforme.ru" width="196" height="64"></a> <br>  <a href="http://picfor.me/">PicForMe</a> <br>  Our answer is FFFound.com.  Online bookmarking service for images.  Very nice and neat startup.  It seems to me that everything was done very conveniently.  Nothing extra.  The project has already been translated into 4 languages, including Polish. <br><br>  <strong>Zinich (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúA startup does not claim to be the ideal, it‚Äôs just at the testing stage.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>We decided to entrust the honorary role of the tester to the habrasoobshchestvo (and didn‚Äôt lose it) because there are a lot of adequate people in terms of coding and design.</em>  <em>From the side, as they say, more visible.</em>  <em>And critical and harsh remarks like yours bear special value for us, dear Explanent!</em>  <em>So that you special thanks!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>As for cloning, I can say that we didn‚Äôt try to invent a wheel, but wanted to put together the best of existing identical services.</em>  <em>Evolution, her mother!).</em>  <em>If we succeed in it or not, time will tell! ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>2nd place</strong> <br> <a href="http://metaid.ru/"><img title="MetaId.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c1/f80/d89/1c1f80d895d7d032cc67cd2ff76c5eb7.jpg" alt="MetaId.ru" width="155" height="63"></a> <br>  <a href="http://metaid.ru/">MetaID</a> <br>  Very ambitious project.  He promises not to impose on us "any restrictions on communication with other people. To read what another person writes and to receive information about a wide variety of events related to him, you do not need to register on those sites where this person is registered." <br><br>  <strong>Daniil Bratchenko (Developer)</strong> : <em>‚ÄúThis is not a social network.</em>  <em>It is a tool necessary for normal existence in a global social graph.</em>  <em>Just because it is not a social network in its current sense, we do not need to artificially create restrictions for users.</em>  <em>And our users will be able to take full advantage of the communication technologies provided by the worldwide network. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>1 place</strong> <br> <a href="http://www.songsterr.com/"><img title="Songsterr.com" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/cfa/a7b/bb1cfaa7bdabc121966a05f51321709e.jpg" alt="Songsterr.com" width="160" height="102"></a> <br>  <a href="http://songsterr.com/">Songsterr</a> <br>  The development team from Rostov has created a magnificent project, oriented to the west.  And in August, within its framework, a service was launched that was losing tablature.  The news of this was on Techcrunch.  The idea and its implementation are fascinating.  Takes real pride for the guys. <br><br>  <b>Developers</b> : <i>‚ÄúIn total, the project (since the launch - approx. Author) was visited by 65 thousand people, while a large percentage of our audience from Brazil, France and Germany came to us as a pleasant surprise, where the project was lit up on television.</i>  <i>Based on user feedback, we came to the conclusion that the most promising development of the project is assistance in learning to play the guitar.</i>  <i>We took into account the phenomenal popularity among guitarists of the Guitar Pro program and the huge number of Guitar Pro files written by enthusiasts, and created a server application that can play Guitar Pro files in a user-friendly interface. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  PS With a recent post about the best startups of the year, only three projects intersect;) <br>  PS Augustus is not over yet.  I know.  September 10-ka will also appear on the 25th day =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37998/</a></p>
