  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For holivaru about managers - about the results and products</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuing the theme started by the article “ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165091/">13 reasons not to be a manager</a> ” and continued in “ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165147/">5 reasons to be a manager</a> ”, I want to draw attention to this aspect of the work of abstract “managers” as the product of their labor.  From my own experience, I know that a lack of understanding of this aspect is characteristic of both the developers and the “managers” themselves.  And where there is a lack of understanding, there are conflicts, and holivars, and a scornful attitude both to one’s own work and to the work of one’s colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  An important prerequisite for the formulation of the product of the work of a “manager” is well formed comrade.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Winter_mute/">Winter_mute</a> in the comments to the "5 reasons ...": <blockquote>  It seems to me that the most adequate motivation to be a manager is the desire to do something that one person cannot, in principle, </blockquote>  The presence of a complex task, the fulfillment of which requires the organization of joint work of a group of different specialists, and the desire to solve it are necessary conditions for the appearance of the role of “manager” on the scene. <br><br>  Actually the wording: The <b>product of the work of the “manager” is the project team or division of the company (it’s still a team) that can effectively work independently and interact normally with all related teams.</b>

      If it is simpler, the tasks of a “manager”: <br>  - “build” a team that can work together for the desired result with a sufficient measure of efficiency (measure depends on the circumstances) <br>  - “to nastapit” the process of work within the team so that it allows a way convenient for the participants to do the necessary work <br>  - “customize” the interaction of the Team with other departments of the company or with the customer so that the communication takes place with a minimum of interference with the main work of the Team and maximum effectiveness <br><br>  In English: I'm not a manager.  I'm an engineer  I build Project Teams, set up relations and environment.  Then it works ... sometimes ... and needs. <br><br>  “Managers”, as we know, are different: products, team leads, products, accounts, and other tops.  But I dare say that the proposed formulation of the product is valid for any management activity, only the scale and structure of the Team, as well as the complexity of the external (with respect to the Team) environment change. <br><br>  To perform its task and obtain the required product, the “manager” works with people and with information.  Such work requires specific knowledge and certain features of a character, different from the knowledge and features inherent to developers, testers, administrators and other IT professionals.  You need to be able to communicate with a variety of people, regardless of personal sympathies, carefully distribute information inside and outside the work team, work in the mode of constant “interruptions”, “translate” “thought streams” into the format of requirements and rules for one party, and into the format reports and plans for another.  All this is quite difficult, “eats nerves”, and leaves little time and energy for creative activities that require flow and concentration. <br><br>  However, the result of the work of the “manager,” as I think, is worth the effort.  When you see a successful Team, which “pulls” complex projects, gradually grows, takes pride in its work and contribution to the development of products demanded by society, people in which can grow and develop as professionals and earn honestly enough for a normal life with family and children - you feel some pride or something, and faith in the inevitability of a bright future is growing stronger.  The more such successful teams will be, in different companies, cities and states - the better will be our common Tomorrow. <br><br>  Returning to the subject of articles "13 reasons not to be a manager" and "5 reasons to be a manager" I want to mention a couple of points. <br><br>  The problems described in the first of them are characteristic of large companies, in which often the task itself, which needs to be solved with the help of a team, and for which a “manager” is needed, is greatly eroded and the “manager” himself may not be fully understood. and his immediate leadership.  It is possible to deal with such situations - if the management has retained a certain level of adequacy, it will never interfere with an intelligent manager to effectively deal precisely with his task, with his section of general work.  For such “workers” even in large state-owned companies, sometimes they create “special conditions”, without “additional activities” and “loads”, and forgive a certain eccentricity and “unformat” of behavior without listing “disloyal”.  Try to find your task, and do it in a really real way.  If it does not work out - there is always a way out, in the form of a job change.  Although there is still a question of personal motivation - for some “managers” a high salary in the current place of work is more important than the meaning of their own activities, and the habit of whining and complaining, but not changing anything, becomes a part of nature.  This is not “hitting” on the author of the article, but just a note from personal experience. <br><br>  The position of the author of the second article inspires respect and, in general, is characteristic of young and intelligent "managers" whom the management gives (and sometimes even helps) to do their job qualitatively.  I would like to wish the author a long and successful path in professional development. <br><br>  And, by the way, finding new tasks, the solution of which will help the development of the company, is also part of the work of the “manager”. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165321/</a></p>
