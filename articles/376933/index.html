  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern ways of online communication of teachers and students</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Modern IT-technologies provide a whole range of tools for teachers to communicate with students, not only during school hours, but also outside schools.  They are especially relevant for class leaders who are looking for new, non-standard methods of rallying their class, increasing authority in the eyes of children, and establishing friendly ties with their pupils.  How accessible they are to teachers and how skillfully they use them is another topic for discussion.  I want to dedicate this post to those innovative teachers who do not stop at standard teaching and communication methods and are constantly looking for new ideas to realize their vocation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c63/7ba/340/c637ba3406030f5a19c0669b7f788702.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Group class on Facebook or VKontakte</b> <br><br>  These social networks provide many opportunities for communication between people.  In Facebook or VKontakte groups and accounts, you can update statuses, post news, announcements, photos, videos.  And access to all this information is simultaneously unlimited number of people: students, teachers and even parents. <br>  In such groups, schoolchildren will be able to ask questions about their studies to each other and the teachers and promptly receive answers to them.  Teachers, on the other hand, have the opportunity to initiate discussions, raising children's interest in learning, posting various videos, photos, text documents and other materials so that students can prepare for a particular lesson.

      <b>Twitter class account</b> <br><br>  In Twitter, as in other social networks, you can post news, reminders, announcements - all that concerns the life of the class.  And thanks to the convenient search for hashtags, each user can easily find the information he needs.  In this network you can also communicate with each other, ask questions, post your comments, quotes, etc. <br><br>  <b>School blogs and / or teachers</b> <br><br>  Ordinary paper diaries to record their thoughts gradually still go into oblivion.  The reason for this is the ever-expanding possibilities of online blogging.  With the help of the latter, the child will be able not only to learn to express his thoughts, but also to share them - let him not with the whole world, but at least with his classmates.  For example, you can put up a discussion on the topic covered or a trip on a tour, as well as talk about new films, music, books, etc., and illustrate it all with your own photos and videos. <br><br>  <b>YouTube account</b> <br><br>  Many advanced teachers use YouTube videos in their lessons to make them more interactive, as fun and interesting for children as possible.  So why not create your own videos in school programs?  The children will surely like to watch their fellow practitioners explain what they have learned, discuss books and films, give their interpretation to what they see and read, comment on the events taking place, etc. <br><br>  <b>Instagram account</b> <br><br>  As they say, it's better to see once than hear a hundred times.  Instagram provides unique opportunities to publish photos that tell about class life much better than words.  Here everyone will be able to publish their own work related to school and class.  Ask the children to show their imagination by finding and publishing photos related to the topics being studied - for example, related to their favorite books or famous historical characters. <br><br>  <b>Mobile class management applications</b> <br><br>  Another tool for teachers would like to pay special attention.  These are mobile services for class management and communication with their wards.  Abroad mobile communication with the class through a program on a smartphone or tablet is still quite a popular thing.  Famous in the US, BlackBoard and Canvas services combine schools and campuses.  Through the application, the teacher gives students assignments, conducts testing, makes class schedules, notifies of upcoming events and reports important announcements.  Through the application, you can access online courses in various areas for pupils and students.  In BlackBoard, users can access information on the nearest libraries, cafes, recreation areas, etc. on campus. <br><br>  In Russia, similar analogues have not yet been noticed.  The closest to them in essence and content is the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/app">Shkolnik mobile app</a> , which serves as a platform for uniting classmates along with their class teacher.  Through the program, the teacher informs his class about homework assignments, corrects the schedule, publishes school news and announcements around the class, brings the topic up for discussion and receives feedback from each student.  The teacher can add interesting books, useful materials, tests, questionnaires - that is, everything that the children will be interesting and useful to get acquainted with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57d/21a/139/57d21a1397fc7b42afeafe364cc8eb36.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d88/ae2/e4e/d88ae2e4ed4ea6b8e8ab98779eb51a74.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d11/fee/148/d11fee148767c410dd075ec3d99497a2.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa2/97b/fa5/aa297bfa541fa9fdfa7992f5b1ead7ea.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Such a virtual space creates a sense of team cohesion, friendly relations with the class teacher.  A functional application that allows you to keep your <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_parents">electronic diary</a> allows you to always have at hand reliable information about homework and schedule.  By the way, integration of <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/app">the Shkolnik application</a> with the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_teachers">electronic magazine</a> is possible.  In this case, students will be available and their assessment. <br><br>  <b>A look into the future</b> <br><br>  If we assume what new communication tools are waiting for schools in the near future, then we can already predict that devices such as <b>ibeacon</b> will take the upper hand.  This beacon device will be installed at the school to send personalized messages to students or teachers.  For example, when students in 11th grade enter the school, their smartphones will receive a notification of the event, which is only related to eleventh-graders.  <i>"Guys!</i>  <i>Today at 13:00 in the auditorium will be a lecture on admission to the university.</i>  <i>We are waiting for you! ‚Äù</i> - such messages will come in the form of push-notifications through a special application for schoolchildren.  Thus, teachers and school administrators will be able to congratulate students on holidays, remind them of important events, send instructions and set up a positive message on the training wave. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376933/</a></p>
