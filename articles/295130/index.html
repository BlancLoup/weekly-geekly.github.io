  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why don't online sales go on sale?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day more and more online stores with a variety of goods are opening.  Each of them, as they themselves believe, has a unique concept and unique products.  However, after some time, after the site and social networking pages were created, advertising was launched and a couple thousand rubles was spent, sellers are surprised: not?!". <br><br>  On our site, about 200 medium and small online stores are now registered.  To one buyers come regularly and make purchases, while others do not spend a minute.  We at OneMarkt tried to understand the possible causes of low sales and ways to rectify the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f7a/8d4/6b1/f7a8d46b15d1dfa6864d7d449239dd14.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      1) Information about the store.  You need to spend a little time to clearly and clearly describe what the store does, where it takes the goods, and how much it works in the market.  The correct description of your store will help buyers begin to trust this store a little more. <br><br>  2) Links to social pages.  Nowadays, shops that do not have pages in social networks look strangely strange.  If you are selling on the Internet, always provide links to all your pages.  Perhaps the buyer wants to contact you there. <br><br>  3) Avatar / logo store.  This is one of the main details of recognition of your store.  Whether it‚Äôs our site, or a page in social networks, blogs, and email lists, customers will remember your logo and are more likely to want to return to you. <br><br>  4) Promo picture.  On OneMarkt each seller can upload a promotional image to his storefront.  There he can visually tell about the ongoing promotions and discounts, hold contests and sweepstakes, or post a unique offer.  When you open the store page, this is the first thing that the buyer sees. <br><br>  5) Product information.  Perhaps this is the most important part of the online store.  It is imperative that you always talk clearly and in detail about a product.  It is worth paying attention to such information as: where it is produced, size, weight, color, how much is in stock.  Spend time, but make a qualitative description of each product.  Put yourself in the buyer's place - would you buy your product? <br><br>  6) Shipping Information.  Not less important part in the store.  Try to also tell in detail how you will send the order, how long it will take, and most importantly, how much it will cost!  In our opinion, it is better to include the cost of delivery in the cost of the product itself, making delivery in this way "free."  In this case, it is much more likely that the customer will buy your product. <br><br>  7) Methods of payment.  Unfortunately, in Russia there is still a confidence in the prepayment of goods.  Buyers want to be 100% sure that they will not be deceived.  Try to offer the customer several ways to pay for your order.  Also try to find a way in which the customer can pay for the purchase upon receipt. <br><br>  8) Always in touch.  Specify how the customer can contact you.  Install the necessary applications on the phone so that the client can write or call you for free.  We recommend to always answer the call or message within 5 minutes.  This can increase customer confidence and make it loyal. <br><br>  As a result, we note that to create a good impression of your store, you need to spend time.  This is the only way to gain the trust of customers and make them loyal customers who will tell your friends and colleagues about you. <br><br>  Successful sales! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295130/</a></p>
