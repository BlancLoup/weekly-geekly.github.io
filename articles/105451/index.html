I will talk about my experience with the Samsung Apps Store, what could be the difficulty and what is the dry residue.  First there will be a theory, then practice.  I have tried to give as many tips as I can. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Accommodation in the Samsung Apps Store </h5><br>  I recall the process of placing the application in the store.  We create an application profile on developer.bada.com, then create the corresponding profile on seller.samsungapps.com.  I think that there will be no particular difficulties if you are familiar with English.  I liked the fact that for any country you can set a localized description, price policy and even the name. <br><br>  At the end, you need to upload the package (package, archive with the application) to the server.  Robots will conduct a primary analysis of the package - integrity, proper structure, manifest.  Then begins the multi-step process of acceptance into the store (approval).  Treat him as an exam for a strict teacher - patience and hard work all, and you should not wait for freebies.  The procedure consists of 5 levels: <br><ul><li>  <b>Registration - Complete status.</b>  Profile data, descriptions, screenshots, in general - everything that is declared about the application is checked.  Usually problems do not arise. </li><li>  <b>Approval - Pre-test.</b>  Deep package analysis.  It is done automatically.  For example, used privileges are <i>really</i> checked.  I failed this check only once, at the very first surrender. </li><li>  <b>Approval - Device Test.</b>  Surface running the application on the Bada-device.  It is carried out manually on the list of tests.  Koreans check if the application starts at all, whether the buttons are pressed, what will happen if you press the ‚Äúnot there‚Äù button or turn the device into a horizontal position.  I also failed this check only once. </li><li>  <b>Approval - Content Review.</b>  Manual content check.  The profile indicates for which age the application will be distributed.  There are clear rules by which the target age should be determined.  Criteria: porn, dirty language, violence and the like.  Also checked copyrights.  I had no problems with this - I handed over the peaceful utility. </li><li>  <b>Approval - Confirmation.</b>  The most interesting is heuristic verification.  There are no rules.  At this point, it checks if your application does what you have stated.  Quality and meaning are evaluated.  The last level is the most difficult.  I tried to pass it twice, and only on the third I was lucky. </li></ul>  After passing through all 5 levels, the application is finally placed in the store.  On the second, third and fourth in case of failure, the Koreans will send a detailed list of all errors, with comments and (device test) video (!).  After correcting errors on the list you should be skipped on.  However, at the last level, the change will take place before the first critical error.  You will also be provided with a detailed report and video.  After correcting the error, it is likely that they will find another one.

      The typical duration of a single attempt is two weeks.  Optimistic forecast - one week.  Pre-test does not take longer than a day, most of the time is spent on device test and confirmation.  After each failure, you need to create a manifest with a larger version on developer.bada.com and use it during the next build, otherwise the robot will not allow unloading the package.  The most embarrassing moment - during the delivery <b>can not be unloaded new version</b> .  This means that before unloading the updated package, you need to check ten times whether everything is fixed, whether new errors have appeared, etc.  Then it will be too late. <br><br><h5>  Tips </h5><br>  So, we have the Bada application, which we tested on the simulator and made sure that it works.  The first rule is based on bitter experience: the next mandatory step is to <b>check the application on the hardware</b> .  With each release of the new version.  Every time - completely.  If there is no iron, then you can use the Samsung RTL ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobiledev/102511">I already wrote about it</a> ).  For me it was the only way.  Not very convenient and has significant limitations, but for static things it works. <br><br>  During testing on the device, pay attention to even the smallest details, inscriptions, buttons, sizes, screen rotation.  Do not forget to <b>change the splash screen from default to your own</b> - this is a copyright infringement of Samsung.  White and black box methods should be applied.  This will save you time for device test. <br><br>  After extensive testing, you must <b>carefully review the code manually and determine the privileges used</b> .  The built-in analysis is good for nothing - in my code of three privileges, it did not identify any.  This step requires an excellent knowledge of the privilege system by heart, since  sometimes even the most obvious API calls are under a virtual lock.  This is useful for pre-test. <br><br><h5>  My success story </h5><br>  My application is BadaArchiver.  <a href="">Page in the store.</a>  This 7-Zip, compiled under Bada, wrapped in a GUI.  I‚Äôll say right away, if it were not for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/103521">my extensive experience with 7-Zip</a> , I could hardly have managed to port the code, and you shouldn‚Äôt rush to compete with me in the hope of a fast port.  A lot of little things, driven only by Igor Pavlov and me.  Sorry, carried away. <br>  I passed the application from the fifth attempt and spent 2 months on it.  I started as a complete newbie, with little experience developing on other mobile platforms. <br>  The first attempt failed on pre-test due to privileges.  I looked at Osp :: Media :: Image :: DecodeN (), which requires the Osp :: Media IMAGE privilege. <br>  The second attempt failed because of the default splash screen and unintended screen rotation.  I changed the screensaver, but simply banned the rotation. <br>  The third and fourth attempts failed due to serious shortcomings.  For example, I have not provided for action in case a memory card is not inserted. <br><br>  Examples of videos from Koreans in which they show errors: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PE9T1FLCBE8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNjC_OWGG3If2Y9nIRuHnzqfMAsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4oiWPuFgk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh8ubxuy8JMtiGyxUdAyqAQVhNuHg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I set the price of my creation $ 10 worldwide, except Russia.  Countrymen put 100 rubles, added a description in Russian and allowed to pay by SMS.  For two days of sales, I earned about $ 200.  I was surprised when I discovered it.  Nicely.  In a couple of weeks I can provide statistics. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  You can develop Bada applications.  The approval procedure is not the fastest, but as transparent and fair as possible.  Many details that are poorly covered in the official documentation, but all problems are solved.  Money is paid, the market is actively developing. <br>  Perhaps I have nothing more to add.  As always, happy to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105451/</a></p>
