Each task you encounter turns out to be more difficult than you imagined and perhaps you are accompanied by constant problems in your life‚Äôs journey? <br>  Often we find ourselves in stressful situations and it is extremely important not to give up and not lose inner motivation in order to emerge victorious from a difficult life situation.  In general, get comfortable and meet, 5 ways to stay motivated and achieve your goals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Think less and do more!</b> <br><br>  Stop postponing difficult work because it seems daunting or boring to you.  The more you worry about what you have to do, the less you really want to do it, so start doing it right now - this is the best way to cope with a lack of motivation.  You will certainly have a million reasons to refuse to do this unattractive job, but believe me, as soon as you begin to do it, you will feel more confident in order to continue it.

      <b>2. Plan your time and stick to the plan.</b> <br><br>  Without a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is to be done, you can be intimidated by any upcoming major project or responsible work.  You can easily be led astray by the desire to postpone the beginning of their realization until the last minute. <br>  Just set aside a few hours a day at the same time to do this daunting job.  Be clear about what tasks you are going to complete in these two hours.  If you want to lose weight or exercise, free up a couple of evenings to go to the gym and stick to your plan. <br><br>  <b>3. Set goals and reward yourself for achieving them.</b> <br><br>  One of the easiest ways to self-motivate is to set achievable short-term goals.  If you start a new business, you want to earn for example 40 thousand dollars in 5 years - this is a long-term goal.  Break these 5 years into stages lasting half a year and decide on the goals you want to achieve within each of these periods. <br>  You will feel that you are capable of more when you accomplish the tasks set before you, but if you are unlucky, you can at least analyze it in time and understand what your mistake was to correct your plans for the next 6 months. <br><br>  <b>4. Add a little variety.</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs pretty boring to do the same job and maintain a high level of self-motivation, so if you feel that you need variables, find them.  If you are tired of exercising in the gym, do a run in the park, if you are constantly working in your home office, try a couple of hours to work elsewhere.  Even small changes in your daily routines are a great way to stay motivated. <br><br>  <b>5. Leave time for rest and avoid recycling.</b> <br><br>  Many people are immersed in a project or enterprise and this takes all their free time, strength and energy, exhausts them and in a few months leads to the inability to act effectively.  The most important step to stay motivated is to find time for rest and relaxation.  Take a step back and appreciate your own achievements, take time for your favorite activity, spend a few hours with your family and friends. <br><br>  Sometimes demotivation can overwhelm you.  Do not fall into depression and do not give up all your undertakings, do not create a precedent, refuse to fulfill the intended plan, just lower the bar of your expectations a little.  Make a decision to work before lunch or in the evening, but by all means complete something significant this morning.  This would allow you to be proud of yourself and stay motivated. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54167/</a></p>
