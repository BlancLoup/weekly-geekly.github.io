I must confess to you that I, as a religious fanatic, am a completely happy man, but of the last 16 years, out of my 32, I have been observing around me an increasingly aggravated picture of the struggle of society with the absurdity of life.  The fact is that many of my friends work in large companies, where office sansara is mercilessly spreading, and I, so it happened, never had a hard schedule and an overwhelming corporate car behind my back, for which I praise Allah day and night .  Being at a considerable distance from these problems and being emotionally not involved in them, doing science in my pleasure at the Scientific Research Institute of System Technologies (and earning a living from my own IT business), using miraculous system analysis, I will try to summarize everything I know about . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with I will give an introduction to my incompetent research.  I write something based on stories, and something from personal experience or experience deeply felt in close communication with customers. <br>  1. I usually catch up with my familiar corporate employees at the weekend and in a state of " <b>weekend neurosis</b> ."  In short, this is complete apathy, lethargy and indifference, which attack people after a busy week in the office.  Usually, this condition is taken as a form of relaxed rest from working life, but this is a deceptive feeling.  During the holidays, if you do not artificially load yourself with vigorous activity, it can last for weeks.  Many IT people even come up with projects for the soul for weekends or holidays, so now the May days have come, and let's honestly raise our hands, who sat down for their favorite activity?  I myself raise the first one. <br>  2. Secondly, this is a <b>terrifying senselessness</b> , with which all business processes in 99% of companies are imbued, and in order not to lose your place, you need to vigorously pretend that projects are full of meaning.  Fortunately, if there is a healthy sense of humor that does not allow believing in the reality of what is happening in the company, and if it is not there, then a serious esoteric self-embarrassment takes place, accompanied by standard phrases and clever looks without a shadow of doubt.  For doubters, there are usually express courses. <br>  3. Well, about <b>procrastination in the workplace</b> , Habr has been discussing for a long time, I‚Äôll just remind you for the sake of completeness, the essence is unwillingness to start necessary, important and urgent matters, limited to endless automatic and empty activities. <br>  4. " <b>Delivery in 2 seconds</b> " - many complain about this strange symptom of company management.  The decision was made and the results were needed right away, the meeting was not over yet, and the impatient was already started, no time was allocated for implementation, it was unbearable to wait.  Google is to blame here, yielding results for 2 seconds or even the habit of going to the supermarket, where everything is ready - I don‚Äôt know, but the desire to receive everything immediately became the norm. <br>  5. <b>Mindless actions</b> .  The problem has been revealed, it is necessary to urgently do something to solve it, but what exactly is not so important.  To calm you just need to do, and as quickly as possible. <br>  6. Permanent " <b>informational nipple</b> ": listening to music while working, reading news, music in the car, regular SMS and Internet (read and write in transport, on the move, frozen in the middle of the street, at home in the restroom and even under the pillow), TV with news and TV shows, and then radio, for smart ones - a book, well, the Internet, before work, during and after it, before going to bed, it's already an hour with a toothbrush in your mouth.  We are on our way to the human of a new formation, a human aggregator, a human hub. <br>  7. <b>Degradation of social activity</b> in the network from writing meaningful texts to <b>copy-paste and likes</b> .  At first it was FIDO and Usenet, then mail, forums, LiveJournal, later - social networks and social applications.  Who remembers the meaningful communication?  Now, however, the loss of meaning and the replacement of creativity with external irritant of attention.  Habr is one of the few islands where you can see not only links, funny pictures and quotes from the eternal, but material that embodies personal opinion, experience, work and a certain person‚Äôs position. <br>  8. <b>Startup neurosis</b> - many in IT are familiar with this, but this is not only in IT now, any activity is perceived as a start-up (it looks like an infection), which is accompanied by: the fear that someone will do it before us (when they are jealous of an idea or they are jealous of the potential audience), super secret about all ideas (even if they are obvious), desire to score more domains, and finally, the all-consuming striving for <b>ZVI</b> (to capture all the Internet). <br>  9. <b>General information overexcitement</b> without the slightest useful exhaust.  This is a strange state of consciousness typical of postmodern society, when all materials become very accessible, being two clicks away from you, they lose their value.  A lot of context, all the ideas at once in the attention, attention is not enough, it dissipates and information prostration comes. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e5/a09/ed8/6e5a09ed86e664ebef2b9f127417d296.jpg">  Something tells me that all these symptoms have the same roots.  This <b>repression has been swept away by activity</b> . <br><br><h4>  The greater the capitalization, the greater the confusion </h4><br>  Analyzing what businesses are doing, I came to the conclusion that 90% of them are built on the exploitation of primitive needs, delusions and fears, it can be delusions and fears of customers (consumers of goods and services), and maybe - delusions and fears of business owners.  In the first case, there is a conscious intimidation of the audience, tough propaganda and the spread of dependence on the goods and services, and in the second - a bubble of pride of the founders is inflated.  The more money is invested, the harder it is to get rid of the desire to think that we are on the right path.  Say something to the leadership rarely anyone can, and they will hear if they do not want to hear.  How to work in such an organization?  Subconsciously, every employee feels that the flow of directives is either immoral or meaningless.

    <h4>  But you can always hide by closing your eyes. </h4><br>  So they close their eyes, taking up all the flows of attention with the ‚Äúinformational teat‚Äù or going to parallel worlds, depicting vigorous activity and thinking about Friday.  And a little later it turns out that all these unhealthy methods had a side effect, prevented us from remembering the meaning of existence.  Of course, they prevented me from remembering anything, but it is difficult to unlearn the nipples. <br><br><h4>  Did you remember before? </h4><br>  It seems that they used to recall, but earlier there were ready answers.  After all, there are two main approaches to the semantic fulfillment of existence: religious (mystical) and scientific (atheistic).  But does everyone choose them freely?  There is a certain fashion for this and the conditionality of the cultural context.  Well, in order not to go to the holivars, we will assume that everyone chooses for himself.  Mystical, if it is based on a young, lively and pure faith, it is beautiful, but if it came to the patterns and monotonous automatism of the old cult, then it is terrible, even atheists do not argue with that.  The scientific approach, on the contrary, is terrible while fresh and young, and it becomes beautiful when science moves from the euphoria of uncontrollable progress, reversal of rivers and the preparation of all life, to mature wisdom.  But in spite of their cardinal difference, they have one thing in common - both are forgotten and replaced by liquid, administered intravenous informational swill. <br><br><h4>  And then what is the world holding on to? </h4><br>  According to IT experience, I can say that always and everywhere, the very core of the systems, the core and the main working code, is written by one or several super-specialists who, despite everything, in a strange way, maintain composure and adequacy in any conditions.  They are moving not at the company's course, but in their own way, falling out of a common vision, and creating without any motivation for this, simply because they cannot otherwise.  Units, a handful of people, do all the deepest and most important, all programming languages, DBMS, operating systems, complex application packages.  In theory, they need to be cherished and cherished, backed up and cloned, but they are only exploited.  Moreover, these people themselves do not notice this at all and will be very surprised if they are told that someone is exploiting them.  Take care of them! <br><br><h4>  Soothe the excited </h4><br>  If individual readers still cannot calm down after reading the introductory information about the <b>Startup Neurosis</b> , then I have a few reassuring facts: <br>  1. Never in my 16 years experience in IT has anyone done or launched an idea into life before the authors of the idea did it, if they really gave birth to it from themselves, rather than licked it.  Authors always have an advantage over repeaters, they have access to a clean source of meaning and creativity, and cannot be replaced with any reactive brainstorming. <br>  2. Super secrecy is superfluous, because words are only mental labels, on which everyone hangs his semantic load, therefore, even having recorded your conversations, it will be possible to restore only the formal meaning, and the deep meaning will always remain with you. <br>  3. And finally, <b>ZVI</b> "(to capture all the Internet) is a great and beautiful idea, no need to make fun of it. <br><br>  <b>UPD: I will</b> describe another case by example.  It happens to me that a lot of things also accumulate, which I would not like to do, but it seems to be necessary.  One weekend I even prepared a whole list for the page of such cases for myself, looked at it, and it became so nauseous - I crossed out everything and made a completely meaningless and non-commercial project all weekend, and my happiness was restored.  I hope to tell you about the project next time. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2: I</b> also wanted to say something about hipsters, but I don‚Äôt know where to stick them here. <br><br>  <b>UPD 3:</b> They write ‚Äúwhere is the solution?‚Äù Is reasonable, but there are many of them and I somehow hope that they will be searched for.  I swear to promise to make a review of my known meanings and ways to meaningfulness. <br><br>  <b>UPD 4:</b> Review of the Doctor of Philosophy Mikhail Minakov: ‚ÄúFear of total meaningfulness, Timur!  Otherwise you will become a philosopher. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143044/</a></p>
