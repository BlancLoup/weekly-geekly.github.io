  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to cheat the Corporation of Good or buy Nexus 7 in Russia without Google Play Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148463/">recent article</a> on Habr√©, we already talked about how to buy on Google Play in the Devices section right from our backwater.  The topic is undoubtedly interesting: the Nexus 7 is not yet found in Russia and nearby countries, and the Galaxy Nexus is likely to cost you much more if, of course, you do not live in Moscow or St. Petersburg.  The only problem is that the recipe turned out to be somewhat unstable: Personally, the Kindness Corporation has rightly suspected my personal data fraud, and judging by the comments, I was not alone. <br><br>  The week of torment and attempts to deceive Google Wallet led to a positive result in the form of the ability to buy anything and anywhere on Google Play, moreover, the solution, strictly speaking, lay on the surface and did not require any complicated actions. <br><br>  Under the cut a new recipe and quite a bit of screenshots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, let's hope that you have not yet tried to make a purchase and you don‚Äôt have a Google Wallet letter on your inbox stating that your account has been blocked.  If so, you will have to create a new Google Account from scratch specifically for shopping.  Blocked funds will return to the card literally within a few hours while you deal with the rest.

    <h5>  1. Shipito. </h5><br>  The first thing to do is to create a <a href="http://www.shipito.com/">shipito</a> account.  In principle, now there are many alternatives, some of them are a bit cheaper, but I am a supporter of proven solutions.  You will be asked for a $ 8.5 advance payment, which will immediately be credited to your account.  Later they will be able to pay for the services of the service.  Now is what we came here for.  The ‚ÄúYour Shipito and Home Address‚Äù tab will appear in your account, in the left you can find two of your American addresses and another Hong Kong one.  We choose the address (I personally chose the address in California, but I was advised to choose the second one after the fact: it is tax-free and you can save about $ 30) and write it down, it will be useful to us several times. <br><br><h5>  2. Qiwi Visa Card. </h5><br>  The next service we need is <a href="https://w.qiwi.ru/">a Qiwi wallet</a> .  He is pleased with us that Qiwi is not particularly jealous about the accuracy of the personal data you provide (as opposed to the Good Corporation).  Here it is necessary, first of all, to register the wallet itself, then create a virtual card.  I personally find it more convenient to use QVC, since it has a common account with the Qiwi account itself, which I also sometimes use, besides - it is a bit cheaper to use than QVV.  In the data on the cardholder indicate the same address from the shipito.  If you already have QVC - you can simply create a new one, the cost of the card is small. <br><br><h5>  3. Google Wallet. </h5><br>  It remains to connect the newly created card to Google Wallet.  We go, we create an account, if it is not there, we specify the same address from Shipito, and where we need to specify the phone we write any abracadabra (Google does not check it), the main thing is that in the beginning there would be the correct phone code of the place where you are supposedly : I for california indicated code (310).  When you connect the card to your account, it will block $ 1.  Google will return it before the second coming, so you can forget about it. <br><br><h5>  4. Tor. </h5><br>  If you now try to go to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices">https://play.google.com/store/devices</a> - Google will say that you are not living there and talk, and even more so - it is not going to trade with you.  The solution to this problem is simple - the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> browser.  Download, set.  To show the browser that we want to inform the whole world that we are in America, we need to add only two lines to the <i>{Tor} \ Data \ Tor \ torrc file</i> : <br><br> <code>StrictExitNodes 1</code> <br> <code>exitnodes {us}</code> <br> <br>  This is enough for Google Play to kindly open all the doors to you. <br><br><h5>  5. Purchase, Round 1. </h5><br>  Now we need to actually place an order.  We go to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices">Google Play</a> , choose what and how much we need, make out the purchase through the created Google Wallet account.  Money on the card is blocked, Google writes us a letter of thanks, and we are waiting for the outcome.  There is a good chance that this will all end, the payment will pass and you will only need to redirect the package with the shipito after a couple of days.  Do not forget that the USPS does not carry lithium and you need to choose Airmail Priority! <br><br>  But it can go wrong. <br><br>  Then in a couple of minutes Google will send you another email with the title ‚ÄúOrder Canceled‚Äù.  The text of the letter may be different, depending on the severity of the crime, in which Google suspects you.  It is important for us that now instead of the page of a Google Wallet account we will see a stub of a typical contact to support service: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Account Verification</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/30344215/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80/Google%20Wallet/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  But we are honest people and all the documents about it in our hands!  We scan any document confirming the identity (I used a Russian passport altogether, you can take a foreign passport or rights), and then the main number of our program: we make a statement on the card.  To do this, go back to the Qiwi wallet and go to the ‚ÄúWorking with cards‚Äù section, there in the ‚ÄúReports‚Äù section, select the desired card, set the expiry date for the report and generate a report, and then an extract.  If the card is new, as I had with you, something like this should come out: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Card statement</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/30344215/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80/Google%20Wallet/%D0%92%D1%8B%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  On the right are the same data that Google wants from us.  You do not need to do this; we will only gloss over there our card number, except for the last four digits (you never know ...) and a helmet received in support of Google as a Bank Statement. <br><br>  Google immediately assures you by mail that it will understand within three working days.  I received the answer already the day of the first (adjusted for the difference in time zones). <br><br><h5>  6. Purchase, Round 2. </h5><br>  Finally, Google Wallet starts working again, and we have a typical letter of apology in the box: <br><br> <code>Hello,</code> <br> <code>Thank you for submitting your documents. We have reviewed your verification information and can confirm that your account is fully active. You may now place orders through Google Wallet. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.</code> <br> <code>Please keep in mind that your previous order, if any, was cancelled. You may visit the seller's website and place a new order. Please note that you may notice activity on your card statement corresponding to orders cancelled in the last 14 days. This activity is an authorization confirmation with your bank, not an actual charge, and the authorization will be removed from your account within 1-14 business days, depending on your bank.</code> <br> <code>Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced and we thank you for your cooperation during this process. Feel free to reply to this email if you have any additional questions.</code> <br> <code>Sincerely,</code> <br> <code>The Google Wallet Team</code> <br> <br>  We can go back to Google Play with peace of mind and place a new order, already completely legal from the Good Corporation's point of view.  Within one and a half to two working days, if the goods are in stock, you will receive it at the shipito warehouse.  Again, do not forget about Airmail Priority!  From there, delivery takes an average of two to four weeks. <br><br>  At this quest is completed, it remains to wait and become the happy owner of the coveted device. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> In connection with the release of Nexus 4, a new <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161791/">instruction</a> from the habrakchanin <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andrey_snegovik/">andrey_snegovik has appeared</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148883/</a></p>
