  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Merging Oracle and Sun, prospects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been working with Oracle technologies for more than 5 years.  But I have no direct relation to this corporation, and everything written here is my personal opinion. <br>  I want to share my vision of what will happen if Oracle buys Sun. <br>  Why do I want to highlight this whole topic?  not enough conversations in the comments. <br>  No, I believe that the fate of this transaction will greatly change IT, in the near future. <br>  Judge for yourself in connection with the latest acquisitions, the ‚Äúred giant‚Äù can offer a full range of applications necessary for a successful business: these are document and mail systems;  ERP, BI analytics and even a billing system. <br>  They have no doubt the most powerful DB, with the largest list of options, including full OLAP, in 11g. <br>  Plus they release their own framework for the development of <a href="">Oracle ADF</a> . <br>  And now they are getting almost a monopoly on Java technology, plus Sun's hardware business. <br>  But I digress, back to the topic topic <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first about technologies which Orakle will be glad. <br>  First of all - Oracle will be glad Java - in fact, Oracle has become a monopolist, I don‚Äôt know how the US Antimonopoly Committee will react to this.  In general, on the approach of J3EE and in theory it should have been released by Oracle and Sun, but now only Oracle?  or another large technology consumer will connect to the process - SAP ??  It is not clear yet, but it does not matter in principle. <br>  Second, Oracle will be pleased with Sun‚Äôs development of File Systems.  Luster and ZFS will definitely find their place in Oracle technologies: OCFS, OCFS2, ASM.  I think Luster should breathe new life into a not entirely successful in the first version of OCFS. <br>  Third, of course, Solaris, as is well known at the moment, Oracle is actively promoting its Oracle Unbreakable Linux.  It is not clear whether Oracle will promote two operating systems?  On the one hand, this is quite resource-intensive, on the other hand, Oracle will have 30,000 employees, Sun staff, and it‚Äôs necessary to take them up. <br>  But there are also technologies that Oracle is a bit alien.  First of all it is StarOffice.  Why does he have an Oracle?  Initially, we should recall the words of the president of Oracle: "We are not doing what we can not be first."  Here Oracle corporation does not shine as in office packages - M $ they rule and it will be difficult to move them.  The only way to rewrite this office package is under the web.  In this case, oracle will be able to use powerful word processors in such products as Collaboration Suite.  It is also possible to integrate into their Document database (something like a centralized file storage) - they will receive an analogue of Google Docs.  This is all provided that they translate the project to the web.  But I think it is more realistic to completely transfer the rights to this product in favor of OpenOffice.net. <br>  For GlassFish, MySQL, I would not worry, Oracle has more than one database;  There are free Berkeley DB, XML DB;  there will also be muskul, plus GlassFish as a free equivalent of WebLogic / ApplicationServer.  They will support them, but their development will not be a priority for a number of reasons. <br>  But NetBeans is likely to only enrich the functionality of JDeveloper, I very much doubt that Oracle will abandon it.  This IDE spent too long in the database, there were not many successful releases, before the release of 10 and 11, oh, I don‚Äôt believe that Oracle will simply switch to NetBeans. <br>  And finally, an open-ended question: what will happen to Sun's server business, as well as its Storage solutions.  In general, current trends speak in favor of the fact that Oracle will offer customers a full range of software and hardware tools for deploying any application.  This is supported by ExaData, a joint project of Oracle and HP, hardware solutions HP + Oracle Linux + any turnkey DB.  After the takeover of Sun, Oracle will well have all the necessary resources for the independent release of such solutions.  They will do this without fail, there is only one thing.  The failure of the SPARC processors.  Here, as a Database Specialist, it is difficult for me to predict anything, I hope that people will have their comments on this matter. <br>  <b>UPD1</b> <br>  And most importantly, I forgot. <br>  And the most important thing is virtualization technology.  Oracle recently started digging in this direction.  It was developed by their Oracle VM, who came across a very poor product in terms of what is an analogue of IBM AIX.  The virtual machine itself is essentially RedHat, it can only virtualize the same RedHats.  However, a very convenient web-interface is able: Oracle VM manager, for managing a virtual machine park. <br>  However, the acquisition of the virtual box will allow you to compete with IBM and Dell (which owns EMC, which owns VMWare). <br>  Without virtualization, it is difficult to develop on this base.  In general, Orakle has a strict three-tier software development ideology. <br>  A productive server - a server that is inviolable, cannot be developed on it, for obvious reasons - up to version 11, the database had problems that when a change was made in the source code of an application, there was a high probability of disabling most of the application. <br>  In this regard, you must keep two servers: Test and Dev. <br>  Dev - for development, usually behind the productive system for many months. <br>  Test - for testing new developments, as a rule, it is an exact copy of a productive server, obtained by cloning, most often once a month, it happens even when tests are covered with a productive server every night. <br>  Agree to rather bloated architecture.  And without virtualization, it is difficult to accompany such a fleet of vehicles. </div>
