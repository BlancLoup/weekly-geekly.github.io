Part I</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, Habr! <br>  Let's talk about people. <br><br>  Immediately answer the question "What is it?" <br>  HDI is a model for determining the profile of an individual. <br><br>  In the free access there is almost no information about the typology of HDI.  At best, there is only a brief description drawn up in the best traditions of NLP and the art of sales, smoothly flowing into the ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù section for ordering training from German consulting companies. 
      <br>

      Despite the fact that this typology has an interesting and deep enough scientific background, it has a wide potential of practical application for management, motivation and delegation of work to staff.  Its special value is a relatively small threshold of entry.  And already with a little experience of using, you can quickly find the right approaches to working with people. <br><br>  HDI knowledge will be especially helpful to project managers.  Since the PMs should be the leaders ‚Äúdoubly‚Äù (if not ‚Äúfrom God‚Äù), since they more often face the need to lead and motivate employees who are not directly subordinate to them, and therefore do not have the necessary amount of administrative resources, which increases the risk of disrupting the project due to the fact that ‚Äúthe immediate boss Vasya gave him a task with a higher priority‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhy should Vasya do additional work‚Äù.  Of course, such subtleties depend on the development of the project culture in the organization (level of maturity of the organization), and will not be considered in this article, but a definite parallel can be drawn.  Also, this article will be useful for managers of functional units who want to hone their leadership skills and better understand the capabilities and needs of their people. <br><br>  And I would be very happy if, after reading this article, some managers understood why their employees do one job better than another;  why an external uncertainty and lack of independence of an employee can actually be a gross mistake on the part of management in delegation and motivation.  Any feedback is welcome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Short story </h5><br>  This typology was invented by Ned Hermann and was actively developed in the 70s.  At one time, he was a leader in executive education at General Electric in the USA.  It is interesting that Hermann was a physicist by training, and in addition to his manager‚Äôs activities, he showed himself to be a singer, an artist, a sculptor.  Perhaps it was such a diversified development of himself that enabled him to single out ‚Äúdominants‚Äù in thinking and acting.  His model was widely adopted in the 80s and is actively used today in the field of personnel development. <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  The model is based on the scientific findings of brain researchers <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Roger Sperry</a> , Paul MacLean (who is a neurophysiologist) and others.  Namely, the functional distinction between the left and right hemispheres of the brain and the ternary division of the brain hemispheres, the limbic system and the trunk.  Hermann distributes thinking and behavior into 4 categories along two axes.  Thus, the left and right hemispheres are arranged one by one, the upper section ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum">Cerebrum</a> , the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3">Ultimate brain</a> ) and the lower section (the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">limbic system</a> and the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">trunk</a> ) are located on the other. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/288/212/c5f/288212c5f21753c7c5f434a862272a1d.jpg" alt="Model Hermann HDI"><br>  Each person has a model of behavior and thinking that he prefers.  The choice of model is determined by various personal factors and is a continuation of his personality, a way of self-expression.  These models show how he thinks, communicates, learns, teaches, makes decisions, and so on. <br><br>  These dominants (dominant patterns of thinking and action) were formed on the basis of innate characteristics associated with upbringing, educational and social environments.  4 quadrants correspond to 4 dominants that ultimately shape thinking and behavior. <br><br>  For ease of perception, each quadrant has its working title (alternative names in parentheses): <br><ul><li>  <b>A</b> - Analyst </li><li>  <b>B</b> - Administrator (organizer, bureaucrat) </li><li>  <b>C</b> - Empath (sociologist, psychologist) </li><li>  <b>D</b> - Novator (creator, creative) </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Dominant description </h6><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <b>A</b> </td><td>  <b>B</b> </td><td>  <b>C</b> </td><td>  <b>D</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Attributes </td><td><ul><li>  Analytical </li><li>  Authoritarian </li><li>  Critical </li><li>  Based on facts </li><li>  Logical </li><li>  Mathematical </li><li>  Quantitative </li><li>  Rational </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Order lover </li><li>  Conservative </li><li>  Controlling </li><li>  Detailed </li><li>  Data buff </li><li>  Inflexible </li><li>  Procedural </li><li>  Structured </li><li>  Punctual </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Emotional </li><li>  Intuitive </li><li>  Musical </li><li>  People oriented </li><li>  Spiritual </li><li>  Symbolic </li><li>  Communicative </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Artistic </li><li>  Full </li><li>  fantasy </li><li>  Intuitive (aimed at solving) </li><li>  Does several things at once. </li><li>  Adventurer </li><li>  Maverick </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>  Appropriate skills and abilities </td><td><ul><li>  Analyzes </li><li>  Calculates </li><li>  Solves problems </li><li>  Works with formulas and scientific calculations. </li><li>  Loves to command </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Performs administrative tasks </li><li>  Develops detailed plans </li><li>  Controls </li><li>  Comply with the formalities </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Sociable </li><li>  Idea's generator </li><li>  Can teach, train and advise </li><li>  Can convince others </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  Presenting ideas </li><li>  Creates concepts </li><li>  Trust intuition </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>  Typical phrases (indicator phrases) </td><td><ul><li>  Systems approach </li><li>  Critical analysis </li><li>  Important point </li><li>  Main provisions </li><li>  "Analyze </li><li>  set out </li></ul></td><td><ul><li>  According to ...

But apparently this is either the most difficult / profitable part for consulting companies, and therefore, the most secret.  It is for testing the staff of various such companies are asking a lot of money.  Each company has its own test.  But once in my hands, I realized that there was nothing special about it.  To do this, it is enough to cross the testing methodology "what came first" and the table presented above.  <i>The test that I possess, I will not lay out in free access (I‚Äôm not sure that I have the right to do this), but if you are very interested, write to LS.</i> <br><br>  By the way, our own self-esteem plays an important role, but the assessment will be more accurate if you invite your colleagues to characterize you. <br><br><h6>  Return to dominants.  Manager characteristic </h6><br>  Type <b>A</b>  The leadership style is logical, analytical and result oriented.  No decision will be considered without facts and arguments, in the absence of those, it will come down with criticism.  In the most extreme case, it can even be extremely cruel.  To the extent that the goal justifies the means, and will easily take any unpopular measures if they have a positive expectation.  Such a type expects from their staff that they operate on facts and base their decisions on logic, and not on intuition and inspiration.  In his vision, staff must ‚Äúfunction,‚Äù and personal factors and work are incompatible. <br><br>  Type <b>B.</b>  In the style of leadership of this type is dominated by strong detail.  This type tends to structure, petty, does not like ambiguity or ambiguity, loves discipline. <br>  The works will be carried out neatly and in time, everything is clear according to his detailed plan.  Any indent from the plan is regarded as sabotage.  A manager of this type appreciates when they follow instructions, and he receives projects in a timely manner, everything is carefully organized and is also carefully documented.  As a result, it is difficult to distinguish the essential from the non-essential, and therefore is quickly lost in trifles. <br><br>  Type <b>C</b>  His style is sociable, group oriented. <br>  For the leader of this type, human destinies and their feelings are of great importance to him, people are above all.  For such a manager, the workplace should be friendly and remain open for communication, conflicts should be absent in principle.  It is obvious to him that the solution to the problem must be found extremely diplomatically. <br><br>  Type <b>D.</b>  This type of leadership style is not simple enough.  Many decisions he makes intuitively.  Prone to adventures and risks, appreciates experiments.  It‚Äôs normal for him to use as many features as possible at the same time.  Despite the fact that with the structuring of his obvious problems, not susceptible it can not be called.  He sees the prospect, but is practically unable to calculate the iterations to achieve it. <br><br><h6>  "We are all half-breeds" </h6><br>  HDI is no exception to the rule.  In this model, it is also extremely rare to find the ‚Äúpure‚Äù type. <br><br>  Combined type <b>AB</b> ("engineer").  Obviously, you can guess that leadership style combines A and B types;  It can be called practical and realistic, it can be unusually energetic, its main distinguishing feature is ‚Äúhardness‚Äù rather than ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù.  This type of name was not accidentally received; a manager of this type can be compared with a complex mechanism; he must (in his opinion) understand how each screw works.  Usually, growth and expansion occurs through the study of new material, taking into account the features of both the initial types, more often it will be the economics of an enterprise, finance, or the like. <br><br>  Combined type <b>BC</b> ("performer").  His leadership style combines stability and traditionalism with the ability to perceive feelings.  It combines a love of order and formality with a strong focus on the person, the ability of sensitive receptivity and with a preference for working in a team.  This managerial style is highly service oriented.  In the case of production management, it will take into account both the interests of production and the interests of the people involved in it. <br><br>  Combined type <b>AD</b> ("strategist").  This style is a strikingly different way of thinking, combining logic, analyticity and rationality <b>A</b> and intuitiveness and craving for experiments <b>D.</b>  This type of thinking prevails among scientists, inventors and people working in R &amp; D and development.  Usually such people are completely immersed in work, they find satisfaction in it and do not need encouragement and recognition. <br><br>  Combined type of <b>CD</b> ("actor").  As a combination of empath and innovator, it is flexible, open and intuitive, aimed at people, enterprising and inclined towards idealism.  He approves of contacts between employees, the formation of an independent team, attaches greater importance to an enthusiastic working climate, and crystallization of the team.  Employees who work under such a manager are often more actively involved in decision making and have relatively more freedom than others. <br><br>  At this point I made a decision to split the material into several articles (if this information is required).  Firstly, there is already quite a lot of it (material) for one article, and secondly, some pause is necessary for its assimilation. <br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument">A small article on Wikipedia</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://nkozlov.ru/library/s42/d2530/print/%3Fresultpage%3D5">Another related link</a> </li><li>  If you have something to share on the subject, write </li></ul><br><hr><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144933/">Continuation</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144837/</a></p>
