  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Terrible recruiter, terrible candidate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, my name is Nastya.  I have been looking for and finding employees for IT and IB companies for 12 years.  In the past few months, conversations have arisen on Linkedin, Facebook and thematic sites, which make me angry, curse and exclaim, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing ?!‚Äù.  Candidates write that companies demean their dignity when an interview is conducted by an ‚Äúunaware Eychar‚Äù.  HR's indignant - "Yes, he did not answer why the manholes are round!".  Timlides do not like the professional level of candidates.  And the timing of the projects do not like the fact that they approach the deadline so quickly.  And for some reason they all forget that hiring and employment is a process that requires patience, benevolence and positive attitude from all participants. <br><br>  I want to write about the most terrible representatives of the Russian labor market - a terrible recruiter and a terrible candidate, whom we consider as two collective images.  It is important to emphasize that I describe far from typical cases, but the most extreme, clinical variants.  The post is written on the basis of his own and others' bitter experience, as well as based on the posts and comments on social networks and employment sites. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e7e/2de/00a/e7e2de00af0947a48deea245fd616d49.png" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When two such comrades collide in a network or in real life, something similar to annihilation takes place - mutual destruction and release of energy of cosmic scales.  As we will see later, these are two twin brothers who were on opposite sides of the barricades.

    <h2>  Horrible recruiter </h2><br>  Let me introduce myself - God.  He is confident that, together with his position, he has received magical superpowers that allow seeing people through and through. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9d5/793/d85/9d5793d856bf4fb89e446ba408176509.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Quote: "as long as we reach the negotiating room with the candidate, I already know whether he will work with us or not."  With his incomplete correspondence education, he peremptorily judges the level of intelligence of the system architect.  While the manager is struggling with a lack of resources, and the team is reworking, the recruiter is experimenting over candidates by slipping idiotic tests ‚Äúlike in Google‚Äù or composes a psychological profile on even more idiotic methods from ‚Äúfor psychiatric disorders‚Äù.  To elementary courtesy rarely descends, never calls back.  This is not laziness or lack of professionalism - due to its egocentric obsession with itself, it does not think about the emotions and feelings of other people.  He is completely confident that the candidates have endless time and patience and are ready to perform his Wishlist for weeks: the first interview with hr, the second with the leader, the third with the director, then the test, and then another test, and then the final one, and then a lie detector for the poor fellows who have gone through all the circles of hell.  Does not own interviewing techniques, does not study, asks the same, long ago turned into memes and questions from all the forums in the series ‚Äúwho do you see yourself in 5 years? !!‚Äù But it has tremendous abilities to draw far-reaching conclusions from the meager answers candidates "well ... uh ... I do not know ...".  Puts categorical and categorical diagnoses.  The resume of such a recruiter is a series of small recruitment agencies with experience of several months each.  Or not dusty existence in-house under the guise of a powerful relative.  Of all other places, he is expelled because he is chronically unable to fulfill the recruitment plan. <br><br><h2>  Horrible candidate </h2><br>  This comrade, by virtue of an infantile and egocentric temperament, regards the world as some kind of abstract mommy, who in fact owes him.  Quote: "Recruiters are employees who are responsible for my job placement."  My friend, your job placement is your responsibility and no longer a draw, and the recruiter‚Äôs duty is to ensure that the company has qualified employees.  Nothing more than that sends a resume with a year of work experience to the position of a leading developer, without thinking about having to compete with people with extensive experience and real achievements in this field.  He is very offended at the refusal and is absolutely unable to understand its causes, so what, I don‚Äôt know half of the technologies, and you teach me!  If a terrible recruiter never calls back after an interview, then the terrible candidate is dynamite interviewing and going to work.  If hr succeeds in calling him, he answers something like ‚Äúachetakova?  I didn‚Äôt come, it‚Äôs not interesting to me. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9e1/2ba/10f/9e12ba10f3014b7785c8096de8974d5d.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Determined by the frequently used word "must."  He must be employed, he must be provided with training, he must be regularly raised wages.  Quote: ‚Äúin six months you will have to add me a salary.  Why?  Because I will understand your processes. "  The recruiter of such a candidate is responsible for everything: the location of the office, the color of the salary, the nature of the potential manager and the weather on the day of the interview.  For his knowledge gaps are responsible technical experts who attended the interview.  They didn‚Äôt ask, asked the wrong questions, insulted me with a proposal to write code, gave the wrong test task.  The proposal to raise the level of knowledge creates a fierce batthyrth and a flurry of arguments, why this cannot be done: long, dear, once, he has not yet decided what he wants to learn, etc.  etc.  Each failed interview, each failure is perceived as confirmation of some existing conspiracy of employers against "all good people."  He writes devastating posts in social networks, writes antijob sites and complains, complains, complains.  Or swearing, depending on temperament and character. <br><br><h2>  What are the similarities of these two types? </h2><br>  <b>Inadequately high self-esteem</b> .  A person does not test reality, does not understand that his expectations are unreasonably high, his value on the market is lower than he would like, his significance is low, he chooses not only him, he also chooses him. <br><br>  <b>Illusions that prevent adequate self-esteem</b> .  After the pack, everyone usually has bitter thoughts: if I'm so cool, how did it happen that nothing happened?  And further illusions helpfully begin to camouflage the sad reality.  ‚ÄúThe interview failed, I did not answer most of the questions,‚Äù says the voice of reason.  ‚ÄúWho needs this theory, everything is in Wikipedia‚Äù - answer illusions.  ‚ÄúThe candidate went to the competitors while I was pulling the rubber,‚Äù - the recruiter, the dynamic candidate‚Äôs month, is trying to get through with repeated interviews.  ‚ÄúI have a huge load, stress and an impossible plan, I just did not have time‚Äù - the illusions sing. <br><br>  <b>External responsibility</b> .  A person‚Äôs attention is focused not on what he can do, but on what others are supposed to give him.  Successes and failures are attributed mainly to external factors, someone is always to blame. <br><br><h2>  What if the terrible recruiter is you? </h2><br><ol><li>  Respect your candidates.  If we are talking about the labor market in the IT industry, most of them are smarter, more talented, more professional than you. </li><li>  Right now!  write to everyone who is waiting for your response following the meeting.  Refusal to E-staff is sent with one button. </li><li>  Learn.  Stop asking who the person sees himself after 5 years, this question has got everyone. </li></ol><br><h2>  What if the terrible candidate is you? </h2><br><ol><li>  Take off your rose-colored glasses and look in the mirror without them.  Ask an advanced colleague to honestly describe your professional level.  The main thing - do not quarrel.  Adequate assessment will be useful to all. </li><li>  Learn already Exchange, or what you need to find a job.  Open Lutz, shake off the dust from Bertrand Meyer, because you bought it for some reason? </li><li>  Stop complaining in social networks.  Even if your post has gained 1000 likes, what is the use of it if you still have no work. </li><li>  Stop thinking that everyone around is guilty: hr, timlid and conspiracy of employers.  Worst of all from this position to you. </li></ol><br><h2>  Conclusion.  What to do if you met such a terrible representative of the labor market? </h2><br><ol><li>  Move to a safe state, do not waste your nerves </li><li>  Do not respond to his comments, do not take to heart his "professional" assessment.  It means nothing and no one is interested. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334268/</a></p>
