      Following this tradition, the freemium model is brilliantly suited for IT companies to increase awareness and avalanche-like increase in the customer base.  In this article you will learn how freemium can influence a business and find 11 examples of successful implementation that you want to buy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/645/5d6/44f/6455d644f0064647aa42dbbca3ba11fb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Why make a free fare </h1><br>  The magic of this model lies in the possibility of an avalanche-like development of business through outreach activities. <br><br>  In October 2014, <a href="https://slack.com/" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> - a tool for instant communication in a team - became one of the fastest growing business applications of all time.  The growth of daily active users doubled in three months, up to 500 thousand, and an estimate of $ 1.12 billion, Slack is obliged to word of mouth.  Bill Macaitis, director of marketing, calls this concept client-referral-growth. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe don't care when they make their first purchase.  We care when they recommend us, ‚Äùexplains Makaitis on HubSpot's The Growth Show. <br></blockquote><br>  Instead of selling directly, the team seeks to create a product that will make users happy.  So much so that they feel they <em>should</em> recommend it.  Or even pay. <br><br>  By offering a freemium version like in Slack, you get an easy way to get people to try your product and <em>drag it to their side</em> . <br><br>  Obtaining experience of using and evaluating the benefits of your product without the risk of losing anything (and this is important!), They have one foot on your side, and you have contact details. <br><br>  Then to grow a contact into a paying customer or simply shocked by the coolness of your project, a fan who recommends it to everyone.  Like Slack. <br><br>  In general, if you instill in users love and dependence on your freemium product, they are more likely to pay to get more.  And most importantly - will take the responsibility to disseminate information among their circle of contacts. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not for me to explain to you how word of mouth works. <br><br><h1>  Examples of successful implementations of free tariffs </h1><br>  The variety of freemium offers today is an unimaginable amount.  We have collected here 11 delightful user services, which should be equal to everything else. <br><br><br><h2>  1. <a href="http://wistia.com/pricing" rel="nofollow">Wistia</a> </h2><br>  Allows users to upload up to 25 videos in HD, no size limit.  If you are just starting to learn video marketing, and not against <a href="http://wistia.com/" rel="nofollow">Wistia's</a> copyright (which is mandatory for the freemium version), then the service is well suited for small businesses, because  offers a wide range of embedding and distribution options, and even simple analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d15/5d7/d01/d155d7d01ba849d7b147b8d5fcb0e8ff.png"><br><br><h2>  2. <a href="http://mailchimp.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow">MailChimp</a> </h2><br>  If you have less than 2000 contacts on your mailing list, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/" rel="nofollow">Mailchimp</a> is what you need!

<h2>  11. <a href="http://redconnect.ru/" rel="nofollow">RedConnect</a> </h2><br>  Callback for a small site is a luxury.  The free <a href="http://redconnect.ru/" rel="nofollow">RedConnect</a> plan allows <a href="http://redconnect.ru/" rel="nofollow">you</a> to receive up to 1000 callbacks from customers monthly.  The downside is that the client and the operator are not connected in one line, the call comes only to the employee of the company.  The main thing is the substitution of numbers.  The operator on the screen of his phone sees the number of the visitor, and can call the customer in one motion.  A great option for a novice online store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c0/863/862/4c086386214f42c993bc5fb8704b7976.png"><br>  Posted by: <a href="http://www.impactbnd.com/blog/10-phenomenal-freemium-models-that-are-putting-yours-to-shame" rel="nofollow">Ramona Sukhraj</a> <br><br>  Translation and adaptation: <a href="http://redhelper.ru/" rel="nofollow">RedHelper</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295938/</a></p>
