  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung: dried fish, cars, refrigerators and smartphones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Chebol - a form of financial and industrial groups.  It is a conglomerate of independent firms owned by families under single administrative and financial control.  Samsung Group, along with LG Group, GS Group, Hyundai, Daewoo is one of the biggest chaebols. <br><br>  The founder of Samsung was Lee Bin Chol, the son of a large landowner.  Chol was able to go to Tokyo University, and after his father's death, used his money in order to open his own business.  It is worth saying that South Korea in 1938 was a Japanese colony.  Then the name Samsung Trading Company appeared - a trading company exporting goods to China and Manchuria.  From the very beginning of his entrepreneurial activity, Lee Bin Chol began to discover new areas - he began to produce sugar and fabrics, and he created an insurance company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/529/79f/66b/52979f66b0d635b13280983359644792.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the 1960s, the company entered the electronics market.  For this, Samsung has teamed up with Sanyo, and by 1976 produced the millionth black and white TV.  Samsung-Sanyo Electronics in 1975 was renamed Samsung Electro-Mechanics, and in 1977 got its modern name - Samsung Electronics.  To improve its position in the electronics market, Samsung in 1987 established an institute for developing new products.  Since the 1990s, international laws have allowed the company to enter the world market and become one of the leading manufacturers of liquid crystal displays.  By the end of the 1990s, the company began producing the largest 30-inch LCD displays.

      Thanks to investments in R &amp; D, the company was the first in the world to release a 21-inch OLED panel in 2005 and the world's first serial Blu-ray player in 2006.  In 2010, the company became the first manufacturer of a full range of 3D equipment for the home - TVs, Blu-ray players, glasses and content.  And the company became the first on the market of curved UHD TVs: the 105-inch TV presented at CES in 2014 became an occasion to flood stores with expensive curved panels today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/196/245/ea5/196245ea52ca5d4b569007f39fb0ed31.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a68/720/840/a68720840a9a85ad9c84d637b7b073af.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cd/475/abc/1cd475abc6a7ec53a72a42b91097f2da.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/950/7a3/6c9/9507a36c9334fb013cf06ccbf1a1d444.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung Electronics, formed in 1977, by 1988 released the SH-100 cell phone to the Korean market.  It was the first phone released in the country.  By 2003, the company released the SPH A500 clamshell and the first Windows Mobile phone. <br><br>  In 2009, Samsung again became the first with a smartphone on Android.  The first Samsung Galaxy had a 3.2-inch AMOLED display, WiFi and a GPS receiver.  Samsung decided to work with its own mobile operating system and in 2010 released the Samsung Wave S8500 to Bada, and in 2013 combined this OS with Tizen.  In 2012, the company led the sales of smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/b6c/6b0/044b6c6b083180c8408a4abab22393a7.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a4/b5e/751/8a4b5e751fe633d56126089346ab633d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ce/dd3/e3a/8cedd3e3a2bffbb721e4cb6889875dbc.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2014, the company presented a smartphone with a curved Galaxy Note Edge display at the IFA exhibition in Berlin.  Since 2014, the company's profits have fallen in competition with Chinese manufacturers of cheap smartphones Xiaomi and Huawei.  Xin Chong Kin, the head of the division at the time, was accused of including the inadequate production of the Galaxy S6 Edge with a curved display, which became much more popular than the company had expected.  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22322/">Shin Chong Kenu was replaced by Koh Ton Chin</a> . <br><br>  Ko Ton Chin was responsible for the R &amp; D division of the corporation; under his leadership, a security service was developed to store personal and corporate data on one Samsung Knox device, Samsung Pay system for paying for purchases with a smartphone, and Tizen operating system.  And he was responsible for the latest flagships of the company - the Galaxy S6 and Note 5. Some analysts have high hopes for the new head of the division. <br><br>  One of the reasons for the fall in profits was ‚Äúspraying‚Äù on a large number of smartphones.  In 2014, Samsung released 56 smartphone models and gained 49% less revenue than in 2013. The company thought: ‚Äúless means better,‚Äù and in 2015 they decided to reduce the line by a third in 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d5b/5fd/256/d5b5fd256e41a236258115168c0a1505.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  2014 Samsung looks like this in smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b95/bfe/e05/b95bfee05f9bbb6fd14587efe8612f99.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1989, Samsung released its first laptop, the S5200, and in 2005, the Samsung M70 transformer.  The display was attached to the stand and turned into a desktop computer.  The company entered the American notebook market in 2009.  Since 2014, the company began to experiment with Chromebooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de5/eb4/a6e/de5eb4a6ea16a630d2a52a173a975f2c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f64/df8/5e2/f64df85e2beff2c0a46ccf090444716a.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The Sega Saturn known to us in Korea was marketed under the Samsung Saturn brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/711/3dd/10f/7113dd10fa78f13191e2b9d9ec686c9f.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Electronics is only one part of the Samsung chaebol.  In 1994, a group of companies included a car manufacturing company.  Samsung and Nissan created Renault Samsung Motors, developed the SM5 sedan in 1995-1997, but the crisis led to bankruptcy in 1998.  The Samsung Group withdrew from the project and for a while became part of Kia Motors.  Now Samsung Motors belongs to the French Renault. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e59/2a3/cb5/e592a3cb5a924f0e2723c92f055b8b33.png" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>SM7 Sedan</i> <br><br>  Samsung has a large number of affiliated companies, including Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Securities, Samsung Total Petrochemicals and others.  Chebol works in the fields of finance and insurance, heavy and chemical industries.  The company produces tracked and wheel excavators and a number of special equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7c9/1b6/178/7c91b61788a35dbfcf8928f11dac4b4c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Household appliances Samsung includes almost everything that can be at home with a person.  These are refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, air conditioners.  It is also responsible for Samsung Electronics - Digital Applience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f30/0d7/9c8/f300d79c866ab97753b21c5075b34d4c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Lee Ben Chol, born in a not very poor family, managed in difficult political and economic conditions to create a brand that many people trust.  This fact proves the long-term and mostly successful existence of a whole group of companies responsible for everything - from cars to washing machines, from food to smartphones with a curved display.  Starting with the creation of an electronics division for working in the domestic market - with a black and white TV - the company has become a world leader in this industry, gradually beginning to work outside the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297478/</a></p>
