  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The book "Computer Design for Architects"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/277905/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96a/ff6/b9e/96aff6b9e9fc417d9fbe6032f4144661.jpg" align="left" alt="image"></a>  Today, most architectural projects are developed using CAD, various computer-aided design and modeling programs.  Both students and practicing professionals have to master the technology of working with such programs.  This book describes the most useful features for architects and designers of AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Vectorworks, as well as 3ds Max, Maya, Form Z, and Photoshop.  For convenience, detailed explanations are accompanied by vivid examples of specific projects and screenshots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Drawing is often considered an occupation, for which only paper and relevant accessories are needed.  Today, the creation of traditional drawings and sketches still plays an important role in the design of architectural structures and interiors.  Many courses of architecture and design pay serious attention to drawing by hand and creating layouts as an effective means of expressing design ideas and developing project documentation.  However, carrying on the essential role of drawings and sketches made by hand, the realities of modern design remind us daily of the exceptional importance of computer-aided architectural design. <br><br>  Every year computer-aided design (CAD, Computer-Aided Design) takes the place of the professional standard more and more.  This also applies to the creative side, and the efficiency of the work of specialists employed in the field of design.  This book is devoted to the basics of computer design and is intended both for practicing architects and for those who master this profession.  In the field of computer-aided design, a stable set of concepts has emerged that relates to the key methods of drawing and modeling.  Since this book demonstrates examples from various computer programs, it is more likely a universal reference than a guide to using a particular program.

      The main objective of the book is to consider the features of working with applications for the processing of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) graphics and give the reader the most important skills in the field of computer-aided design.  We will start with the simplest methods of working with 2D and 3D graphics, after which we will proceed to the consideration of more complex issues.  The programs we will talk about are widely used. <br>  both in professional and in educational environment.  These are SketchUp, Vectorworks, Form Z, AutoCAD, 3ds Max, Maya and Photoshop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d12/5a8/ad3/d125a8ad3b80448a9fc32beb8cc8e75f.PNG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c6/661/764/2c6661764d4c4b14b4d7bd0023d3de37.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Chapters 1 and 2 will demonstrate the basics of creating two-dimensional images and three-dimensional models.  Using walkthroughs, you will learn how to create a building project from scratch. <br><br>  Different applications will be considered in parallel, so you can see how similar actions are performed in different programs.  Each chapter of the book includes walkthroughs on drafting, modeling and visualization of finished images of architectural objects.  With their help, you will be able to master all the stages of working with various applications.  In addition, in this book you will find useful tips that will help you when working with alternative programs.  Thanks to them, you will learn what can be achieved specifically with the help of computer-aided design technologies, and thus you will not limit yourself to the capabilities of any particular type of application. <br><br>  In the last chapter, all that is shown in the book is combined in a step-by-step example demonstrating the development of the project of the famous building - the Barcelona Pavilion of Mies van der Rohe.  Having dealt with this example, you will understand how separate parts of a project become a single whole.  In addition, in the last chapter you will learn about the technology of building information modeling (BIM, Building Information Modeling), which today is becoming an important part of architectural design and construction.  Finally, at the end of the book you will find tips on solving some problems, a glossary of terms, a list of additional literature and useful sites. <br><br>  I hope that this book will be useful to architects, designers, students who are not familiar with computer-aided design systems, as well as to all those who want to brush up on their knowledge in this area.  A typical omission of some architectural courses is insufficient attention to computer-aided design techniques.  Often, students have to deal with all this on their own.  The book that you hold in your hands will help you learn the fundamentals of computer modeling and will tell you how to give a professional form to your architectural ideas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/b79/a91/80eb79a9171e402388e8b9c7fa480ef8.PNG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/c2f/7b4/12bc2f7b428d4fc8a89a7ae43913ce08.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  From chapters 3 and 4, you will learn how to visualize building models and create graphic materials that will allow your ideas to be shown to other people.  Simple and clear explanations will help you do everything you need yourself. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new/product/kompyuternoe-proektirovanie-dlya-arhitektorov">the publisher's website.</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Architecture</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277905/</a></p>
