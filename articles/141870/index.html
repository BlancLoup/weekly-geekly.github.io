  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wars with Citrix XenServer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  The other day, my employee accidentally deleted several virtuals in Citrix XenServer. <br>  Everything was complicated by the fact that virtual machines were on a snapshot disk. <br>  Under the cut, I tell you how I took them out of there in the absence of any backups and transferred them to KVM. <br>  I did not do a lot of command examples, since the purpose of the article was to describe the concept.  Below cited the necessary links. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  I took the hard drives myself, put it on a test machine. <br>  Loaded xen did not want, went into a cyclic reboot. <br>  Consequently, I had to download the new version and install it on another disk. <br>  Download, install.  Next, it was necessary to connect the old drives. <br>  Xen was in the most standard configuration, virtualka on LVM. <br><br><h4>  First disappointment </h4> <br>  All articles say that LVM in XenServer should back up changes to daddy <br> <code>/etc/lvm/archive <br></code> <br>  But it was not there.  In version 5.5 in the LVM config, automatic saving is turned off. <br>  Fortunately, I have already dealt with LVM and I know that it stores copies of data in the initial blocks of PV. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      Using the command: <br> <code>dd if=/dev/sda3 bs=512 count=255 skip=1 of=./lvmbackup.img</code> <br>  copied the first blocks of the section <br><br>  With vim, this picture can be perfectly open and pull out the necessary information. <br>  There by the way you can see a lot of configurations.  The last but one came up to me.  Since the previous ones did not have the necessary sections yet, and in the following ones already! <br><br>  And so, having found the necessary configuration piece, I tore it out and copied it into a new file. <br>  Then, reformatting it a little and, if I'm not mistaken, changing the uuid of the physical partitions, I got the working lvm configuration of the volume. <br><br>  After that, in the / etc / lvm / backup folder, I replaced the lvm group description file with my own. <br>  And launched vgcfgrestore with the name of the group. <br>  It is not strange but all sections are hooked. <br><br><h4>  Second disappointment </h4><br>  And so, joyful that everything I had successfully got, and the disks are seen, I am trying to hook this storage in XenServer. <br>  I did not expect such a breakup.  SR connection is successful.  Not a single mistake.  But!  Disks are seen only those that have not been deleted.  No deleted. <br>  The lvs team also showed only new discs.  That is, XenServer found somewhere a repository description. <br>  There is nothing to do, I restore lvm a second time.  (To be honest, I did it 10 times until I realized that Zen considers disks to be remote and does not want to see them at all) <br>  The same thing was complicated by the presence of snapshots from these disks. <br><br><h4>  proper restoration </h4><br>  At about 10 pm I received insight that the LVM volume of the server's zen is nothing but VHD disks. <br>  Armed with a notepad and vhd-util, I recorded the data on the parents of all snapshots.  Snapshots in Zen server are differential VHD drives. <br>  Further dd in files of all necessary volumes. <br><br>  After that, the vhd-util check check showed that all the checksums are correct and the files are working. <br>  Through the same utility, I pointed out new parents to snapshots and started merging (coalesce parameter). <br><br>  Here, by the way, I still have a question: when creating one snapshot, the zen makes 2 differential disks.  One is the size of the original, and the second is very small.  It was enough for me that the size of the original.  Small did not merge. <br><br><h4>  Final stage </h4><br>  Transferring files to the server with KVM I tried to feed him vhd.  He naturally did not eat him. <br>  But I was helped out by the qemu-img utility which didn‚Äôt convert the raw files to me very well. <br><br>  In general, all is well that ends well.  Now users work well. <br>  Please do not kick much - the first experience of an article on Habr√©. <br><br>  About the lack of backups - their absence is not an accident, and not negligence. <br><br>  VHD for xen is a little different and you can‚Äôt connect them directly to Hyper-v, you also need to convert. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX120962">How to Reinstall XenServer and Preserve Virtual Machines on a Local Disk</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microdevsys.com/WordPress/2011/09/19/linux-lvm-recovering-a-lost-volume/">Linux LVM: Recovering a lost volume.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/%3Fp%3D436">Qemu disk image conversion</a> </li></ol><br><br>  Thank you for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141870/</a></p>
