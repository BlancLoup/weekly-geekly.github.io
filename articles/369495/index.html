      Nick walked over to a deck chair with a red and white striped fabric that was pale and in places disheveled.  He leaned his arms against the back and looked up, squinting in the light.  After standing like that for a couple of seconds, he decided that he had to start more quickly, otherwise there was very little time and soon he would be called for a shift again.  As usual, arranging a dressing out for the fact that he left without permission. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Sitting in a chair, Nick missed his right hand past the armrest and nearly fell out of it, falling heavily on the springy fabric.  This embarrassment only raised his spirits and he, holding back his laughter, broke into a smile.  Trying to observe the utter silence, he shifted, sitting down comfortably.  He threw his head back and closed his eyes, picked up a comfortable position for hands on the narrow armrests. <br><br>  The silence was absolute.  You could hear the blood in his ears making a noise, and the light shining through his eyelids created a sensation of rose-colored glasses.  Nick opened his eyes and for the first second he saw only a crystal white shroud, which, slowly scattering, showed a shining silver circle against the background of stars. <br><br>  Along with peace and tranquility, memories came flooding back.  He again remembered that evening when his grandfather took him to the beach to show the constellations.  More precisely, when he could not think of an excuse not to go.  Father Stepan for more than two weeks, with an interval of a couple of days, tried to pull Nick out of the house for a small astronomy lesson.  But either the homework, or the deuce received, or the remarks about the behavior, became the reason for the short-term house arrest.  And at nine years old house arrest seemed to him much more profitable than a walk with his grandfather, because it was not forbidden to use a computer during an arrest. <br><br>  All the way to the sea, his grandfather Stepa complained that today the full moon and the stars will not be visible.  There will be so much moonlight that the human eye simply cannot distinguish the spark of a star.  And having come to the coast, they sat down in chaise lounges and the grandfather instead of stars, began to tell about the moon.  About how it affects the tides, about the fact that it is always turned with one side to the ground, about how the person entered it for the first time.  And a lot of something else.  But Nick then barely listened to his grandfather and was digging sand into his sandal, waiting for the end of the lesson.  How he would like to go back and weigh the slap on his own.  What would Nick-child spend more time at home, did not upset his mother and said that he loved her.  I saw my grandfather more often, because he would not be soon.  Another "Ah!  If only ... "flashed through his head.  Nostalgia began to nibble at him again. <br><br>  Nick was so lost in memories that he stopped breathing for a while.  He exhaled slowly, from which the sight glass of the spacesuit half covered with condensate.  But internal ventilation almost immediately returned the glass to transparency. <br><br>  Nick felt a lighter feel and a stretched fabric began to push him out of the chair.  That's all, this session is over, it's time to go back.  Nick smoothly pushed his legs from the ship's hull and when the safety cable was taut, he began to fold the deck chair in an orderly manner so as not to accidentally release it from his hands and send it into outer space.  Taking the folded chair in his left hand, he flipped the intercom switch with his right hand and immediately voices on the bridge sounded in the headset.  Nobody was looking for him. <br><br>  About seven years ago, Nick, while replacing one of the antennas damaged by micrometeorite, noticed that his mounting key was tightened on a safety loop every four hours towards one of the power supply plates behind his back.  This included one of the electromagnetic generators used by the physicists of the scientific compartment for their tests.  For the year, he assembled the frame of the chaise longue from pieces of the protective frameworks of the equipment, and for the fabric part he spread a sleeping bag on the rags.  Typing enough scrap metal Nick built a vest filled with iron and improvised horseshoes.  Therefore, coming to his beach under the scattered light of one of the planets of this galaxy, he sat in an armchair feeling like a vest presses him to the chair, and his legs barely break away from the metal plating of the ship.  It very much reminded him of earthly gravity and how he and his grandfather sat by the sea at night, but only for four hundred seconds.  Then the generators were turned off and the effect disappeared.  And he, like last time, sticking to the handrail, flew to the hatch in the residential compartment. <br><br>  Leveling the pressure, Nick took off his spacesuit.  He changed his clothes, opened the hatch and pushed the deck chair into it, flew out after him.  And then he stumbled upon Captain Samoilenko. <br><br>  - Nicodem !?  - Captain shouted at the beachman.  - Are you at the end blunt ?! <br>  - Oleg, I have a smoke break.  - Calmly answered Nick. <br>  - And what does it matter to me !?  - snapped Samoylenko.  - You again went out into open space without an order! <br>  - Yeah, wait for your order.  - Nick growled, not waiting for the end of the captain's tirade. <br>  - Major Gromov!  How do you talk to a senior officer?  - Samoylenko played cheekbones.  Although they had a difference of one year, Nicodemus was sixty-three and Oleg was sixty-four.  And on the ship they had served together for thirty-four years and both were Russians, the captain of the ship did not allow familiarity outside the mess room. <br>  - Sorry, Comrade General!  - Nick stretched to the string, releasing the chair from his hands. <br>  - Officer, you are free!  - Restraining anger, Samoylenko said through clenched teeth. <br>  - There is!  - Nick answered mildly, and picking up a chair prepared to push off to fly into the next compartment. <br><br>  - Nick!  - Oleg called him in an absolutely calm voice. <br>  - M? <br>  - How much is the next inclusion? <br>  Nick glanced at his watch. <br>  - After two fifty.  - He knew by heart the schedule for the inclusion of generators.  Moreover, with changes in the schedule of inclusions, physicists first reported to him, and only then to the captain of the ship. <br>  - Allow?  - General Samoilenko nodded toward the chair. <br>  - Of course!  - Gromov smiled and pushed the chair to his friend.  - Vest and heels in my box to the right of the suit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369495/</a></p>
