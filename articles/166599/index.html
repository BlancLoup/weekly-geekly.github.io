    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>- John, what exactly is a 3D printing project for the Lumia 820 and what makes it so special?</b> <br><br>  - The 3D printing project of our community is a simple concept with exciting prospects.  Our Lumia 820 has a removable case that can be replaced with branded cases of other colors, cases with additional protection from shock and dust, as well as cases with the possibility of wireless charging of the phone. <br>  These cases are a great addition to the overwhelming majority of Lumia 820 customers. In addition, we are going to publish templates for 3D printing, specs, and material recommendations in case someone who understands 3D printing wants to print a case for Lumia 820 All this together we call the developer's set for 3D printing, or shortly - 3DK (3D-printing Development Kit). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Links to download templates</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/42482850-b21d-48e8-a027-6b6453e19fa5/Lumia820_shell_allparts_STL.zip.html">All details</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/90d754d9-2419-404d-a6d2-6ce1ff049a8f/Lumia_820_shell_STP.zip.html">Housing</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/11b6fcb5-d42b-41fd-9988-68bedfae4891/Lumia820_shell_separated_STL.zip.html">Separately</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Nokia is the first company to meet the 3D printing community, and continues to be the leading telephone company in this exciting field. <br><br>  I look at it as following the ideas embodied in the ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù of customizable phones, the Nokia 5110 with its colorful collection of interchangeable faceplates.  I still remember how I used its version for the American market, the Nokia 5120. <br><br>  <b>- How else in the production of Nokia is 3D printing used, and what opportunities do you see additionally for mobile technologies now and in the future?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúInside, it helps us prototype faster so that, as Stephen Elop said,‚Äú increase the Nokia clock frequency. ‚Äù  In the future, I see much more modular and customizable phones.  Perhaps, in addition to our own beautifully made phones, we could sell some kind of phone patterns, and entrepreneurs around the world could create local businesses by adapting phones to the needs of the local market.  Do you want a waterproof, glowing in the dark, with a bottle opener and a solar cell phone?  Someone can do it for you, or you can do it yourself. <br><br>  <b>- Can you tell us what your daily work is and what does it have to do with 3D printing?</b> <br><br>  - In our development team, we are trying to create an ecosystem around Nokia Lumia smartphones.  Generally speaking, our team is divided into two sections: ‚Äúdepth‚Äù (big brands like Angry Birds, ESPN, Red Bull) and ‚Äúreach‚Äù (independent projects, amateurs and, possibly, major applications of tomorrow).  I specialize in ‚Äúreach‚Äù applications that inspire me a lot more because I help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to life.  But a rich, vibrant ecosystem is not only a matter of applications and services;  it's also hardware ‚Äî things that enhance and personalize your phone experience.  Since their release needs mass production (as well as a large investment in it), the accessory ecosystem has always been strictly a matter for the depth team.  But now 3D printing allows anyone to start making their own accessories! <br><br>  <b>‚Äú3D printing technology is something that many have heard about, but few people imagine what it looks like in practice.</b>  <b>What did you feel when you first saw her in action?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I first saw 3D printing in action, I felt that it was probably the way people felt when they saw the steam engine for the first time.  The earliest steam engines were expensive, capricious, and extremely limited in their capabilities.  But in these cumbersome mechanisms, some saw a huge potential to change everything.  Any mass invention began with only a shadow of what it could be.  Today we can print cases from only one or two materials, and the machines are limited in what they can produce, but this in itself is very inspiring, and there will be more in the future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEKns8T7yUA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6GW2z8WxQY3aqqxEh59VVj4Ay6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>- The organizers of 3D Print Show in London this year stated that it is close to changing the world, as the Internet has changed it in the 90s.</b>  <b>Do you believe in this deception, and if so, why?</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, this deception has a real basis and 3D printing really is a very big deal.  I do not think it would be an exaggeration to call it a continuation of the industrial revolution.  Yes, it may take a little longer than some suggest, and it may disappoint people.  Now this is an enthusiasts initiative, this is what Nokia is currently targeting its work with the community. <br><br>  <b>- If you could use 3D printing to print anything, what would it be?</b> <br><br>  - Angry Birds level the size of a house! <br><br>  <i>This is a very promising development of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomizing your own phone.</i>  <i>Previously, it was possible to use either the accessories issued by the manufacturer, or, as in the Nokia 3200, change the pictures under the transparent case.</i>  <i>Later, vinyl stickers appeared.</i>  <i>Then - covers, "bumpers", which, unfortunately, significantly increase the size of the device.</i>  <i>Now, with the advent of 3D printing technology, you can add a number of chips not provided by the manufacturer that you need.</i> <br><br>  Here are a few ideas on how to complement the body of your phone: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Built-in mount on a belt or loop; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Points for connecting photo accessories; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Embossed hull texture to prevent slipping; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fastening for winding the headset; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mounting in the car; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bicycle mount; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Backpack holder; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Slot to store additional SIM card or memory card. <br><br>  Details about the project you can find <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/3D_print_a_shell_for_your_Nokia_Phone">in the wiki</a> for developers. <br><br>  When the article was ready for publication, the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43163">first photos of the</a> finished package created on the Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer with the files presented above appeared. <br><br><img src="http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/55/47/ee/92/50/IMGP1386_preview_featured.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/f1/ad/6f/fd/88/IMGP1391_preview_featured.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/94/e8/66/57/89/IMGP1380_preview_featured.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166599/</a></p>
