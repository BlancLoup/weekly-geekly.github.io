  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPhone inconvenient to use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Translation of an article by Canadian journalist and writer Joe Clark</i> <br><br>  I once wrote a manual for a portable module engine diagnostics cars Daewoo.  So I know what ‚Äúinconvenient to use‚Äù means.  And iPhones use uncomfortable. <br><br>  Two times on the bus on the same route, I could not look directly at how older people (in one case - with glasses, shifted to the forehead) tried to read something from iPhones.  I took phones from them (with their permission) and displayed a very well-hidden screen with a choice of font size.  Then they chose a bigger font - one that they needed.  In the end, they thanked me so much that I was even embarrassed.

      The same thing happened again, later, though not on the bus, - with one 85-year-old man, who also suffered from a small text. <br><br>  Another elderly person knew that you could send a text message to a specific phone number containing the bus stop ID, but did not know that this is the worst possible way to know the estimated time of arrival of the bus, or that these predictions can be found anywhere, or what to do, if you are in an unfamiliar place and cannot find the stop id.  (How did he learn to use the iPhone? He asked his wife. He also thought that you can only use the Gmail application to read the email). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My almost blind friend replaced the iTouch with an iPhone 8, and then for several weeks I couldn‚Äôt check my voicemail, because the keyboard and buttons for entering numbers on the iPhone <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/sets/72157696848140930">randomly change or invert the color</a> , and he simply couldn‚Äôt see and find the buttons on the numeric keypad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/639/da5/fe0/639da5fe01b91f13e929586140259567.png"><br>  <i>Before and after the call to the number of voice messages</i> <br><br>  Apparently, the Filipino nanny or housekeeper, traveling for a part-time job, stopped me to ask where the well-hidden street with a complex name is located.  ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù I asked.  She opened her iPhone X (which was just now out) and showed me a map.  She had no idea that she could ask for directions on the phone.  (And just seeing the map, I understood the name of the street).  (By the way, one day after the publication of this article I already forgot that you can ask for directions on the phone. People just tend to forget). <br><br>  I had to tell the owner of Apple Watch, using them for notifications and tracking fitness achievements, that you can ask the watch for the way, and his phone has the Health app.  I had to explain to him how to find this application. <br><br>  The most advanced and knowledgeable fans will learn about the new features of Apple's phones and how to use them by looking at the presentations of the new models.  And yet there are all the other people. <br><br>  Don Norman [ <i>author of well-known books on the design of things / approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ] already <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name">told</a> us <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-apples-products-so-confusing-ignore-design-don-norman/">several</a> <a href="https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/apples_products_are.html">times</a> that iPhones hide their capabilities.  Apple will never admit its mistakes.  Next time when you hear Tim Cook or someone else remember the story of the dude who had an accident and managed to call an ambulance with the help of Apple Watch, think about the millions of people who are not able to use their phones for basic or urgently needed needs. <br><br>  With the number of iOS devices in use over the past 10 years, supposedly reaching a billion, Apple‚Äôs errors are an aggravated version of the butterfly effect.  Everything that people can do wrong, or do not know about, will be done wrong, or remain unknown to tens of millions of people. <br><br><h2>  Almost one-way street </h2><br>  You can expect some things from your iPhone without much thought (there is a calculator in my iPhone).  There are things that become obvious to the back of the mind (iphone can tell me the way). <br><br>  However, sometimes people just need to learn basic things.  There are people who drive Facebook into the Google search bar to go to Facebook.  They do not know what the address bar of the browser is, despite the fact that it has been staring at them for already ten years, and they don‚Äôt know anything about bookmarks.  There are people who know what the address bar is, but they don‚Äôt know what the search field is, so for any search they first google.com. <br><br>  Do not be afraid of your phone.  No need to restrain yourself from trying something new.  But we all do.  Including me. <br><br><h2>  The two most necessary things (and well hidden) </h2><br><h3>  Text size </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/d07/8d0/f08d078d0910a31218d44a2d05626828.png"></div><br>  If Apple really cares about the availability of the product (does not care), then on the settings screen of each iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch there would be a step that cannot be missed, and in which the user would choose the size of the text.  And there it would be written that if you choose between sizes slightly larger and slightly smaller than necessary, choose slightly larger. <br><br>  This function is not as strongly related to vision loss as one might think.  Blind people do not need to inflate everything to a large size.  The friend of mine mentioned by me needs the text of the normal size.  This feature refers to millions of middle-aged and elderly people with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">presbyopia</a> associated with age, the inability to focus a look that got its name three hundred years ago.  (It is not possible to focus the view without moving the object or adding a lens). <br><br>  If Apple had even attended to the diversity (does not care), middle-aged people would participate in product and software development, and they would have made a fuss if they could not read the text from the product they had created (or would simply pay attention to their complaints) . <br><br><h3>  Permanently annoying WiFi network reminder </h3><br>  Just yesterday, I saw a hundredth or thousandth person in a row quickly and reflexively, without even realizing it, closed the warning that jumps out every time you are not within the range of your WiFi access point, and the phone detects other wireless networks.  (I once, standing next to a friend, took his phone from him and <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/04/07/stop-iphone-looking-for-wifi-networks/">turned off this function</a> . Without asking permission). <br><br>  If something in the "ecosystem" of Apple and is like Windows autism, which so repels frantic Macintosh fans, it is the tenacity with which the iPhone interrupts you just because you have passed the WiFi router. <br><br>  Try the following experiment.  Take a ride around the city by cafes or densely populated places like high-rise buildings.  Or shopping - everyone today has wireless internet.  Hold your phone in your hand and pretend to be doing something with it.  You will be interrupted constantly. <br><br>  Once again: everyone instantly closes this dialogue, not realizing what they are doing, what the dialogue is doing, and not even remembering what they have done.  This is such a special irritation, like dissociative anesthesia, where you may not know what happened, but you definitely don‚Äôt want to relive it.  But it will happen again: this feature is enabled by default.  And I will not even include a screenshot here, so it infuriates. <br><br><h2>  Human security </h2><br>  Since Apple calls passwords as [passcodes], it does not occur to anyone that instead of a sequence of six numbers (for example, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/10/11/kanye-change-your-iphone-passcode-now-using-000000-bad-idea/1606983002/">000000</a> ), an alphanumeric password can be used.  And all the terminology is terrible.  ‚ÄúNumeric Code Password,‚Äù ‚ÄúPassword,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlphanumeric Code Phrase,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlphanumeric,‚Äù we would not need to use all these terms. <br><br>  The interface almost irrevocably inclines you to a numeric code instead of a password.  My blind friend could not understand what was happening when a keyboard appeared on my login screen. <br><br>  Passwords are so rare that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/apple-fixes-a-pair-of-lockscreen-bugs-with-ios-7-0-2-update/">there was a time</a> when the Greeks, who used Greek passwords, could not enter the phone.  Yes, it makes sense that passwords do not have to use only those characters that are on the American keyboard.  But this for some time did not even know in Apple. <br><br>  Older people like iPads, but older and not very healthy people need to enter a medical identifier (which is not obvious) in the Health section (also not obvious).  That is, the very people for whom this function is necessary will be used with the least probability.  We cannot, and should not, rely only on the fact that the grandchildren of these elderly people or the people who care about them will do it for them. <br><br>  By filling in these fields, and if you suddenly lose consciousness, an ambulance worker (or just a passer-by) can not only find out about your medical problems, but also call your emergency phone numbers (and also call an ambulance).  Someone can steal your phone while you are half-dead, lying on the sidewalk, but on the other hand, someone can give you a good head start in case of an urgent need. <br><br>  Few people know that Siri and the Maps application can guide you with text and voice.  And even the explanation of this fact seems abstract and dry.  To people who clearly did not understand when I told them that their phone could tell them where to go, I had to say the following: ‚ÄúIf you get lost, press the button and say: Take me home.  You can also press a button and ask: Where am I? ‚Äù <br><br>  I had to use both of these features.  In a fairly wide range, you can not get lost if you have an iPhone with you.  Now tell me how many people know this. <br><br>  You definitely need to tell the phone and Siri who you are and who your family members are.  For this you need to create a contact card (what is this?) And links to it.  Then all your family members will need their own cards, and you will have to work hard to identify their relationship with you. <br><br>  I insist that this is not one of the pleasant opportunities that it would be nice to have.  If you have chest pain, you should be able to hold the button and say "Call Charlie" or "Call your wife."  (And God help you, if Siri asks in response, which Charlie should call). <br><br>  One of my friends actually had chest pain when he was in another country, and it did not occur to him to call someone.  So, it turns out that Apple, with a trillion-dollar capitalization, needs to spend significantly more resources on telling people how to set up their phones for an emergency, so that they can actually use them in such cases.  And this means that it is necessary to force people to do this when setting up, and to make the process crystal clear, to explain it with text and videos - what exactly their phones can do for them at the moment when people will need them most. <br><br>  As a simple example of the possibility that any non-autistic person could have thought out over the past five years of developing iPhones, one could call the following phrase that a person says to Siri: ‚ÄúI'm in trouble.‚Äù  Or "I need help."  Shouldn't such phrases do something useful?  And if you set up your business card and identify yourself as an iPhone owner, everyone can ask Siri ‚ÄúWhose phone is this?‚Äù When they find your lost iPhone. <br><br>  Last but not least, almost no one knows that some contacts can be assigned VIP status, and then their letters and messages will become much more visible to you.  In addition, it is so difficult to do that every time I have to look for <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-or-remove-vip-senders-in-ios-mail-1172526">instructions</a> . <br><br>  Really advanced security settings, such as two-factor authentication (which of the two? Apple has two of them), are an example of such settings that will include only experts who don‚Äôt need them. <br><br><h2>  "Basic" functions that few people understand </h2><br>  Watching the behavior of those people who are scornfully called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (or ‚Äúusers‚Äù) for more than ten years, I noticed that the only knowledge that iPhone owners are proud of is how to close applications forcibly.  They also know how to place a call and select flashy wallpapers. <br><br>  And that's all.  But it is not their fault. <br><br>  People do not know what they can do svayp on the screen up or down at the top or bottom of the screen.  For example, I almost never saw anyone turn on or turn off WiFi in this way (this is almost always done through the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù).  People do not know what the "Control Center" and "Notification Center" are.  They also do not know what an iSight camera is, what a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringBoard">Springboard is</a> (although they would not need to know that).  But they know what a home screen is. <br><br>  Few people know that svayp from the left and right edges is equivalent to the commands "back" and "forward." <br><br>  On the lock screen, you can control almost everything directly.  (They don‚Äôt know that this is a ‚Äúlock screen.‚Äù They don‚Äôt know that they have ‚Äúlocked‚Äù the screen. They know that they didn‚Äôt turn it off ‚Äî except for a small number of people who completely turn off their phone every time they stop using it. A blind friend was one of those people, because a Windows / Android user told him something about ‚Äúbattery life‚Äù).  They do not know that these are not just pictures on the screen, but objects that can be manipulated.  The exception is music or podcasts, since the ‚Äúplay‚Äù and ‚Äústop‚Äù icons are self-evident.  But try to ask the person to remove the meeting reminder or reply to the message directly from the lock screen.  This is known only to experts. <br><br>  The function "press and hold" is completely hidden, and it can only be found by accident.  (Is this an example of using 3D Touch, or is it ‚Äúpush and hold‚Äù, or is it ‚Äúpush deeper‚Äù?).  What can be done with the function "press and hold", about which people do not know: <br><br><ul><li>  Move the scroll bar directly.  (In most cases, this is not possible due to the fact that you are expected to be able to get into the tiny narrow scroll control). </li><li>  Show an enlarged copy of almost everything that is on the screen, and what can not be manipulated - for example, of what is indicated in the title (try pressing and holding on the battery icon). </li><li>  ‚ÄúReading mode‚Äù in Safari browser, terribly useful, and almost unknown function (click to activate, hold to configure). </li><li>  Copy and paste.  I affirm that very few people know about this. </li><li>  Turn the keyboard into a bad trackpad.  It is so difficult to use (and impossible to detect) that when I showed it to my blind friend, I had to go through a bunch of articles to figure out how it works. </li><li>  Move applications.  Creating a folder by dropping one application to another is the second most inconvenient feature of the iOS interface.  (the first is the cancellation of the action, see below).  Press and hold on the application - people usually do this only by accident.  And in general, ‚Äúpush and hold‚Äù - people who are not experts perform this action only by mistake. </li><li>  Did you know that in iPhones there is a drag-and-drop function?  I know.  But half the time she does not work.  You need to press not as much as for 3d Touch, but stronger than usual. </li><li>  Honorable mention: if someone told you that the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button is worn out, and only after that you turned on the <a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT202658">AssistiveTouch</a> - they <a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT202658">lied</a> to you.  Moreover, this myth is very common in China.  I have never seen a person with a disability use an AssistiveTouch.  It is used only by people with a broken screen and ethnic Chinese. </li></ul><br><h2>  Devilish Interfaces </h2><br>  The user interface for call waiting is not just confusing - you cannot use it while you are on the phone, after you realize that you have another incoming call and you are trying not to miss it (or are annoyed that your phone interrupted you ). <br><br>  You can search by iPhone.  He will not find a category (for example, the names of photos), but you can search.  You only need to learn the following sequence: <br><br><ol><li>  Find a place on Springboard (what is it?) Without applications and folders. </li><li>  Pull down (not from the top of the screen!) </li><li>  Drive a search phrase. </li></ol><br>  It turns out that (for most languages) you can make a swipe to the left from the home screen, and there will also appear a ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù - but because of the ‚Äúbanner blindness‚Äù it is almost not visible under the collapse of colorful and bright icons.  I know that he is there, and I never see him there. <br><br>  The two most difficult things to transfer to or from an iPhone: a photo and a URL. <br><br>  The simplest task, which is functionally impossible to do (as on the Macintosh): start playing exactly one song. <br><br><h2>  If experts who are paid for reviews of iPhones are not aware of the existence of a certain function, then it does not exist. </h2><br>  The most advanced experts ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/icloud_photo_library_start_over">one of them</a> ) had no idea that the following is possible.  And, as with many other features, the best way to demonstrate these features is video, not text. <br><br><h3>  You can select many photos </h3><br>  The albums in the Photos application are incomprehensible and they are not used.  Therefore, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/16/camera-roll-ios-81/">I had to return the</a> Camera Roll after it was abandoned.  And yet: go to any album (except for shared albums and some other types).  Click the "Select" button.  Click on the first photo.  Touch and do not lift your finger from the next photo, and then drag your finger to the end of the row.  Keep your finger pointing down to mark new rows. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d4/b92/5fc/8d4b925fc586a394186826fcd3083199.png"></div><br>  Need to remove the selection from several?  Can.  Just click on them again (you can also drag with your finger). <br><br>  It is interesting that in some albums you can drag photos - I discovered this when I didn‚Äôt cope with the procedure just described. <br><br><h3>  Advanced features that few understand </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT204144">AirDrop</a> . </li><li>  Apple Pay.  It is difficult and scary to understand even in countries where there are cards with chips for a long time. </li><li>  What is the Share menu, and that in such menus you can change the sequence of items and delete unnecessary ones. </li><li>  Delete the panel with the assumed variants of the typed word on the keyboard - for ten years I have seen how it is used only on Japanese and Chinese keyboards.  (People see it, just do not use it). </li><li>  Delete ‚Äúapplications‚Äù from the message set (this row of icons is immediately below the text entry field - no one knows what they are called, and few people need them). </li><li>  Add unusual or preferred spelling variations to the dictionary.  But this is called ‚ÄúText Replacement‚Äù, and this function is not reliably synchronized between devices.  Having bought a new phone, get ready to re-enter all this (I had to). </li><li>  The names of certain engineers from Apple are in the internal dictionary, and the phone does not underline them as a typo.  However, in iOS 12, it is still possible to write ‚ÄúOK‚Äù or ‚Äúok‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, since no one has introduced such simplest acronyms as OK or ‚Äúbtw‚Äù into the lexicon. </li><li>  The gold standard is the undo function.  You need to shake the iPhone (or the giant iPad Pro) to cancel the action.  You discover it by chance, rising from a table in a restaurant with a phone in your hand, and detecting the "Cancel Input" dialog box.  If you are not an expert, you will not guess what happened. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/572/68c/915/57268c9150a5bd9c37ea7d4a72714e0b.jpg"></div><br>  If you really need the undo feature, you can enable it with an AssistiveTouch.  But AssistiveTouch itself also has a devilish interface. <br><br><h2>  Siri uncomfortable to use </h2><br>  Like you, I can‚Äôt get Siri to do something right the first time in about three-quarters of cases.  We should not have to say something to a virtual assistant in a certain way.  After so many years, she just has to understand you.  But she does not understand.  (Siri is a male Australian). <br><br>  Make an appointment with Fred tomorrow at two o'clock. <br><br>  "With which Fred?" <br><br>  It's almost midnight, and she will ask you what day you mean.  If you are not a savage, and use the 24-hour time mark, she will correctly set the time, regardless of. <br><br>  Make an appointment for nine <br><br>  Attempts to make an appointment at 21:00 instead of 09:00 when normal people make appointments. <br><br>  Set up an appointment for two tomorrow. <br><br>  "Let me know if you need to change something."  ‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry I'm so stupid.‚Äù <br><br>  It turns out that you can hardly change any part of the record.  "Change the time to 2:35."  ‚ÄúChange the name to‚Äú late lunch ‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Really convenient features </h2><br><ul><li>  Let your phone tell you who is calling.  This is such a necessary thing that even David Pogue <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pogues-basics-have-your-iphone-announce-your-calls-212108695.html">wrote</a> about it [a critic who reviews gadgets / app.  trans.].  (Settings - Phone - Announce calls). </li><li>  Change the display of your contact names.  (Settings - Contacts - Short Name). </li><li>  Locking the screen in a few seconds after being idle is only needed by security specialists (and restless teenagers).  All the rest will be enough delay in a few minutes.  (Settings - Screen and brightness - Auto-lock). </li><li>  Scrolling up by clicking on the clock (who could detect it by chance?) There is no way to scroll down to the bottom of the system, because no one needs it - no Apple engineer had to scroll to the end of the list of 250 guests to the wedding. </li></ul><br><h2>  Did you know about the existence of instructions? </h2><br>  In the iBooks Store (or Books?), You can download an iPhone user guide for all major software versions.  Usually you can find instructions there for the iPad and sometimes for the iPod Touch. <br><br>  If you do this (and you will not do this), you may find that almost nothing of what I described here is described in the instructions.  It mentions the ability to announce caller names, but resizing text is buried so far that it only exacerbates the problem. <br><br>  iPhone inconvenient to use. <br><br>  [ <i>Approx.</i>  <i>Transl .: I do not have an iPhone, so I translated the English names of any settings and sections according to logic.</i>  <i>Write a <a href="https://habr.com/conversations/sly_g/">personal message</a> , if where wrong.</i>  ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428373/</a></p>
