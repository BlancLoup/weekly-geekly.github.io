  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia n86 8mp - Never Connected or Stay Offline</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About six months ago I won the Nokia n86 ‚Äî I dreamed about the device, I knew everything about it before I bought it, turned it in my hands at the Nokia Store ... I liked the device.  I loved him.  Therefore, I decided to buy it as much as 20 thousand rubles. <br><br>  What did I expect from the phone for 20 thousand rubles from the Nokia company? <br><ol><li>  You just </li><li>  Be always connected </li><li>  Service </li><li>  The perfect functioning of all the wealth that crammed into this expensive toy </li></ol><br>  What did I get? <a name="habracut"></a>  I got a camera.  It was worth thinking about this after seeing the name of the device for the first time.  But I did not think.  And now I am clearing up. <br><br><h4>  Email </h4><br>  Setting up email took me about ... half a year.  I hope so, not a dumb person.  At various times, the user palm, wine-mobile, i-background.  I could not configure the mail on my own.  Could not according to the instructions.  I could not after a long correspondence with the support.  It was possible to set up mail only after calling for support.  The essence of the problem - the email client asked to enter the mail address and password, then tried to connect somewhere, said that the server is unavailable and ... everything.  There are no settings anywhere.  I write from the service - enter the addresses of the servers manually.  I have them - nowhere to enter them!  They tell me - select the box, press Options ... I give them - yes there is no box, it is not created.  They give me a backup and format the phone ... And so for a few weeks.  New firmware released.  The problem has not disappeared.  Ugh.

    <h4>  Internet connection </h4><br>  Constant requests to connect to the network.  Continuous.  Turn on the phone - hanging request.  Climbed all the settings, in the access points indicated automatic connection.  Anyway, the request constantly flies.  And this, for a moment, is the complete contradiction of Always Connected, and is completely identical to manual checking of the same mail.  I am ready to spend a little money on GPRS, but let the phone check my mail myself?  I don‚Äôt even need to push, although, looking ahead, I‚Äôll say that he ‚Äúis.‚Äù  That's right, in quotes. <br><br><h4>  Nokia websites </h4><br>  Oh, Nokia websites.  It is almost like Microsoft sites.  Their million.  Users are completely shamelessly thrown between the sites of Russia, Europe, UK and further support, ovi, discussions, forums, etc.  etc.  Logins do not fit from one to another.  Passwords are reset.  Names are remembered.  Recover password is not possible.  This is the theater of the absurd - Neverhood from Nokia, I thought it was impossible on the Internet in 2009.  But Nokia succeeds.  I thought that the site Asus is the worst (only 4 windows open until you get to the club section), but Nokia is like flying to another galaxy compared to a trip to another city with Asus.  Asus, sorry!  You are great! <br><br><h4>  Support </h4><br>  Polite guys try to help.  But they can not.  The only thing they can offer is to back up and format the phone.  I already do it in a dream.  I wake up in the morning, and the phone is formatted, because, damn, motility.  Everything about the support will not write anything. <br><br><h4>  Unexpected "solution" mail problems </h4><br>  I'm setting up here somehow after the next formatting of the phone.  I climb, already anticipating any nastiness, in messages, I drive in the e-mail address and the password.  And suddenly something that has never happened before happens to me - the phone itself sets something up, creates a box and let's greet me in the Nokia Messaging service.  Op-pa think what kind of beast?  Climbed to the site - it turns out it is almost a lively push, with support right up to 10 boxes, in general, solid charms.  In three minutes I create both my boxes, I sit, I move away from the shock.  So, I think how it was all planned.  Well, I was so tormented for half a year.  I threw a test letter, it immediately went on the phone.  Everyone, I think, got used to our characters with the phone, now how are we going to live in perfect harmony!  Yeah, ran up. <br><br><h4>  Unexpected ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to connection problems </h4><br>  And connection requests have stopped.  Ugh, I think, probably the evil eye was.  And then I somehow took it off, probably reading the correct prayer when formatting. <br><br><h4>  And I did not say that the phone hangs? </h4><br>  Not that often.  But this is a very nasty problem on n86 8mp.  Because the only way to reset it is to remove the battery.  And to do this, you need to pry the lid with your fingernail.  I'm not a girlfriend, but what I feel like broken nails is very good.  At the same time, when you hook the lid, there‚Äôs nothing to hold the phone for - except for the slider.  This is very uncomfortable and bad.  And try to do it on the go, and even better when you're driving. <br><br><h4>  Why, in the preceding paragraphs, was the word ‚Äúdecision‚Äù in quotes? </h4><br>  Yes, because the test letter was the only one that Nokia Messaging missed.  Now there are mailboxes, the service is active, but mailboxes are not received.  You go in the message, you say - connect the box.  No answer.  I think - maybe GPRS does not work?  No, the internet is flying.  All settings climbed - maybe the access point is not that or something else.  No, all that.  All right, I think.  In vain did I get experience on Vin Mobile.  Delete the box and create anew.  Well, who will say that this way will not work, who?  Does it always work?  FIG!  You!  You can not delete the box until there is no connection to the Internet !!!  And it is!  But it is not. <br><br><h4>  And now what i can do? </h4><br>  Call in support?  Are you kidding me? <br><br>  In general, SW.  Nokia  Your favorite question is whether you recommend Nokia to your friends.  How, how can you tell me, I can recommend Nokia to my friends, if I myself can‚Äôt get everything from the device for half a year what was listed on the Nokia Store price tag?  Only you honestly say. <br><br>  PS In the aftermath, screenshot of Nokia‚Äôs support site <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_BVjB4Vkjp2A/Swuvl7LsSaI/AAAAAAAABsQ/8ghCpSJ-PrI/s800/Nokia.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76199/</a></p>
