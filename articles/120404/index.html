  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Subjective view of DevCon'11 or will HTML5 conquer Russia in the near future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My main interest in the DevCon'11 conference was related to the topic of the struggle of technologies on the client.  The report ‚ÄúClient selection - HTML5, Silverlight, WPF, Win32‚Äù and the eponymous round table I considered for myself the key events at this conference.  Why? <br><br>  Because now I, as a developer of solutions for end users, really have to choose between technologies such as WinForms + WCF + ClickOnce on the one hand and Silverlight 4 - the most progressive, but still developing and currently yielding in some aspects to the previous set of technologies (WinForms + WCF + ClickOnce). <br>  And then the release of Silverlight 5 and the hype about HTML 5, which should kill all the technologies on the client that we have used so far, are just around the corner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  May 26, 2011 </h5><br>  <i>Next, there will be a slight deviation from the technology to the description of the registration process for events DevCon 11.</i>

      The morning was cool and after thinking whether to take something warmer with me than a long-sleeved T-shirt, I decide not to take it in favor.  At nine o'clock we sit with colleagues on the bus and discuss the upcoming conference program.  The question arose why in the subject of the report ‚ÄúChoice on the client - HTML5, Silverlight, WPF, Win32‚Äù is not designated WinForms?  We decide that this type should be understood as Win32.  Somehow, with uncertainty, we agree with this and go with the hope that everything will be clarified soon.  The trip was long.  Are there always such traffic jams in this direction?  Is it so unlucky for us on Thursday?  It is not clear.  I always thought that traffic jams should be in the morning from the Moscow region to Moscow, but not vice versa.  But finally the traffic jams disappear and we feel that our bus is picking up speed, and we will be there soon.  But suddenly the bus slows down and we are asked to go out for everyone.  There are questions.  What's the matter?  How so?  How long to go?  Answer.  The girls at the Reception do not have time to register participants and asked to delay the bus on the road.  Shit happens or C'est la vie.  A cool morning makes you want to pour out the excess liquid.  Where to cast?  Near only the forest and one path, completely littered with some kind of garbage.  Tiptoe along the path through the garbage into the woods.  In the forest, the soil is still wet, such as not until the end of a dry marsh.  Shit happens or C'est la vie.  But soon we are back on the bus, and after another 20 minutes on the spot.  Hooray! <br><br><h5>  Registration process </h5><br>  The queue at the reception.  Cost  Our turn is coming.  The girl at the reception - ‚ÄúHello, what is your name?  To move into the room, please turn in that queue. ‚Äù  We turn to another line.  Cost  A turn is coming.  Girl - ‚ÄúHello.  Where are you settling in? ‚ÄùWe answer‚Äú How do we know? ‚Äù.  The girl shows with her hand where the lists are hanging.  We release the queue, go study the lists.  We find our last names and next column, with some sort of numbers.  In this case, the number was 3. To understand what it is we are looking for the heading of the column.  The first word that comes up at the top is the word ‚Äúcottage‚Äù.  We decide that we have a cottage number 3.  Again we stand in line.  Cost  A turn is coming.  Girl - ‚ÄúHello.  Where are you settling in? ‚ÄùWe -‚Äú Cottage number 3 ‚ÄùThe girl thought for a moment, rummaged through some papers, replied -‚Äú Cottage number 3 we haven't ‚Äù  Then we say that we saw there simply the number 3 and decided that it means a cottage.  The girl replies that this most likely means the corps and invites us to enter the corpus number 3 and find out everything there.  Fortunately, it really turned out to be a building and, after standing up last, we finally settled in and went to a normal toilet.  Fortunately, a great Zdob si zdub concert (I don‚Äôt know how it translates, but in my mind the association with ‚Äúso that you are dead‚Äù) at the end of the evening and the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfree beer smoothed all the morning inconveniences. <br><br><h5>  We return again to the technology on the client </h5><br>  The overall impression of the conference is HTML (even 5, not 4) + java script in 2011, this is what will determine the nearest future on the client.  I had a strange feeling.  Do I sleep now, and I dream all this, or I just woke up and all that was said at the previous conferences ‚ÄúPlatform ....‚Äù I dreamed.  WinForm was declared obsolete by no technology in the world, and therefore not included in the discussion list.  But what about all the programs that have been made and are still working on this technology?  How WCF + ClickOnce?  What are the best and richest devexpress components in the world for WinForms?  By the way, my DevCon'11 logo was associated with DevExpress, probably due to the first letters of the Dev and the color scheme.  It seems that Microsoft has forgotten due to which they now can raise a topic altogether - the choice on the client applies to their products.  They forgot that there was such a Delphi before and that without creating something more convenient than Delphi‚Äôs environment, they wouldn‚Äôt discuss this topic at all, or nobody particularly listened to them. <br>  As for SilverLight.  In version 5, it will become a truly mature product that really claims to be a killer of WinForms and WebForms.  As once WinForms and WebForms + VisualStudio killed Delphi or at least significantly pressed, SilverLight5 should become the product that will kill WinForms and WebForms. <br><br><h5>  Must, but will it? </h5><br>  Powerful HTML5 PR makes many people doubt SilverLight as the technology that will be relevant in two more years.  If on SilverLight and HTML5, in two years, it will be possible to create applications of equal complexity for the same time frame.  Will anyone ever need SilverLight in the future? <br>  Unfortunately, no one answered this question directly at the conference. <br><br>  In my opinion, the following situation is now on the client. <br><br>  <b>first place</b> <br>  WinForms + WCF + ClickOnce + (DevExpress components) + (patterns &amp; practices - Smart Client Guidance) <br><br>  <b>second place</b> <br>  SilverLight + WCF RIA Services + (patterns &amp; practices: Prism) + MVVM patterns <br><br>  <b>third place</b> <br>  HTML5 + (hope that there will be components, convenient development environments, recommendations for developing enterprise-level applications) <br><br>  Win32 and C ++ for mass development on the client in 2011, in my opinion, should not be considered.  The complexity of the creation, maintenance, creation time is too high.  Win32 and C ++ will remain a means to create environments for client development or highly specialized tasks.  Although, if the majority of clients suddenly become devices that do not support the .NET Framework or HTML5, Win32 and C ++ come out on top. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Of course DevCon'11 event is very necessary and useful.  At such an event for developers, there is an opportunity to learn about what the leading software companies are focused on.  In turn, software companies have the opportunity to receive feedback from ordinary developers, about their thoughts, doubts, desires. <br><br>  My opinion on the client will win not just technology, but technology + development tools.  By and large, it does not matter that it will be silverligth or html5, the native code.  They will defeat environments and technologies that allow them to create quickly ‚Äî reliable, easily followed, extensible code.  I would like these development environments to be simple and convenient.  And maybe at the DevCon'15 conference we will be able to see many young and happy girls of user interface designers who use these products and our harsh male developers environment will be diluted by the beauty of beautiful female smiles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120404/</a></p>
