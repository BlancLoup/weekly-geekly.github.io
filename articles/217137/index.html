Today we published the <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/index-ruward/united-web-rating-2014/">results of the 2014 Ruward Web Studios Unified Rating</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/292/db9/952/292db99522663b30370b2c9d2fac8476.png" alt="image"></div><br>  In fact, habrayusers are not very fond of ratings, and posts about them rarely gain a lot of votes.  But ratings are the main profile of Ruward's activities, so we just cannot not write about them in our corporate blog. <br><br>  Our web studio chart is the most comprehensive, transparent and comprehensive product on the market.  The technique is based on the aggregation of all other industry ratings (as many as 15 pieces were published in 2013 only for the web development segment), and as a result, they are absolutely transparent, everyone can check if our algorithm correctly calculated points for each participant.

      The result of the method of "collecting in a pile" of all the data on other tops, of course, are the pieces of colleagues about the "rating ratings" and the second / third derivative of the market.  We used to =) <br><br>  In the bottom line, our methodology allows us to make a table that is as secure as possible from various kinds of markups - and the most consistently reflecting the real alignment of forces.  Even if someone got into one of the tops with an unfair method, then on the total mass of data this fact will be very insignificant - the general aggregation of data is almost the same heartless bitch as gravity. <br><br>  So, we come to the point and tell you more about the top ten companies of our rating: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/895/b68/3da/895b683dac331b0f02e984257636b43f.png">  <a href="http://artlebedev.ru/">Art. Lebedev Studio</a> .  The studio holds the first year of the rating for the second year, despite a certain decrease in the company's focus on the development of Internet projects.  But in 2013, Lebedev Studio released more sites than in 2012 (25 projects against 19). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/923/88d/d4a92388de7871494c626c6b9c223de0.png">  <a href="http://actis.ru/">Actis Wunderman</a> .  Aktis receives the silver of the Unified Rating, as in the past year.  The company is the largest full-cycle agency on the market (more than 200 employees).  Due to the high positions in the ratings of 2013 (and also due to the first place in one of the most authoritative charts of the Tagline agency), Actis Wunderman was able to significantly increase the gap from the third place of the rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d83/599/5b0/d835995b0447bfc96716900b097f684c.png">  <a href="http://adv.ru/">ADV / web-engineering</a> .  ADV for the second time in a row takes the third step of the pedestal.  De facto, ADV is the largest web production on the market by the number of developers.  During 2013, the company changed its positioning and approach to working with clients on the ideology of performance based marketing, and also significantly expanded its client portfolio at the expense of large e-commerce brands.  It is also worth noting the first place of ADV in the new Tagline web integrators rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8f/af6/0c0/b8faf60c0deab6b75cbf3ef7e6583e0d.png">  <a href="http://defa.ru/">DEFA</a> .  The defa shows impressive growth by 9 positions and is in fourth place in the final chart.  In many ways, such a rapid growth in positions is due to high places in the ratings of CMS Magazine and Tagline, as well as good positions in other tops.  It is also worth noting that not so long ago, on the basis of the company, a new agency, Dr. Jung, was formed, where the direction of services for the promotion and organization of integrated integrated advertising campaigns was highlighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/083/6cd/4020836cd5689b194e5d1594e5098d9e.png">  <a href="http://redkeds.com/">Red Keds</a> .  Red Sneakers lose one position and close the top five.  From the positions in the local charts, it is worth noting the first place in the new Adindex ranking by the quality of services (web-production segment).  Red Keds are still one of the most active players in terms of market infrastructure development: Vitaly Bykov is the chairman of the Association of Interactive Agencies, and the Keds themselves are developing the Cossa portal, the Digital conference without Silicone, the educational project of IKRA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/234/ef7/7fd/234ef77fda7418c1fd6d446d93dd0421.png">  <a href="http://articul.ru/">Articul Media</a> .  The article rises immediately to five lines and occupies the sixth place in the rating of studios.  The company successfully completed work (as a key design contractor) for the most significant client account of recent years - the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and strengthened its position by increasing places in almost all popular web development segment charts (it is worth mentioning the first place Articul Media in Tagline design studios). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d9/204/41d/2d920441da404fba6c26d83caba7dc74.png">  <a href="http://armd.ru/">Armada SOFT</a> .  The company ranked seventh in the chart for the second year in a row.  In many ways, such a high position is due to second places in the ratings of CMS Magazine studios and Tagline web integrators, as well as the first place to work with public companies of Runet Rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/350/8bd/525/3508bd5254a12a605558a8349db27a0b.png">  <a href="http://promo.ru/">Promo Interactive</a> .  Promo rises immediately to 12 positions and occupies the 8th row of our chart.  Such a quick take-off is the result of the appearance of the company in a number of ratings, where it was absent in previous years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d3/640/516/6d364051624f727f2a11b432a3f6baae.png">  <a href="http://cpeople.ru/">Creative People</a> .  CPeople loses four rating points and is located on the ninth row of the table.  The agency is actively developing, and the focus of attention is gradually shifting from production services towards complex RK and a strategic aspect.  Not so long ago, Glazyrin CG production was incorporated into the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcb/da1/7dd/fcbda17ddd76a20450e31701f601c349.png">  <a href="http://agima.ru/">AGIMA</a> .  Agima first entered the top ten, rising to 12 positions at once.  The rapid rise is associated with narrow core positioning, active promotion of the adaptive design segment, as well as the fast-growing portfolio of large projects for companies in the financial and insurance sector. <br><br>  The best newcomers to the rating were <a href="http://spyk.ru/">SPYK</a> (United Siberian Agency - 14th place), <a href="http://dalee.ru/">Dalee</a> (17th place), <a href="http://pichesky.ru/">Pichesky</a> (19th place), <a href="http://artus.ru/">Artus</a> (25th place), <a href="http://2nova.ru/">2Nova</a> (29th place) and <a href="http://accorddigital.ru/">Accord Digital</a> (33rd place). <br><br>  A complete list of the top 100 <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/index-ruward/united-web-rating-2014/">can be found on the rating page</a> .  I will be glad to answer questions =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217137/</a></p>
