  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen WinWin and WinJoy: an overview of the most affordable smartphones on Windows Phone 8.1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the modest share of gadgets on Windows Phone in the overall standings, Microsoft's operating system does not lose appeal in the eyes of fans.  Following the takeover of Nokia in 2014, Microsoft embarked on promoting its OS for mobile devices.  This summer, the company has simplified access to Windows Phone 8.1 for other manufacturers.  The Russian brand Highscreen took advantage of the situation and presented two low-priced viphones at once - Highscreen WinJoy and Highscreen WinWin.  About them, and will be discussed in this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c00/8f1/b61/c008f1b61e464267949d06b85d0ffd69.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First about the price.  Highscreen WinJoy, the youngest model in the line, in the official store of the brand costs 3990 rubles, Highscreen WinWin - 4490 rubles.  The difference in price is small, it is also small in technical characteristics.  Just starting with the differences. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Equipment</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the standard paper set-instructions-warranty, the box with Highscreen WinWin has an additional back cover in bright yellow.  While the main color of the smartphone is black.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1c/9d6/2a6/f1c9d62a6dce4f2c82129087108bfe1a.JPG"><br><br>  Highscreen WinJoy comes without interchangeable rear panels, but the model itself is presented in four color variations at once: black, white, red and blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/aa2/085/ef8aa20852d74d87a810f2728ad82b6b.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are also slightly different: WinWin headsets have rubber covers and a silver button for answering a call, WinJoy looks a bit simpler.  Looking ahead, we note that those and other headphones are suitable for hands-free conversations, and for better listening to music it is better to choose something more serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/9da/e93/7b69dae93995464ab5ae903e54252213.JPG"><br><br>  With WinWin comes the power adapter at 0.8 A, with WinJoy - at 1 A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c40/f41/64b/c40f4164b4c540c9859792f90dbe973c.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Multimedia speakers</font> </h2><br>  Everything is simple: Highscreen WinJoy is equipped with only one speaker - the speaker, it also serves as a multimedia speaker.  At Highscreen WinWin there is a full-fledged multimedia speaker, at the edges of which there are two small protrusions - so that the sound does not spoil when the smartphone is turned ‚Äúon its back‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/59d/d89/64e59dd8973e45bb833d82441081f287.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Battery</font> </h2><br>  Batteries for both smartphones are removable.  WinJoy has a smaller battery - 1700 mAh.  Included with WinWin is a 2000 mAh battery.  But don't let that frighten you much, because this is about the WindowsPhone, not about Android.  So, on average, the boot mode of the first model can work without recharging for two days, the second - 2.5. <br><br>  This is where the main differences between smartphones end.  On trifles we will understand in the course of the review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d4/694/939/5d46949392cc4f5dbf70652d051a25f8.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Control elements</font> </h2><br>  Despite the fact that both devices weigh the same - 105 grams each, and are equipped with 4-inch screens, WinWin looks a little more than a younger comrade.  WinWin dimensions are 126x64x10.5 mm, WinJoy parameters are 122x63x9.9 mm.  The difference in the thickness of the screen frames - they are wider in WinWin. <br>  Speech speakers are located on the top of the front side.  Front cameras are located right there.  In WinWin it is in the right corner, in WinJoy it is in the left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/618/c61/14f618c61b3143cb9265e6cc39328991.JPG"><br><br>  Under the screen is a standard set of touch buttons: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù.  Also at the bottom is a microphone, at WinJoy - at the bottom, and at WinWin - under the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c9/2c2/8a6/3c92c28a68a64a248f13d29f17a51b37.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/484/1b6/589/4841b6589dd54fa8a0222ff4138846fc.JPG"><br><br>  There are two connectors on the top side of the WinWin: for the micro USB cable and for the headphones.  At the top of the Vinjoy there is only a 3.5 mm audio output, in the micro-USB connector - on the left side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/430/1fa/901/4301fa90143b49409ee2ecae38e51d46.JPG"><br><br>  Also, smartphones have a mirrored location of the volume button.  On WinJoy - top right, next to the phone's power button, on WinWin - on the left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17f/2f3/cc4/17f2f3cc47404a3ea81d8e083e95005d.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3d/0b9/78c/b3d0b978c8c6495ebae550823e6c8a17.JPG"><br><br>  Smartphones support different types of SIM-cards: WinWin - miniSIM, in WinJoy - microSIM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e22/681/70f/e2268170fd904ce48c5f452b78440af6.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Screen</font> </h2><br>  Gadget displays are protected by durable glass with oleophobic coating and anti-reflective layer.  Further characteristics are similar.  As noted above, the screen diagonal for both devices is 4 inches.  Resolution 480x800 pixels, pixel density - 233 PPI. <br><br>  The matrix used by the TFT-TN does not provide wide viewing angles (compared to IPS), but still the picture is bright and saturated.  WinWin display supports up to three simultaneous touches, WinJoy - up to two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/378/147/bbd/378147bbd7d3436f87e1bef533a5a1c9.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Hardware platform</font> </h2><br>  Both smartphones are based on Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8212 chipsets - 4 cores with a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  Adreno 302 is used as a graphics accelerator. The RAM capacity is 512 MB.  If for smartphones on Android, such volume will cause braking when launching a number of programs, then this is not observed on the ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù.  This is good for Windows Phone 8.1: it almost does not freeze and reacts quickly.  Of course, by no means all applications run on Windows phones with 512 MB of RAM ‚Äî however, in this case, inappropriate programs simply do not appear in the Marketplace.  For example, Asphalt 8 and other popular games run without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/cae/c1a/dc3caec1af5c42d2a24a2fbfe09f9645.png"><br><br>  For storing files provides 4 GB of internal memory.  Since almost half of this volume is already occupied by system files, the presence of a microSD memory card slot is clearly not superfluous. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Connection</font> </h2><br>  Both smartphones support the work of two SIM-cards.  In Windows Phone 8.1, management of various SIM cards is very conveniently implemented.  Each number is assigned its own Tile for calls and SMS.  The devices operate in 2G cellular networks (GSM / GPRS / EDGE, 850/900/1800/1900 MHz) and 3G (900/2100 MHz).  Both slots support 3G, but not simultaneously.  If one SIM card has a 3G connection, the second one automatically switches to 2G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b63/6ae/f14/b636aef14b5d47e1bb07f0d03b23ce0a.png"><br><br>  From the set of standard wireless modules, we note the presence of GLONASS along with GPS.  As you know, dual-system navigation has several advantages: communication with satellites is established faster and is more stable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Camera</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen WinWin and WinJoy are equipped with two cameras.  The main one has a resolution of 5 megapixels (+ autofocus and flash), the front has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels.  The quality of photos in both devices is the same.  With good natural lighting, you can get good shots in the room - as lucky.  However, the text in the photo is well recognized - thanks to the auto focus.  Examples of frames made on Highscreen WinWin: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60c/eaf/606/60ceaf606a7746c1a004958570da0091.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/440/73c/848/44073c8488964c488cf9fbd3d90027e3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Pictures taken on Highscreen WinJoy: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/167/2f0/359/1672f03591034c03a0d745d370205a0b.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae2/2e8/62d/ae22e862d41442d987697e808baf4d2f.jpg"></a> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen WinWin and WinJoy are compact, well-built smartphones with a fresh version of Windows Phone 8.1 on board.  These are not flagship devices, but ‚Äúevery day‚Äù models, for solving simple ordinary tasks - calls, internet surfing, killing time for Angry Birds.  The low price of smartphones makes these devices attractive in the eyes of students, parents of schoolchildren, and those who have long wanted to try the Microsoft operating system, but were afraid to take the risk.  Highscreen WinWin and WinJoy know everything that modern smartphones should be able to, plus they support the work of two SIM-cards and catch signals from GLONASS satellites - not all budget vinfonov have it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364321/</a></p>
