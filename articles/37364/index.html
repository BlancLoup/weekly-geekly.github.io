I want to insert my five kopecks.  I'll tell you about the life of the Parallels company from the inside :) <br><br>  I no longer remember my feelings when I settled down, but for some reason people who come to us for a couple of hours immediately notice THIS.  At the level of the atmosphere, how everything is organized here, how everything communicates and so on.  In short, many people like it.  Although, if we talk about the location of the office - then it is a complete ass - m. "Otradnoe" ("despicable" as it is called here). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c24/83b/465/c2483b465d34a06a7a4746de836c8174.jpg"><br>  <u>We occupy 2 floors of this business center</u> <a name="habracut"></a>

      However, in the past we all sat in Dolgoprudny, so that one FIG.  Now, from Otradny, Rechnik and Dolgopy (from there we have a lot of employees - the proximity of MIPT affects) to the office go corporate shuttles - it saves.  Someone, of course, comes by private cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33d/2ca/598/33d2ca598a499aa4df3d5edd40bbd016.jpg"><br>  <u>Solid Rolls-Royces in our car park</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/456/3d6/0d44563d6523d564d14acc16269a4c61.jpg"><br><br>  You know, this bicycle parking was given to us by blood and sweat, because the authorities somehow did not assume that someone would drive a big bike in a pleasant, but such mmm ... enthusiasts were found!  After moving from Dolgop, many people changed their place of residence and began to rent apartments near the office.  Apparently, they are relevant. <br><br>  It is very important that Parallels realistically appreciate the ‚Äúdislike‚Äù of programmers and engineers, people of a special creative focus, so to speak, to a rigid framework, so the work schedule is essentially everyone chooses for himself, and the well-established notions of morning and evening are nicely stretched.  So morning at us lasts till 12 o'clock in the afternoon, and evening till 10 o'clock in the evening.  Most of it suits. <br><br>  <u>Our hard working days:</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/7f1/28c/26e7f128c862a2a9277a4747d296a538.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/7af/54a/7b97af54ac7457feb47bde584421ebde.jpg"><br><br>  I do not know how strong this argument is, but for example, I like it when in the office there are coffee machines, tea, sweets at every step.  A trifle - but nice.  I know companies where, for some delusional reasons, local tea drinking or walking with corridors are not welcome.  Even more fun where coffee and tea are sold in vending machines :) In Parallels is not so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/857/95b/05e/85795b05eed8c3845af2261f6af56161.jpg"><br><br>  The dining room is ordinary.  The food is not a restaurant, but not the soup from the bags.  Before the dining room appeared, everyone dined on the ground.  In general, it is surprising that when it appeared, there were those who wanted to continue the tradition - to eat on the spot without interrupting production, or what ?!  But their pleas were not heeded.  IMHO did the right thing - the first, second, third, dessert and compote is easier somehow at the dinner table to place ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/938/b20/f50/938b20f505f55e257ab72c063322adbf.jpg"><br>  <u>It was‚Ä¶</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c3/002/f00/0c3002f006b13ee3c921d08e47496a6a.jpg"><br>  <u>So it became: "Where am I going to grub?" (C) Heart of a dog</u> <br><br>  Rallies to discuss any working moments are mainly conducted not even in negotiations, but in corridors and open spaces throughout the office.  When 30 people are going, this is the whole action.  Sometimes for the sake of brevity and quickness of understanding we switch to another great and mighty language ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb0/5bd/b09/cb05bdb095a29964f2f2848a68a38327.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73a/405/a0d/73a405a0d8cf012339002054240e8b46.jpg"><br>  <u>No comments:)</u> <br><br>  The guys from kernel developer'ov are trying to win the title of the room of high culture of speech.  For each abusive word a fine of 10 to 50 rubles.  Money folded in the bank and then spent on cakes.  Recently we expanded the price list by introducing a new option ‚Äúmonthly subscription‚Äù (cost 500 rubles) - they presented the first subscription to a colleague on the DR (they took it in bulk for half a year) - now he can ‚Äúconcisely‚Äù speak for as long as 6 months without any penalties. <br><br>  In general, despite the standard interior of our office space, some of them are particularly fancy about the appearance and interior elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97e/f52/435/97ef5243535103949735860135ae407d.jpg"><br><br>  <u>Cone, helmet, shovel and iron are sometimes used to "stimulate" the work of employees</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b06/700/314/b067003144a63b42b1797dc16bf9d18a.jpg"><br><br>  <u>Popularly, Parallels Desktop for Mac is called the balalaika.</u>  <u>Once, in order to make it easier to materialize our idea, this very balalaika was presented to the leadership.</u>  <u>A lot of time has passed since then, but the balalaika is still alive and has become our calling card.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/306/773/876/306773876fa38b9a544e701bf8fdfe91.jpg"><br><br>  <u>Real plunger (clean of course; never used for its intended purpose) - a kind of amulet from a blockage of the brain</u> <br><br>  As for the boss, he is quite ascetic.  No reception of wood and leather sofas.  He asked to ‚Äúphotograph the office of <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/30401">Sergei Belousov</a> in the‚Äú holy of holies ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05e/372/86e/05e37286e01951d3121d6b53b575a11e.jpg"><br>  <u>Cot for relaxing</u> <br><br>  Previously, in front of the Belousov office there was a sports simulator, on which occasionally someone puffed.  It is difficult to imagine what feelings this sight gave birth to its visitors.  But he himself is an amateur to strain not only the brain, but also the muscles :) Therefore, now the simulators are in all the offices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e46/373/24b/e4637324be7d95888b3a39bde44406f7.jpg"><br>  <u>Fell-wrung out!</u> <br><br>  Especially worth staying at the local ladies.  Imagine, there are a lot of them here, although I don‚Äôt remember that in software companies the female gender was in proper presence.  Some even work in the Core team, where 20 key developers work.  An example from the life of our girls :): I meet one in the subway.  There is nothing to do, she asks: do you want to show pictures?  Of course, I agreed.  I think, like all girls, now they will get typical pictures from Turkey and show them.  Right now!  She gets a laptop out of her handbag and starts to show how she was vacationing in Siberia (sic!) Because it‚Äôs not fun in Turkey (and the girl really loves traveling).  The final question: why are you carrying a laptop - is it heavy?  After answering, the people around him fell into the sediment: ‚Äúwell, I still need to add the driver, and at home there is not a single 64-bit host ...‚Äù and then there is a tirade on the internal structure of microprocessors, etc., etc. <br><br>  <u>And these are representatives of the male part of our colorful team:</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d38/525/eb8/d38525eb8b9e27e0cfc59f2d30fad462.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cb/1a2/534/0cb1a25349db443f7c8d8f92688bf428.jpg"><br><br>  And the last.  As I have already said, the working day is shifted, so we have something like snacks) As a herd of hungry bison, people rush to the canteen to consume the baters and says, says, says, says ... mostly about work ( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/822/805/721/8228057218fe84b24baa971e3fb4ab70.jpg"><br><br>  This is how we live ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37364/</a></p>
