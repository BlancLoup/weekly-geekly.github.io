Android users should be more serious about the security of their data, as Avast experts with the help of their utilities were able to get personal data from 20 used phones purchased on eBay.  To reach out to our prudence, Avast has published information in the form of <a href="">infographics</a> . <br><br>  More than 40,000 photos and other equally important data were acquired by specialists from these phones.  And here, probably, it is impossible to blame the users themselves, they, following the instructions, deleted this information from the phones.  The problem is that, due to the software features of the devices, this data was not actually erased.  In addition, Avast warns that in some cases does not save factory reset.  You can solve the problem of ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù files using the free application from Avast (the post is not advertising). <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  It's time to embed deep links from Facebook into your applications. </h4><br>  Recall that the company Facebook for a long time announced the App Links - the ability to follow the link from Facebook immediately inside the mobile application.  Today, the company <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2014/07/01/app-links-reaches-1-billion/">reported</a> that developers have created more than 1 billion such links. <br><br>  This is a very convenient mechanism to transfer the user from the Facebook feed to the desired screen of your mobile application.  An excellent viral tool and the ability to retarget users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/f29/297/d69f292970577e94f714e7925ce27e67.png"><br><br>  Direct integration with mobile applications is gaining momentum and provides developers with very effective tools for interacting with users.  As we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kamagames/blog/225015/">wrote</a> , Google now indexes mobile applications and allows you to immediately open the mobile application from the search results and view the content there. <br><br>  The possibilities of mobile applications are increasing every day.  The disadvantages of the mobile web are less and less) <br><br><br><h4>  Messengers now get to the locks of your devices </h4><br>  A funny creation from a startup Loklok with an interesting idea.  This application allows you to draw hearts on your friend's lock screen.  Or a friend, okay.  Or friends, long live the 21st century!  Isn't it nice to send photos and pictures with your own captions and drawings, wishing people a good morning or mimicking during the day? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/patgOkFHOgU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5Dfd9-rILwD0qhKKyfdku3ZTKbg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way!  You can not only share your message with one addressee, but also chat in a group: find out the opinion of friends about this or that menu item or solve the issue of choosing a movie.  However, at the moment, at the same time it is possible to consist only in three groups.  The creators explain this with their focus on comfort, warmth, and the desire to give users the opportunity to share their mood with greater clarity.  So the value of messages sent should increase. <br><br>  So if you want the first thing you saw in the morning, unlocking the screen, dear man, was your man-made message - download!  The application is already available.  True, there is another limitation.  The program is available only for Android.  Versions under iOS, most likely, are not foreseen, in any case, with fully preserved functionality: Apple's OS does not allow to interact with Lockscreen in a similar way. <br><br><br><h4>  New MOBA on mobile platforms - Fates Forever </h4><br>  In late June, very successfully unleashed the whole world <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id859204347">WoT Blitz</a> .  Judging by the indicators, the game feels great.  Behind the PC, the tanks seized the tops of the grossing and in the mobile space.  And what other popular genres and titles on the PC have not yet switched to mobile platforms? <br><br>  The largest genre is MOBA (DotA2, League of Legens).  These games earn as others and do not dream.  Therefore, it is not surprising that there are companies that are trying to repeat this success on mobile platforms. <br>  The first bird was the game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id509458284">Heroes of Order &amp; Chaos</a> from Gameloft, it came out already in November 2012. She paid for herself, lit up everywhere, but could not win much success.  The next game of this genre was Zynga's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id648531679">Solstice Arena</a> , released in May 2013. Its performance was sadder, but the game even went out on Steam.  It seemed everyone was convinced that you should not transfer this genre to tablets, but no. <br><br>  There are two new projects, the developers of which are going to try their luck in this area.  Remarkably, both games are made exclusively for tablets. <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ph/app/vainglory/id671464704%3Fmt%3D8">Vainglory</a> is a very beautiful MOBA with its own look at the interfaces and gameplay.  Games go 3x3.  There are so few heroes, but it's nice to play.  The game is launched only in a number of Asian countries and is at the soft launch stage. <br><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id658886500">Fates Forever</a> was recently opened to the world.  She has a bit of an unusual setting, similar to the Kung Fu Pandu cartoon, but the game is very well done.  And it is recommended to familiarize all those who yearn for Dota on the tablets. <br><br>  The new MOBAs are very well made, but there is still no game that could repeat the success of DotA on mobile platforms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230115/</a></p>
