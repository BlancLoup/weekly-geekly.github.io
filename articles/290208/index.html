Earlier, I had already considered the <a href="https://forum.bits.media/index.php%3F/blog/178/entry-299-dash-otcenka-investitcionnogo-potentciala/">Investment aspect</a> and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/253623/">Technological aspect</a> (in terms of ensuring anonymous payments).  Now I would like to touch on the issue of general strategy and management, which set the dynamics of development and, ultimately, determine the fate of any project. <br><br>  <b>RECIPE FOR SUCCESS</b> <br><br>  In the world in general, and in the world of cryptocurrencies in particular, there are many ambitious and talented programmers, ideologues, PR specialists, etc.  specialists who daily try to realize their abilities by doing something useful.  However, we see that only a small percentage of new cryptocurrency projects eventually achieve at least some success.  What is the reason for this?

I'm not going to do it, my goal is different - I want to offer you, with the example of Dash, to look at a cryptocurrency project in terms of a classic startup.  Yes, I think that both Dash and Bitcoin and the rest of the Altcoins continue to be in the startup stage.  Startup operation is the development of a new technology that is not yet in demand by society (investors and enthusiasts are not counted), but the developers are trying in every way to create functionality that meets the needs of ordinary people, to create on the basis of these needs a new market and related services. a significant part of this new market and as a result achieve a wide practical application of their technology in the foreseeable future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dash entered the cryptocurrency market by the time Bitcoin had already established itself as the undisputed leader.  In the case of classic startups, this would mean an almost inevitable defeat for a beginner.  However, a number of technological features of Dash not only make it easy to use the entire Bitcoin infrastructure that has been developed and relatively easy to compensate for the lag in a number of points, but also to offer a number of revolutionary fundamental differences that are not amenable to direct copying by competitors.  In addition, the cryptocurrency market itself is still in its infancy, which makes it possible to talk about high chances for Dash to intercept long-term leadership. <br><br>  <b>FINANCIAL SIDE</b> <br><br>  Unlike traditional start-ups on angelic initial financing, which will have to be sold entirely or hold an IPO in the distant future, having already gained the required potential, crete-currency projects begin to offer their ‚Äúaction‚Äù coins to the general public from their very birth (when they have little to offer except promises).  Such uncertainty provokes the appearance of numerous scammers, ‚Äúblack PR‚Äù masters, speculators, etc., who crank up their ‚Äúpamp-dump‚Äù schemes.  Often this happens independently and even against the wishes of the developers themselves.  As a result, the altcoin market is characterized by high volatility, which is primarily caused by the actions of a fairly limited circle of traders and short-term speculators. <br><br>  In the case of a successful start, as the project matures, some of the risks and uncertainty disappear, the real potential of the team becomes visible - the prospects become clear ... As a result, the project begins to include more conservative investors tuned to long-term prospects, who bring not only money but often more and additional competences in the field of management, integration, promotion, and more. <br><br>  Initial investors, who decided not to sell their DASH (not to leave the project, fixing the profit received from the growth rate), gradually begin to realize that further successful development of the project can bring them more than any other of their activities - as a result, many of them start this or otherwise help the project on an ongoing basis.  High expectations justify the continuation of the growth of prices and further investment in the project not only their money, but also time and abilities. <br><br>  Cryptocurrency projects compare favorably with other startups in that the technology behind them is uniquely nominated in the corresponding digital currency.  Since the issue of Dash is limited and its schedule is tightly predetermined - we can consider DASH coins as actual ‚Äúproject shares‚Äù that carry the corresponding share of its total value.  What is important - this excludes any abuses typical of ordinary joint-stock companies - dilution of the share of the initial investors in subsequent investment rounds, violation of the rights of minority shareholders, misuse of investments, etc. <br><br>  In addition, the mechanism for encouraging Masternode operators allows large and medium-sized investors to maintain constant the size of their share in the project, preventing the inflation from blurring the share, as in Bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies. <br><br>  <b>STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF DASH</b> <br><br>  Let's return to the question of the quality of project management and to our specific example - Dash.  Upon closer examination, it is clear that this project compares favorably with other cryptocurrencies.  For many key points, it is unique.  I'm not talking about its unique technical advantages, but about the uniqueness of Dash in terms of strategy and management. <br><br>  The first significant difference is publicity.  Dash has a real active creator who has publicly revealed his identity.  Many other team members also published their real names, photos, etc.  This phenomenon, which is rare for the world of cryptocurrency, allows us to conclude that once developers have put their personal reups at stake, connecting the fate of the project with their personal destiny, this means that they are as serious as possible.  They will not abandon the project halfway and are determined to show maximum competence and perseverance in the face of difficulties that any startup will inevitably face sooner or later (most startups die at this very moment).  This kind of openness and dedication cause well-deserved respect and trust from both investors and the community who have decided to support this project. <br><br>  The second important advantage is a balanced team.  It is not only about its size and focus on results (many members have gone full-time in the project, etc.), but also in its balance and healthy team environment.  The team structure of many other cryptocurrencies demonstrates painful distortions: only programmers work or, on the contrary, only PR managers and advertisers.  Sometimes there are cases that the team is generally focused purely on theoretical scientific developments.  On this motley background, the Dash team is represented by professionals of the widest profile in optimal proportions, which makes it possible to cover the entire spectrum of urgent tasks and achieve excellent results. <br><br>  The third unique advantage is the decentralization of management decisions.  Dash becomes the first cryptocurrency implementing an independent decentralized ‚Äúshareholder voting‚Äù mechanism.  Medium and large investors (in most cases being simultaneously masterno operators) get the opportunity to participate proportionally in the polls on all important issues related to the further development of the Dash project.  In addition, they can decide where (to which specific special projects) a part of the new emitted coins will be sent.  This contrasts sharply with the flawed concept of Bitcoin and other PoW altcoins, where all new coins go exclusively to miners who support the current work of the network but are not interested in the further development of projects. <br><br>  Thus, Dash successfully implements decentralization not only in its functioning, but also the first to introduce decentralized management and financing of its further development.  Decentralization of this kind is the basis for the further growth of the effectiveness of decisions made and inspires confidence among serious investors who do not want to be held hostage to circumstances, but wish to be able to take a direct part in the most effective management of the Project to which they have entrusted their investments. <br><br>  <b>SUCCESSFUL START AND MOVEMENT FORWARD</b> <br><br>  Dash spent his first year quite effectively, not only in technology (many unique things were successfully introduced that were not planned and not announced initially), but also in terms of the evolution of strategic management.  By launching a project in the form of a modest niche-based criterion focused on anonymity, the Dash team fully demonstrated its potential.  All the set initial goals were successfully implemented (along the way, the developers made a number of inventions claimed by the entire cryptocurrency community). <br><br>  But besides genius and high performance, a third important component of long-term success is needed - healthy ambition, which will not allow you to rest on your laurels and lock yourself in a narrow comfortable niche, but will make you constantly move forward, setting new goals.  Few people possess such qualities, but without them it is impossible to achieve anything truly great. <br><br>  And now we can confidently ascertain - the Dash team has the proper ambition!  In 2015, Dash realized the full-fledged competitor of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency ‚Ññ1.  To implement the new large-scale plans will require a number of important efforts not only to the members of the development team, but also to the entire Dash community.  And people have expressed their willingness to support the project ideologically and informationally, because the first place today is the need to promote and adapt technologies for ordinary users. <br><br>  Rebranding allowed to change the ‚Äúdark‚Äù name Darkcoin to a neutral Dash, which opens before it many doors that were closed earlier.  Now Dash allows you to position yourself selectively and effectively for completely different groups of users and their different needs, if necessary, adapting the overall marketing strategy for specific situations and user preferences. <br><br>  Focusing on the fulfillment of its main purpose: ‚ÄúTo give people the perfect money that everyone will want to use‚Äù - Dash does not limit himself to the original concept, but in the process of development he constantly finds more and more new opportunities to implement this idea.  It is important to note that the probability of success of Dash directly depends not only on the introduction of advanced software solutions and technologies, but also on new approaches to marketing and project promotion. <br><br>  Dash needs new markets and new types of users that existing rivals cannot satisfy either now or for several reasons will not be able to adapt to them in the future.  First of all it is: <br><ul><li>  Cash (due to their low mobility, inability to use in electronic payment systems, etc.) </li><li>  Bitcoin (due to unprotected privacy, the inability to quickly evolve in the interests of users, etc.) </li><li>  Centralized payment systems (for a very large number of reasons). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>2 SIMPLE CONCLUSIONS</b> <br><br>  If you are a good programmer, but not a super-genius and not a leader, able to continually inspire a team of multi-talented professionals - do not try to pull your own project.  It will be much more efficient for you to choose a working project and invest your skills in its success.  For example, the Dash Project looks promising - it not only has great development potential, but also offers the widest possible opportunities and the freedom of your participation in it.  For example, recently launched a program to support talented developers.  You can work anywhere and in a convenient mode for you, while maintaining complete freedom.  In the team of the best professionals you will take part in the creation and debugging of a truly unique software product - Dash. <br><br>  If you are not a programmer, but have any other abilities - you can also become a full participant in the project and its ‚Äúshareholder‚Äù.  The decentralized and open nature of the ‚ÄúDash startup‚Äù allows everyone to realize their abilities in one way or another, benefiting Dash in a convenient form for them at a convenient time.  Increasing the value, attractiveness and corresponding cost of the Dash project as a whole, each project participant increases the value of their investments in it.  And besides, in the company of excellent people you can take a real part in creating and promoting a unique financial instrument.  Everyone can do something really important in life - at least a little, but to change this world from the best. <br><br>  <b>CONCLUSION</b> <br><br>  When it comes to high risks of investing in start-ups and the corresponding large potential for increasing the value of cryptocurrencies, some critics are beginning to talk about high volatility, lack of intrinsic value, similarity with financial pyramids, etc.  In this regard, I would like to point out the fact that the current value of established and developing start-ups, such as Google, Facebook, Bitcoin, Dash, etc.  it does not depend on the amount of money spent on their development and not on the intrinsic value of their ‚Äúframework‚Äù.  Their real value is determined mainly by the additional infrastructure and those additional values ‚Äã‚Äã(customer base, monetization paths, additional services, etc.) that stand on the foundation of their software.  That is why the cost of Facebook, Bitcoin, etc.  changed significantly more than the characteristics of their software code. <br><br>  You can bring another household anology.  Today, many can buy an apartment for rent, for example, in New York.  As a result, buyers in a sense become the ‚Äúshareholders‚Äù of this city and receive their share of its potential.  And once it was the same ‚Äústartup‚Äù - the story tells us that Manhattan Island was bought in 1626 for $ 25.  Since then, its intrinsic value (physical, geographical, geometric, geological parameters) has remained unchanged, but its actual value is now determined by completely different parameters. <br><br>  The same happens with cryptocurrencies (one of the brightest representatives of which is Dash).  They provide a kind of "technological basis" - the frame is empty, but very convenient, functional, with the necessary and important characteristics for users.  And then the laws of growth of a snowball begin to work, when layering of new opportunities attracts even more new users and further on increasing.  The current high capitalization of popular cryptocurrencies, with virtually no use at all in the real world, once again shows us how high the stakes and expectations are in this area. <br><br>  Money is perhaps the most powerful power in the world today.  And if we throw aside abstruse academic definitions, then everything that people agreed to consider as money and use as money can act as money.  In other words, anything can work with money when a consensus is reached in a society, during which a corresponding unwritten ‚Äúsocial contract‚Äù is concluded. <br><br>  Already today, Dash offers one of the best (almost certainly the best) technological platform for Alternative Money.  Will most people want to take full advantage of it, filling this so-called ‚Äúempty frame‚Äù with the necessary recognition and liquidity?  Will the result of humanity the opportunity to finally use the full digital money?  Time will tell.  In the meantime, in this cryptocurrency startup (a digital analogy of the "Manhattan Island"), the first travelers tread their first paths.  Ahead, Dash has an interesting future, and each of you can also take part in it. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.dashpay.io/ru/">Welcome to Dash!</a></b> <br><br>  PS The topic of decentralized management of development and financing continued - <a href="https://www.dashpay.io/news/self-sustainable-decentralized-governance-by-blockchain/">www.dashpay.io/news/self-sustainable-decentralized-governance-by-blockchain</a> <br>  Soon, detailed plans for practical implementation should be published. <br><br>  PPS Hooray!
