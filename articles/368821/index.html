  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A piece of history of space exploration is on sale</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On October 26, the Dallas Auction House began <a href="">accepting applications</a> for the acquisition of a memory component of an onboard computer, which was in space and went around Earth orbit on March 23, 1965, along with astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young.  It was the first NASA space mission to launch two astronauts around Earth orbit and the first mission where the on-board computer was claimed.  It was developed by IBM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/cac/0df/2bbcac0df5e6411882c3d58687081c0a.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Matrix of memory. <br><br>  Gusom and John are one of the most famous astronauts of NASA.  Grissom was the second American to go into outer space.  Unfortunately, he died in 1967 during the tests before the launch of the Apollo 1 lunar manned program. Young, in turn, made six more space missions during his 42 years of service at NASA and was the ninth person to set foot on the lunar surface.

This computing device is by no means miniature.  Its weight is 26.7 kilograms, and the memory component, known as the ‚ÄúMemory Matrix‚Äù, is 25.8 centimeters square.  This matrix was able to accommodate only 4096 bits, which is only half a kilobyte.  For comparison: the title picture in the article is ‚Äú795.80 kilobytes‚Äù.  But this computer was created six years before Intel introduced the first microprocessor, capable of performing 7000 computing operations per second.  It was the legendary Intel 4004. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e1/c01/147/1e1c011476dd4e8d971de609d1105786.jpg"><br>  Computer installed in the space capsule. <br><br>  In the words of Paul Serazzi (Paul Ceruzzi), who oversees the electronic-computing collection at the National Aviation and Cosmonautics Museum of the Smithsonian Institution: <blockquote>  This almost five-hour flight with a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù assistant on board prepared the ground for the Apollo mission, which was successfully carried out on July 20, 1969 by the landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the Moon. </blockquote><br>  According to NASA‚Äôs ‚Äú <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Part1.html">Space Flight Computers</a> ‚Äù report, the earlier missions of Mercury did not need their own computers.  Calculations for the return of space capsules were carried out in computer centers on Earth. <br><br>  During the flight, Gemini 3 was another stage that few people know.  According to <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-032315a-gemini3-corned-beef-sandwich.html">collectspace.com</a> , the first space smuggling was on board: a corned beef sandwich from Wolfie's Restaurant and Sandwich Shop, located in the Ramada Inn (a hotel in Coco Beach, Florida).  Young took a sandwich from his suit pocket and filled the capsule with crumbs.  At this point, NASA was not amused. <br><br>  The memory matrix put up for auction consists of tiny magnetic rings with tiny wires interwoven. <br><blockquote>  These little rings are responsible for their entry into the space age. </blockquote>  This opinion was expressed by historian Michael Riley. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46e/ed0/8ef/46eed08ef5a344f59c548e312bfc5733.jpg"><br>  Size of magnetic rings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4f/149/967/d4f14996776a47d1bef0324c97a4842e.jpg"><br>  It looks like weaving in the matrix of memory. <br><br>  The initial bet on the memory matrix was set at $ 1,200. Online offers will be accepted until November 5th.  A live auction will be held on November 6th and will include the ability to place a bid online. <br><br>  The current bid for the lot is $ 1,300. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368821/</a></p>
