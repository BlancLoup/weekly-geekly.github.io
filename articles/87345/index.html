In the yard of 2010, and Corbin, now Beeline, never ceases to please. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, after about half a year, it began to seem that Corbina‚Äôs servers also have monthly periods.  With enviable consistency, the Internet does not work once a month.  What is most interesting with the arrival of Beeline, absolutely nothing has changed. <br>  Secondly, when you call those.  support, for some reason, you have to repeat your problem to each new operator from time to time.  Given that the waiting time takes an average of 30 minutes between each of them.  As a result, once a month, just to find out what happened to them there, I listen to their answering machine for hours, I repeat the story 10 times that the Internet is not the Internet ... And then I find out the terms of solving the problem ... Usually they say that in 2 4 hours will be fixed, but in fact it‚Äôs 2-4 days at least. <br><br>  But all this was before Beeline.  And then I started living on the bright side.  I felt all its charms already at the merger of these two campaigns.

    <h4>  History times </h4><br><br>  Someone decided to steal the equipment of Corbina from the roof of our house ... In the first week of the absence of the Internet, Corbin was looking for the reason why nothing works.  In the second week, they were looking for a thief.  In the third week they bought new equipment.  And even wanted to put it and adjust, but!  But they unite with Beeline, unite their accounts ... And as I was told at that moment in those.  support, they cannot install equipment, because  no lock on the box.  And they can not buy a lock, because  accounts are combined with Beeline.  As a result, after a month or so, they were able to return everything to their places. <br><br>  At the same time, I imagined how poor they were, for the sake of buying a barn lock, transferring millions from their account to the lock shop.  After all, just send the equipment to the store with the money behind the lock and the sales receipt, such a mega-corporation is not under force.  I also worried about employees who, due to frozen accounts, probably did not receive their salary for the whole month ... <br><br><h4>  Story two </h4><br><br>  February 9, as expected by the plans (after a month, as there were no problems), the computer proudly reported that I did not have a power cord connected.  After an hour of communication with those.  support (30 minutes of waiting, 30 minutes of searching for problems), they recognized that the patchchord was torn and assigned me a technician for ... February 19th.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwaiting for almost two weeks to simply replace the pachcord did not please me, but I had to wait ... I don‚Äôt know one or two vehicles for the whole city, and no one could answer this question for me in Beeline. <br><br>  On February 10, I decided to walk to their office, for the first time in all this time.  Had to walk during working hours, because  everyone who is in charge of something for them works exactly at the same time as me.  I was not allowed to assign a technician early, citing the fact that I had to make such a request yesterday to their office, and not by calling the hotline.  It was at 10 o'clock in the evening ... I filed a claim in the name of the general director, I thought suddenly hurry ... <br><br>  February 19, the technician did not come ... I called at 5 pm on the hotline to inquire about his fate, to which I was told to wait until 7, he must be late.  At 7 of course, no one came.  I call again ... The girl politely explains that at 6 everyone responsible for the technicians ran home for the holidays ... Call on weekdays ... In 4 hours of conversations I could not figure out why I waited until seven, where the technician used to hang out, and how do they work ... <br><br>  On February 24, I went to the office again, wrote a complaint again ... This time they promised me that a technician would come to me on the same day, they would call me up to 12 o'clock and agree with me at a convenient time for me to come to repair. <br><br>  12:00  A Beeline technician calls me for work, says we are at your house (my mother turned out well, otherwise they would have stood at the door) and asked if the Internet was working.  To my answer, that I was kind of at work, and the computer was at home and what you were doing there, when you had to call me first, the technician said, okay, and hung up.  After 10 minutes, he calls me again and asks what is my specific problem with the Internet.  This is how slowly it turned out that they came there, I don‚Äôt know where to do it, I don‚Äôt know what ... After another 20 minutes, they called me back and said that everything works.  When I asked them how they checked everything without me, they said that once they said that it works, it means it works. <br><br>  These are the brave things they have technology.  When it is necessary to come - do not come; when it is not necessary to come - come.  What is the most offensive, the provider can not be changed, because  they are like mafia clans divided areas among themselves.  As a result, you need to move to change the provider. <br><br>  So far, everything works, but in the area on March 24, I am again waiting for planned problems. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87345/</a></p>
