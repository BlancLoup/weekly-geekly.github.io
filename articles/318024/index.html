In this post I would like to go through the statistics of their records for the year. <br>  The fact is that I, as a UX / UI designer, suddenly started writing on Habr!  It just so happens, sir.  It was almost exactly a year ago.  Record that sternly merged - the first pancake is lumpy.  However, someone found a share of valuable in it and gave me Read / Write mode.  Thank you, by the way, kind man.  If you see this post, please nod gently. <br><br>  It is not news that another busy year is nearing the end and it is time to sum up.  I honestly never did that.  And did not understand those who do.  A year is just a unit of past events.  Tomorrow life will continue, it will not start from scratch. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I received my invite to Habr a year ago <b>on December 14th</b> .  I think that for the past habrogod, which was my first, it is much more interesting to draw a line than to philosophize globally about the lived year of life.  So, I wrote <b>20 posts</b> for this period.  Welcome under the cat, if you are interested to know my story about how in a year I managed to attract customers from my readers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/fb4/a0f/d1ffb4a0fc1b49abae5c793087f5a4a0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <b>By the way, if you use Figma</b> , I recommend paying attention to our <b><a href="https://setproduct.com/">ready-made design systems</a></b> .  They help freelancers complete more orders per month, programmers can create beautiful applications on their own, and the Timlids run sprints faster using ready-made design systems for teamwork.

      And if you have a serious project, our team is ready to deploy a design system within the organization based on our developments and tailor it to specific tasks using Figma.  Web / desktop, and any mobile.  We are also familiar with React / React Native.  Write to T: <a href="https://t.me/Kamushken">@kamushken</a> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  I guess I'm here because you never need to stop in your professional development.  Heck!  I would never have thought that I would say this :) Actually, a year ago, projects were sluggish, prospects were foggy, and the brain needed a shake-up.  Especially when you consider that I have been in the design for at least 15 years, and there was a feeling that I could formulate my experience and put it in text. <br><br>  The second reason, frankly, the psychological language is ‚Äúthirst for vocation‚Äù.  Do not get literally.  For me it was the need to get approval made.  When an interface designer creates projects for a long time, offers not the worst solutions, and projects do not reach beta - he gets bored and he is overwhelmed with doubts.  Or projects reach beta, feedbacks are good, and money runs out.  And this was also in my practice. <br><br>  But to understand the many reasons why I write on Habr, I came gradually over the course of a year.  I realized the need for a ‚Äúvocation‚Äù after a few months when I tried to describe one ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù product.  It turned out that I was able to popularly explain what and how I did in the interface.  And it turned out to be interesting.  This project was old, unfortunately, it was paused, and it was not covered by NDA.  Can be taken as a basis. <br><br>  In general, I started blogging.  Although I do not like this word.  I will stealthily assume that I am an imaginary engineer in a white robe who meticulously writes something about his research.  Of course, in the first series of my posts I have not been to them yet.  Later, I began to listen to the statistics of posts and the reaction of the audience.  As a result, I tried to adjust the language of presentation and the topic of posts, in order to understand what ‚Äúcomes in‚Äù better.  Shoot could anything.  Never guess.  I tried different approaches to the presentation, in which I sometimes used a bit of marketing and a couple of tricks.  This added to my confidence that I still sometimes had that imaginary research engineer in a white coat in the user experience research lab. <br><br>  My plan worked and in the second half of the year I had new clients, various projects and interesting tasks.  People willingly accepted the cost for my services, and I was inspired by the whole of August.  I still remember how I simultaneously conducted three projects.  The working day could easily be delayed until 12 o'clock.  But it only inspired me!  Have I really begun to reap the fruits of my intellectual work?  Could I thus convert my articles into a stable income?  I think the answers to these questions will come to me gradually. <br><br>  It seems that this scheme really works: you can start sharing knowledge for free and something good will happen.  I still secretly expect some pleasant surprise, which will turn out.  No, they won't call me to google.  Let it be some interesting project and interesting conditions. <br>  And for that I will be grateful to myself and Habra. <br><br><h2>  Story </h2><br>  Let's move from facts to numbers.  It is especially interesting to do this, thanks to the statistics, which became available in this outgoing year.  For me it was a wow feature!  <i>Give your customers more tools to improve their activities on your resource - this will improve the quality and position of the resource as a whole</i> .  Absolutely effective way to develop a product.  In short, cool move, Habr. <br><br>  So, for the period from the <u>14th-December-2015</u> to the <s>14th-December-2016.</s> <u>On the 20th-December-2016,</u> I wrote <b>20 articles</b> .  This one doesn't count.  They were watched by <b>274669 people</b> , of whom <b>2080 people</b> added material <b>to favorites</b> .  Further, it is not the most obvious indicator of quality, but nevertheless: they gave a total of <b>+306 karma points</b> (negative posts were taken into account). <br><br><h3>  It turns out that on average: </h3><br>  <u>Each article received:</u> <br><br>  <b>~ 13733</b> views <br>  <b>~ 104</b> favorites <br>  <b>~ 15</b> rating points <br><br>  I believe that the rating is not an ideal indicator of the quality of writing posts.  There are too many factors: both competition and the possibility of minus without looking at the post, and the factor of privilege (only invited people can change karma, registration is not enough, which means the majority opinion is ignored). <br><br>  If you just start with the popularity of the number of views, the top three posts will be: <br><br>  <b>73086</b> - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277399/">My rules for a good interface design</a> <br>  <b>19289</b> - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/304766/">Projecting Google Material Design onto the desktop system ... (part two)</a> <br>  <b>18871</b> - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/307674/">New user of your product - how to help him?</a> <br><br>  <i>Not very representative, since</i>  <i>a different post will subsequently receive a different number of search traffic.</i>  <i>In addition, you never know which record will be in the top, if at all.</i> <br><br>  Suppose I want to determine the top 3 of my best articles <b>only by rating</b> , then the list will be as follows: <br><br>  <b>+64</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/311426/">A series of interface (un) updates - "Habrahabr joins darkside"</a> <br>  <b>+51</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277399/">My rules for good interface design</a> <br>  <b>30</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/313096/">Okay, Google, how about optimizing the interface for working with a smartphone with one hand?</a> <br><br>  <i>Again, this is not an ideal indicator, because it takes into account the opinion of only an advanced audience, which is smaller than readers in general.</i>  <i>If an article is liked by an amateur, then he will not be able to raise the rating, since</i>  <i>his opinion is not considered authoritative.</i>  <i>These are the rules.</i> <br><br>  Well, as without the "dry" add to favorites.  Sorting by the greatest number of bookmarks shows the following list: <br><br>  <b>651 bookmarks</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277399/">My rules for good interface design</a> <br>  <b>252 bookmarks We</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308684/">optimize our labor costs when developing an application in Google Material Design</a> <br>  <b>133 bookmarks</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/307674/">New user of your product - how to help him?</a> <br><br>  <i>I completely agree with this indicator, but in this case the votes of the ‚Äúold-timer‚Äù and ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù are not taken into account.</i>  <i>We need some golden mean.</i> <br><br>  If you calculate the ratio of <b>views / favorites</b> , it will show the articles that were most actively <u>bookmarked</u> .  This is some intermediate quality indicator: <br><br>  <b>1/69</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308684/">Optimizing our labor costs when developing an application in Google Material Design</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/305660/">1/108 Projecting Google Material Design onto the desktop system ... (part four and final)</a> <br>  <b>1/112</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277399/">My rules for good interface design</a> <br><br>  <i>1/69 means that every 69th person who reads the selected article.</i>  <i>It turns out that the smaller the ratio, the better.</i> <br><br>  Perhaps a compromise would now be to find the ratio of <b>views / favorites to the rating of</b> each post, in order to get an average indicator of interestingness between regular users and those who are invited and are in Read / Write mode. <br>  Thus, I summarize my <b><u>top 3 best posts for the year</u></b> according to both sides: <br><br>  <b><u>1st place</u></b> (2.201 points) <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277399/"><b>My design rules for a good interface</b> .</a> <br>  I consider my achievement of the year.  An article in which I gathered and described my methods of work for a while became a hit.  So most readers agree with this.  Isn't this a confirmation that I'm doing everything right? <br><br>  <b><u>2 place</u></b> (4.905 points) We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308684/"><b>optimize our labor costs while developing an application in Google Material Design</b></a> <br>  Just a collection of design resources for interface design for Android.  In the appendage is a small training manual.  This is always in demand, because it is required for practice, and is well issued in search engines. <br><br>  <b><u>3rd place</u></b> (5.04 points) <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/311426/"><b>A series of interface (un) updates - ‚ÄúHabrahabr joins darkside‚Äù</b></a> . <br>  Sudden curious experiment.  It turns out habrovchanam generally liked the idea with a black color gamut of the resource.  But there was no response ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù and the motivation was over.  Sorry who waited for the styles.  But healthy enthusiasm, it turns out, has its limits ... <br><br>  <i>Such is the digest of the most popular records in several ways.</i> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Thanks to everyone who appreciated my work.  Yes, with a capital letter.  I like to write on Habr, but this is still a work inherently.  Thanks to those who put the minuses.  You made me think how to write more interesting.  It is difficult to draw conclusions about oneself in order to preserve modesty.  I am sure that I am doing everything right.  The most important thing is that this year blogging gave me a sense of self in a professional field.  I understood where I am.  I understood where I should go and how I could come to this.  Therefore, I plan to continue in the same spirit and come what may.  I hope that in the near future I will be able to describe real cases and show working products.  Here everything is only in the hands of developers ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318024/</a></p>
