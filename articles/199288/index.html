  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recovery of the TeXeT TM-9750HD tablet from a state of a full brick</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br>  I want to tell you about the restoration of the TeXeT TM-9750HD tablet as a full brick from the state of Teclast P98HD.  I bought it for 7590 rubles in Chelyabinsk, a tablet with a Retina screen and an RK3188 processor for that price immediately attracted me.  For a couple of days, I honestly sat on the stock firmware from the texet, but although AnTuTu showed 18,500 thousand parrots on it, the interface brakes and the lack of some things needed by the developer were forced to look at custom firmware. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a brief search, 2 candidates were found.  One from the site w3bsit3-dns.com, on Android 4.2.2, by the way, I was even happy to call it good firmware, the other on Android 4.1 from rockchipfirmware and it was a fatal mistake, let's call it bad firmware.  First, with the help of RKBatchTool, I rolled up a good firmware, and I had to calm down, but there is no limit to perfection.  The fact is that in a good firmware there were several droplets and one big spoonful of tar.  He 1, 2 times a day rebooted at the most inopportune moment for no reason, it terribly enraged me.  Then I decided to try a bad firmware.  RKBatchTool wanted to warn me that it was a bad idea to persistently give an error, but I did not give up, then using rkflashtool and Ubuntu forcibly flashed the images of kernel.img, misc.img, recovery.img, boot.img, system.img, parameter on the offsets written to file parameter.  After the reboot, the tablet stopped serving any signs of life.  It was not included, and was not detected by USB in any operating system.  I did not enter either the recovery mode or the bootloader.  After sitting a week without a tablet.  I realized that I need to fix it and started looking for information on its recovery from hard-bricks.  After two days of searching, the MaskROM keyword was found - this is the mode in which the processor enters when it does not find flash memory chips, and since flash memory is not needed to go into this mode, in fact, you can do anything with a tablet.  From the freaktab site from Finless Bob user, familiar to many of the firmware for dongles on RockChip processors, I found instructions on how to restore the MK808 dongle by locking legs 8 and 9 to enter from MaskROM.  There was nothing left to do and had to open the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/2b0/6d6/07b2b06d67684edf8b0bfd0ebb789195.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a little radio amateur I know that to close just any contact is not worth it.  Therefore, I decided to first find out about the flash memory that was installed in my tablet.  I had a Micron 29F64G08CBABA.  Most importantly, I learned that in my case I had to close the contacts 29 and 30.

Armed with an eye scalpel that was purchased specifically for the analysis of the tablet, I proceeded with the operation.  Found instructions said that you need: <br>  1 - close the flash-memory chip leads with a sharp object <br>  2 - connect the tablet to a computer via USB <br>  3 - and turn on the tablet <br>  4 - open the pins of the microcircuit when the tablet appears in the list of Windows devices. <br><br>  Having done as it was written in this manual, I did it.  The tablet appeared in the list of devices but why it disappeared immediately.  Half a day with a scalpel in these chips.  As a result, I found out that the power button on my tablet needs to be kept constantly pressed only then it will not disappear.  Having prepared, I launched RKBatchTool and rolled up a winning good firmware.  At the end, RKBatchTool reported success.  The tablet rebooted and boot animation appeared.  Emotions knew no bounds.  Now the tablet is in good health, just so it continues to reboot for no reason.  Company developers are in no hurry to release updates. <br><br>  The article is written for enthusiasts the same as I, for broken tablets I am not responsible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199288/</a></p>
