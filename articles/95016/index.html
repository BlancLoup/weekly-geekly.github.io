  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nanotechnology, for example</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I, as the head of the youth department of the Nanotechnology Society of Russia, have some access to the products of these same nanotechnologies.  Therefore, I will try, if it seems necessary, to describe these products here, for the intellectual public to understand that these notorious technologies still exist, but everything is so fragmented that everyone hears only about nano-socks. <br><br>  By the way, the first number will be socks. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Official version</b> <br>  It has long been no secret that after a few days of wearing, sock textiles become a kind of ‚Äúdepot‚Äù of microorganisms, bacteria, fungal spores, and a complex of physical activity with simultaneous heat and moisture (foot sweat) creates a favorable environment for the growth and reproduction of harmful microorganisms. <br>  One of the products of the project - men's cotton socks modified with silver particles - is indisputable and the fact that cotton fibers do not provoke allergic reactions in humans, and the active silver introduced into the structure of cotton fibers gives it antimicrobial properties.  Of particular importance are such socks for athletes and the military, for people whose profession is associated with large and / or prolonged physical exertion, which is of great importance for patients with diabetes.  The delayed effect of wearing such socks was an increase in the life of the shoe.  Of course, socks, like shoes, should be chosen based on the conditions in which they will be used. <br>  Currently, according to the developed technology, the company MER, commissioned by Edelhaus LLC, launched production of nano-modified men's cotton socks, which received positive conclusions from the independent expert company Mosexpertiza and the Federal Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation .  The presence of nano-sized silver in the products is confirmed by the result of an analysis made at NPO Typhoon and a patent for a method for producing nanostructured metal particles.  In the period from February 15, 2008 to May 15, 2008, an experimental sock was carried out in the units of the EMERCOM of Russia, which resulted in a positive conclusion.

      <b>My version</b> <br>  Like a real research physicist, I gave them a light test.  Wore a couple of days - do not stink, do not glaze, do not turn into a poker.  Feet good, comfortable.  After washing the quality is not lost. <br>  The cost of socks from 45 to 180 rubles.  Honestly, I did not notice a big difference from expensive high-quality socks, but only the price is pleasantly surprising. <br><br>  The next, more interesting post will be devoted to nano-editors - school stations for laboratory work on nanotechnology. <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> Limited Liability Company "Edelhaus" <br>  115035, Moscow, 3rd Kadashevsky Lane, 6, bld. 2 <br>  tel./fax 951-10-20, 951-15-83 <br><br>  <b>UPD2: The</b> Nanotechnology Society of Russia, like any other society, unites people of interest. <br>  The youth department unites youth and all sympathizers.  Our goals are to help young people involved in a nanotechnological project, to hold contests, to get money for trips to various events, to hold their events, to conduct educational activities. <br>  Now we are working closely in schools so that high school students understand what these nanotechnologies are, why they are needed, what profit they have, etc. <br>  We try to socialize nanotechnology, in general. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95016/</a></p>
