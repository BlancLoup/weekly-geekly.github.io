And just a convenient alarm clock for Android.  After a long search on the Market, I still could not find an alarm clock, which I would like to use.  Therefore, in this article I will design an alarm clock the way I myself would like to see it. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that this is an alarm clock for those who need an alarm clock that wakes them in the morning, and not a timer for cooking eggs or a crutch replacement for reminders in the calendar. <br><br>  Before I talk about what is in this alarm clock, I will start with what is not in it.  Firstly, there is no possibility of setting several alarms, since in most cases they are used only to set 3 alarms in a row for the purpose of not sleeping.  This does not work and should be solved by other means. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, there is no pseudo-analysis of the stages of sleep in it, since so far I have not found confirmation that at least one of these applications works.  And certainly they do not work if you are not sleeping in bed alone. <br><br>  And thirdly, there are no mathematical examples to turn off the call.  So for lovers of mathematics, it is not suitable. <br><br>  <i>Disclaimer</i>  It is possible that you already have an alarm clock that suits you completely.  Well, then this article is unlikely to be of interest to you.  And for the rest, I'll talk about designing an alarm clock. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Before you go directly to the interface, a couple of words about appearance.  Most of the alarms from Market, tested by me, had a dark design on a black or so background.  This is no accident, because at night you do not want to dazzle your eyes with a bright display.  But before going to bed, setting the alarm clock, I want to see something colorful, and not dark depressive.  Therefore, I decided to combine the ‚Äúwarm tube‚Äù design with the night mode, which automatically turns on at night.  If someone wants only a dark alarm clock, then the theme "Carbon" is provided: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4bbafb0/de314b79/b391dae3/b4a4073c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Scenarios </h4><br>  Now let's go through the scenarios, in parallel implementing them in the interface.  Alarm usage scenarios are divided into 3 main groups: scenarios for setting the alarm time, using it at night, and turning it off in the morning. <br><br><h5>  Set the alarm time </h5><br>  In the most common scenario, the user sets an alarm for a specific time.  This script is implemented in almost any alarm clock.  But there is a second scenario in which the user is not tied to a specific schedule and wants, for example, to sleep 8 hours.  In the case of ordinary alarms, such a user will have to calculate the time of installation in the mind or use a timer (which is easy to turn off, so he cannot be considered an alarm clock).  In my alarm clock, you can use both scenarios.  The type of installation changes by flipping the screen, and both screens are interconnected, and by changing the time on one of them, changes automatically occur on the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5e3dbdaf/1eb5a408/34a4e12e/16195e7f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Use at night </h5><br>  The first thing you want from the alarm when you wake up at night is to find out what time it is now and most importantly how much you can sleep.  :) To answer both questions, the alarm clock has a night mode that automatically turns on when you put the phone on its side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/59cb0c44/8cfa6583/3274f0c0/eeec459d.jpg"><br><br>  The color of the inscription changes with time, and when it gets closer to the morning it turns red.  When you sleep less than an hour, the inscription turns red. <br><br>  The night-time mode turns off after 30 seconds if the phone is not plugged in (so as not to put the battery in overnight) and turns back on if you hold the phone in your hand.  When you turn the phone upright, the main screen is displayed again. <br><br>  Sometimes you also want to write down a dream that you just had in order not to forget it.  Or use a flashlight to walk in the dark to the fridge.  You do not want to go to the main menu of the phone, so as not to blind the eyes with a bright display.  Therefore, these functions are placed on the main screen of the alarm clock and can be used immediately, as at night I took the phone in my hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f8582d9b/b4f22865/b3584e3d/d357dd2f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Awakening and disabling </h5><br>  In the first scenario, turning off the alarm, the user disables the first few warning calls to rest for another 15 minutes, but must definitely get up at the designated time. <br><br>  In order to make the wake-up in the morning less sadistic (if it is even possible), the alarm starts to wake the user 20 minutes before the appointed time (you can change it in the settings).  Moreover, he makes the first timid attempts with no sound signals, I light with the help of a display and a built-in flash.  This may work if the person is dormant or is in the stage of sleep in which it is easiest to wake up. <br><br>  If this does not work, the alarm starts to add beeps.  It starts with the most quiet and barely noticeable, and comes to quite invigorating. <br><br>  If the user is awake and wants to sleep for a couple of minutes, he just needs to take the alarm in his hand and shake it vigorously.  After which the alarm will give a delay for a few minutes.  But this will only work until the time has come for the alarm to be set.  To turn off the alarm after the appointed time, you need to pass a small maze with your finger: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b4ba6478/f6398692/5ae3ebee/1db6c1ea.jpg"><br><br>  This task is difficult enough to solve it in an unconscious state, and, at the same time, it is elementary and quickly solved when it wakes up.  At the same time, when the user takes the phone in his hand, the sound of the alarm becomes barely audible so that you can safely turn off the alarm.  But if after 10 seconds the labyrinth is not passed - the call will continue to ring again with the same force (otherwise you can take the phone in your hand and continue to sleep). <br><br>  There is also a second awakening scenario.  In it, the user himself woke up before the alarm and now does not want to wake others.  In this scenario, the user needs to turn off the alarm before it rings, but you cannot do it with one button (at the university I learned to turn on 5 minutes before the first alarm and neutralize it and the next 3, then go off again without waking up) .  Therefore, on the main screen of the alarm clock there is a ‚ÄúShut down‚Äù button, when clicked, you will again need to go through a maze like on the previous screen. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion: Developers - Wellcome! </h4><br>  In this alarm clock I collected everything that I was waiting for from the alarm clock of my dreams and tried not to leave anything extra in it.  In my opinion, it turned out cool. <br><br>  The problem is that I can create a design, but I can not write an application for Android or iPhone.  So if you know how to write good applications for iPhone or Android, and this alarm clock seems to you promising - write in a personal.  Let's fill the Market with beautiful and convenient applications together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132401/</a></p>
