Until today, we all, unfortunately, were only able to theoretically evaluate all the positive aspects of the office 2.0. Our team made every effort to change this situation.  So, get acquainted: "Vulik" is the first co-working center in the CIS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://co-working.org.ua/tmp/IMG_2711.jpg" alt=" -  -  " title="Vulyk - the first coworking center in the CIS" align="right">  We very carefully approached the choice of place, taking into account the numerous wishes of freelancers, current trends and prospects.  "Vulyk" is located 5 minutes from the central bus station, 2 minutes walk from the future metro station, directly opposite the Goloseevskaya park area.  The presence of a developed infrastructure makes it possible, if necessary, to completely eliminate tiresome trips, as there are a lot of cafes in the park area (discounts are expected for the summer season), the Mir Hotel, the Velikka Kyshenya supermarket, a gym, a hairdressing salon, a medical center.

The windows of the main hall overlook a cozy, quiet, well-kept courtyard, on the territory of which a ping-pong table will be installed, and the presence of an external Wi-Fi access point will allow you to work in the open air in warm weather. <br><br><img src="http://co-working.org.ua/tmp/IMG_2715.jpg" alt=" -  -  " title="Vulyk - the first coworking center in the CIS" align="right">  Working conditions in the office are also thought out to the smallest detail and meet all the requirements of a modern person.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 sq.m.  2 working rooms, a kitchen corner, a meeting room, a recreation room and a smoking balcony were comfortably accommodated.  The office is furnished with premium furniture and business class. <br>  The main work room (resident room) can accommodate up to 12 people at a time and assumes the presence of two types of places: <br>  - 3 individual tables that will be assigned to certain people. <br>  - 9 premium seats (table for three), which can also be optionally assigned to certain members of the club. <br>  In the second room there is a large conference table, which can accommodate up to 10 people. <br>  In addition, there are 10 subscriptions without a fixed place (for those who do not need a long time in the co-working center) with the opportunity to be located on sofas, balconies, behind the bar and in the meeting room. <br>  The working rooms are equipped with all the necessary equipment for comfortable work: printers, copiers, scanners, marker and cork boards.  There is an opportunity to receive and send faxes.  All jobs are equipped with security locks for laptops.  Also, if necessary, you will be equipped with headphones with a microphone and a wi-fi adapter.  The meeting room is equipped with a projector.
