  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create a QR code for payment in the payment system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, I want to tell you the real life stories.  I hope that many of the readers who have paid utility bills or any receipts at least once will share my modest work with their experiences and, not considering it, will add one to karma, I want to warn the rest of the lucky that this event in your life in front. <br><br>  Receipts for payment of all communal things lurk for the modern man literally at every turn.  Relatively recently, a new service appeared, when you can pay for receipts by its number.  With a sinking heart, I always looked at these volumes of data, because in order for this to work, the authority that issued the receipt must provide this data to the bank or provide an API.  Judging by the latest trends, this technology has been replaced by QR codes, which contain all the necessary information and do not require any preliminary data exchanges from institutions.  So one day you get a receipt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/bl/n8/bhbln88qgnqkkqcvgbdj5ebht64.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And all you need to do is open the Bank application and scan the QR code.  Then the program will fill in all the necessary details for you and you will only need to confirm your intention to make a payment.  Considering that there are quite a lot of receipts, especially in the conditions when public utilities seek to switch to the point-to-point communication mode and each service exposes its own account.  Lawmakers complicate their lives by introducing new standards ‚Äî capital expenditures require a separate bill and the like ‚Äî everything in this world starts to spin around the receipt.  Anticipating such a situation, the relevant organizations are beginning to think about how to earn capital on such services.  And on one of the next wonderful days, a receipt arrives.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/zy/2k/jjzy2k9dmkcdazllkf60dc3dydo.png"><br><br>  Accustomed, as usual, to pay for everything on the last day, Neo suddenly notices that something has changed in the matrix.  Without resorting to bit-wise comparison, we quickly find out that the QR code has disappeared.  Turning to the chairman of the HOA, we get an explanation that the QR code is a paid service, which is estimated at 50 rubles.  Those.  in order for the receipt to be issued with a QR code, you need to pay 50 rubles for each receipt.  The history is silent on the names of real organizations, so please do not test the above code - it is fictional, but let's see what is included in this code.  This standard was developed by the National Payment Council Non-Profit Partnership, introduced by Technical Committee for Standardization TK122 ‚ÄúStandards of Financial Operations‚Äù, APPROVED AND INTRODUCED IN ACTION by the Order of the Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Metrology (I emphasize the word NON-COMMERCIAL organization).  The code includes required and optional parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/d5/qf/nsd5qfu34byjxuoah2pvnup7ygo.png"><br><br>  But if it is easier to write this information in a text form from a receipt, a code converted into a QR code and nothing more.  For example in our case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/jy/fg/qwjyfgiqowbwvzzaty4wmqdteog.png"><br><br>  Taking into account the fact that current accounts do not change often - basically only the amount that can be adjusted in the application changes from month to month, I suggest earning 2400 rubles a year if you pay on average 4 receipts per month as follows: download the demo version of FastReport <a href="https://www.fastreport.ru/ru/download/">www.fastreport .ru / en / download</a> and open the above invoice.frx <a href="https://github.com/ufocombat/invoice-fr">github.com/ufocombat/invoice-fr</a> in the designer, open the report in the FastReport designer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/na/op/scnaopvph5x7kl6ueogp6jcuivu.png"><br><br>  In the text field specify the necessary details and you can scan the barcode from the screen without even printing.  Life hacking and only. <br><br>  I want to note that there are a lot of similar services on the Internet right now, the principle is that you fill out an electronic form and receive a code.  Some payment systems even accept such codes as a file.  The convenience of the proposed method is that you have all the codes at your fingertips and do not take up much space. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450978/</a></p>
