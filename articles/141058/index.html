  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Preparing content for the site - problems and solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As already discussed in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/137943/">previous article, the</a> preparation of content for the future site is equally necessary for both the customer and the performer.  But recognition of this fact alone is not enough to integrate such an approach into your workflow.  The situations in which we find ourselves with our customers are different, and we need to respond to them in different ways too.  We will analyze typical situations and try to give recommendations on the behavior in each particular case. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What to do if: the client is not aware of the importance of preparing the content </h4><br>  Most often, a client taking such a position poorly represents the purpose of the site and is completely unaware of how the development process takes place.  The manager should record on paper the steps of creating the site from the joint definition of goals and objectives to testing and publishing the finished product.  Each described stage should be explained in detail: what is required from whom, preferably within what time frame.  It is necessary to say the purpose and meaning of each step, as well as the consequences if not adhering to the chosen scheme.  For clarity, you can show one or two unfinished sites in order for the customer to see the problem with his own eyes. <br>  If the client is not ready to listen to you, is not ready to agree that the development process developed by years and experience is likely to lead to a successful project, then you should think hard about continuing cooperation.  It is worth remembering the risks that the studio is exposed to, working with this type of clients. <br>  <i><b>Solution:</b> explain the process of work, the appointment of stages of work and the role of each in the process.</i>  <i>If it did not help, assess your risks and think about not cooperating.</i> <br><br><h4>  What to do if: the customer can not collect content </h4><br>  There is no one solution to this problem.  The manager, depending on the situation, should be able to offer one of the following options: <br><br>  <b>The studio can offer to write content for the customer.</b> <br>  With small volumes, the studio can use the services of a freelance copywriter, and in the case of permanent large orders can take a specialist in the state.  Perhaps all the information in this way will not be able to collect, because  it may be too narrowly specialized.  But the main content in this way to get quite real, while even a little money.

      <b>To determine the types and volumes of missing information and reflect them in the TK and / or in the prototype</b> <br>  Each type of section should be coordinated with the customer and presented in the form of content blocks, where each block has its own type of information (photo, video, text, diagram, chart, table, etc.).  This can be done in the most visual way in the prototype, where the customer can see everything with his own eyes.  For each block, it is necessary to determine the volumes, their content, minimum, maximum, optimum and fix it in the statement of work.  For example, when defining a block of images in a product card, you must indicate that there is a main photo and additional images minimum - one maximum - five, but on average three will be used.  Describing, for example, a text section, you must specify the estimated volume of the text, the presence of photographs, tables and diagrams for the section, the intended content. <br>  <i><b>Solution:</b> Write the content or part of the content for the customer and describe in detail the structure of the site in the TOR, it is desirable to prepare prototypes.</i>  <i>If at least one condition is not met, it is worth assessing your risks and thinking about not cooperating.</i> <i><br></i> <br><h4>  What to do if: the client provides poor quality content </h4><br>  To solve this problem it takes not so much.  Professional supervision of all materials received from the customer is required.  It must be carried out constantly in any project.  On the basis of this supervision, it is necessary to point out problems to the client, explaining his decisions.  If difficulties arise in making adjustments, the studio should be able to make them on its own and present it for approval.  Most often, the work will be reduced to creative processing and rewriting, which is not at all scary.  For example, in the case of photographs, the studio may offer to organize a photo session, if possible.  After all, often the customer simply cannot distinguish the good from the bad, and you can give the client a guide and justify his decision. <br>  <i><b>Solution: to</b> conduct constant supervision over the customer‚Äôs materials, to have the opportunity to offer their services in editing materials.</i> <br><br><h4>  What to do if: the client is far behind in terms of providing content </h4><br>  For a studio in this case, it is important to take the right position - the contract must contain the terms on which the studio can actually affect.  Those.  The time for coordination and preparation of content should not be included in the general term of development.  This is very important because  even with the ideal work of the studio, any breakdown by the customer transfers the responsibility to the studio.  To speed up the collection of content, you can make it a rule to contact the client once every 1.5-2 weeks to find out how it is working.  An experienced project manager can give his customer a lot of useful tips in the process of such communication.  After all, most often the problem of disrupting the timing of content preparation is a problem of an organizational nature. <br>  <i><b>Solution:</b> studios need to remove responsibility for those works that it cannot affect.</i>  <i>Periodically to find out from the client what is the state of his affairs, to offer help and advice.</i> <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  There is no single solution, following which you can successfully pass the stage of content preparation.  There are no identical projects and identical starting conditions.  But whatever it is, the studio should strive to reduce uncertainty.  And one of the most important components of success is the work of a manager.  His professionalism, attention to the client, communication skills and experience allow us to create an effective team from the studio and the customer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141058/</a></p>
