This can be confirmed by the statistics of the all-knowing ‚ÄúYandex Wordstat‚Äù: for example, about 14,000 people per month are interested in the question ‚Äú <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.com/">how to earn bitcoins</a> ‚Äù.  We will not argue that the situation is connected with the crisis, but the fact that in difficult economic times people are much more creative in their search for sources of income is a fact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/61b/e72/a3261be7275c4ee4bb93fc810d54a05d.jpg"><br>  <i>"On earnings".</i>  <i>Nikolai Kuznetsov, 1882</i> <br><br>  At the same time, in order to find information on Altcoin earnings that is relevant for 2016, it is necessary to filter out outdated data and resources on the topic ‚Äúearn Bitcoins for free without investing 1 Bitcoin per day‚Äù for a long time.

      We decided to improve the situation and prepared fresh material on work for crypt: where is it better to look for such work, what are the pros, cons and pitfalls in the cryptocurrency salary, what professions are the easiest way to get offers, how to organize the process of converting a crypt into Fiat.  The material is based on real events: in order to prepare it, we talked with hired employees and freelancers who are rewarded for working in Bitcoins and its forks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="170ec7">Pros and cons of working for cryptocurrency</font> </h2><br>  Do I need to get a salary in altcoins?  There is no definite answer, but you can consider the advantages / disadvantages of this option and draw conclusions on your own. <br><br>  The benefits of salary in the crypt: <br><br><ul><li>  You can win on the difference in the course: if you earn altcoins, you do not plan to instantly convert them to fiat currency, and wait for a more favorable exchange rate, you get a nice bonus to salary (in fiat equivalent), the size of which will depend on your trading skills and patience . </li><li>  There are no unnecessary papers, problems and questions: it is very important for freelancers, lovers of poaching and ardent haters of bureaucracy.  No one will ask where the amount equivalent to $ 10,000 came to your bitcoin wallet, and this same wallet will not spit out a message stating that you have exceeded the limits and now you need to pass verification / authentication, send a pack of notarized documents or come to branch of the bank.  True, this is all up to the moment until you want to convert your ‚Äúcoins‚Äù into a cache. </li><li>  The RFP is higher than the market: if an employer can only offer an exotic payment method, feel free to ask for more money, arguing that it is inconvenient.  In addition, payment in Altcoins is often associated with work that requires specific knowledge of these very Altcoins (Bitcoin startups, exchanges, etc.).  Knowledge is scarce and, having them, you can get a salary above the market for your profession. </li><li>  Two in one - earnings and long-term investment: according to some experts, the course of Bitcoin in the coming years can reach $ 10,000, thus, postponing part of the earned bitcoins, you will significantly increase your capital. </li><li>  This is interesting: if you find a job in a crypto startup, you can learn a lot of new things and pump skills in an area previously unknown to you. </li></ul><br>  And now about the disadvantages and disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Losses are possible: the exchange rate of altcoins is difficult to predict, it can both rise and fall, significantly reducing your income.  Predictions about $ 10,000 for 1 btc have not been confirmed, with the same success for several years for 1 Bitcoin on the market can give $ 10. </li><li>  Do you speak English?  If not, then it will be very difficult to find a good job for the crypt, the lion's share of the proposals is located on English-speaking resources and is associated with foreign companies; </li><li>  Monopoly: if you are a fan of lightcoins or Dogecoin, we have bad news.  Employers mainly offer Bitcoin, forked jobs are extremely rare; </li><li>  Entry is only for IT: work for the coin is usually associated with IT projects and offers for specialists from other fields are not often found.  In the top professions: programmers, designers, marketers, arbitrageurs, testers, engineers, admins, copywriters / journalists, content managers, financial analysts. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="170ec7">Where to look for work for cryptocurrency</font> </h2><br>  The resources and methods listed below are selected on the basis of practical experience, the information is relevant at the time of this writing.  We do not pretend to complete the list and we will be very grateful if you complement it and indicate the sites and ways that you use yourself.  And also share your opinion if you have experience using these or other resources. <br><br><h4>  <font color="170ec7">Forums and Boards</font> </h4><br>  In any major cryptocurrency forum, there is a section on work.  There you can dig up an interesting job or freelance project, as well as publish a post in the style of ‚Äúlooking for a job in a bitcoin startup‚Äù.  Among the proposals a lot of garbage: affiliate program, pay per click, a frank ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù.  But sometimes there are real treasures: you can agree on remote work on quite American Rates, make promising acquaintances, and even arrange yourself a relocation to the EU, Asia or the States. <br><br>  Minuses: vacancies are not updated very often, payment guarantees, as a rule, are absent, formal contracts are rare, so there is a possibility of not receiving a salary.  Most of the proposals - one-time (project) work from private customers. <br><br>  List of the most interesting resources: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4bitcoins">Reddit section</a> : few offers, many people willing, the choice of the artist can be influenced by the reputation in Reddit.  But, as always in freelancing, the key is the ability to sell your services.  For example, a small but strong development team here managed to find some very profitable orders, despite the Indians, dumping and competition; </li><li>  The famous <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">BitcoinTalk</a> forum offers many options for finding a job: you can immediately go to the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Fboard%3D185.0">local Russian branch</a> (this option is suitable for those who do not speak English).  We advise others to take a look at other local branches of the forum (interesting proposals from European and Asian customers pop up), use the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Faction%3Dsearch2">search</a> on demand job and look in the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Fboard%3D12.0">Project Development</a> section.  Almost all offer crypto payments, in 99.9% of cases this is bitcoin.  Often come across offers for copywriters, translators, content managers. </li><li>  The specialized <a href="http://bitgigs.com/">BitGigs</a> board <a href="http://bitgigs.com/">is</a> more alive than dead - new job offers appear almost every day.  You can find jobs not only for developers, there are suggestions for photographers, graphic designers, music editors and video professionals. </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="170ec7">Freelance exchanges and job aggregators</font> </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the largest and most popular resources like <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a> , <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">UpWork</a> , <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or its Russian counterpart <a href="http://kwork.ru/">Kwork</a> do not allow you to receive payment in cryptocurrency, despite the absolute logicality of this option, constant <a href="https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Payment-in-BitCoin/td-p/69956">requests</a> and <a href="https://community.upwork.com/t5/Freelancers/Feature-Request-Bitcoin-payments/td-p/118939">feature requests</a> from customers and performers, as well as a large number of projects related to cryptocurrency.  Fiverr went the farthest: since 2014, he added the ability to replenish the account balance with bitcoins, but things have not progressed further.  And according to the head of Quork, told to us in a private conversation, it‚Äôs better to stay away from bitcoins in our country: ‚ÄúAs long as the government thinks, <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/business/news/233619-no-bitcoins">and whether to ban this currency in the Russian Federation at all</a> , it‚Äôs dangerous for us to start work with it‚Äù. <br>  So when looking for a job for cryptocurrency, you will have to forget about popular resources and turn your attention to the specialized freelance exchanges: <br><br><ul><li> <a href="https://www.xbtfreelancer.com/">XBTFreelancer.com</a> appeared in 2015, was intensively promoted on thematic resources, including <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D985577.0">BitcoinTalk,</a> and, unfortunately, was largely occupied by customers and performers from third world countries.  In this connection, the "fat" offers come across not so often, but competition as on Elance in the worst years of the mass invasion of the Indians.  Otherwise, everything is standard for freelancing exchanges: orders are received by the owners of the best reputation, masters of dumping and talented sellers of their services; </li><li>  Aggregator <a href="https://coinality.com/">Coinality.com</a> collects applications from several HR-resus and freelancing exchanges, including UpWork.  The latter are not clear why they are needed, since they do not offer work for a crypt.  Otherwise, there are no complaints: there is a lot of permanent work from unknown and large companies, often direct contacts of the employer are published, you can search for offers in the region, there are remote vacancies.  To find them, enter ‚ÄúAnywhere‚Äù in the location field of the search form. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.bitcoin-vacancy.com/">BitcoinVacancy</a> aggregates posts and ads from other resources and allows you to publish offers directly.  Here, basically, you can find a permanent job for professionals in the field of project development. </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="170ec7">Cryptocurrency companies and startups</font> </h4><br>  The overwhelming majority of crypto-related companies (miners, stock exchanges, coin casinos, etc.) offer payment in altcoins as a pleasant option for employees.  By the way, HashFlare is no exception - look at the <a href="https://www.hashcoins.com/careers/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D273170">list of our vacancies</a> . <br><br>  If among the vacancies HashFlare you did not like, open <a href="https://angel.co/">Angel.co</a> - a platform for placing startups and search for investments.  Not so long ago, they opened the Jobs section, in which projects publish vacancies and are looking for specialists.  There are many options with work for salary / percentage / share in the project, there are vacancies with relocation, deleted. <br><br>  How to search for a job for cryptocurrency in Angel.co: <br><br>  <i>Method 1:</i> filter projects and companies by tag (keyword) <a href="https://angel.co/bitcoin">bitcoin</a> , <a href="https://angel.co/cryptocurrency-2">cryptocurrency</a> , <a href="https://angel.co/dogecoin-2">dogecoin</a> .  We get a table with the results; in the right column, companies looking for employees will have a ‚ÄúView Jobs‚Äù button. <br><br>  <i>Method 2:</i> go to the <a href="https://angel.co/jobs">Jobs</a> section and filter by the same tags.  To search the remote we add the keyword ‚ÄúRemote OK‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, a very important practical advice: you do not need to register with Angel.co, it is long and tedious to fill out a profile and write to the startups you like through this service.  Except when you participated in the development of 3-5 famous projects presented on Angel.co, you live in Silicon Valley and (preferably) you know Zukenberg personally.  Filling an account takes a long time, and through Angel.co companies rarely respond, especially to unknown individuals from distant Slavic countries.  It is better to go to the company website, find contacts and write them directly.  By experience, it's much easier to get feedback and agree. <br><br>  You can also search for companies and their contacts in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a> : go to the search section, use cryptocurrency, bitcoin filters, go to the companies websites and look for the Jobs section, Career section. <br><br><h4>  <font color="170ec7">Facebook</font> </h4><br>  Through Facebook, perhaps, you can find anything, including work for the crypt.  Alas, with high probability, to write a post with an attractive picture (a bitcoin coin in the hands of a naked girl) and a text like ‚ÄúFrontend developer is looking for work for Bitcoins‚Äù is not particularly productive.  If among the thousands of your friends there were those who can help, you would have turned to them.  Although what the hell is not joking?  This is Facebook and the famous hypothesis of several handshakes.  If it does not work, you can do the following: <br><br><ul><li>  In search FB, enter a request of the type ‚Äúbitcoin jobs‚Äù, and get a list of subject groups ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1024067550951401/">for example</a> ).  Most of them are closed, so you have to knock on the PM to the admins and ask to add you; </li><li>  And now there will be a life hack: on the same Angel.co, in project descriptions there are very often references to the FB profiles of the founders of startups.  As experience shows, many of them easily add you as a friend if you send a request.  And the rest add, when they see in you friends of other founders.  Then everything is simple: 1) write a LAN and propose your candidacy, 2) wait for one of the new friends to repost vacancies in your project and respond to it, 3) gather a crowd of such friends, discover the salesman‚Äôs abilities and create a post on the topic ‚Äúlooking for a job for cryptocurrency, smart, handsome, brilliant‚Äù. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="170ec7"><font color="170ec7">Some practical tips:</font></font> </h2><br>  Practical experience is a great thing, it helps to prevent new applicants from making mistakes and suggest solutions that take a long time to find.  A few useful and proven tips that can help you on the difficult path of exchanging knowledge and skills for cryptocurrency: <br><br><ul><li>  Before agreeing to work for Altcoins, study how you will convert them to Fiat and how much you will lose on commissions.  After a detailed study of the issue, things may not be very beneficial and rosy.  We will publish a detailed article about the withdrawal of bitcoins in Russia a little later, but for now we advise you to pay attention to resources such as <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/country/RU">LocalBitcoins</a> and <a href="https://btc-e.nz/">BTC-E</a> (you can change the crypt to Russian rubles and withdraw to Yandex Money with a 0% commission). </li><li>  Fix the RFP in Fiat, not the crypt.  This is a standard practice that 99% of employers agree to, allowing you to secure your income.  Example: agree on $ 2000, payment in bitcoin, at the rate at the time of payment; </li><li>  Follow the course and do not rush to change the entire crypt at once, especially if the financial situation allows.  With a high probability, literally within 1-2 weeks, you will receive a more profitable course.  Exception - when you received payment at the rate close to the maximum for the last 2-3 months.  Then it is better to sell immediately. </li><li>  Reliable wallet / service for storing alcoins - our everything.  Each owner of the crypt in the reserve has a story about how he frantically saved a PC drenched in beer, in whose memory wallets were stored or could not restore access to an online wallet tied to a lost phone.  If you are interested, write in the comments - and we will make the same detailed material on which wallet is better to choose, but for now we advise you to carefully select services / desktop applications, make backups as often as possible and store them in safe places. </li></ul><br>  <i>And of course, mining, as a way of earning, <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D273170">has not been canceled</a> :</i> <i><br></i> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D273170"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392031/</a></p>
