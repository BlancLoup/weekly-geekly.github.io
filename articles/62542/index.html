  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Liveanime.ru - we connect external subtitles to video</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://liveanime.ru/">Liveanime.ru</a> is a large wiki system, focused on collecting an anime catalog and series available online.  The project is purely non-commercial, and since it is based on a wiki, everyone can improve already known information. <br><br>  In the center is a Flash video player that can take video from one source, and subtitles from another. <br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br>  1. The user finds on one of the foreign hosting sites (Youtube, Veoh, 6.cn) anime with the original voice acting (because there are a lot of it); <br>  2. The user finds Russian subtitles and uploads them to the site; <br>  3. The user writes a special directive on the wiki page: ‚Äúcreate a link that would show this video and subtitle data in a flash player‚Äù.

      <b>What do we get?</b> <br>  We get a large anime catalog with an original sound that can be viewed online (ideally).  Now the database is filled with about 40 serials. <br><br>  True, since the video is taken from external video hosting sites, for some reason, IE often does not show video, so it is recommended to use other browsers (I use FF). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Where and how can I connect the video?</b> <br>  Videos can be connected from Youtube, Veoh, 6.cn, and even from a number of sites, as well as through direct links to FLV-files (Flash Video format for broadcasting on the Internet), in case someone wants to connect their own video archive. <br><br>  Such services, of course, use dynamic addresses to ‚Äúupload‚Äù video content - but you just need to specify the address of the video, and our script will do the rest (pull out the working FLV address). <br><br>  Orientation, first of all, goes to <b>Veoh</b> , because it is fast and there are supported videos lasting more than 20 minutes, which is necessary for the series.  However, it is often removed from the video. <br>  In the second place, we use <b>6.cn</b> - it is Chinese and slow, but there is almost everything there. <br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , <b>Youtube</b> , because it‚Äôs the most popular, and there‚Äôs a lot there too.  However, he only recently lifted the limit of 10 minutes per video, and therefore most of the series there are cut into pieces, which creates certain problems. <br><br>  Since, for various reasons, video files sometimes disappear from hosting sites, the button ‚ÄúReport a broken link‚Äù is available for each series, which modifies the wiki page by adding the ‚ÄúNot working‚Äù flag to the link. <br><br>  <b>How do subtitles connect?</b> <br>  Subtitles are taken from SRT files, since I have specially written an AS3 class for Flash that can disassemble this file format.  The class is <a href="http://janvarev.ru/CuePointsFromSRTRu">distributed under a free license</a> . <br><br>  Often, the subtitles are formatted using ASS, SSA, which allow better control over the process of overlaying subtitles (set color, place of appearance).  Writing a parser of this format is much more complicated, so only SRT is used.  The above formats can be converted quite easily to SRT using a <a href="http://liveanime.ru/Pravila/Dobavlenieserii">special program</a> . <br><br>  The SRT file is uploaded to the site using the file manager, converting to UTF-8 encoding (from Win-1251) as you go.  The file manager offers a short link to the file, which should be inserted in the appropriate place, indicating where to get the subtitles from.  You can also use the HTTP address, which allows you to load subtitles from any place on the Internet (only you need to remember to convert them to UTF-8). <br><br>  In the Flash-video player itself, you can adjust the color, the size of the subtitles, set the time offset if the subtitles are ‚Äúknocked down‚Äù relative to this particular video.  In particular, this is how video from Youtube is connected from several parts: a very large offset is set for the second part, about 10 minutes. <br><br>  <b>How are you different from many other anime online sites?</b> <br>  1. We believe in the power of the community.  Therefore, we have created a wiki site that everyone can edit.  Similar resources usually limit the ability of users to add series.  We can create backup options of at least 10 pieces, participate in changing the description, offer a new version of the classification ... <br><br>  2. We believe in high-quality, highly specialized resources.  Therefore, we have no forum, chat and hundreds of other small things.  Only information, if possible, quality.  By the way, so there is no advertising (I promise that there will never be a popup ad).  Therefore, the design is so simple (even, unfortunately, too simple). <br><br>  3. We think that speed and convenience are sometimes more important than quality.  You can always manually ‚Äúsew‚Äù Russian subtitles into a video file and upload it to a hosting service or simply download the AVI version from the P2P network.  But we think that the user is more pleasant to click on one link in order to evaluate the work as a first approximation.  Or it is easier for the editor to find a collection from all series and subtitles to them on video hosting and write 26 lines so that the series can be watched than uploading about 4 GB to the server manually, after a long conversion. <br><br>  <b>Do you have flaws?</b> <br>  Of course have.  I would even say they are full.  First of all, I want to note the inexpressive design and the overall structure of the project site, to which the hands do not reach.  Secondly - a small amount of base and the slowness of its filling.  Well, and many others, of course. <br><br>  <a href="http://liveanime.ru/">Go to Liveanime.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62542/</a></p>
