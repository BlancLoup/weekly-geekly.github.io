      This means that <b>if you put all the disks on your computer under protection</b> , the utility will require a reboot, during which <b>instantly their shadow copies will be created, and the original will remain protected and will not be altered in any way</b> .  In the process of working on a computer, everything that is done is presented as a change of information, and it is these changes that will accumulate in the shadow disk.  Such as downloading new movies, changing the settings of the computer registry.  Downloaded viruses and trojans awaiting implementation.  All this will be that modified information.  So <b>when the moment comes and you turn off or restart the computer, all the changed information will disappear without a trace</b> , and you will again see your original disk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can also not put all the disks under protection or want to save files of historical Internet messengers or mail clients.  How to do this is described below in the ‚Äúprogram benefits‚Äù. <br><br>  The first line (1.x) of Disk Write Copy software products has been developed for more than one year and has already been completed.  It is sold both in electronic format and in physical format - it stands on the shelves in stores.  Software products are based on shadow technology and provide instant rollback of all data on a protected disk for rebooting the system or when the computer is turned off. <br><br>  In Runet, you can already find the keys to the Personal version, which fell from us in unscrupulous hands.  However, I‚Äôm not going to scold anyone, because in principle, living in Russia and any country with an economy that is still ‚Äúfar away‚Äù from Norway or Switzerland, I understand perfectly well that this is quite natural and maybe even a fair phenomenon. <br><br>  In total, at the moment, 4 editions of Disk Write Copy of the first line are available: <br>  - Personal SE (available only in jewel packs) <br>  - Personal <br>  - Professional <br>  - Server <br><br>  One of the improvements to the new 2.x line will be that <b>you can roll back data without rebooting.</b>  <b>Select individual folders that will remain unprotected and save changes</b> . <br><br>  But so far that is already available to all. <br><br>  The program interface looked like this: <br><img src="http://soft.mail.ru/NAuthorFiles/articles/32629/images/0-9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And over time, acquired new changes and functionality. <br><img src="http://www.diskwritecopy.com/rus/images/dwc_pro_sshot_1_big.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In the new lineup, the interface will undergo more change than before. <br>  The lion's share of changes, of course, was in increasing the functionality of the program itself and its capabilities. <br><br><h4>  Additional screenshots </h4><br><br>  Settings: the ability to control the boot OS and DWC. <br><img src="http://www.diskwritecopy.com/rus/images/dwc_pro_sshot_7_big.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Ability to display information on the desktop. <br><img src="http://www.diskwritecopy.com/rus/images/dwc_pro_sshot_2_big.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Trey. <br><img src="http://www.diskwritecopy.com/rus/images/dwc_pro_sshot_10_big.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What benefits does the program bring? </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://soft.mail.ru/article_page.php%3Fid%3D237">One of the well-known articles about the capabilities of the product</a> well reveals the scope and side of its application, in figures showing the effectiveness of the application.  Specifically, it reveals how to make Windows "unkillable." <br><br>  A recent topic in Habre, where the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/47287/">user tells how he defended flash drives at the university from viruses with startup</a> , reminds us that not only flash drives but also computers must be protected from the introduction of malicious codes into the network.  Programs that use shadow disks, in my opinion, are great here if every computer on the network is protected with a system disk.  Thus, if a class does not work around the clock, it is enough just to turn off the power for computers - access terminals, and all viruses left by student users evaporate at that very moment.  For the work of students, it was important for us not to restrict them in management rights, since the subjects taught in class also provide administrative privileges for their study.  And at the end of the working day, after disconnecting the class, all their possible errors, reconfigurations and all other information also disappears, leaving all the systems in their original form, from the installation, given by us. <br><br>  I also sometimes work in a similar educational institution.  Of course, in our university, we also use the ability to download and install Windows on machines via a network interface.  That is, you can install Windows and run a silent installation of all the applications we need (batch files, more precisely, cmd, we have added the necessary ones), but this does not apply to instant recovery, as it does not happen in half a minute, 2, 5, or even 10 if it is necessary to install several computers on the network at once, the information starts to load the network and is still slower. <br><br><h4>  Where it all goes. </h4><br>  We are constantly working on the project and release updated editions.  There remains a lot of unrealized ideas, in terms of a large number of already-designed utilities and other software.  We have big plans in general :) <br><br><h4>  What supports: </h4><br><br>  OS: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows VISTA, including 64 bit support. <br>  Server Edition: Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows LONGHORN, including support for 64-bit architecture, and successful optimization for Intel ITANIUM II 64 (ia64) <br><br><h4>  Where to use: </h4><br><br>  More about the use I will write in the following article. <br><br>  Reviewing the <a href="http://www.intel.com/business/enterprise/emea/rus/isv/disk_write_copy.htm">publication on the Russian-language portal of Intel,</a> it can be said that effective application is possible in a wide area: <br><ul><li>  On home computers </li><li>  In offices on office computers </li><li>  In computer clubs, Internet cafes and computer classrooms </li><li>  At customer service terminals </li><li>  On server systems </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Program website:</i> <a href="http://diskwritecopy.com/">http://diskwritecopy.com/</a> <br><br>  By the way, in the comments, here or on our official forum, I will gratefully listen to your criticism, opinions and wishes of any kind, especially if all this will be balanced and reasoned.  In this regard, Habr in general I really like, because you can often find people full of enthusiasm, enthusiastic and thoughtful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47176/</a></p>
