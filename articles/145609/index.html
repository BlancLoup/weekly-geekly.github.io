      However, I didn‚Äôt have enough solitaire to play at the workplace.  For relaxation and brain training.  Fast, interesting, and to compare your IQ with others. <br>  So I came up with the Sarov Towers and for the first time made a site for a collective in-person correspondence game. <br>  The programmer from me is no on the part of accuracy, and here I am afraid to wake the real Habra-hunters for memory leaks. <br><br>  I already got it from them.  Please keep it down, guys. <br><br>  As a result, on my page appeared about 100 fans of the game, with whom we have been hacking towers for the fifth year already. <br>  I did not think about monetization, or thought lazily. <br><br><h4>  How I joined Google </h4><br>  In 2008, I suddenly received a free certificate from Google for 1200 rubles. <br>  For this money, Google offered to advertise a site or lifestyle or something new-owner-needed. <br>  Wow, I thought, and got 400 rubles.  Because to activate the certificate to your Google AdSence account, you had to put money. <br>  A small divorce.  And I forked up. <br><br>  Moreover, besides advertising, Google offered to place banners on the site. <br>  ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù I thought.  I will play my 400 rubles on advertising other people's services and I will be happy. <br><br>  A couple of weeks of scrolling banners to my account fell $ 2. <br><br>  - Hurray! - I was dreaming about the box of beer. <br>  -Horseradish!  - Said Google and banned my account. <br><br>  Type I cheater.  And unfairly I click. <br>  I was offended and took off the banners. <br><br><h4>  The phone broke into my life </h4><br>  After 2 years, I made Towers for the iPhone and earned a lot of money on iAd advertising. <br>  Apple made no claims to me.  Just asked to rearrange the banner at the top of the screen. <br><br>  Despite the financial and moral success, I held a grudge against Google for those $ 2 and $ 400. <br><br>  Another year has passed.  I wrote a Soviet toy Chapaeva. <br>  Free of course, it is in Russian. <br>  It played 100,000 people.  iAd did not bring money - it does not work in Russia and Europe. <br><br>  And you did not know?  Strange.  Where did you get the invitation to Habr? <br><br>  And I again started an account in Google AdMob. <br>  Placed banners in the game.  Unobtrusively.  In February 2012. <br><br>  And babosy went.  From 5 to 10 bucks a day. <br><br><h4>  Statistics from Admob </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed7/81e/0bd/ed781e0bdeee5a73e6445b23a28b060b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In April 2012, more than 500 dollars accumulated.  I paused.  Google could not resist and sent a letter. <br><br><h4>  Babosy went </h4><br><pre><code class="perl hljs">Congratulations!
