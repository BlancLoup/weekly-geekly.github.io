Project teams (design teams) that understand and take into account these nuances have the greatest chances for the broad and waiting masses to accept their product. <br><br>  <b>Diffusion of innovations is a complex process</b> .  In it, project teams must use their theoretical knowledge for marketing and handling critical factors, which we will now discuss.

      I went through the types of users and the adoption process in the first part of the story.  The second half will tell about the five characteristics of innovation that determine its use.  According to theory, this will determine its long-term prospects. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Characteristics of innovation</b> </h4><br>  People do not immediately get used to something new.  They make an informed decision.  This is something intentional.  Returning to the previous part, I will say that this is the third step in the adoption of innovation.  He needs to pay a lot of attention, this is one of the most important moments.  The theory identifies five characteristics that determine the use of innovation: <br><br><h5>  <b>Relative superiority</b> </h5><br>  Relative superiority determines how much better the product is compared to the previous generation or its equivalent.  Changes may be as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  improved service </li><li>  combining several functions into one tool </li><li>  reduced need for support resources </li><li>  empowering users </li><li>  improved interface </li><li>  improved customizability </li><li>  increased durability </li><li>  increased productivity </li><li>  reduced user effort </li><li>  reduced environmental impact </li><li>  saving money </li><li>  space saving </li><li>  time saving </li></ul><br>  In the 1980s and early 90s, WordStar and WordPerfect demonstrated relative superiority over existing products.  In offices, typewriters that used to occupy a lot of space were used most often.  They performed only one function, they always needed to maintain and update parts on a regular basis (and even they are noisy, these things). <br><br>  As computers became more common, WordStar and WordPerfect freed people from typewriters.  Excellence was obvious.  Programs not only did not need additional physical.  space (except, actually, the computer).  Ink and corrective tapes were no longer needed, document editing became easier thanks to printing, files could be saved and transferred on diskettes.  Soon, typewriters disappeared from the offices altogether, computers replaced them with word processing software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d39/954/dea/d39954deaa4f43ee888a2367b9ff737d.jpg"><br>  <i>Word processing and typewriters</i> <br><br>  Your team will face relative superiority in a variety of ways.  If not, then this is no innovation, and in general the game is not worth the candle.  You need to find the potential of your product at the planning stage of development.  From this point on, it is necessary to work on these strengths in order to have an advantage in our side when compared with competitors. <br><br>  Market research must follow a certain logic.  Have you determined the demand for innovation?  What are competing products?  Putting emphasis on the problem your development solves, and how it does it, you will understand its relative superiority. <br><br>  You must clearly highlight the relative superiority of your product in marketing.  The better your product existing?  How does he solve unmet needs?  You should be clearly aware of these things, and promotional materials - show them and prove why you are superior to similar products. <br><br>  You need to do research to support your statements.  For example, you say that your product is easier than competing things.  But are you sure that users need it?  Does it somehow save them money or reduce their dependence on a few things, combining their functions?  Prove it, and then use the facts in advertising. <br><br><h5>  <b>Compatibility</b> </h5><br>  Compatibility is an indicator of how innovation is assimilated into people's lives.  Potential buyers should know that your product is ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù with them.  If your product requires a big change in their lifestyle or it needs additional products, then most likely you are doomed to failure.  Innovation is successful only when people take them into their lives unnoticed by themselves.  When they replace something. <br><br>  The iPad is a great example of a product with good compatibility with potential buyers.  Many have stopped using smartphones and laptops to read mail, surf the net and just watch videos on the Internet. <br><br>  Your team needs to understand for whom and what they develop.  You will not be able to make innovation with use for a society that does not have electricity.  You need a deep understanding of the conditions in which your development will be at the time of release.  Answer the following questions, keeping in mind the compatibility of your product: <br><br><ul><li>  How does your innovation fit the lives of users? </li><li>  What changes in behavior are needed for your product to take root? </li><li>  What are add.  products are needed for the success of your innovation (for example, high-speed Internet connection, gas, etc.) </li><li>  What existing products do you replace? </li><li>  How does your innovation fit in with the psychological model and beliefs of people? </li></ul><br>  These questions are required.  To be honest, the success of your product depends on how the innovation gets along with the beliefs, attitudes, values ‚Äã‚Äãand behavior of potential buyers. <br><br>  Compatibility does not force innovation to be less ‚Äúinnovative.‚Äù  Let's go through the success of the iPad again, noting its key factors. <br><br>  The iPad appeared just in time for the ‚Äúevolution‚Äù of human views.  Many thought that new technologies are designed to ease the daily routine (conviction) that this is a good phenomenon (attitude).  People have already used laptops and smartphones to surf the net (behavior). <br><br>  Wi-Fi made the Internet accessible, it allowed the main functions of the iPad to work practically everywhere (technology).  In the end, enough people were willing to spend money on these types of technologies to show them as something worthwhile to the late majority.  These factors made the iPad compatible with people's lives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3a/237/19f/b3a23719fc3b44b1ae297370b902d1cb.jpg"><br>  <i>iPad as an example of compatibility</i> <br><br>  Apple's knowledge of their market led to the success of the iPad.  And it is unlikely that he would suffer the same fate if he were released before the advent of ubiquitous Wi-Fi or mass access to digital films and music.  Your project team needs a clear understanding of the potential of the market and the conditions that must be met for the product to be better compatible with the lives of customers.  If success depends on the availability of some other product, you need to figure out what it is, whether it is sufficiently widespread and would not prevent potential buyers from using your product. <br><br><h5>  <b>Complexity versus simplicity</b> </h5><br>  Complexity and simplicity - important are the nuances in how people learn to use your product.  The difficulty puts a stick in the wheels of progress.  Tricky innovation = difficulties in its adoption into their lives by people.  Potential buyers usually do not have enough time to deal with all the subtleties.  The more intuitive the product, the better it will go to the masses.  It's simple. <br><br>  The Oreo biscuit dividing machine is a great example of a too complex thing.  Even if people think that they need such a device, the level of effort required is prohibitive.  Potential buyers will be forced to re-read the instructions many times, for a long time to delve into it.  This machine is a clear illustration of such characteristics as compatibility.  The size here matters (it is huge), not everyone has a whole room for an automated cookie separation system.  A pocket portable version would be more likely to succeed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVkRDrbzgoU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjt1W6E4GHylmh8Ap8eVZKJ-sVkRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Your team should aim for simplicity, carefully examine every detail of your product.  High technology does not immediately have to mean high learning them.  Treat usability testing as a standard practice.  It has its obvious practical benefits: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Iterate the design of your product</b> .  Results of usability tests should directly affect these iterations.  Take a closer look at the problems encountered when using your product, pay attention to the terminology with which your users are unfamiliar, present the information in a understandable way. </li><li>  If you do not cope with the discrepancies revealed as a result of the usability testing, describe them in the FAQ, tips, video instructions and other educational materials. </li><li>  If your product is complex, with a lot of standard and advanced options, you can still find a middle ground.  ‚ÄúQuick Start‚Äù is a cool example of simplifying tricky systems.  Having bought a TV or computer, most likely in the box you will find one sheet with a description of how to connect this product for its basic use.  It suits most people.  Extended instructions describing all the functions most often appear as a downloadable PFD file or simply lie side by side.  That's how everyone pleased. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/e4d/d34/006e4dd347ec41358b96264f84979ce0.png"><br>  <i>Brief instructions for a quick start from Amazon fireTV.</i>  <i>The full version takes 39 pages.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Approbative</b> </h5><br>  Approbability is a characteristic that shows how well people can explore your product before purchasing.  This is an important point in making innovation.  A person needs to know what your product is and even make a ‚Äútest drive‚Äù.  This is the whole point of demo versions and beta releases.  Potential buyers should understand what their life will be after the adoption of the product. <br><br>  It is necessary to provide people with the opportunity to test your product.  There are many examples of a competent approach to this issue in digital products.  The Sirius XM has a 30-day free period, during which the user can come to the conclusion that the subscription is worth the money.  You can offer a free limited version of your product with the ability to pay for additional features.  Join.me effectively uses this technique: it offers a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù free version of its image translation service from the desktop.  Users see the benefits of paid services and more actively use them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/c11/c9c/1dac11c9c84a4764bbddd0c036e162b0.jpg"><br>  <i>Join.me: of course you can ‚Äúshare‚Äù the control of your cursor.</i>  <i>It will cost a lot of money.</i> <br><br>  You can offer a version of your product without advertising, allowing users to decide for themselves whether or not to pay for it.  This approach is in Pandora.  You can listen to music for free, but after a few songs, advertising is surely played.  Do you want to get rid of her?  Pay for Pandora One. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce9/f14/587/ce9f1458726c47c7926960f781f9225e.png"><br>  <i>Pandora offers a paid subscription to its service without ads.</i> <br><br>  It is worth understanding which of these methods best suits you in dealing with potential buyers.  Explore your audience or evaluate how your competitors work with trial versions of their products.  In approbation, the most important thing is the high quality of the trial version, showing the experience that your team wanted to create.  Users will make a decision based on this particular nuance.  Do not think that this "trial" is the best chance to test and collect feedback.  You will do more harm than good if you have a free version full of errors and problems.  Hurried release of an unfinished trial product - definition of self-sabotage. <br><br><h5>  <b>Visibility</b> </h5><br>  Visibility - the degree of visibility of the results of using the product.  In the first part, we found out that not all of them take innovation at once.  All those who go after the pioneers rely in their choice on observing this group.  Visibility goes far beyond the more "late" categories.  Absolutely all types of users should see the benefits of adopting and using innovation. <br><br>  Understand how people will see the benefits of your product.  Here are some ways to emphasize them: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Comparison</b>  Potential buyers should first see the advantages of your product over others.  Comparison is a good thing when you have a highly visible superiority over competitors.  For example, cunning store owners deliberately put the very best TVs in front of smaller and / or worse models to create contrast and more obvious difference. </li><li>  <b>Before and after.</b>  What will be the life of a person after you start using your product?  Showing a positive difference, you will have a significant impact on potential buyers.  Are there any noticeable changes in any aspects that your product leads to?  If your application teaches foreign languages, you can focus on the average number of new words that you can learn with it. </li><li>  <b>Recommendations</b> .  People very well perceive the impressions of others.  Of course, advertising campaigns on traditional information channels is an important and necessary thing, but it is even more important to hear feedback from ordinary people.  For example, online reviews.  People who write recommendations and reviews have a very strong influence on public opinion and potential buyers.  Have your product appear on relevant sites. </li></ul><br>  Exact following these tips is optional.  Get creative in presenting the benefits of your innovation.  Think of a way to cover as many forms of media as possible in order to increase the reach of people who have learned about your product. <br><br><h4>  <b>Blockbuster and Netflix: A Tale of Innovation (in some way)</b> </h4><br>  Let's take a look at the characteristics of innovation already on the example of the streaming video service Netflix.  Once, somewhere in the year 2001, there was a video rental giant named Blockbuster.  Thousands of stores, tens of thousands of workers - things were fine, the overwhelming market share belonged to this network.  Blockbuster calmly sat and watched what was happening, because everything was fine.  It was.  Because Blockbuster did not notice at the time Netflix, a small but more innovative competitor, who was already close to overthrowing the giant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/0da/e63/8970dae638fe43d59f6b4ccf8728a0cb.jpg"><br>  <i>Blockbuster: many shops, many workers, few innovations.</i> <br><br>  Netflix appeared in 1997.  In less than 15 years, he (with the help of Redbox) completely changed the video rental market to such an extent that Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and ordered a long life in 2011.  All this happened because of the innovativeness of Netflix and its products. <br><br><h5>  <b>Relative superiority</b> </h5><br>  In 2001, Netflix users paid a monthly subscription for a DVD by mail. <br><br>  This gave an obvious superiority over Blockbuster and other "brick" shops.  DVD by mail was much more convenient for most people, as they regularly received letters at home or in the office.  Users are less likely to be penalized for delaying the rental of discs, and this, in turn, defamed and killed the Blockbuster image. <br><br>  Netflix developed in parallel with the technology.  Since 2001, the number of homes connected to the Internet has rapidly increased.  In 2007, Netflix began to provide the ability to stream movies and TV programs.  Users no longer had to wait for their order to be delivered.  The need for return is completely gone.  And if you have a laptop or PC, you have access to all content anytime, anywhere. <br><br>  Today, Netflix also offers its services on gaming consoles, smartphones and tablets.  Users are just a few clicks away from viewing their favorite programs in any resolution on any screen.  Netflix moved from mail, which was very expensive and relied on the not the most reliable way to deliver content to the Internet.  The company has maintained its relative superiority due to innovation and technology growth. <br><br><h5>  <b>Complexity versus simplicity</b> </h5><br>  Netflix took a simple thing and made it even easier.  This is the main characteristic of a successful innovation: take something and do it better than others.  The concept of video rental was not new.  Netflix made the process easier: users watch movies when they are comfortable and in the order that suits them, and then can quickly return them. <br><br>  Later, Netflix went even further and began to make recommendations based on user behavior.  The system advises content based on ratings previously supplied by the client.  This shows Netflix an expert in people's eyes.  The service not only delivers content, but also supervises and recommends movies and programs. <br><br><h5>  <b>Approbative</b> </h5><br>  The Netflix model is particularly good at handling approx.  The company has a great free period, familiar to almost everyone.  At the beginning, potential buyers could simply be convinced of the convenience of receiving and returning the DVD by mail.  As soon as streaming appeared and became the generally accepted norm, people were fascinated by the magic of video on demand for a month. <br><br>  Netflix content is constantly growing, so users just can‚Äôt see everything in just one month.  The advantages of the trial period fully justify its duration.  People with "trial" have exactly the same features as full-fledged clients.  They can watch whatever they want.  If they still do not decide on a subscription for money, they immediately lose access to everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8be/c54/c5e/8bec54c5e491405683750def4f07ea90.png"><br>  <i>Netflix trial period: one month and you're already on the hook for the rest of your life</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Visibility</b> </h5><br>  Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãalso strong on this issue too.  Remember, we said that it is necessary to make not only the product itself noticeable, but also the advantages of using it? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having chosen Blockbuster, people felt the flaws of its system back in 1999. There were fines for late returns, it was hard to get the news, and you had to walk a lot to rent or return the film. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The drawbacks of Blockbuster have made Netflix's superior visibility very high. Monthly subscription - no delay penalties. It was a mail-in service ‚Äî no additional work. It was possible to change the order of receiving films - see always what you want. When potential customers learned about Netflix, they no longer needed to explain its benefits. And further attempts by Blockbuster to offer delivery by mail and streaming video only confirmed the success of Netflix.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Netflix increased the visibility of the product and its packaging. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bright red DVD cover worked well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People saw a neighbor getting a package from Netflix from their mailbox and understood how easy and simple it is to use the services of this particular company. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/b85/b6c/0bdb85b6c81b4e25afe476870b020fdf.jpg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHey, where did you get this DVD?‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Netflix branded packaging improved brand awareness. </font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Netflix has been an industry innovator for 15 years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company went through water, fire and copper pipes, the economic problems that killed Blockbuster, then its main rival. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, often the future of Netflix was questionable, but the focus on user feedback and innovation did the trick. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To remain competitive, Netflix will have to continue to innovate.</font></font><br><br><h4> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not stop!</font></font></b> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your project team should more often refer to the concepts outlined in the diffusion of innovation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I recommend simply writing out all the above characteristics and how your product relates to them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And yes, it would be nice to visualize the ecosystem in which your development exists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Include these points in the document:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In what conditions can your innovation flourish (for example, widespread access to high-speed Internet)? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What technologies should be compatible with your product (for example, should a smartphone be able to run any applications)? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What market research and potential buyers need to conduct? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What can you control and how can you manipulate (for example, deals with content distributors)? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What products compete with yours (including physical and digital)? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What are their disadvantages and what is your superiority? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do competitors advertise their products? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What marketing campaigns are most successful?</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Is there a good time to get your product out (for example, when your product solves people‚Äôs problems)? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What form of approbation do you have? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very important how the time ‚Äúafter‚Äù looks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What will the world be like if your innovation becomes ubiquitous?</font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And add to the list more questions from the previous part: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Did you find out who and what category of users falls into? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Who are your pioneers and earlier most? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How do potential buyers learn about your innovation? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How can people get more information about your product? </font></font></li></ul><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Answers to these questions are hard work, but worth it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use visualization and answers to your questions as a map to go further and develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, nothing will work out perfectly, but learn as much as possible about what influences your success. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Project teams who are knowledgeable in the diffusion of innovations have a superiority over competitors who do not possess such knowledge.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251237/</a></p>
