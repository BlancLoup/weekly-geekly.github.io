  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mosaic creates a single screen from multiple iPhones and iPads.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At PennApps Hackathon, a group of MIT students has created an application that can do amazing things by connecting multiple iOS devices into a single interactive screen.  An application that does not require any jailbreak <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mosaic.io/id620300332%3Fmt%3D8">available</a> for free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mosaic.io/id620300332%3Fmt%3D8">on the App Store</a> , but Mosaic plans go even further: they created an SDK that allows other developers to embed similar functionality into their own applications. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYrhkl3JKPM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibb9Zzos1EsZwaMpvhFYBfQ-j-FA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Application features are very interesting.  Imagine a board game divided into four iPads, one for each player.  Or RPG, where you create a map, folding several iPhone close to each other.  Its use for advertising, user terminals and POS applications is also obvious, but the prospect of using it for interactive applications using several iOS devices is what really excites the imagination.

      ‚ÄúWe talked with many casual game developers and found out that among them there is a significant interest in creating board games, since this process is quite simple,‚Äù explained the founder of Mosaic Isaan Gulrajani.  ‚ÄúWith multiple iPads, you can stack them together and get a large enough surface to play board games or Angry Birds, where the first player controls the birds, and the second builds a fortress that the first must destroy.‚Äù <br><br>  For fans of board games who want to have a digital version of Settlers of Catan or Warhammer, the application can fully recreate the sensations of their physical counterparts, and the flexibility and extensibility of the application make it even more attractive.  Mosaic also talked with advertising agencies that believe that people will open the application only because of the novelty of this way of interacting with the device.  This is a winning point for brands and advertisers, giving the opportunity to increase the return on advertising within applications or branded content. <br><br>  "Brands can hold promotions like: 'Swipe this Starbucks coupon from one phone to another and you both get a dollar on your next purchase,'" says Gulrajani.  "This is something like viral advertising, and we want to use this feature to the maximum." <br><br>  Mosaic.io itself, rather developed as a technology demonstration, offers useful features for end users as well.  You can share local, or stored on the Dropbox images: you can brush them to another device and its screen will adjust to show the entire image.  Although this feature was introduced for demonstration purposes, even limited functionality is enough to impress anyone. <br><br>  The Mosaic team tested the application on ten iPhones and found that even on so many devices the delay is insignificant.  This is achieved using the clock synchronization algorithm, using one synchronized clock on multiple devices.  Gulrajani says that since the quality of the application depends on the speed of the user's Internet connection, it is suitable for playing video. <br><br>  Mosaic is going to work with interested developers.  They did not introduce a queue system and process requests as they arrive.  The startup is being spun on its own, and is going to continue in the same spirit for the foreseeable future.  However, the company's future plans include the introduction of a fee for using the API based on the volume of requests required by the developer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175409/</a></p>
