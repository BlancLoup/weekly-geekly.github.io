That's why I decided to make tambourines.  First of all, the service was created for itself.  In the first place, there was still a desire to make tambourines, to gain invaluable experience in production, to communicate with customers, to master the intricacies of sales and logistics of their own small, unique product.  And only then - making a profit.  This is not just an online shop selling souvenirs, but a well-established service to create the most holy thing in the IT world.  Formation and development consists of 2 parts.  Perhaps someone this experience will be useful in the future will be useful.  For me, this is an openness to criticism and gaining invaluable experience from the largest IT community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d7/31c/4c7/9d731c4c77dc53011735ae10fe0e4ee2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  History of creation </h4><br>  One winter evening, I wanted to buy a tambourine, with some logos, drawings that emphasize what I do.  I mean IT topics.  But to my great regret, I have not found anything.  And then I decided to buy an ordinary musical tambourine and remake it.  Engaged in search in the online store music products.  The price was not at all pleased, and the idea itself was somehow forgotten, but not for long.  Being on vacation in one of the African countries, I saw a tambourine in an Arab shop.  Bargained and I bought it.  Upon arrival, I decided to redo it: I took off my old skin and pulled the cloth from my old pants, stuck an apple on Apple, ‚Äúperformed a rite‚Äù over all the equipment.  Then I wondered, what if I start selling such tambourines?  And he began to develop the topic, namely he started looking for the possibility of drawing an image qualitatively, but at the same time without using expensive equipment (thermal printers, etc.) and without complicating the process. <br><br>  All of what I did can be described as ‚Äúdomain analysis‚Äù.  It included: <br><ul><li>  finding the best solution for tambourine manufacturing </li><li>  search for suppliers of tambourines </li><li>  choice of fabric and paper for thermal transfer </li><li>  dispatch process by delivery services in Ukraine </li><li>  accepting orders through the website </li><li>  search for similar services in Ukraine and abroad </li></ul>

      After a while, the picture was already looming.  Well, then in order. <br><br>  <b>The address and the site</b> was chosen to be consonant with the name and subject matter, CMS wordpress &amp; e-commerce was installed, several plug-ins, including statistics, CNC, SEO.  The base is quickly filled with tambourines and options.  Wordpress - because it‚Äôs a popular and well maintained, evolving engine.  In addition, there was already experience and the creation of some projects on it.  He allowed to make a quick start based on ready-made solutions.  As it turned out later, it turned out to be one of the minuses.  But more on that below. <br><br>  <b>The supplier</b> found a store of musical goods, agreed on wholesale purchases.  We were offered tambourines with dimensions of 8 ", 10", 12 ", which is equal to 20, 25, 30 cm, respectively. It later I realized that the optimal size for thermal paper transfer is A4, and for sending by New Mail delivery service - it is 10 "(25cm).  But first, I bought tambourines of various sizes, I watched who orders what and what, I gained experience with orders. <br><br>  There was a period when there were no drums, then they were looking for alternative customers.  Up to the Pakistani manufacturer.  There were negotiations and they were ready to send the order.  The term is 1 week and the cost of delivery is $ 100 for 50 pieces.  And did not order, due to the absence of such large sales volumes. <br><br>  <b>A</b> thermal transfer <b>paper was found</b> - Barva Thermotransfer.  Its price is relatively cheap, it is designed for transferring a regular iron, it has a heat indicator that changes color at a sufficient temperature, which is very convenient, so as not to overdo it and not burn the fabric.  The paper is designed for printing with an inkjet printer in a mirror form.  Printing consisted in preparing the template in Photoshop in a mirror form and going to the nearest kiosk for printing on our thermal paper. <br><br>  <b>Delivery.</b>  Initially, the shipment was New Mail and UkrPochta.  The latter disappeared immediately, after the first half-hour dispatch of staying in the queue + search for packaging, etc. ... New mail has proved itself from the positive side.  Delivery from the central region to anywhere in Ukraine rarely exceeded $ 2.  We decided that delivery in Ukraine to the New Post office should be free and adhere to this to this day.  Thus, we believe that the contractual relationship between us and the customers ends after the order is shipped by New Mail. <br><br>  <b>Payment.</b>  They chose a PrivatBank card, because there was a convenient management system for Internet banking privat24, a wide network of self-service terminals, and the availability of credit cards with the population.  Since part of the orders was from Kiev, we decided to take not only on PrivatBank's credit card, but also on our hands upon receipt.  Later, the API documentation for connecting payment systems to the site was thoroughly studied and scripts were written that accepted payment via Privat24 and liqpay.  The latter provides the possibility of payment from any credit card that has rights to online payments. <br><br>  <b>The cloth.</b>  The Tambourines themselves were originally covered with "skin."  By the way, this skin was more like rough cardboard paper than leather.  Therefore, what was my disappointment when I began to stroke this thermal paper on the tambourine and this skin on the tambourine was squeezing and rivets jumping out.  It turns out that the skin is very tight when heated and bursts.  I had to just do her clean and pull the fabric.  The fabric was selected cheap cotton, but of high quality and pleasant color, on which the paint was well tolerated from thermal paper.  Thus, trial and error born application process.  The fabric was bought, it was cut into squares of about 30x30 cm, and an image in a mirror image was applied to these square pieces of fabric by ironing.  Then this square of fabric was tied onto a tambourine and cut around in a circle.  Later a printer with a CISS was purchased and the printing problem disappeared.  Brochures-postcards were developed, on which were words of gratitude for the purchase of a tambourine, instructions and a catalog.  What in turn created - a chain reaction of orders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf7/1c8/6f1/bf71c86f1d6c4f31f0852c0947703968.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Advertising.</b>  There was a complete SEO optimization of each tambourine, each article.  But the desired result of the sale of a large number of tambourines was still not achieved.  And then, they began to create ads on IT-forums and blogs of Ukraine.  It should be noted here that an incredible fact, when 5-6 sites, including a group in a popular social network, attracted 5 clients, and one forum of local networks about 30 clients per day.  It was important to find that golden mean.  Google tools were used, keyword analysis was performed.  The words <i>buy a tambourine</i> 2000 requests per month, and a <i>tambourine admin</i> 30 requests.  Contextual advertising was bought, which also had a rather positive effect on sales.  They set a budget of $ 50 and advertising kept about 3 months.  This was caused by a lack of competitors for keywords. <br><br>  <b>General view.</b>  This is a hobby, so the period came when there simply wasn‚Äôt enough time to service orders.  After the main working day, in the evening I had to make tambourines.  Gradually, interest in the case fell.  But then there was the same feeling that forced to move forward.  I realized that for almost half a year, I gained invaluable experience in sales and development of an online resource for selling a unique product, which has no analogues in Ukraine.  In the evening, giving the next tambourine to the client, I listened to the words of gratitude for the excellent resource, which of course made me work further.  There were orders from Belarus, when people ordered several pieces, as souvenirs to their homeland.  Orders from Tyumen, for the competition on CISCO-technology as souvenirs and prizes.  Orders from Moscow (about 10 pieces) for game-resource gifts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ff/78a/04f/7ff78a04f3b7b5b367af87183d239cb1.jpg"><br><br>  After a break of 4 months, after the New Year's calm and free time, under constant pressure from customers who wanted tambourines and said that ‚Äúthere was great service‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a pity that it was closed‚Äù and so on, I decided to start the site again .  It is worth considering the fact that the site did not work for about 3 months (the paid hosting period was over) and yet, people found contacts somewhere: Skype, mobile, mail.  They called me with the desire to buy a tambourine. <br><br>  I decided to completely rework the CMS site.  In a past wordpress site, I didn't like: <br><br><ul><li>  Heavy design and code </li><li>  A lot of superfluous and not needed </li><li> It was necessary to poke around in someone else's code in order to make the ordering system ‚Äúeasier‚Äù. </li><li>  Much needed to be mastered "from scratch" and therefore not improved. </li><li>  The store system itself did not satisfy me </li></ul><br><br>  But this time, taking into account all the nuances and problems of the past site, I began to develop.  For 2 weeks, created a CMS, based on php, bootstrap 3, jquery / ajax, php + mysql.  The concept - minimalism in design.  Having selected the main thing - tambourines, but having allocated with a powerful functional the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aac/a27/837/aaca2783759ad96f4151eadbcd77ba20.png"><br><br>  <b>User interface.</b>  Getting to the main page of the site, the user immediately saw the logo and under it a catalog of tambourines.  An intuitive interface, after clicking on the "buy" button, the client immediately saw the "basket", with a list of tambourines.  All that he changed: quantity or tambourines, additionally choosing the options ‚Äúgift wrapping‚Äù, ‚Äúfast delivery‚Äù.  And it changed instantly in the Database through ajax requests.  That in turn did not create a burden on the client.  The site itself has an adaptive design and is perfectly displayed both on the tablet, mobile phone and on Mac / PC.  The ordering procedure was adapted - depending on the chosen delivery method, payment, type of tambourine.  For example, if this is a personal tambourine, then fields are added to the form with the ability to upload your image, comment, etc.  Each new order was assigned a unique 5-digit number by which it was possible to track the status of the order.  The procedure for generating an order number took into account current orders, so that the number would not match.  If a person specifies an email when ordering, which is already in the customer base, then the customer information is updated (full name and mobile), and the total statistics of orders is summarized.  The privat24, liqpay payment systems were connected, the order form was simplified, the customer‚Äôs shopping cart, the order procedure itself, all the addresses of the New Post offices were pulled from excel to csv and parsed into sql.  Mail was connected to gmail, so that the letters would not fall into spam.  From the ‚Äútrack order‚Äù page you can pay by alternative methods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/288/619/df7/288619df76da5b47ef579d356b365bbc.png"><br><br>  <b>Admin interface.</b>  This part needs to be given greater attention, since it is a whole management and monitoring system. <br><br>  <b>Statistics.</b>  Displays personal statistics of site visits, for the entire period, per month and per day.  The current balance of tambourines, the ratio of orders / sales.  Current balance, income calculator.  It is taken into account how many tambourines are sold / bought, money earned / spent. <br><br>  <b>Orders.</b>  Order list with quick search on any of the fields.  When you click on any of the buttons: payment is accepted, the order is sent, the line changes color depending on the status of the order.  The status changes, including automatically, if payment was made through the payment system privat24 or liqpay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb0/913/7f0/eb09137f00c7a227997a16f47afa25f1.png"><br><br>  <b>Customers</b>  Base customers, with their orders, the amount. <br><br>  <b>Content</b>  Managing the tambourines catalog with convenient sorting draggable, hide-buttons, prices. <br><br>  <b>Settings.</b>  General site settings, SEO pages of the site, id &amp; key payment systems, prices for additional services.  Definitions of discount threshold and its amount.  And much more. <br><br>  Newly recycled postcards.  Now they are printed on photo paper, their size is A5.  They go with each tambourine, tied on a golden corset rope.  They contain a mini-catalog, words of gratitude, instructions for use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e09/a00/6a9/e09a006a925f0db534567a63ee60ff98.png"><br><br>  <b>How does it work?</b>  New order - a letter arrives from the site about a new order (either to the mail of a laptop or to the mail of a mobile phone).  Sometimes immediately comes and sms from the bank with a notice of payment.  I am looking at the ordering information.  I can go to the admin panel and see the orders, if the order is paid, it is marked in yellow.  I am printing an order card in order to send an order on this New Mail on this card.  I print the image of a tambourine, cut it out.  I transfer to the fabric.  I stretch the fabric on a tambourine, cut it off.  I pack.  Carry a bicycle to the New Mail.  I get the number of TTN.  I enter it in the admin with one click.  I click on the button and the order is sent.  Thus, the status of the order changes and a letter is sent to the customer with the TTH number, thanks and a link to the New Mail website to track the order. <br><br><h4>  Summing up </h4><br>  Service has been working for 1.5 years.  The total number of sales is more than 300. 70% of buyers are girls, usually orders for a gift.  The peak of sales is spring, February 23, or professional holidays and corporate parties. <br><br>  Many orders from Russia (but the complexity of delivery).  40% - tambourines with personal images (logos of companies and representative offices). <br>  I will be glad to hear comments and suggestions, as well as happy to answer all questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226361/</a></p>
