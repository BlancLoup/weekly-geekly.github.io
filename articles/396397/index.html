Near the pavilion there is a rocket "Vostok".  A hole from above is necessary for the rescue system to work - in the event of a launch vehicle accident on the Vostok ship, the hatch should have been fired off, and the astronaut should be ejected.  On the Soyuz rockets, the rescue system <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/267044/">works differently</a> , and there the fairing is solid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/6e2/d7f/2c76e2d7f83d4b2ba47ea36bc60027bf.jpg"><br><br>  Notice how far the rocket is below the installer.  This was done deliberately so that the lower, widest part of the rocket hid in the launch structure to protect against the wind.  When the R-7 was designed, they initially even wanted to build a wall around the start, but, fortunately, they came up with a much more beautiful solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e1/93a/2e5/5e193a2e5a0c4a65a015c2cc904c98ee.jpg"><br><br>  Now there are no exhibitions in the pavilion "Cosmos", you can see desolation in the door slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed7/d9c/c0e/ed7d9cc0e3384253a75437468890fd13.jpg"><br><br>  And the exhibition "Cosmos: the birth of a new era" is in pavilion number 1, it is "Central" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfd/441/fea/cfd441feac2c4c27a189cd51bc7f968e.jpg"><br><br>  The exhibition <b>"Cosmos: the birth of a new era"</b> <br>  <b>Admission</b> : 250 p. <br>  <b>Photographing</b> : Free. <br>  <b>Overall rating</b> : Go necessarily. <br><br>  The exhibits are placed approximately in chronological order, so we begin with the fantasies and dreams of the early 20th century.  For example, the cabin of the transport of the future, as seen in the 20s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/bc7/628/ff2bc76284c843bba82179817dcb8888.jpg"><br><br>  Reflections Tsiolkovsky about how people will live in weightlessness.  Items in the baskets (come true, but Tsiolkovsky did not know about stickies), food in the baskets, water in a rotating container (did not come true, we cope, and so), wings for flying around the station (while there is little space, it did not come true). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6b/aba/45e/b6baba45e38942b68d46e09ca3895949.jpg"><br><br>  "Tying around a rocket" is so cute.  Immediately the problem of a broken cable was managed to catch someone, and someone died.  Individual engines that were in reality did not occur to Tsiolkovsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/bfd/65c/aeabfd65c8c74288ae1f06124420423d.jpg"><br><br>  If we are talking about Tsiolkovsky, the most obvious artifact is the auditory tube.  Konstantin Eduardovich, due to illness in childhood, had hearing problems and was forced to use a special auditory tube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ed/78a/b22/8ed78ab22d8e4fc9a523a42078b1560a.jpg"><br><br>  Historical fact - Korolev was repressed and at least twice survived miraculously.  Therefore, the exhibition has his camp mug, the only thing he brought from Kolyma.  On the right is the Queen's glove, which he wore in 1946 in Kapustin Yar, creating the first Soviet ballistic missiles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a46/0be/8ed/a460be8ed1374fa7880e8f15d344a13b.jpg"><br><br>  And this stand is dedicated to the sculptor Anatoly Grigoriev, who was fond of cosmism, and in 1948 he was arrested in the case of the ‚ÄúSoviet Theosophical Society‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/bed/449/25ebed4499454a55bd7e1dc05e42cc96.jpg"><br><br>  Model of a spacecraft designed by Tsiolkovsky.  In this project, there was a brilliant guess; oxygen and hydrogen, the most efficient of the available, were offered as fuel for the ship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa5/493/b7d/aa5493b7d0dd4c64a92a68384fedc92f.jpg"><br><br>  Historical document - Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers on the establishment of the Committee on Rocket Technology: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/944/200/3109442001434a3bb094586865468be5.jpg"><br><br>  A pair of curious exhibits.  A letter of a 42-year-old collective farmer who wants to fly into space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/434/5dd/894/4345dd894f27467a87cf50c59717b158.jpg"><br><br>  A bottle of champagne, which stands on the stand with photos of SP  The Queen has the following story (as presented by B. E. Chertok): <br><br><blockquote>  Humanity admired us and all Soviet people were proud, not knowing our names.  But we did not grumble about it.  ‚ÄúOur feat,‚Äù the JV said, ‚Äúis appreciated not only by humanity, but also by a rich French winemaker.  He announced that he would give a thousand bottles of champagne to those who show the opposite side of the moon.  He was sure that we would fail, and he was not afraid of risk.  But after losing, he kept his word.  True, there was a hitch.  The winemaker appealed to our embassy in Paris with a request to inform whose address to send champagne to.  The embassy was confused and requested the Foreign Ministry.  After multi-tiered approvals, the Foreign Ministry gave instructions to send bottles to the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences.  Now we are honored to receive several dozen bottles of champagne from the warehouse of the Academy of Sciences.  You will get a couple of bottles, the rest will disperse among the apparatus and other uncomplicated. ‚Äù  We have slandered a lot about this.  But still bring home French champagne in the evening to the family meeting of the New Year, received as a gift for the Moon - agree that this is not given to everyone. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2e/5d5/5e7/d2e5d55e7bde4db1879060296142fa27.jpg"><br><br>  On the wall with posters there are a couple more rare <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cd/a57/b6f/5cda57b6fd574636b9794bfb36f3388a.jpg"><br><br>  Then begin the exhibits associated with the first flights into space.  Titov's movie camera (he was the first to film from orbit). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02f/12b/d49/02f12bd4968243aebf31ff5b05a1ba03.jpg"><br><br>  Costume Tereshkova. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/302/e0a/b8a302e0ab1d47c295fca3d16cff6c1e.jpg"><br><br>  Drawing Leonov, made in orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/92f/bf2/0e592fbf2a5a4f7cb436b08a680a8a67.jpg"><br><br>  Two things struck me in technical exhibits.  First, the cabin "Voskhod-1".  Yes, I knew with my mind that in the "ball" of the "East" for one person they managed to stuff three.  But when you see this cockpit with your own eyes, there is a feeling that even Tirion Lannister with Miles Vorkosigan would be cramped there, not to mention the three Soviet cosmonauts "no more than 170 cm tall." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/91d/70f/0e591d70f74946f8837e6d6a4bde6f87.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the farthest cradle - legs will rest against the dashboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07b/903/7a2/07b9037a25e04ab48fe9c5a4de0c6118.jpg"><br><br>  The second surprising thing is the Tereshkova descent vehicle (Vostok-6).  It is known that Gagarin was blocked in flight, in case he suddenly went insane.  After his flight, it became clear that this protection measure is excessive.  But all subsequent astronauts flew with the code lock turned off - if the project is approved, they will no longer change it, even if this combination lock is not needed.  Here it is, on the top of the left dashboard, six buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f0/365/0c6/5f03650c66014227b69d4296c8db679d.jpg"><br><br>  Not a very common angle - the cosmic thermal protection of the Vostok was in the form of hexagons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0e/083/21e/d0e08321e59246b4afafcdd8f19e256f.jpg"><br><br>  It also seems that Raikin said: ‚Äúa person strives to inhale pure oxygen, and to exhale all kinds of muck‚Äù.  Astronauts are no exception.  And in the closed volume of the cabin with this filth, something must be done.  And besides the obvious carbonic acid, a person still exhales water vapor.  If it is not removed from the atmosphere of the ship, then soon all surfaces will be covered with dew.  And this is not only unpleasant, but also can be deadly because of the risk of a short circuit.  Therefore, on all manned ships, the atmosphere is also dried.  Here is the drying unit of the Voskhod ship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9f/d6a/c43/a9fd6ac4331f4c958a126cd2a0bd7d3a.jpg"><br><br>  At the exhibition there are several more seemingly unremarkable boxes, without which the flight is impossible.  Here is an installation that absorbs carbon dioxide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/344/381/7c8/3443817c859e4e43a9bd537a657f191c.jpg"><br><br>  Boris Volynov's loading suit, obviously, from Soyuz-21.  From these experiments, the Penguin loading suit, which is used now on the ISS, has grown <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/546/950/3b9/5469503b91ea49aab1fe93cda2f6281f.jpg"><br><br>  Installation for moving and maneuvering astronaut 21KS.  American MMU flights are widely known, but the USSR had a similar program, according to which in 1990 they even performed two tests in space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/268/505/561/26850556102b4188a61bd5b29ffec6da.jpg"><br><br>  Space suit of the Mars-500 isolation experiment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd0/9d3/157/bd09d31578354f31bb289e0f24ebd083.jpg"><br><br>  The whole wall is dedicated to Galina Balashova, our space designer ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIVF1oErUhlg">film about her</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a0/715/2f4/9a07152f425f4e0596dfaa9d6f46df50.jpg"><br><br>  Phantom dummy to study the effects of cosmic radiation on humans.  The official name is ‚ÄúFM-2‚Äù, but, probably, it would be more correct to call it ‚ÄúHello, Yura!‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/92a/254/72992a254e0f409f938fbd2f20642def.jpg"><br><br>  The "Union" has a periscope for docking - "Vizir special astronaut."  The periscope is reset before entering the dense layers of the atmosphere, but part of it remains on the descent vehicle.  It is interesting to see how it looks from the outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd2/d5c/9c5/cd2d5c9c518f4782a7ad7d049ecf468a.jpg"><br><br>  Dashboard "Soyuz-T" ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278298/">modifications "Unions" here</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/979/9c4/729/9799c472945b40d295ed29ac028e3170.jpg"><br><br>  Pressure chamber.  Space technology helps people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/e07/c7e/adee07c7e1e847c980b9030f02137790.jpg"><br><br>  "Lunokhod" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cb/23d/2d5/5cb23d2d5a464bc19dc243f1d3b54daf.jpg"><br><br>  The descent vehicle "Venus-7".  This station managed to make a soft landing in the hellish conditions of pressure of one hundred atmospheres and temperatures of 500 ¬∞ C. For example, the parachute had to be made of glass nitron.  Nitron (an acrylic version) in the process of landing burned out, and the device went down on glass filaments.  Glass was used in the descent vehicle - fiberglass, glass wool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77c/85f/349/77c85f3497704d32bf3d00b72fe87e1d.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the last room.  There is only one exhibit in it - the LK-3 lunar landing module.  Because of the limitations on the payload of the H-1 lunar rocket in the apparatus, they made many compromises.  The crew of LK-3 was supposed to be only one person, so we see only one porthole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce2/38f/9c3/ce238f9c327f4a41b8ecebc4615dc649.jpg"><br><br>  The docking unit was without an internal manhole - in order to return to the ship flying to Earth, the astronaut would have to climb into it through open space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/4d9/930/2cb4d993003b4514b03457e405da12dd.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, some solutions seem redundant.  For example, there are visible special engines, which were supposed to press the ship to the surface in case of landing on a slope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44f/0e7/b67/44f0e7b677f54bc1998b0105cb8541fd.jpg"><br><br>  The sealed unit of the instrument cluster is not very happy to us ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a84/d36/017/a84d36017b4a432bbf40c3d774006bca.jpg"><br><br>  But in general, the hall is very impressive.
