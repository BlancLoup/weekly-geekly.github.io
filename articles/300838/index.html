      <br>
      Explicit underestimation is just a part of my life. <br><br>  Whatever I do, to those who see me for the first time, the usual seems extraordinary, and going beyond the usual - and completely impossible.  It cannot be that I make the same contribution to society as everyone else. <br><br>  This is not just a conclusion I made.  That is what I was told straight to the face.  People treat me like this because of the white cane in my hands - a sign informing others about the weakness of my sight. <br><br>  The most significant was the incident that occurred to me when I went to college for an early lecture.  A man entered the bus and sat down next to me.  He asked how I was doing, I answered the way politeness dictates, and then I asked him a similar question. <br><br>  His answer was: ‚ÄúIt was better.  I just got out of jail. ‚Äù <br><br>  From this point on, the dialogue went downhill.  He said that he was ready to "put on himself a cross," "consider everything lost," "commit suicide." <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">And then he honestly and openly declared to me that ‚Äúlooking at you and understanding how terrible your life is, I cannot lay hands on myself, you inspired me, showing that there is someone who is much worse than me.‚Äù</font> </h3><br>  I was traveling by bus to the university, where I was studying, and he, having just left the prison, was going to God knows where!  I had a bitter lump in my throat. <br><br>  Without hesitation and doubt, I was incredibly underestimated, and my life was reduced to a tiny fragment of what it really was.  And all this - because of one small detail! <br><br>  Hearing the word "prejudice", people automatically present the worst example of condemnation of the other and immediately classify themselves as "innocent".  ‚ÄúWe in no way underestimate or discriminate other people in the sense that the word‚Äú prejudice ‚Äùcarries!‚Äù <br><br>  However, in Mariam Webster's dictionary, this concept is simply defined as <b>‚Äúbaseless negative attitude or sympathy, formed prior to receiving meaningful information.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  It is extremely easy for a person to pick up one small fact about another and immediately begin to underestimate him, without even realizing it.  Therefore, so many of us do not receive due recognition due to circumstances beyond our control.  Here are some examples. <br><ul><li>  You occupy a lower position, have no experience in your field and at the same time continue to learn and develop. </li><li>  You are in the process of changing jobs and in constant search. </li><li>  You are young or unmarried, or your financial situation is precarious, and you are expecting a child. </li><li>  You have a physical or mental disability. </li><li>  You have chosen a career that, in the opinion of the rest of the world, does not bring income. </li></ul><br>  Even despite the fact that you are undoubtedly an incredibly valuable and talented person, one of these small circumstances can belittle you in the eyes of others. <br><br>  Yes, the basic advice for people who find themselves in a situation where others are making negative comments about them is simply not to listen to the others.  But if day after day we are told that we are lower than it actually is, it can be difficult to follow. <br><br>  I know what it feels like to be undervalued.  I am familiar with the feeling that the results that can be expected of me are underestimated without any hesitation. <br><br>  However, I learned several lessons from the state of eternal non-recognition and in many ways I learned to withstand the pressure of this burden. <br><br>  So, for those who are underestimated due to circumstances beyond your control: I hope these very feasible steps will help you just as they helped me. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Know your own worth</font> </h2><br>  This is the easiest and simplest step you can take to get rid of the negative things that are destroying you.  However, this is one of the most difficult for the present implementation of the points in practice.  If people say that we are not as significant as we think of ourselves, then they can easily be believed. <br><br>  You need to purposefully and consciously remind yourself how valuable you really are.  Here are some ways to make this abstract, but necessary step. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Compliment yourself</font> </h2><br>  Hearing a negative review in your address, block it with a positive. <br><br>  Make yourself compliments, looking in the mirror.  Praise yourself in the morning before leaving the house.  Support yourself by bringing to the fore consciousness of qualities that make you unique and priceless. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Remind yourself of your reasons for pride.</font> </h2><br>  No matter how insignificant they may seem.  If in the past you did something that you can be proud of, or are now engaged in <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">helping to move forward</a> , then such achievements should demonstrate this: one small circumstance due to which you are underestimated is not so important if you really to figure everything out. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Show self esteem</font> </h2><br>  That's what I'm talking about: move confidently, choose your wardrobe wisely, do everything as well as your abilities allow.  And as a result, your self-esteem will increase dramatically. <br><br>  Besides, it will be harder for people to underestimate you if you look <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kak-nalazhivat-svyazi-slovno-vy-deystvitelno-znaete-chto-delaete/">like you know what you are doing</a> .  At first it may seem that you only imitate such behavior, but believe me, you will not have to pretend for a long time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Enlighten understanding</font> </h2><br>  Like any absolutely blind person, something extremely important became clear to me: many people are simply ignorant or incorrectly informed.  They have never before encountered those who do not see, and therefore do not know anything about them. <br><br>  If I start to communicate with them, tell my story, show that I am a person like everyone else, many of them have a much better opinion of me and my abilities. <br><br>  Everyone has a story, and healing can lurk in openness and willingness to share it.  Whether it is a family member, friend or stranger, whom you see for the first time in your life, you always have a chance to show him an unknown perspective. <br><br>  You do not need to talk about your life to everyone you meet, but misinformation and lack of understanding play a huge role in underestimating those around you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Surround yourself with like-minded people</font> </h2><br>  I am talking about people whom you can tell about your frustrations;  about those who help you overcome difficulties when <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/5-sposobov-obshheniya-s-pytayushhimisya-podavit-vas-lyudmi-v-perelomnye-momenty-zhizni/">others want to crush you</a> . <br><br>  In my opinion, this step is the key to maintaining a positive in my life.  I already had to communicate with people who could or could not see me as such a person as I see myself.  So why should I strive to go home and relive it again or to invite such a negative in my own life? <br><br>  Sometimes it is the <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-sposobov-spravitsya-s-toksichnymi-chlenami-semi/">people who surround you most often that</a> show the understatement: family, friends, colleagues. <br>  I know for some of you this may be the most difficult moment.  That is why it is so important to find a narrow circle of the closest people who can support you in any situation.  It should include those who encourage you and stay close, who want to lift your spirit, and not spoil your mood. <br><br>  I promise you that if you find such a group, even with a clear lack of due recognition, its members will help you maintain mental health.  Common sense and readiness to meet new people and make contacts is really all you need to communicate with others on a deeper and more complete level of understanding. <br><br>  Join a group of like-minded people, for example, a group of meditation or yoga, an intuition development class, a writers club, or somewhere else where you can feel support and spiritual intimacy.  Starting to meet people, be ready to open up in front of them and tell them at least something.  They, like you, came here in search of communication, and therefore sincerity and sincerity will generate trust. <br><br>  Such a relationship does not occur in one day, so that results appear, work and consistency will be needed.  But if you have a desire to communicate, then people at the deepest level will understand or feel this and will begin to reciprocate you.  Such relationships can turn into the most full-fledged relationships that can help you overcome low expectations and negative. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Prove that they are wrong</font> </h2><br>  People who underestimate you think they know something that you don't know about yourself for some reason.  However, the home advantage is on your side: you know more about yourself than anyone else. <br><ul><li>  You know your true price. </li><li>  You know the position from which most people speak. </li><li>  You know that you can communicate with someone who will cheer you up. </li></ul><br>  And in the end, you are the only one who has plans for your life.  You are the only one who knows about your success and that you are going to develop it. <br><br>  So, you are the only one who can step by step and keep moving forward even when, in the opinion of the others, you should stop immediately.  You are the only one who can prove that they are wrong. <br><br>  And finally, you are the one responsible.  No matter what others say or think, it is you who choose your life and your way. <br><br>  If you know your own worth and continue to move forward, if you understand the mentality of the people around you and lean on your loved ones who love you, then soon you will see changes in the perception of those you meet on your life path and in yourself. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - the <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/nauka-o-tom-kak-razvit-duxovnuyu-stojkost-v-rabote-i-v-zhizni/">science of how to develop spiritual endurance in work and in life</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300838/</a></p>
