      So, I propose my fundamental research of the problem to the scientific community.  Below you will find a small atlas of these fantastic creatures, their characteristic signs and ways of their destruction of the working process, as well as safety rules, antidotes and other methods of neutralization during design work. <br><br><h3>  Cockroaches Corporate (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Plant in large corporations, in small companies take root poorly.  Cockroaches need to run a lot and approve re-approval of agreed approvals.  Maximum movements with negative benefits. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  It is necessary to understand, there is generally anyone alive, or just cockroaches.  If only insects, then the project will not move anywhere, and hoping for some changes for the better is inappropriate.  If, apart from cockroaches, someone else is doing things, then somehow you can go, but with pain. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Science does not know large companies without Corporate Cockroaches.  If you want without them, then work in small ones.  Cockroaches devour your enthusiasm, job satisfaction, good mood, and the meaning and benefit of the entire project.  Constantly take tests for the content of these components in your life.  If it catastrophically falls, you need to move in the direction of places with a lower concentration of corporate insects.  Do not have time to look back, as it turns out that writing reports and other meaningless actions take 80% or more of your working time.  Do you grow as a specialist, get experience?  What have you learned?  Reports to write? <br><br><h3>  Kiso Kislomordoye (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  It is found everywhere: both among customers and clients, and in your team.  Kiso on the client side is dissatisfied with the quality, timing, price, sales, contract, service.  Kiso in a team is dissatisfied with your qualifications, your salary, your position.  Often whine and complains about you: the boss, lawyers, procurers, colleagues.  In the spring, as well as during the menstrual cycles, X10 can be added to aggression and X100 to toxicity.  Menstrual cycles are pronounced in both female and male individuals.  After a vacation or payment of bonuses, it happens that Kiso will gloom a couple of days, but do not be deceived by this. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Only one Kiso on the side of the customer, customer or management can poison your project so much that the whole team will run away or go into the binge, or die from exhaustion on the 1024th revision, and the office will go bankrupt. <br>  If the team Kiso one, then it is dangerous no more intestinal parasites.  And if there are several individuals in a team, run from there into the night, only carpet bombing will save the situation. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  There are people who believe that they can scratch Kiso Kislomordoe behind the ear.  Recent randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown that all of these are indigenous beliefs and nothing more.  The so-called earballs walk usually traversing, tortured and poisoned.  Best of all toxic kitty dismissed as soon as possible.  If you do not have such an opportunity, then try mi-mi-zirovat communication.  If this does not work, then it is necessary that Kiso Kislomordoye was sitting in a cage of rigid rules and agreements.  As soon as approaching - immediately current! <br><br><h3>  Sporun Violet (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Often found in freelancing and small companies.  Since corporations require individuals with good ability to lizoblyudstvu, Sporun Vyatlovidniy badly takes root and reproduces in such conditions. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Sporun Datalid, unfortunately, is a dangerous catalyst for the toxicity of other more poisonous species.  If you have a toxicological vivarium in your project, then Sporun can take care of other creatures, give them unprecedented inspiration, with the result that the project will rot right before our eyes. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Sporun Vintur is dangerous only for fauna with thin skin.  Obsolete individuals with a thick viscous outer cover quite easily pull it onto the globe by slowly and consistently inserting a finger into the anus during a public choral reading of technical assignments and other documents line by line.  Once stretched Sporun for some time is easily stopped, even with a transparent hint of repeated line-by-line administration.  There is a positive effect: other poisonous reptiles, watching the massacre of Sporun, temporarily lose a fair share of toxicity and even try to enroll in peacekeepers. <br><br><h3>  Oskorblyan Ordinary (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Oskorblyan is Kiso Kislomordogo's satellite - the latter takes inspiration from it.  See Kiso?  Soon you will see and offended.  Sometimes these two grow together and produce disgustingly toxic creature.  However, usually, Kiso disdains, therefore keeps a distance. <br>  Oskorblyan must throw in, otherwise he does not feel necessary.  Do not call a spade a spade, so to speak.  You wrote not according to GOST!  Obviously, you did not study in a technical university!  Yes, you probably never worked with normal customers!  Yes, you just do not know modern techniques!  Yes, you are not just innovative! <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Oskorblyana prot change horses during the change of horses due to the general worthlessness and disrepair.  As a result, the ends are not found.  Who was doing what?  Who were these people?  Probably, archaeologists will sometime tell us about this, but not earlier than Oskorblyan will be drank from the project, because archaeologists ... What are these archaeologists?  It's just some kind of grave diggers! <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Do not argue with Oskorblyan!  Even if you really, really want to!  For this there is Sporun Dyatlovidny, let them have fun, and we will work a little while they are both busy. <br>  It is better to ask him, and what does he mean by the word GOST and the word ‚Äúyo!‚Äù.  It is clear that ‚ÄúFuuu!  You, here, do not even know such simple things!  And we came here to learn! ‚ÄùWell, but still?  And here it turns out that Oskorblyan is a fizruk by education ... <br><br><h3>  Lizobud Unusual (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  It has a long slippery tongue that can penetrate even into the most tight sphincters of the boss.  On the one hand, it moves on the smell of money and nishtyakov, on the other hand, the Unbelievable Lizobylu can be found even in extremely nischebrodskih regions - apparently, he stuck his tongue at the test and got stuck. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Blocks feedback from the team to the leader, turning it into sugar and sticky honey.  Two or three assholes, and the intoxicated top-manager is no longer capable of anything.  Excellent cohabitation with corporate cockroaches, in his mucus, they crawl even more slowly. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Well, what can I say?  Keep the anus shut!  If you do not relax under hypnosis and demand it, then it turns out that the Unsurprised Lyzoblyudy are usually quite able-bodied. <br><br><h3>  Redirector Irresponsible (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  It is found in the manual.  Evolves from the Unusual Lizoblyud.  Since he does not have a developed brain, he is forced to use the mental abilities of those around him.  He quickly remembers other people's ‚Äúclever words‚Äù and begins to broadcast them in conversation with others almost verbatim, which may lead to temporary confusion of a specialist and even make him believe in his professionalism.  The poorly developed brain is compensated by a hypertrophied chuyka.  The redirector instantly and accurately catches the slightest changes in the mood of the top management, and any flaws, if they do happen, will be smoothed out with their nimble wet tongue. <br>  It is possible to correctly recognize the Redirector by emails and messages in the messenger with one link (without context), a screenshot or at best, accompanied by one word: ‚ÄúLook !!!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Redirector Irresponsible eating your work time just on an industrial scale.  As the name implies, he adores redirection: letters, tables, estimates, documents - without any indication of what is required of you, and then redirect your answer to someone else.  At the same time, he manages to quarrel two employees who are about each other neither in sleep nor in spirit.  In a monstrous stream of spam, an important introductory message from the client will inevitably sink from him, which he will send in one link or file without comments, which you will find out at the final look at the project.  But you cannot make him responsible for this fact, since he immediately forwarded everything - what complaints could there be to him?  The forwarding channel is by mood: today is the instant messenger, tomorrow is the mail, the day after tomorrow is SMS.  The e-mail address of the Redirector is at least four: from ‚ÄúEleonora Zanzibarovna Zabodayskaya - Eastern Europe‚Äù to ‚ÄúKisik-Murlysik‚Äù - it sends from everyone. <br>  A client-side redirector is able to bring you to a heart attack.  For example, send you a screenshot of the chat with a colleague, from which it may seem that your product is a complete shit.  But in the process it turns out that the Redirector considers a fool armless colleague, not you. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  The way of dealing with the Redirector has been used in the army and other power structures for a long time and with taste: I received a redirect - forwards it further.  A link to analysts, a screenshot to designers, a table to financiers.  From a selective mate on the other side it will be possible, without delving into it, to understand what it was.  Impatient: ‚ÄúI looked? !!‚Äù - we answer vaguely: ‚ÄúI have set the task!‚Äù <br>  If you love your team and colleagues, you will have to select a separate junior who will filter spam from important tasks.  Although it is still a redirect. <br>  Toxicity is aggravated by the fact that you yourself can become a redirector: either gnaw and cry yourself, or mutate. <br><br><h3>  Infernal procrastinator (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  He lives under the skin of engineers, developers, designers, konfetschiki and art directors. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Very contagious, transmitted during meetings, as well as through mail and instant messengers.  He is often carried by Lizobud in his dirty tongue and corporate cockroaches with dirty paws.  It leads to despondency with breaks in production conflicts and non-payment under contracts. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Quarantined and whipped with a belt!  However, in the presence of the omnipresent cockroaches and the all-pervading Lizoublya - it is almost useless.  Only a strong team helps, in which members infected with the Prokrastinator Infernal members begin to glow with phosphorus, which leads to a temporary pupation of the parasite until the next deadline. <br><br><h3>  Handless suitcase (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  It is found in every company without exception.  Likes moist key points where it becomes temporarily indispensable.  Protects them by the principle of a dog not hay. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  In order for something to somehow move, you need to walk and beg.  If you beg wrongly, you get offended; if you don‚Äôt beg, you get offended; if you beg too hard, you get offended; if you beggard too little, you get offended.  At the same time, which is doubly surprising, it does not tolerate Lizoblyuds. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  At some point, you realize that it is easier to do yourself than to handle.  Do not be afraid of problems with delegation, you can safely resist this temptation.  Make a job for him once, a second, and then take the pissing rags and drive the brat out of use. <br><br><h3>  Prostun Achotakovy (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  As a rule, it is found among linear executives by hands and junior executives, as well as freelancers.  On the territory of the senior management of the client is effectively destroyed by lawyers and other departments of the Ministry of Standards and Prohibitions.  However, in small companies can grow to the degrees of well-known ... <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  The danger of this parasite is that it can be asymptomatic and, if lucky, without any consequences.  But if you are unlucky, the project may have a department, or even the whole company will receive harm incompatible with life.  For example, in the form of sources dumped in public in which the cloud of client money is enclosed.  Well, what? <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Be safe!  In fact, any harmless animal may turn out to be Prostun, so even the cutest attractive face should be forced to sign an NDA, undergo training, take exams in life safety and undergo other circles of the introductory hell.  Of course, it will poison the life of the rest of the team (this is another danger of Prostun - he definitely exists somewhere!), So hell must be heated in proportion to the size of what can be lost at once, otherwise the whole team will run away from you. <br><br><h3>  Perfectionism Non-Resilient (toxicity: ‚ò£‚ò£) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Dwells in ... another department, so be it!  Sometimes, in the accounting department ... Now I will explain: ‚ÄúWe will not sign your certificate of completion, because on one of the screenshots of the hundred screens that we asked you to insert into the accounting documents, we noticed unevenly standing buttons!  Please check all the screens for button flatness and arphographic errors! ‚Äù(Author's spelling is preserved).  And it can not be influenced in any way!  He is in another department! <br>  Also often this reptile settles in the individual customer. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  And happiness was so close!  Some 90 days of postponement of payment under the contract, and the money should have come to your account ... But instead, the art director, layout designer, account manager, courier, secretary, mobile developer ... leave the company under the ‚ÄúFarewell Slavyanka‚Äù march ... Yes and you yourself with them.  Why live like this? <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  First page!  I beg you, with a microscope, check the first page!  Fortunately, Perfectionism is only enough for the first page, so if everything is perfect in it, then there is a great chance to slip.  But if you have a single typo in the whole project, and it is, of course, on the first page, then you will be thrown documents in the face, the layout (PDF and web interface are also thrown - do not hesitate!) With the wording: ‚ÄúThere are solid school mistakes!  Where, look for yourself!  How could you pass the project without even bothering to read it ?!  I will not watch anything else until I check everything thoroughly! ‚Äù <br>  True, there are especially fierce critters who read everything, and only a secateur will help here. <br><br><h3>  Itaksoydun Mountain (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  It is found at nuclear power plants, many copies in the army, in the navy, in construction and of course in IT. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  If somewhere through ‚ÄúF‚Äù we sometimes have ... The crust has been torn off, and under it is the Itaksoidunov family with Lizoblyadami and Sporun, and corporate cockroaches hiss at you.  You think: ‚ÄúHere, crooked, but it worked!  And why did I get there ?! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  It is recommended to plant Itaksojduna together with Kiso Kislomorda or Perficionismus in the hope that the first will become a little less crooked, and the other two will make a decisive apoptosis. <br><br><h3>  Reschedule Handy (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Most often found in sales departments and near habitats of top management.  It is easy to recognize him by the uterine chorus: ‚ÄúComfortable, convenient!  Are you comfortable?  Everyone is comfortable!  Convenient-convenient!  Wonderful! ‚ÄùAnd appearance - he always looks contented, even with an aspen stake in his side. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Like many poisonous species, it feeds on your working time, but, unlike most of them, it does the greatest harm to plans and pipelines, because it loves to move something from place to place, and then change its mind and return it.  Most of all she likes to postpone meetings, convened and meetings.  At the same time, he sincerely believes that it is convenient for everyone, and you are just an egoist, since you do not care about universal convenience. <br>  Dressure does not respond - science knows no cases of successful training of individuals of this species to report on transference in advance.  It was not even possible to teach Transfer to simply cancel the appointments he had appointed - they themselves break down in the process of constant transfers, simultaneously burying your working day completely. <br>  And still Transfer very much like to transfer buttons.  Here, you used the service, attachment or some other tool for a year or two, got used to it, and poke into the right buttons without looking.  And then hop!  - an update from where it was not expected.  And there is no your button.  And where is she?  Shifting moved to make it easier for you. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  So far, it is known about one way to influence the Transfer of the Convenient - to scream at him: ‚ÄúNo, it is NOT convenient for me!‚Äù.  It does not save from the transfer, but he grumbles: ‚ÄúConveniently convenient‚Äù - it is no longer so loud and annoying. <br><br><h3>  Investurus Promise (toxicity:) </h3><br>  <b>Habitat and habits:</b> <br>  Astral creature that exists in deep space.  From time to time, it condenses into the physical body in London or, at worst, in New York and flies to your city for a few hours, so it considers that you should drop everything right now and run into his sticky arms. <br>  Hypnotizes you with the essence of dough, the sounds of obsession with the topic you are interested in, hallucinations of incredible global success with it.  Every time it shuts off your brain somehow in a new way, and you inexplicably spend three to four working hours for a cake and a cup of coffee.  Out of politeness, you still decide to ‚Äúcount‚Äù, and Investor Promisekus dissolves without a trace in the air until the next lunar eclipse. <br><br>  <b>Implications for the project:</b> <br>  Investurus is parasitic for a minute of weakness and an unconscious desire to solve the problems of the project with a wave of a magic wand, and not with hard work, resourcefulness and ingenuity.  It slows down the acceptance of inevitability and postpones the right steps for business development.  It feeds false hopes.  However, this can also be a positive effect in the form of anger and a desire to ‚Äúshow them all what they missed‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Ways of protection:</b> <br>  Immediately talk to him about the money and ask to pay for the work done.  If you are trying to pretend to be a partner, say that you give partner prices - for your customers it is much more expensive.  From this Investurus Promisekus immediately sad and the next time will appear in a much longer period of time.  But there will be a must! <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  As you may have guessed, I am a seasoned toxo-zoologist, and I have seen a lot in my lifetime: I had to drastically drape from the feral menstrual Kisa and write TK in a bank teeming with Corporate Cockroaches among the sly tongues of Lizyoblyud who felt me ‚Äã‚Äãin all places. <br>  They even had to enter into an unequal battle with Oskorblyan, the Redirector and Sporun. <br>  But you know what I tell you.  Chin up!  The project will collapse, and you still live and live.  Take care of yourself! <br><br>  In my traveling bag, along with a gas mask, there are such antidotes: <br>  1. Poisonous creatures fear TK as fire.  Read my article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315046/">"Without TK</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315046/">"</a> <br>  2. The clarity of the TK will add X10 to the resilience: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320476/">"High Definition TK"</a> will help you. <br>  3. What happens in the poisoned Oskorblyan and other dangerous types of team, I wrote here: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/327126/">"How to get rid of smart employees in your company"</a> <br><br><h3>  UPD: New species proposed in the comments: </h3><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Sudimus Psychologius</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Napoleonic Inventor</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Such shitty dudes</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Prostrastiatus Boltologicheskaya.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">(tox. 1b.)</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Ethilophil Duncardic (tox. 3b.)</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Meditates Soon</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Proto Junior Fearful Repentant</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">Nostradamus Nephew Toxicity 1-2 units.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435792/</a></p>
