  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TOP 10 ICO 2018 Q3 (voting)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As we all know, the year 2018 has become a really difficult time for the cryptocurrency market, the more difficult it has become for investing in ICO.  It was painful to see this steady recession, which was marked by a significant decrease in market capitalization around the world and the apparent dominance of BTC. <br><br>  For the ICO world, such changes meant that investors were unwilling to take big risks, which meant little investment on their part and greater alertness towards the cryptocurrency market.  Ultimately, all this led to a prolonged main sales, as well as to a small or low profit when exchanging cryptocurrency on exchanges. <br><br>  However, many ICOs managed to show exceptionally positive results in 2018.  A great example of such achievements are Zilliqa, Ontology, ArcBlock, Nucleus Vision and Bluezelle and these are not all platforms that could be on this list.  Receiving 1000% of profit is still quite achievable, but only if investment is approached wisely.  Considering all this, I analyzed in detail all the good ones - and also weed out all the bad and really worthless ICOs, paying attention to which of them are the most popular, which of these projects try to interact with their audience to the maximum, which of them uses the most advanced technologies, or has an excellent white paper at its disposal (or with a technical description of the project), or it has the potential to create something unique.  The result of the works was a short list of 10 ICOs, which - despite the fact that they only "loom on the horizon" - managed to really impress us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We strongly recommend that you use this list as a preparatory platform, after reading which you can begin your own analysis regarding each of the projects listed below.  In drawing up the list, we did not set ourselves the task of somehow advising you on financial matters.  If you are planning to invest in ICO, we recommend that you thoroughly familiarize yourself with the white paper and other details of the projects, as well as interact with its members.  In the event of even the slightest uncertainty about something, you can write to the ICT program in the Telegram to clarify questions to which you could not find the answers.

      Investing in an ICO is quite a risky business that requires immediate action and as a result can bring a large income, with the right approach. <br><br>  Without further words, go to our list. <br><br><h2>  Blockcloud </h2><br>  Blockcloud is a project that has set itself the task of making a real sensation in the field of the Internet of Things (from the Internet of Things, IoT).  Its goal is to become a scalable solution for the growing IoT industry, with an incentive system for participants, service providers and miners. <br><br>  The Blockcloud team plans to use the SCN solution (from the English. Service-Centric Networking - service-oriented architecture), which can be attributed to the concept of web 3.0, built on the use of service names instead of the addresses of web resources.  Considering the blockchain protocol used, this platform will be able to provide a safe and smooth connection of network providers to user devices.  Millions of devices will forever get rid of connectivity problems by interacting autonomously with no loss in speed.  It is also worth noting another important factor: due to the fact that the demand in this industry is constantly growing, as well as the fact that an increasing number of devices are becoming interconnected, the scaling of this system can be carried out really effectively. <br><br>  Despite the fact that their plans and the range of applied technologies are not as wide and ambitious as in the case of Skynet, nevertheless this project has a strong team that has an incredible technical potential and vast experience in the field of IoT.  Considering the fact that approximately 80% of the team members came from Oudmon, which is the parent company of IoT, and also taking into account the list of partners and previous contacts with some of the largest Chinese companies, such as Huawei and Alibaba, we are more than sure that this project will be able to realize all the promises. <br><br>  Another important reason why you should pay attention to this platform is the steady mood of the market participants regarding the project and its well-developed community.  At the inception of this ICO, it received a lot of positive feedback from within the web community.  In addition, you will find many discussions circulating within communities, as was the case with the Neon Exchange or Quarkchain at the time of writing the white papers for these projects. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.block-cloud.io/">Website</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.block-cloud.io/whitepaper.shtml">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://metabase.network/">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  Ubex </h2><br>  The next on our list is Ubex - a platform that uses artificial intelligence, was created to increase the relevance and conversion rate of advertising displayed on many online platforms.  The team of this project is confident that the current system - first of all, it concerns advertising on Google Ads - is not capable of efficiently finding target customers, with the result that users see completely irrelevant content.  Ubex intends to change that. <br><br>  By combining blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, the Ubex Ad advertising system aims to eliminate irrelevant content and provide advertisements for a specific product based on the demographic features and requirements of each individual user.  The Ubex team represents such a solution in the correct format, which favors the involvement of the maximum number of participants in this project. <br><br>  The Ubex team is confident that combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence will allow them to collect more accurate data on user habits on the Internet, with the result that advertisements will be distributed based on the individual preferences of a particular person, while platform developers offer to display such advertisements in the most appropriate format .  All this should lead to greater interest on the part of users, and, of course, to an increase in the profit from business advertising. <br><br>  The Ubex platform will include the approaches used in Ethereum: it is planned to use smart contracts to link advertising costs to specific actions as an alternative to the traditional PPC method (Pay per click).  By applying smart contracts between the host and the advertiser, a predefined contractual agreement will be created.  In this case, the payment will be charged for specific actions, which will provide a more accurately customizable method of measuring conversion. <br><br>  The cost of the advertising industry on the Internet is estimated at approximately $ 83 billion, while it is expected that by 2021 its value will rise to a staggering figure of $ 129 billion.  Given this, there is no doubt that the market potential is huge.  However, one should not dismiss such giants as Facebook and Google, which are firmly rooted in this area, which will be quite difficult to move from their seats.  Along with this, the Ubex team will also have to try to leave behind existing projects, which include Adex, Papyus, Exchain and Adshares. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, Ubex collected 85% of its Hard-cap (from the English. Maximum amount of funds raised), which is 28,800 ETH, from which it can be concluded that the main sales will begin very soon.  So, the team of this project has tremendous experience, the beta version has already been created, and there is definitely a positive aura around the project itself.  Thus, if Ubex succeeds in proving its value in this market, where the level of competition is more than high, then we expect this project to prove itself only on the positive side. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ubex.com/">Website</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ubex.com/wp/Ubex-Whitepaper-en.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/UbexAI">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  Menlo one </h2><br>  Menlo One is the world's most powerful framework for creating decentralized applications that are comparable to the speed of regular web applications.  The developers of this project claim that the decentralized database and the Proof-of-Reputation incentive system are the infrastructure through which all online stores, social networks and applications based on the development of Web 3.0 technologies will work as quickly and efficiently as their predecessors using a centralized approach. <br><br>  Created using Ethereum, the Menlo One platform provides enhanced data exchange capabilities as well as other automation tools that were previously unavailable.  Together, these developments will solve the fairly common to date problems associated with UX (user experience - with the English client experience), security and compatibility. <br><br>  This framework is used to create a unique site for the sale of tokens, providing complete security, as well as a mechanism for user interaction with each other, which as a result should make cryptocurrency the mainstream in the world of economics. <br><br>  This project is supported by many experts in the field of blockchain technologies, it also has many partners and advisers. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.menlo.one/">ICO Site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://menloone.docsend.com/view/zgf6d4e">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/Menloone">Telegram chat</a> <br><br><h2>  Bravo </h2><br>  BRAVO was launched in 2014 and decided to revolutionize the anonymous payment industry with its mobile payment application.  In 2017, BRAVO was represented on SharkTank at ABC and, as a result, made a deal with Mark Kuban and Lori Greiner.  Since then, they have gained a significant audience with tens of thousands of users and millions of dollars in transactions. <br><br>  BRAVOs plan to achieve global exposure and grow outside the United States, and even more, introduce Blockchain technology and tokenization to ensure anonymous and secure transactions throughout the world;  with minimal fees.  In 2019, BRAVO will release an update, through which you can make transactions using a cryptocurrency (BVO token). <br><br>  BRAVO is one of the few ICO companies in the world that actually has: <br>  Developed business solution.  Less than 9% of ICO came from established enterprises and almost half do not have a product developed before the start of the ICO campaign. <br><br>  <a href="https://bvo.trybravo.com/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://bvo.trybravo.com/BRAVO_Whitepaper_V1.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/BRAVOPay">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  NEX ICO </h2><br>  Neon Exchange (NEX) is a decentralized platform based on the NEO blockchain, which uses a public order matching system for conducting and processing transactions, as well as for performing complex payment transactions (for example, limit orders) that cannot be processed using existing DEX .  NEX will be the first trading platform in which it will interact with NEO, NEO Gas, and also in which its own NEX tokens will be used as basic trading pairs for trading NEP-5 tokens. <br><br>  This platform was developed to combine the advantages of off-line and on-line transactions, thanks to which NEX will allow to process orders paid from electronic wallets not connected to the platform.  In addition to the exchange platform, NEX also provides a payment service and capital management system that will allow third-party smart contracts using NEO tokens to participate in sending and receiving assets. <br><br>  Another feature of NEX will be a new, user-friendly smart wallet in the form of an extension for Chrome, allowing users to store currency that will not be used during the exchange, and which, if necessary, can be used during instant operations.  The ‚ÄúMetaMask + NEON Wallet‚Äù application - a similar characteristic to such an expansion was given by the co-founder of the project Fabio Canesin.  He believes that it will allow users to access cryptocurrency exchange exchanges, without the risk of losing their own tokens. <br><br>  The Neon Exchange is based on the NEX token.  It is planned to release 50 million tokens, the holders of which will make a profit from using the platform‚Äôs payment system and other features of the NEX exchange.  Thus, those who will be engaged in investing in NEX tokens will be able to make a profit on successful operations carried out with the help of this exchange: the more investments in this cryptocurrency will be, the greater the profits will be to its holders. <br><br>  <a href="https://neonexchange.org/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://neonexchange.org/pdfs/whitepaper_v2.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/neonexchange">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  ORCA </h2><br>  ORCA is the first Open-Banking platform designed for users working with cryptocurrencies.  This is a customizable and easy-to-use tool that will become indispensable for conducting operations in the world of crypto-economy for both beginners and people with considerable experience with cryptocurrency.  ORCA uses the advantages of Open-Banking for the innovative integration of fiat bank accounts with e-wallets for cryptocurrencies.  A convenient toolbar will help users link several bank accounts to a single account.  Flexible design solutions will allow you to customize the toolbar to meet the needs of each individual user, while to optimize personal finance management, ORCA uses intelligent analysis algorithms that provide personalized assistance in conducting operations.  Moreover, ORCA users will be able to access the most relevant services associated with the world of cryptocurrencies.  It should be noted that all these features will be available through a single platform, just as it is implemented in the Apple App Store and Google Play.  To meet all the individual needs of App Center users, the ORCA platform provides a wide range of reliable third-party applications for conducting cryptocurrency operations.  Payment cards for cryptocurrency, trading bots, credit services, insurance, and many other features are available in the App Center platform, whose list of services is constantly expanding.

Thus, the combination of ORCA tokens, internal cryptocurrency exchange solutions and integrated into the API platform eliminates the need for any other cryptocurrency assets.  The availability of ORCA tokens guarantees you access to all the benefits of the crypto economy. <br><br>  <a href="https://orcaalliance.eu/en/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://orcaalliance.eu/docs/ORCA_WP_07.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/ORCAalliance">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  Incremint.io </h2><br>  Incremint can be used for any transaction (cryptocurrency trading, holding a crowdfunding campaign, buying goods), in which the parties want to be sure that all the preliminary conditions of such a transaction will be met before the electronic money changes its owner.  Incremint facilitates successful digital transactions of its customers through the following approaches: establishing trust relationships between the parties to the transaction (for example, between a start-up team and tokens holders, a buyer and a supplier, etc.);  Encouraging the parties to fulfill their duties (fulfilling the conditions stipulated before the transfer of digital money);  Contribute to increasing user confidence and understanding of projects selling cryptocurrency or seeking investment;  provision of a decentralized dispute resolution system;  ensuring the fixation of decisions and guaranteeing access to them within the public blockchain. <br><br>  Incremint's mission is to support the growth and development of the primary coin supply market (ICO), which is expressed in a more efficient distribution of the interests of issuers and cryptocurrency buyers by minimizing risks and encouraging the parties to openness and transparency.  The Incremint team is confident that many ICOs have a huge potential for financing innovative solutions and finding effective self-regulation mechanisms, which can be viewed as a critical aspect for the world of the primary coin offering and the blockchain-community as a whole. <br><br>  With the help of Incremint, the predetermined part of the funds collected by the issuers of ICO will be deposited before they complete a certain payment stage.  At the end of the ICO, token buyers will vote to authorize the release of the deposited funds if the issuers fulfill their obligations regarding the ICO payment stages.  Incremint will act as a guarantor of the firmness of issuers' intentions to adhere to good practices in building corporate relations, as well as their confidence in their own business plan with which they act in the market.  For buyers of tokens, this approach will mean minimizing the risks associated with investing in an ICO, which should lead to an increase in demand for issuer projects. <br><br>  The founders of this project are experts in the field of finance and law, with an extensive reputation for conducting complex commercial transactions.  Their team effectively combines its practical experience in the field of escrow and financing with the technical competence of its strategic partners. <br><br>  <a href="https://incremint.io/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://incremint.io/pdf/Incremint.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/incremint_en">Telegram</a> <a href="https://t.me/incremint_en"><br></a> <br><h2>  Keplertek </h2><br>  The Keplertek team is developing an international ecosystem for the development of the development and production of AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics.  The Keplertek project includes its own and partner research laboratories, technology parks and other enterprises and online platforms for bringing together developers, investors and customers from around the world. <br><br>  We live in an era that is increasingly influenced by technological advances.  Their roles and meanings in our daily lives are becoming increasingly important and in many cases are inseparable.  The same can be said about the growing influence of corporations, each of which controls a large market share.  Such influence limits the participation of other people in the development of technological solutions, attributing to them the role of ordinary consumers, while all profits are distributed only between corporations. <br><br>  In addition to the production of significant solutions in the field of AI and robotics, the Kepler team set a goal to create a decentralized system for distributing material resources derived from technological breakthroughs in the field of robotization, which will determine the future of all mankind.  Just imagine if the creators of the Internet decided to transfer access to the system of receiving profits to the whole world, instead of granting this right only to corporate organizations whose sole purpose is to accumulate personal material well-being.  Imagine if the Internet looked like a blockchain - a decentralized system - then each user would be able to profit from the information that he shared with others. <br><br>  Anticipating this possibility, supported by current trends, the Kepler steering group creates a fair market economy that will evenly distribute profits among users.  The three pillars on which the Kepler project stands are transparency, accountability and full corporate responsibility.  The management team intends to regularly provide detailed reports on the status and projects of the company at least twice a year. <br><br>  The Kepler team intends to solve one of the main tasks pursuing humanity - to make a technological revolution.  Under the leadership of a reliable technical team consisting of leading scientific minds, Kepler will produce cutting-edge technology, as well as the ways in which these technical innovations will become more accessible and understandable.  In addition, their plans also include the creation of a platform for the development of scientific and technological achievements of the future.  Of course, the Kepler team is well aware that it is one thing to create a revolutionary idea, and quite another to realize it.  That is why the project attracted highly qualified personnel consisting of leading managers, prominent figures in the field of IT and robotics, accountants, as well as experts in the field of jurisprudence and blockchain technologies. <br><br>  <a href="https://keplertek.io/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://keplertek.io/WP/WP-EN.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/HR5jUxKGkD4XY3y1v6Pmow">Telegram</a> <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/HR5jUxKGkD4XY3y1v6Pmow"><br></a> <br><h2>  Akoin </h2><br>  AKoin is a new cryptocurrency from the famous artist Akon, which is the basis of the AKoin Ecosystem - a unique global project that creates opportunities for consumers to buy, hold and spend cryptocurrency directly from their smartphone through a set of blockchain applications. <br><br>  Created by a Grammy-nominated multi-platinum artist, producer, entrepreneur and philanthropist, Akon, who successfully founded and expanded Akon Lighting Africa to provide scalable solar solutions in 18 countries in Africa. <br><br>  Akon Crypto City is the first of its kind, 100% cryptographically based city with AKoin at the center of transactional life.  This futuristic city, built on 2,000 hectares of land, donated by President Acon of Senegal, is 5 minutes from the new international airport, close to the coast and a few minutes drive from Dakar, the capital of Senegal (the birthplace of Akon).  Akon Crypto City combines Smart City planning projects with a blank canvas to encrypt our daily human and business exchanges to invent a radically new way of being. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.akoin.io/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/AKoinOfficial">Telegram</a> <br><br><h2>  BitSong </h2><br>  BitSong is the first decentralized streaming music service that allows you to earn money by listening to your favorite songs. <br><br>  The BitSong platform aims to change this and become unlike any other music streaming service. <br><br>  The BitSong platform will be built on the Ethereum blockchain using IPFS (Interplanetary File System) technology and will differ from popular streaming services such as Spotify, Google Play, etc.  some interesting points. <br><br>  Firstly, BitSong does not require costs for its users.  Instead of paying for the music, the user can earn money while listening to music - 90% of the advertising revenue will be distributed between the creator and the user, so every time the user hears the advertisement, he receives money in the BTSG token. <br><br>  <a href="https://bitsong.io/">ICO site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://bitsong.io/docs/whitepaper_en.pdf">Whitepaper</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/bitsong_ico">Telegram</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422381/</a></p>
