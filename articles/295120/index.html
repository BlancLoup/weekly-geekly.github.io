  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RTB: a step towards new technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The growing interest in working with big data could not ignore the advertising industry, which is always to the use of technical innovations.  A few years ago, new technology RTB (real-time-bidding) appeared, which quickly gained recognition from advertisers in the US and Europe.  To date, RTB is almost equal in volume with the standard display advertising.  In Russia, the market is developing much more slowly, but nevertheless, even in times of crisis, we are seeing a steady growing trend.  The advertising market is always receptive to new products, and advertisers are willing to try new ways to interact with the audience.  However, RTB has become so in demand that there are whole resources, completely dedicated to the system.  What caused such popularity? <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/b96/f83/4e0b96f83508407fb38f7035ec6356de.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">RTB: the simple essence of a complex thing</font> </h2><br>  The display advertising market developed progressively: websites sold places for banners, search engines introduced opportunities to work with video, images and interactive.  Over time, the prices offered by the sites became inflated, and as a result, advertisers began to avoid such placements.  There were sites aggregators, allowing you to choose topics and buy package placements on selected resources.  But the cost of such placements continues to take shape from the prices of owners of advertising places.  This standard model was replaced by the new online advertising technology RTB. <br><br>  How does she work?  The user enters the site, loads the page of the site with a space for advertising.  At this point, the implementation of the RTB platform logic begins.  SSP ( <i>Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãSide platform - technology platforms for web publishers, through which advertising networks or websites can sell their advertising space, aims to sell more expensive</i> ), the exchange has preliminary data about users, in addition, you can buy information about DMP ( <i>Data Management Platform) platform with accumulated structured data about users</i> ).  Based on this knowledge and advertiser bids, an auction begins that lasts a few milliseconds, completely invisible to the visitor.  The winner of the auction shows its advertising to the user.  The key point is precisely that the system knows the user or assumes who he is, since he has already tracked him with the help of special programs (browser data and social networks, pixel tag, cookie).  This is the responsibility of the DSP (Demand-Side Platform) - a unique brain of the RTB system, including a predictor - a mechanism that helps to purchase unique users.  The predictor assumes, builds probabilities on the basis of the purchased data, evaluates the user, analyzes its behavior on the site, collects data and clusters each unique user separately.  It is on these clusters and target auction.  This is how the main advantages that have allowed RTB to conquer the world: <br><br><ul><li>  accurate targeting - creatives are shown to users, whose interests or previous history of visits to which they most closely match the advertiser's goals

    </li><li>  high conversion without annoying ‚Äúharassment‚Äù of users - there is no need to constantly show creatives to users, just select the right place and the right moment to show <br><br></li><li>  lack of prepayment and bid management - since the auction is held in real time, prepayment is not possible;  Bids can also be managed in the same way as in contextual advertising. <br><br></li><li>  open analytics and transparent reporting <br><br></li><li>  deep customization of tasks <br><br></li><li>  the ability to make changes to strategies during the advertising flight. </li></ul><br>  Thus, automation and customization form the maximum set of advantages for the advertiser. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">RTB: value for the advertiser and for the client</font> </h2><br>  There are three main procurement channels for advertising RTB: the general format (auctions at the sites), the mobile programmatic and the gaining momentum in video advertising.  Standard display advertising can only assume the characteristics of the user, for example, based on the content of the site itself.  Programmatic also allows you to use different data: third-party systems, arrays of offline clients, data from CRM.  At some points, using RTB helps to keep the audience once attracted (actually purchased) and not spend money on collecting new data.  If we turn to bid management, then with standard placement of display advertising, the site sets a hard CPM (cost per thousand impressions), taking into account seasonally allowances, and programmatic allows testing and combining the market as well as a huge number of sites at once, as well as strategies, creatives, remarketing.  Moreover, with each iteration a deep optimization of the audience takes place. <br><br>  In general, Russia for RTB is a difficult market, and the attitude to media advertising is divided into two parts: they do not know or do not understand.  Advertisers compare RTB, Display Network advertising and search advertising, while these are not competitors in the struggle for the development of the advertising budget, but links in one chain that should be used consistently.  And the first should be RTB, because it helps to position the product, generate interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/234/d8d/3a5/234d8d3a5add4160bdce661defbd0905.jpg" align="left">  <i>Consider a small case.</i>  <i>Suppose a company is engaged in the rental and sale of segways (two-wheeled self-balancing scooters).</i>  <i>So that you are not distracted from the post, insert a picture :-) So, these scooters can be used for excursions around the city or some kind of pleasure ride for 30 km along the embankments of a beautiful river.</i>  <i>If you show a client who, say, is looking for a scooter or bicycle, an ad for a segway, he will most likely continue his search.</i>  <i>And if you offer a banner with segway and vivid text to a group of people who often study the routes of unusual excursions, steep city routes and are interested in extreme pastime?</i>  <i>At a minimum, there will be interest and users will later become more susceptible to advertising.</i> <br><br>  Thus, RTB is largely designed to form the public, which is interested in the proposal and announce this proposal to the selected audience.  Here it is worthwhile to draw the line between the Programmatic-strategy and the standard purchase of the media.  The usual purchase of advertising on the site is reduced to pay for impressions.  It rarely happens that some kind of platform is responsible for the quality of these impressions: advertisements can be seen by casual users, and a massive uninterested audience, and bots, which certainly happen in the life of large sites that are interesting to the advertiser.  Programmatic in RTB is focused on the purchase of ad impressions for both the narrowest, most targeted, audience segment and for general coverage, while the audience and strategy can be divided. <br><br>  RTB creates a new type of advertising that is interesting and useful for both the user and the advertiser. <br><br><ul><li>  The user receives the target offer, actually the answer to his request. <br><br></li><li>  Advertising for the user carries an informational function - on the basis of the profile, ads with offers that he might not have known before will be thrown up to him. <br><br></li><li>  User avoids annoying ads. <br><br></li><li>  The advertiser pays for the most relevant users. <br><br></li><li>  The advertiser gets his audience, which can be reused from promo to promo: offer a new product, make a promotional offer and so on ... <br><br></li><li>  DSP, RTB brain, works for advertiser.  The goal of the system is to buy the show for the most relevant user as cheaply as possible.  As a rule, almost everything can be configured in the DSP: from rates to deep statistics. <br><br></li><li>  RTB provides the most accurate targeting, and this is a budget optimization. </li></ul><br>  At <b><a href="http://www.realweb.ru/">RealWeb, we</a></b> build multimillion-dollar RTB strategies for our clients with our tools.  As a rule, combined solutions are selected for the client, which allow reaching different audiences and choosing the most suitable option.  There are a lot of RTB systems on the market, for example, Google Doubleclick, Yandex auction Bayan 2, Auditorius, Hubrus, Getintent, Segmento, etc. <br>  It happens that an advertiser tries one RTB site with a small budget and is disappointed in technology forever.  This is not surprising, since you need to take into account several factors.  First of all, the relevance of the platform for a given advertiser, its predictive ability, targeting capabilities and various alternatives, expert assessment of the allocated budget are important.  Some advertisers have enough small budget to start building a chain of attracting the target audience - they are known, trusted, they are a brand, and these advertisers themselves are experts in the logistics of their site.  But there are challenges and more difficult: less well-known companies with big ambitions.  And here it is worth considering the volume of resources that can move such a locomotive, as well as the level of competition. <br><br>  Finally, be sure to remember that in most cases RTB (like any advertisement) creates desire, but Programmatic allows you to do this very nicely, in terms of combining or excluding cross-platforms, mobile, video, and finally desktop advertising.  He does this by individualizing each of the creatives shown and at the same time teaches the system on different strategies for purchasing the audience, improving the indicators over and over again.  As a rule, such a difficult work takes place in a very convenient and understandable statistics. <br>  But the main selling process takes place after and it happens that a non-professional sales person destroys all gradually formed interest in the product.  Therefore, we advise not only to combine the strategies of various RTB-platforms, but also to pay attention to all units responsible for interaction with the client. <br><br>  The advertising industry is constantly responding to the challenges of the market and uses modern technology.  Sometimes it seems that it is ahead of time.  It is important to correctly use strategies, combine them and choose the most relevant goals of your business.  Then your ad will not be shooting from a cannon on sparrows, but a well-aimed blow to the target. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295120/</a></p>
