  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why in Russia SEO`shnikov do not like, and foreign praise</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I adjusted the grammar, spelling and style of the article a little :-) I think it will now be much easier to read. <br><br>  Good day, dear habrazhiteli.  You have probably seen various negative posts about our SEO optimizers many times.  Today I would like to tell everyone why this impression. <br>  Let's all understand the difference between our SEO guru and foreign optimizer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  S in Russia: <br>  - Hello, is this SEO agency? <br>  - (whisper) yes. <br>  - Why are you whispering? <br>  - I'm on algebra now. <br><br>  1. The first problem.  "The acquisition of knowledge". <br>  Our resources, where they "teach" future SEO optimizers.  Resources where webmasters share their experience in the Russian segment leave much to be desired.  I would not like to poke fingers, but on our resources quite often incompetent specialists give abstruse answers.  At best, these specialists themselves rivet the satellites, and at worst, they foul the issue with doorways.  Their goal is not an integrated approach to promotion, but how to quickly cut the dough.  I often see a newcomer asking a literate, though simplest question, get an answer ‚Äúgo to school‚Äù or ‚Äúwork in a factory‚Äù, and this answer is given by a respected moderator of the largest SEO forums.  Someone will say: "no one wants to share their bread and let newcomers to the topic."  I will not even argue with that, but if you don‚Äôt want to answer and help people, why take on the duties of a moderator in the section ‚ÄúHelping Newbies‚Äù?  In Runet, I met one or two private projects with a population of up to 100 people, where optimizers share their experiences, tools and secrets, but you can get there either for money or through connections, while newcomers rarely have at least one of the above.  The rest of the forums are strong in black and gray SEO, with the results of their work "satisfied" everyone who saw what was going on in the issue on the request "buy" and "download for free."  Also, the grief-translators are trying to spoil the situation;  These translations are in error, but in a matter of seconds they are distributed all over the Internet.  We can observe an example of such a translation in an interview with Alexey Borsch.  At this point, I think to close the discussion of the problems of our forums and SEO blogs, where newbies get their knowledge.  If you are interested in learning more about the problem described, you can enter the query ‚ÄúSEO forums‚Äù into Google or Yandex and read what is happening there and how they are taught there.  Thanks to perseverance and the desire to learn, to do a quality SEO job, a certain percentage of newbies succeed and become first-class specialists, which I wish for all current and future SEOs. <br>  In foreign forums, they really competently and quickly answer the questions of newbies.  When I myself learned to promote under the bourgeois with my zero English, I received answers without ridicule.  True, sometimes foreign colleagues in the workshop knocked on Skype and Skype with questions - how do the bears live there, is it not cold for them to ride bicycles through the streets in -30?  Probably the whole problem in the mentality.

      2. The second problem.  "Approach to work". <br>  If the problem of the forums is solved by the material base of a student who can get bail by a competent specialist for a certain fee and not be influenced by the first problem, then the second problem is very difficult to fight and it is already in the blood of our specialists.  To the second problem, I can attribute the lack of a competent approach to drawing up a plan for the project.  Often, our specialists do not pay attention to content and design at all, but simply carry out their link building tasks and throw hundreds of articles onto the site, even without reading them and checking only the uniqueness and number of keywords in the text.  What comes out of it - on Habr√© has already been written, you can read.  Our webmaster still lives by selling links from their sites, and if he takes to promote someone else's site, then 90% of his work is simply building up the link mass, often resulting in a ban and departure from search engines.  Our master thinks only about one thing - how to make money quickly, and is not worried about whether the client will be satisfied with the result.  In general, I do not want to paint here all the nuances of working with increasing PR and TIC, trading links, updating site content - this is understandable to everyone. <br>  How does a foreign webmaster live?  First, you need to remember that in foreign SEO a lot more traffic.  Russia is a huge country, but our use of the Internet is very weak.  In overseas SEO, you can have a good income on the context, high-paying rates for clicks.  As a rule, the blogger will not engage in the sale of links, as he has alternative methods of earning.  But if you suddenly happen to sell links, various link exchanges will offer excellent rates.  If we compare with our prices, the difference in price is felt at times.  Some of our webmasters have long skewed the chip and began working in the foreign segment of the Internet.  But here there are some nuances.  As a rule, these are already experienced webmasters with stuffed cones.  Such comrades know English well and are very well versed in the trends of the SEO market.  Our main niches in foreign SEO are pharma, adult sites and dating sites.  Of course, you can discuss the shortcomings of our market for a long time, but in general it is raw and saturated with gray or even black optimization methods. <br><br>  3. The third problem.  "Customer". <br>  This problem in my opinion is one of the most important problems of the current development of the SEO market.  And here hardly competent specialists will be able to argue.  The customer at the present time is not ready to pay the amounts that are required for the quality and comprehensive promotion of the site.  Here I can tell a story from personal experience.  A person turns to me with a request to promote the site in the top 3 for 60 days with the theme and the keyword ‚Äúreal estate agency in Moscow‚Äù.  Next is just a short dialogue between the optimizer and the client: <br><br><blockquote>  - I can take up your offer if the term is raised to 90 days.  Sound your budget in advance.  Thank. <br>  - No, my friend!  It is necessary to make 60 and therefore the budget is 4000! <br>  - I think you can try with a budget of $ 4000, but I can not guarantee the top 3 in 60 days.  Only the top 10. <br>  - WHAT?!  You're a fool?  4000 rubles !!!  Where does the young agency have $ 4000? <br>  - Sorry, but I will not work with you.  Look for another specialist on your budget. </blockquote><br>  For 4,000 rubles (minus my salary), I had to drive the site into the top 3 at the request of a real estate agency in Moscow, buy contextual advertising with a calculation of 100‚Äì200 unik a day, and also fill in the content of the site.  As you can see, the client lives in a pink world incomprehensible to me and believes that with this money he will get the desired result.  The worst thing in this situation is that such clients then go to forums and SEO gurus or the newbies described in part 1 of my article will take control of the project and guarantee 100% results.  I think every customer and optimizer got into such a situation, and the funny thing is that both parties were shocked by the desired amount.  I think it‚Äôs not worth describing a kidalovo, either - that on the part of the optimizer, that on the part of the customer they are throwing for a sweet soul. <br>  In the foreign SEO market there are no such problems at all, the client quite calmly responds to amounts of 2, 3, 4, 10 thousand dollars and regularly pays money in a predetermined time frame. <br><br>  In conclusion I want to say that the problem will not be solved by itself and will only flourish in the spaces of our beloved Runet.  Of course, the problem of the client company is eternal, but at least take some steps towards each other!  No need to shout at every corner that SEOs are mediocrity and lazy, chopping a lot of money for nothing!  Believe me, a competent promotion costs a lot, both in material terms and in terms of the cost of working hours of a specialist.  If you do not want to share knowledge and experience, do not take on the duties of moderators / administrators of various projects, where people share knowledge and discuss types of earnings in the network.  Let's work and help each other, like our foreign friends. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138693/</a></p>
