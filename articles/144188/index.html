  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that every second topic in Habr√© is about a startup.  It is no secret that serious people already treat the very word ‚Äústartup‚Äù with some suspicion - they say, where are you all climbing, how much can you? <br><br>  After some thought, I came to one interesting conclusion: this whole startup memory is not accidental;  No, I will not speculate here on the topics of the machinations of the ZOG and the dot-com bubble - I have a more interesting theory. <br><br>  The boom that we are seeing now in the web industry is nothing more than a <em>channel of exit for vanity thirst for amateurs</em> .  Do you know why? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People have such a secret dream - to write their name in the story.  Someone is stronger, someone is weaker - but everyone has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat needs to be done so that you are remembered.

      At the same time, a modern person - consciously or subconsciously - is aware of the fact that in his 26 it is already too late to go to scientists, sportsmen or abstractionist artists.  Not so much because of age, but because of the age. <br><br>  Well, the truth is, there are a lot of scientists, sportsmen and artists-abstractionists around.  Gone are the days when the self-taught Faraday (who was not very friendly with mathematics) could become interested in physics and become a great scientist - in the 21st century, you need to be interested in at least the flows of the Ricci tensor and evaporate this matan around the clock for 40 years and then the general public will know about you only when you refuse a million dollars. <br><br>  I'm not talking about such an exciting area as inventiveness.  All the times of Tesla and Edison are gone.  What can a self-taught enthusiast invent?  USB stripper? <br><br>  All places potentially interesting to our self-taught enthusiast have long been occupied by professionals.  High performance sport?  You can not even try.  Versification?  The names of the Nobel laureates in literature in the last 20 years say something to you? <br><br>  But in the field of web startups, everything is different.  Not at all.  Simple guys Sergey Brin and Larry Page on their knees gathered the most expensive company in the world.  A simple Harvard student Zuckerberg made Facebook and became the youngest billionaire in the world.  About him even the movie was shot! <br><br>  And most importantly, this worldwide shop of fame continues to work.  Here is a fresh example - through the instagram written by 12 developers, the whole world now hangs out photos of ‚Äúme and my shitty cat‚Äù. <br><br>  Is it any wonder that everyone rushed to make their startups?  Will you name another area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity in which one simple idea can turn the world around? <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> .  Before you comment - read the text carefully, please.  I'm talking about vanity, start-ups and self-taught completely neutral.  In the substantive part of my post there is not a single negative connotation. <br><br>  Moreover, I have a very positive attitude to start-ups, self-taught and, moreover, to vanity. <br><br>  However, most of the comments on this article are for some reason attributed to me the envy, the biliousness, then some other ulterior motives.  I begin to think that someone has stepped on a callus, but I just cannot understand which one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144188/</a></p>
