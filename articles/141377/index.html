  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Study in Germany</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day, ladies and gentlemen. <br><br>  In this topic, I offer you a small description of studying for a programmer in Germany.  I have been living in this hospitable country for seven years already, five of which I study at a small special higher educational institution (institute?).  The first two years I spent on paperwork, attending all kinds of courses and on voluntary-forced labor.  My diploma of physics teachers was not recognized here, so officially I only had a school certificate.  With this kind of education you will not find normal work, that's why they made me / persistently asked to work for a symbolic payment, but with benefit for the society.  For a whole year I did quite a normal job, but I got ten times less.  A year later, I finally realized that it was impossible to go on like this, I went to the local high school and asked a simple question: will you take it?  The answer was: come, even give money!  Thus began my student life in Germany, and since I have two studies in Russian institutes, I have something to compare with.  If you are interested in what the differences are, I ask for cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, let's begin. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      <b>School</b> <br><br>  Yes, school.  Higher, but still a school, it is so called here: school.  Here is her <a href="http://fh-bingen.de/">site</a> and let our admin break her head now why the server fell and what this Russian needs here.  The school is the most simple, not elite, not known, provincial.  Several large computer rooms, a projector, a board in every audience, nothing ordinary.  There is a canteen, you can eat for 2-3 euros.  The food is not much of course, but not entirely bad. <br><br>  <b>Rating system</b> <br><br>  Russia adopted a four-point rating system.  Officially, she is a five-point, but because  the unit is still not set, then consider that the estimates are only four.  In this case, a deuce is the worst score, and the top five is the best.  In Germany, things are a little more complicated.  Firstly, the opposite is true; the lower the score, the better.  Secondly, there are not four grades, but ... eleven!  Namely, 1.0, 1.3,1.7, 2.0, etc.  to four.  Four is the final score when the exam is considered passed.  Then comes the five, which means failure.  Purely theoretically, there is also a six, but they put it as an alternatively gifted one, I have not seen one.  I like the German system much more.  presents a lot more room for job evaluation. <br><br>  <b>Subjects</b> <br><br>  What I immediately liked here - no left objects such as psychology, physical education and the history of ancient Rome.  Everything is much more pragmatic and it can not but rejoice.  Although there are such items as economics and business management. <br><br>  Each item is estimated at a certain number of points, the so-called ECTS.  There are items ‚Äúsmall‚Äù (3 points), ‚Äúlarge‚Äù (6) and ‚Äúvery large‚Äù (9).  Each item corresponds to one unit (90 minutes) per week.  Those.  a subject for 3 points is read one block a week, for 6 points two blocks, etc.  According to the rules during school you need to collect a certain number of points.  Items are also divided into compulsory and optional items.  A diploma is also a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù.  For it is given as a rule about 20 points. <br><br>  Almost all subjects are given homework, which is usually done in small groups (2-3 people) and with a deadline of one week.  The surrender is very simple: the e-mail is sent to the teacher.  If there is no answer, all is well.  Households are considered credited if at least 80% is submitted. <br><br>  There are also test papers (tests).  It happens like this.  The group is started in a computer class, given a password to enter the system.  Each hand out a piece of paper with the task.  Allowed to have a pair of clean sheets and a pen.  No internet, no books or notes.  In a task, as a rule, there are 3-5 tasks, for example, to implement an algorithm.  A test is considered passed if half of the tasks are correctly solved, plus at least one line is written in another.  The beauty of the code does not interest anyone, the main thing that would work.  Sometimes they put additional conditions, for example, it is forbidden to use recursion or certain packages / libraries.  After 90 minutes, the computers are turned off, not saved, I wrote an extra character at the last second, and the program now does not compile - it's my own fault. <br><br>  The level of failing is usually 60-70%.  And it's not even that the tasks are complex (just not), but in stress.  A lot of people start to knock on the keys, everyone is in a hurry, though in half an hour it becomes much calmer, because  people understand that in a hurry he wrote complete nonsense and it is time to think. <br><br>  The control is not one, but several.  The rule is ingeniously simple: you get a credit if you take half plus one more test, but no less than two.  Example: if you pass the first two control tests, the test is received, you can not pass the following tests.  If I wrote only four tests, I passed only two of them, then I have to go one more, and so on.  Those.  on the one hand, no one tells you, I'm sorry, you did not pass, come next semester, and on the other hand, the semester is also not rubber and someday ends.  In addition, the teacher is obliged to conduct all three tests, and then how his mood will be. <br><br>  Starting somewhere from the third semester, all kinds of projects are introduced.  Domashki respectively disappear.  As a rule, you choose the theme for the project yourself and the group is organized independently for it too.  At the end, all groups present their projects.  In order to make the presentation look normal, they even introduced a special subject, where they learn how to do this very presentation and how to behave.  So folia ‚Äútear out the eyes‚Äù are very rare and ‚Äúconversation with the wall‚Äù is also a big exception. <br><br>  <b>Exams</b> <br><br>  Exams must register.  This is done through a special system.  If I registered, I didn‚Äôt come and there was no help from the doctor, the evil Buratino himself was gone, the attempt was lost.  If you did not register, but you came to the exam, they will be expelled from the audience.  The exam usually lasts 90 minutes.  What can be used decides every teacher himself.  We have one mathematician, he allows to use everything: the Internet, laptop, books.  Call a friend and help the hall, however, is prohibited.  It would seem: the Internet!  ICQ! (Also prohibited, but how will he control it?) Wolframalpha!  No, it does not help. <br><br>  All exams are written, for all the time I had only one oral.  Sometimes, instead of an exam, they offer to do some rather large project.  No "automatic".  You can write off, but not necessary, because  if caught, two attempts out of three are immediately lost.  The last attempt is always verbal and is taken by at least two teachers.  Not passed, flew.  If you flew out, you lose the right to study this specialty throughout Germany.  Here the truth is, there are a lot of nuances, thank God, I did not get interested in them. <br><br>  As elsewhere there are easy and difficult exams.  For example, on programming, the percentage of those who did not pass in 70% is considered completely normal.  And on the subject of ‚Äúhuman-computer interaction‚Äù (as it is, I don‚Äôt know Russian), not a particularly rare failure is 98% of the failure.  Mathematics, as a rule, is also complete thrash. <br><br>  <b>Teachers</b> <br><br>  All teachers are very good specialists.  All have many years of real experience.  Another question is that as teachers, half of them are none at all.  Simple things explain so hard and tedious that students fall asleep.  This is real trouble. <br><br>  Each teacher has certain hours for consultations, just come and talk.  You can also write a mail and always get an answer.  In general, communication is all right. <br><br>  <b>Comrades</b> <br><br>  And what comrades?  People like people, only Germans.  They treat me quite normally, I never had any problems with them.  Friends (German), I really did not start.  But the Germans themselves, even among their own "bunch of".  The bestial face of capitalism, every man for himself. <br><br>  <b>Practice</b> <br><br>  In the fifth semester there is a subject that is called: ‚ÄúProject‚Äù.  They divide the group into several small groups, 5-6 people (in random order), give the address of a certain company and say: this company has an order for you, go ahead.  Consider that this is a real job, with TK and other delights.  All true, only money is not paid.  Naturally, this project is not one in the semester, there are others.  But this is the main one, 12 points are given for it. <br><br>  In the sixth semester, you must complete a three-month practice.  Where exactly are you looking for yourself.  I did at the Frankfurt airport.  Very interesting, I liked it.  Then he worked there for a year and a half as an intern.  After practicing, you immediately need to write a bachelor's work.  It is naturally desirable to write it in the same place where he did the practice.  For practice give 15 points, for the work of another 15. <br><br>  <b>Dropout</b> <br><br>  In the first semester, there were more than 70 people; there was nowhere to sit in the audience, sitting in the aisles between the rows.  Now 9 people are writing diplomas, two of them from other institutes. There is now a lot of space, which is good. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  I do not know how things are now in Russia, but my Russian education nervously smokes on the sidelines, although I did not give bribes in Russia, I gave everything myself.  And pay attention, I study in the backwoods, in a town with a population of 30 thousand people.  Almost a village. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br>  And still, most of the articles on Habr√© I read and feel like an idiot, such things. <br>  I hope the article turned out not very dry, if you have questions, I will answer with pleasure. <br><br>  Well, in the end, I will voice the main goal of this article: <br><br>  Gentlemen, if there is (there is, I am sure!) Programmers living in dachyland, looking for comrades in the fight for a brighter future for their own pocket and wanting something to stir up for the benefit of their bank account, write me pliz!  I have ideas, only two hands, I am patient and kind of adequate, ready to listen to other people's ideas / suggestions.  I do not want to work for my uncle (cheaply), but time is running out, I will soon finish my diploma and the question will be an edge! <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> a <a href="http://goo.gl/z2K5f">Google document was created</a> with contacts of habra people from Germany, there are links to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habrahabr-deutschland">group</a> , join! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141377/</a></p>
