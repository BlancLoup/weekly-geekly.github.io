Site attendance was over a million people a day.  The monthly audience reached 50 million in the summer.  According to this indicator, the resource surpassed even the most famous torrent tracker in the world - The Pirate Bay. <br><br>  The US authorities have been struggling with torrent trackers for many years since the filing of copyright holders; a few months ago, law enforcement officers started doing KickassTorrents.  And it was not only about blocking or segregating the domain.  In July, the owner of the resource, a 30-year-old Ukrainian citizen Artem Vaulin, was arrested.  The arrest took place in Poland, and the USA immediately demanded the extradition of the ‚Äúpirate‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to law enforcement officers, Vaulin is guilty of unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials, the loss is estimated at $ 1 billion. The case was large, even the US Attorney General followed his progress.  His assistant after the arrest of Vaulin stated the following: "His arrest in Poland ... again proves that cybercriminals can escape, but cannot escape from justice."  Documents of the case <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/file/877591/download">are available at this link</a> .

      KickassTorrents began working in 2008, and within a few years it became one of the largest torrent trackers in the world, and a few years later it became the largest.  The popularity of the resource was positively influenced by the persecution by the authorities of different countries and the fighters against the "pirates" of The Pirate Bay team.  Domains at this torrent tracker are constantly changing, the site is sometimes just "lying", and part of the audience of the "Bay" switched to KickassTorrents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe7/7c2/baa/fe77c2baaad2d022298e6ee506399655.jpg"><br><br>  Now it became known that KickassTorrents can be reborn in the same guise.  And the original team will deal with the revival, which was engaged in its development in the best years of the resource.  The team members first launched the Katcr.co forum, declaring this domain a new home for the torrent tracker.  Today (or rather, yesterday) Katcr.co (KATcr) began to work, and the design and content of the resource is no different from KickassTorrents. <br><br>  The only difference is that the user base is clean, and there are only members of the administration familiar to regular visitors of the resource. <br><br>  "Most of the original team, including administrators and moderators, joined us ... - we are very pleased," - <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-brought-back-to-life-by-original-staffers-161216/">said the</a> authors of the project to journalists TorrentFreak.  An interesting point is that the people behind KATcr did not have access to the original code and torrent tracker data.  But they managed to create a similar design and bring together torrents from the previous site.  So, every KickassTorrents (KAT) frequenter will feel at home on a new site. <br><br>  Some users are already firmly established there.  We are talking about the most "productive" uploaders who load more and more new materials to the resource.  Well, loading is a simple process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/22c/f54/25b/22cf5425b9d7a340f5206294bff7c02f.png"><br><br>  The new administration has declared that community safety for it is number one priority. <br><br>  The main question that remains is how right holders will relate to the revived KickassTorrents.  Surprisingly, the creators of the site believe that there will be no problems.  The fact is that the torrent tracker works with a DMCA system, like on YouTube.  That is, the copyright holder can remove material that, in the company's opinion, infringes copyright. <br><br>  The administration of the resource also states that the servers do not store data on the content, links to which are indicated in the topics of the tracker.  ‚ÄúCAT is a public forum and search service for torrent trackers.  This is what we are and we will not change.  Despite the opposite opinion, torrents are not illegal, and we do not host content, ‚Äùthe administration said in a statement.  Also, the leadership of the new project stated that the policy of the resource is fully consistent with the letter of the law, so the site itself is clean before the law. <br><br>  Over the past few months, several different resources have emerged that have declared themselves the reincarnation of the original KickassTorrents.  In fact, only KATcr can be considered a new KickassTorrents, and then with a stretch. <br><br>  The owner of the original tracker, the US authorities have calculated using the method of "decoy duck."  One of the law enforcement officers acted as an advertiser.  He bought ads on the site and found out the bank account associated with the resource.  Then another order was made, and the US authorities learned without any problems the new bill associated with it.  A little later, the same law enforcement officer found out the email address of the person who managed the accounts, and it turned out to be Artem Vaulin. <br><br>  As for the new resource, it has not been working for several hours.  More precisely, it loads only one page, which says about problems with too many visitors - apparently, the administration was not ready for so many users who want to see the revived KickassTorrents. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357230/</a></p>
