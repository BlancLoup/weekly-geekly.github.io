As quietly as possible, I checked the phone and noticed that the screen reads ‚ÄúThe subscriber is not identified‚Äù.  I decided to ignore the call. <br><br>  After the service, when my family and I went to the car, I looked through the messages on the phone.  There was one from Steve Jobs.  It read: ‚ÄúVic, please call me back at home.  I would like to discuss something important. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even before we got to the car, I called Steve Jobs back.  I was responsible for all mobile applications in Google and in this role very often dealt with Steve.  This was one of the advantages of my work.

      ‚ÄúHi, Steve is Vick,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúSorry for not answering your call.  I was in the service in the church and your number was not determined.  I decided not to answer. ‚Äù <br><br>  Steve laughed.  He said: ‚ÄúVic, until the number is defined as‚Äú Lord God ‚Äù, you should never answer calls while serving.‚Äù <br><br>  I laughed too.  In general, it is normal when Steve called me for a week excited about something.  But it was very unusual to receive a call on Sunday with a request to call him back home.  I wondered what had happened to that important thing. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo, Vick, we have something important here and it needs to be resolved right now.  I have already appointed someone from our team to help, so I hope you will fix it tomorrow, ‚Äùsaid Steve. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at the Google logo on my iPhone and I don‚Äôt like this icon.  On the second ‚ÄúO‚Äù in the word ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù the wrong yellow gradient.  This is wrong and I instructed Greg to make a corrected version tomorrow.  Is it going? " <br><br>  Of course it is!  After a couple of minutes, the same Sunday, I received a letter from Steve with the theme ‚ÄúIcon Ambulance‚Äù.  The letter was instructed to collaborate with Greg Christie on the icon. <br><br>  When I was 11, I fell in love with the Apple II computer, I had dozens of stories about Apple products.  They have been part of my life for decades.  Even when I worked for Bill Gates at Microsoft for 15 years, I admired Steve and everything that Apple does. <br><br>  In the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I remember that Steve Jobs call that Sunday morning in January.  It was a lesson that I will never forget: the head of the company should take care of the details.  Even about the yellow gradient.  Even on sunday. <br><br>  To one of the greatest leaders I've ever met. <br>  My prayers and hopes are with you, Steve. <br><br>  <i>Note</i>  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Gundotra">Trans</a> .: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Gundotra">Vic Gundotra</a> - Senior Vice President at Google for Soc.</i>  <i>media</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Greg Christie leads the development of user interfaces at Apple.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And the bonus - maybe <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/25/steve-jobs-called-googles-vic-gundotra-on-a-sunday-about-this-icon/">the same icon</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127045/</a></p>
