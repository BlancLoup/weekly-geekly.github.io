No, it was not the answer that pissed me off. ‚ÄúWe are temporarily not hiring.  Try again later. ‚Äù  This secretary's response was completely expected.  She was angry that she even went there and flashed her impatience.  ‚ÄúOkay, I'll drop off to youth and the first time,‚Äù Leela thought.  For many years, not a single decent work has been published openly.  Normal demand remained only at the position where the highest cognitive abilities are needed and there was no way to get there without a bouquet of neurostimulators and a set of co-processor implants.  ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù employees have long been replaced by AI and robots.  Summary no one interested.  You are either able to solve the necessary tasks or not.  To identify this, invent various tests.  And the first test was usually to find the actual ad with the vacancy.

      Leela thought she was a cool hacker. <a name="habracut"></a>  She hacked the military and the government, mafia and superstars.  But she wanted more.  She wanted to touch the newly emerging monks.  People with incredibly pumped brains, very deep neuroimplants and powerful co-processors.  They always lived separately from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù people, for which they were called so.  They were said to be almost demigods.  And all the real information on them was very well hidden from prying eyes.  Hacking them was possible only with the resources of a large corporation.  So she went to Galactis.  This muddy corporation was engaged in everything and nothing concrete.  But she had plenty of resources.  Leela was sure that they somehow interact with the monks. <br><br>  Something had to start.  She had a few ideas and she began to check them one by one.  Meticulously and patiently.  Nothing.  The impression was that Galactis didn‚Äôt accept employment.  ‚ÄúWow they have a threshold of entry,‚Äù thought Leela, falling asleep.  Normally she did not fall asleep for a very long time.  She had no time to lie in bed and wait for sleep, Galaktis himself does not hack.  Therefore, she simply switched herself to sleep with the help of a fitness implant and a pair of drugs, which he also injected. <br><br>  Of course, if you are looking for a job as a hacker, the first thing is to hack a potential employer.  Leela did just that when freelancing to like potential customers.  Usually the effect was excellent, the customer was delighted, order it.  But with Galactis this number did not pass.  They were protected impenetrably.  She had been trying to find a loophole for weeks.  Unsuccessfully.  Of course, it was possible to try other methods - social engineering, bribing, or gaining confidence in one of the employees.  There were many ways.  But the bottom line is that they all led to different doors.  It was possible to find a vacancy of a PR manager, lawyer or secretary.  But if you want to work as a hacker, you have to crack them, period.  She was on the verge of despair. <br><br>  Leela woke herself up earlier than usual and went to the bar.  She could pump herself up with everything she wanted without getting up from her chair.  But she wanted to sit somewhere outside the house.  And she went to one of these old-fashioned bars with bartenders and all that.  I drank two beers, as it was once supposed to be in bars, chatted about something with the bartender (they say it was also such a tradition) and went out into the street.  Her mood, oddly enough, improved slightly and she went for a little walk around the city.  Recalling that she was not far from the main building of Galactis, Leela decided to visit the object of her lust.  She had already done this gazilion once in search of clues and knew every inch.  Suddenly she was angry again.  This time she was angry with Galactis and her own helplessness.  Going to the reception desk, she asked venomously: <br><br>  - Can there be a job? <br>  - We are not temporarily employed.  Try to contact later - followed by the expected response of the secretary. <br><br>  Strange doubts began to creep into Leela's head.  She went out and came back. <br><br>  - Good afternoon, I'm looking for a job - Leela said with a confident voice. <br>  - We are not temporarily employed.  Please try again later. <br><br>  Leela rushed home like on wings.  The secretary was a man, and therefore repeating the answer word for word several times could not be a coincidence - this is the key.  The rest was a trick. <br><br>  Having turned off this phrase in all available ways and drove through a couple of hashing algorithms, she received a set of characters.  Each character turned out to be the pixel coordinate of one of the strange images on the Galactis website.  And with the help of these pixels, she was able to break through one of the firewalls of the corporation.  For a long time she could not stay there.  Literally 1.5 minutes and thrown out.  But something she still found.  One strange file which should not be.  There was a small set of characters in the file, which Lila interpreted as the name and the time. <br><br>  At the appointed time, she entered Galactis and politely asked: <br><br>  - Good day.  I'm to mr. Or mrs g. <br><br>  Heart pounding like mad.  She did not introduce herself to be sedated, because she needed a clear consciousness at the meeting. <br><br>  - Room 512 - the secretary answered after a couple of seconds of ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù, during which she checked the appointment with the help of her implants. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù, Leela thought, ‚ÄúAll the same it worked out‚Äù <br><br>  Leela entered the specified room exactly at the appointed time.  The room was empty, but literally a few seconds later a man entered it and said with a smile: <br><br>  - Good afternoon, Leela.  My name is Ji.  Welcome to the Office of Monks.  Just kidding  No one will call the department such a stupid name.  We are ORM.  And all the associations of this abbreviation with monks are random and are exclusively a figment of your imagination. <br>  - Good afternoon - Leela smiled in response.  She was still a little nervous, but she was not surprised that Ji knew her name.  They certainly found out a long time ago who is trying to hack them. <br>  - We are pleased to offer you an assistant job in our department.  No additional tests are needed - J continued to smile. <br>  - Assistant ?!  - burst out from Leela - I hacked your firewall! <br>  - Yes, but how did you get the key?  Our secretary.  Therefore, such a vacancy - calmly answered Ji. <br><br>  There was an awkward pause during which Leela was shaking from the inside out.  She was already a second from simply getting out when Ji continued to calmly as well: <br><br>  - This is a joke again.  Do not be confused by the name of the position.  We have an interesting job and excellent compensation.  And all your talents will be useful to you.  - Ji made a short pause and very meaningfully added - Well, then, we are ORM. <br><br>  ‚ÄúORM, monks, how could I have missed it,‚Äù Lila's head whirled, ‚ÄúHow does he know?‚Äù.  She hid her interest in monks very well.  It was too much, they hacked her much deeper than she had originally intended.  Leela was impressed and scared at the same time. <br><br>  - You are starting right now - said Ji, not waiting for her answer - let's go, I will bring you up to date and introduce you to my colleagues. <br><br>  Zhenya Belik <br>  CC BY-ND (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/deed.ru) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401479/</a></p>
