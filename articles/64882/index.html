  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the Internet and freedom of opinion or Web 2.0 in thinking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This entry will be about the greatest opportunity that the Internet provides us, and which 99.9% of users do not use.  Anyway, no matter how advanced we, our parents and our environment, we are the product of our family, or, in a more global sense, our regional community.  Rules, habits, world views, assessments, principles of behavior, absolutely everything in our country is shaped by the influence of the environment.  Of course, there are errors, but even they are small deviations from standard rules.  Examples of such rules you can give yourself.  For example: ‚Äúwithout a higher education you will not make a career‚Äù, ‚Äúyou must get married before 25 years old‚Äù, ‚Äúyou cannot enter a university without money‚Äù, ‚Äúall doctors / teachers take bribes‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible to earn with honest labor or brains in our country‚Äù ‚ÄúA family without children cannot be happy‚Äù, ‚Äúto lose weight, go in for sports‚Äù, ‚Äúthin means healthy, thick means sick‚Äù, ‚Äúthere will be nothing from a half-slice cake‚Äù.  Each of you can continue this thought-series in accordance with your own convictions or the convictions of your own circle (regional community).  Here I call a regional community a certain community of people who live in one place.  It is clear that in our time this concept is more blurry, and the influence of this community on an individual is less noticeable; nevertheless, it is also very strong. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So: <b>The most important opportunity of the Internet is that the Global Network provides us with the opportunity to literally look at the world with different eyes.</b>  <b>That is, to refute the assertions that we considered unshakable and the only true.</b>  The Internet gives us a lot of counterexamples of all these stupid statements and reasonable people who know how to think and analyze leads to the conclusion that for any rule there are exceptions, and any positive statement in one environment can be negative in another. <br><br>  For example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - ‚ÄúWithout a higher education you will not make a career‚Äù: I know several people who have achieved great career success without a crust about HE, the most famous among them is Bill Gates, the lesser known are a couple of my LJ-friends <br><br>  - ‚ÄúYou cannot enter a university without money‚Äù - I don‚Äôt even want to comment on it, especially in the conditions of external testing, especially when I personally watch a young man, the son of rich parents who can pay for education at any university, but who will not study because a small number of balls <br><br>  - ‚ÄúA family without children can not be happy‚Äù - Child-free will explain it to you better.  Maybe in a more categorical form. <br><br>  - ‚Äúthin means healthy, fat means sick‚Äù - look at one of the episodes of the 5th season of ‚ÄúDoctor House‚Äù, in which a girl, in order to live, had to keep a high-carb diet, that is, eat a lot <br><br>  Such a counter-example can lead to any statement.  So: The most important possibility of the Internet is the opportunity to get rid of the inertia of judgments and see that there are exceptions for any rule.  And that any statement may be wrong - in a certain situation, under certain conditions or for certain people.  To clarify, many statements can be true for most people.  For example, most people, limiting calorie intake, will lose weight.  But not all - and there may be a lot of reasons for this.  Or: a diploma of higher education provides more opportunities for career growth in most cases.  But not in all (although in our time this statement is more than debatable). <br><br>  Why does this give the Internet?  Yes, simply the Network is an opportunity to look at the world with different eyes, in different initial conditions, to learn other cases.  For example, our parents did not have such an opportunity - they received only the information that the party and the government allocated to them dosed out.  We have such an opportunity.  Get rid of the stamps, from the rigidity of thinking and narrow views.  But only we do not use it.  Most of us do not use.  And very sorry. <br><br>  Of course, a person should want to see a different view, realize that not everything in the world is what he thinks or imagines.  But this is another problem, non-Internet.  This is the problem of laziness thinking.  It's like watching the news on TV that someone has selected for you, instead of reading the news online, determining for yourself what you are interested in reading.  It‚Äôs like being created by other Web 1.0 and hand-crafted Web 2.0.  However, if Web 2.0 has won in the online world, then I‚Äôm not sure that it will ever win in thinking.  Probably due to the fact that rebuilding the Web is easier than rebuilding a person‚Äôs thinking. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64882/</a></p>
