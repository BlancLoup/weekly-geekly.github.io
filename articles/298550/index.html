      <b><i>Time saving</i></b> <br>  Automating email marketing serves to reduce the amount of work involved in your operations.  She frees for more important matters.  To some extent, this is your right hand, which will write and send a letter of thanks exactly on the second day after the meeting with the client. <br><br>  <b><i>In the right hands, at the right time</i></b> <br>  Made an order in the online store?  In half an hour you will receive a confirmation with the order number and delivery time.  Bought a smartphone?  The next day, receive an e-mail discount coupon for the purchase of accessories.  Didn't buy anything for a long time?  Get an e-mail notification of this content: "we have a replenishment of the range, discounts, promotions."  Agree, it is convenient.  It is enough just to set up the relevant trigger letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/117/b5d/a56117b5d487409f85a23859a6e6d9b0.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>No routine</i></b> <br>  Slave following a routine action pattern turns work into a mechanical habit.  So it should not be.  One of the positive and main tasks of the automatic distribution is to remove the routine.  Instead of the manager, she will remind the client of the meeting, thank them for attending the event or the webinar, and offer a presentation of a new range or service. <br><br>  <b><i>No mistakes</i></b> <br>  When working with a large amount of information, even an experienced and erudite manager misses typos, and when working with a large number of recipients, it is possible to send a letter to the wrong destination.  Automatic mailing will solve these problems.  But do not relax.  Your role is as follows: regularly monitor the sending of trigger letters, transmit information in time to send letters to your service, update and develop new templates, analyze the result. <br><br>  <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/what-converting-websites-do/">Statistics</a> show that approximately 96% of site visitors are not ready to buy right now.  However, people showed interest in your product and are ideal candidates for making a purchase later.  That is why it is important to set up automatic letters and make special offers to interest them.  The number of clicks on links (CTR) in autoresponder letters is seven times higher than the links of a regular letter.  It can also be noted that repeated letters <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ellenikiforova/ss-28959414">do not reduce the</a> interest of the recipient.  The CTR of the first message is 13.2%, the second - 18.9%, the third - 13.2%, the fourth - 5.1%, the fifth - 5.9%.  From this data we can conclude that interest decreases from the fourth and fifth letters, but does not disappear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/e4d/dc8/4b9e4ddc82d84a00b3afe45d0b01eca7.jpg"><br><br>  According to the <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Webinar/Key-Digital-Trends15-Things-Know-2015/4000098">Key Digital Trends</a> study, companies using automatic e-mail marketing note a high rate of return on investments of this tool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d0/c98/b1b/8d0c98b1b8b145c0a7f9ef1e59f236f9.png"><br><br>  Based on their functionality, automatic mailing can be divided into three types: <br><br><ul><li>  RSS feeds </li><li>  Autoresponders (answering machines) </li><li>  Trigger letters </li></ul><br>  Let's look at these types. <br><br>  <b><u>1. RSS feeds</u></b> <br><br>  The names of this newsletter can be found different: RSS feed, RSS feed, feed (from the English ¬´feed¬ª - feed, food, serve, eat).  In this case, you will feed the information. <br>  RSS feed is best for blogs, news feeds.  Even if your blog is interesting enough, will the reader visit it a second time?  This is ideal when a person directly visits your website every day and reads it.  But how many of these?  RSS feeds are a method of addressing each reader individually to share an article, news, and ideas.  RSS feed automates the traffic to the site, blog with the regularity that you need. <br>  Configured RSS once.  Issues will be released on the basis of updates to the blog that you are, or news feed.  Schedule for mailing - once a day, once a week, once a month - you choose. <br><br>  <b><u>2. Autoresponders (autoresponders)</u></b> - these are pre-compiled series of letters that are sent to subscribers.  Usually they leave according to a predetermined schedule.  What are these letters, you will learn below. <br><br>  <b>Subscription confirmation letter</b> <br><br>  Do not forget to set the shipment - "instantly."  In this letter you can send a discount to a new subscriber, and also do not forget to thank for your interest in you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/592/e37/7c4/592e377c47294b898fd23c773b3d0486.png"><br><br>  <b>Welcome letter</b> <br>  The welcome letter should be personalized, describe the benefits of the subscription, provide information on how often the letters will come and with what content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/c15/985/5c1c15985a5646e3ba2bff0521cfb981.jpg"><br><br>  A good example of a series of automatic letters is the mailing shop <a href="http://global.timex.com/">TIMEX</a> .  Together with the subscription, the subscriber instantly receives a 15% discount on the purchase as a gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/1af/2eb/9f21af2ebbd84a6dae03655b54f865e5.png"><br><br>  After 5 days, the next automatic letter arrives.  It is proposed to specify your gender and thereby segment subscribers for further content relevance.  Simple design assumes ease of response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ea/d35/cd8/6ead35cd8c314a16b23c4c8a73e0af1d.png"><br><br>  Four days after that, another letter will be sent.  Motivating subscribers with a discount, Timex asks them to enter some more data about themselves, namely: last name, index, birthday, and interests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66f/df8/1de/66fdf81de0b045cfa03cc51c4b44eee1.png"><br><br>  Thus, the store cleverly segmented its subscribers.  Segmentation will allow the company to better understand the needs of the buyer, to stimulate the development of new products, activities. <br><br>  <b>Happy Birthday Letter</b> <br><br>  For this type of letters, of course, you must first fill in the "Date of birth".  This can be done in various surveys, questionnaires, in the order forms.  The same principle can be applied in the preparation of the letter of congratulations on the anniversary of the subscription or congratulations on the first purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/382/e1d/c51382e1d699435aa7e7e0d350ede26f.png"><br><br>  <b>Reactivation letter</b> <br><br>  Dispatched if there are no orders or a long absence on the site.  In this case, you need to think in advance about the "date of the last order" or "date of the last visit to the site" and update it.  Thus, six months after the last visit to the site, the recipient will receive a reactivation letter requesting access to your site.  Take care of the special offer: discounts, promotions, gifts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c35/f39/4c2/c35f394c25f24aad9d7501c6e8ed3950.png"><br><br>  <b><u>3. Trigger Letters</u></b> <br><br>  They are generated by an automatic process and sent to designated recipients.  These letters, as opposed to autoresponders, are sent not according to a predetermined schedule, but depending on the action taken by the site visitor.  For example, it can be a greeting after the user has registered on the site.  With such a letter you can stimulate a new client to further cooperation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/be5/222/d21be52227c545269cdafbeb3692ed07.png"><br><br>  You can configure the trigger letters to respond to the following actions of the site visitor: <br><br><ul><li>  If the visitor used the site search; </li><li>  If he looked through the catalog; </li><li>  Read reviews for a specific product; </li><li>  I watched the product, but did not add it to the basket; </li><li>  Not completed the purchase. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/323/11b/4f0/32311b4f0e3740f4b6a9f8d32b221ccc.png"><br><br>  Think over your automatic letters.  The content should be interesting.  After all, if a user came to your site, watched a catalog, read about a product, looked through positions of similar products, read reviews, then he did it not by chance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298550/</a></p>
