A recent <a href="http://news.softodrom.ru/ap/b24694.shtml">survey by the</a> municipality of Innopolis and the HeadHunter recruitment portal showed that about 13% of Russian IT specialists are ready to become ‚Äúlabor migrants‚Äù.  But is it so easy to find a job abroad and is it so much ‚Äúthere‚Äù that is better than ‚Äúhere‚Äù - in order to deal with this, I studied a lot of interesting materials.  I will not advertise my opinion; I'd rather share useful digest materials about job search in different countries and solving problems and questions arising along the way. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Which country to choose? </h4><br>  The results of the <a href="http://news.softodrom.ru/ap/b24694.shtml">survey by</a> Innopolis and HeadHunter identified the TOP of the ‚Äúdream countries‚Äù.  Leading the list are USA, Germany and Canada.  The most common reasons for relocation are the desire to get more wages and grow in the service, as well as the desire to improve their own standard of living or social conditions of the family.

      IT specialists from Russia and the CIS countries often make up their own <a href="http://www.kv.by/content/336986-trudovaya-emigratsiya-dlya-aitishnika-kakuyu-stranu-vybrat">ratings of the</a> most attractive countries for relocation.  If thoughts about moving appear more and more often, but there are no specific ideas about <a href="http://hermil.biz/news/Nazvany-samye-populjarnye-dlja-immigracii-strany">where exactly to</a> emigrate, you can look at the following countries: <br><br><h4>  Germany </h4><br>  One of the most popular areas of labor migration for IT professionals is Germany.  The reason for the increased attention of those who are moving to this country is the high demand for IT specialists and the simplified system for obtaining a residence permit for highly qualified specialists. <br><br>  Here are a few guides for moving to this country: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>‚Äú <a href="http://gmsservices.ru/blog/2016/04/29/germany-migration/">Is it worth it for a developer to look for a job in Germany: Pros and Cons</a> ‚Äù</b> - here you can find out about the conditions for obtaining a residence permit under the program for highly skilled migrants (Blue Card EU) and the ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù aspects of moving (the material was originally <a href="https://vc.ru/p/gms-germany">published</a> on VC.ru, but then it was supplemented with information from the comments on the site of this publication). </li><li>  <b>" <a href="http://vse-temu.org/new-pereezd-na-pmzh-v-germaniyu.html">Moving to permanent residence in Germany</a> "</b> - the main ways of obtaining a residence permit and a list of documents required for moving </li><li>  It is also useful to have a look at expat blogs: <b>‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/285688/">How an IT person should go to Germany</a> ‚Äù</b> , <b>‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/273673/">Moving an IT person to Germany from A to Z</a> ‚Äù</b> to get the most complete picture of the moving procedure and social and social characteristics of the country. </li></ul><br>  With the support of the German government, a useful site ‚Äú <a href="http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/">Make It Germany</a> ‚Äù was launched with general recommendations for those moving. <br><br><h4>  Canada </h4><br>  IT migrant workers formally ceased to be in demand in Canada: IT specialties were <a href="http://www.izmestyev.com/kak-uehat-v-kanadu-na-pmzh-chast-2/">excluded</a> from the Qualified Specialist state migration program list.  However, despite the difficulties in finding a job, domestic IT professionals choose to move Canada, seeking to increase income and improve their standard of living. <br><br>  Learn about the features of the IT labor market in the country of the maple leaf on Konstantin Izmestyev <b>‚Äôs</b> blog <b>‚Äú <a href="http://www.izmestyev.com/rabota-v-kanade-dlya-programmistov-trebuyutsya-shlite-mne-rezyume/">How to live in Canada?</a></b>  <b>"</b> .
