  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About relationships and piracy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A most amusing thought came to me just now in a bright head.  At first I waved her off, and then, having thought it over, agreed with her.  Judge for yourself: <br>  The relationship between boys and girls, that is to say, our typical traditional relations are passionate, as similar to software licensing policies.  Even such a joke was that the girls after some time become stupid, stop making cakes and blowjobs, because the demo period ends.  There is more truth in every joke than in a fresh newspaper. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The beginning of a relationship is a <b>demo period</b> .  Maximum capabilities, unlimited access and all user requests in priority.  The user is, therefore, a man, and the product, on the contrary, is a girl.  By the way, technical support during the demo period works flawlessly - a potential mother-in-law is interested in legalizing the product.  The demo period is a cool thing that allows you to make sure that the product is exactly what you were looking for!  However, the producers are not simply bogus and for the sake of their self-interest they limit the demo period.  The end of the period - and everything, the pipe.  Or marry, or look for ways to circumvent protection. <br>  <b>Product legalization.</b>  The most desirable scenario for the manufacturer.  A man offers a hand, heart and wallet, the manufacturer in the face of relatives and girlfriends of our product is happy.  Most legal users also gain full satisfaction in legal marriage.  The product is fully tested, meets expectations and is regularly updated by the developer.  Aluluya <br>  Our man is not some prince on a white horse.  He does not want to marry so easily.  Or does not want at all, it is quite satisfied with the test version of the product.  All at once and without restrictions - every time as the first!  He is desperately seeking (and finding!) Ways to illegally use a favorite product. <br>  You can <b>extend the demo period</b> .  Reinstall the product and offer to start everything from the beginning - once it works, the second or third will fail and the old databases successfully spoil all the results of the work.  In addition, technical support and the manufacturer will desperately swear.  You can change the iron, but even through the prism of a new car, the product will sooner or later remember that it was hacked.  The method is effective 1-2 times, after bringing one torment to one and the other side. <br>  For each product in demand there is a <b>keygen.</b>  A man is looking for fans of similar products and asking for their advice.  The community does not throw a man in trouble and gives out keygen.  Happiness seemed to be there!  However, a hacked product begins to malfunction.  Then the function ‚Äúmake coffee in the morning‚Äù breaks down, the product refuses to hang men's socks according to GOST, then it completely goes into reboot without explanation.  Technical support throws up his hands: ‚ÄúWe can only help legal users.  Pay or look for a way out yourself. ‚Äù  The search for a new keygen, an attempt to restore the product independently or the humble use of a buggy version is our man's lot. <br>  Another option is to look for a <b>new product</b> or a copy of it every time.  Pour, put - and you have a new demo period.  As experienced men say, after 30 years every new product is hard.  Get used to, adjust, demolish - I want to have some kind of stability and certainty. <br>  A way on the verge of a foul - manufacturers promise to promise <b>legalization at the first financial opportunity</b> .  As soon as possible.  However, the disadvantages of the method is that the promise will have to be kept.  Otherwise, the man will be excommunicated from the product and, possibly, forever. <br>  Offended by the manufacturers of a man is quite able to do on their own.  Expand the production of their own hands.  However, they say it quickly bothers. <br><br>  It seems that this is the essence of the problem of annoying and outdated relations.  Does not suit - demand completion or look for a new product. <br>  By the way, the explanation <b>‚ÄúWhy my girlfriend has ceased to be the same as in the demo period‚Äù</b> logically fits into this scheme.  The manufacturer promised the whole set of functions only for the maximum fee.  You have purchased the version for home use and require the Enterprise functionality from it.  Invest and they will give you back the joy of the first days of the demo period. <br><br>  In general, my friends, respect the work of developers.  Legalize your software on time, before it can ruin your relationship with unwanted bugs.  Develop functionality, gradually investing, rather than having the entire annual budget swept into the introduction of something expensive and unnecessary to you.  Always read the license agreement carefully and the product will not disappoint your expectations.
