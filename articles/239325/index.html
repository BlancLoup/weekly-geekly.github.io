Sometimes it happens suddenly and unexpectedly, and it happens that before that the ear had already slipped on the Internet.  When you need to believe the bad news and run to change the bank and, most importantly, what to do, if you are left without a bank - we will not pull with lyrical introductions and tell you right now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite the hesitant conversations and the so-called ‚Äúblack‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù lists of banks in the network, it is impossible to determine in advance the victims of the CBR.  But to pay attention to suspicious signals and to protect yourself is in your power.  If in the news you have repeatedly met information about the checks and court proceedings of your bank, about the decline in financial indicators and the fall of the rating or that the bank is not temporarily making payments, you should already be wary. <br><br><h2>  Changing the bank is easy </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d0/fe9/0cb/4d0fe90cbb6d4e1b90164ee9bb0e688a.png">  If you have noticed those suspicious signals in time or a friend who has really reliable information about the state of the bank warns you - you are lucky.  You can easily change the bank without any consequences.  The list of actions for this is intuitive: <br><br><ol><li>  Open a current account in a new reliable bank.  To do this, you need to come to the office and take with you: a passport, certificate of registration of individual entrepreneurs, certificate of registration with the tax authorities and a seal.  This is the most basic, all other requirements at the discretion of the bank;

    </li><li>  Transfer the rest of the money to a new bank account and do not forget to warn all counterparties of the account change; <br><br></li><li>  Apply to the old bank for termination of the contract and close the previous current account. <br><br></li></ol>  No one except counterparties needs to be notified about the change in the current account - entrepreneurs were exempted from this in May 2014! <br><br><br clear="all"><h2>  If your bank has revoked the license </h2><br>  As a rule, the news that the bank has revoked the license, is spreading instantly on the Internet.  In addition, many banks still learned how to properly use SMS-mailing.  Also, the latest information is always on the <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/credit/dl_msg.asp">website of the</a> Bank of Russia. <br>  Here the main thing is to calm down quickly and respond correctly.  The algorithm of actions in this situation is as follows: <br><br><h4>  Notifying counterparties and employees is the first thing to do if you find your bank in a license withdrawal message. </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/981/e1c/111/981e1c111b194cc4ab6ed4c56b7b9325.png">  The sooner you warn customers, the less disputes you will have.  The fact is that you can still send money, but they will not have time to reach the account.  Then you will have to figure out where the money is and if they will return to the buyer. <br>  If you are listing staff salaries on cards, inform them of possible delays.  By the way, if there is a delay in payment, you will have to pay compensation for each day of delay.  Employees who have cards in your bank will have to apply for a refund of up to 700 thousand rubles. <br><br><h4>  Physicists and individual entrepreneurs apply for reimbursement up to 700 thousand </h4><br>  As you already know, money up to 700 thousand rubles of all physicists and, now from 2014, all individual entrepreneurs are insured.  The Deposit Insurance Agency, which decides on the reimbursement of all money, appoints agent banks.  Two weeks after the revocation of the license, you need to contact these banks with a passport and an application to receive your money.  They will pay you immediately, along with interest accrued before the day the license was withdrawn.  On the issue of refund, you must be contacted within a month.  You can also see all the information about accepting applications on your bank <a href="http://www.asv.org.ru/insurance/insurance_cases/">website</a> , on the <a href="http://www.asv.org.ru/insurance/insurance_cases/">website of</a> the insurance agency or in the Vestnik Bank of Russia. <br><br>  On the sums over 700 thousand rubles for insurance it is not necessary to count, as well as to all legal entities.  Voluntarily and in full, no one will pay you this money, it is necessary to issue a creditor‚Äôs claim on them.  But these amounts you will receive last.  At worst, it may happen that you do not get at all.  As you might guess, there are a lot of people willing and there may simply not be enough money. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a7/c37/933/9a7c379332d64af99d8f599ad88991d4.png"></div><br><br><h4>  For the remaining money to prepare a claim </h4><br>  Each bank with revoked licenses is assigned a temporary administration.  As soon as she is announced, send her your request to the lender.  An approximate form of the requirement and a list of necessary documents for its application are in the sample on <a href="http://www.asv.org.ru/liquidation/docs/">the</a> DIA <a href="http://www.asv.org.ru/liquidation/docs/">website</a> .  Take care of them in advance. <br><br>  You can find out which temporary administration of your bank is available on <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/credit/likvidbase/LikvidBase.aspx">the</a> CBR <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/credit/likvidbase/LikvidBase.aspx">site</a> already familiar to you.  In the section "Announcements of temporary administrations" a notice of the presentation of claims must be published.  Before the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings, you can at any time send the request by mail or submit it personally to the address indicated. <br><br>  The request must specify the amount of the bank debt to you.  Please note, in addition to the amount of the balance on the account, you still have to return the money that is stuck on the bank account.  This could happen if you sent a payment, the money was debited from the account, but did not reach the recipient. <br><br>  Further, all that remains is just to wait: <br>  At best, the completion of the liquidation procedure: then all the money ( <s>and love</s> ) will return to you <br>  At worst, but more likely, bankruptcy procedures: according to its results, legal entities almost never get anything back. <br><br><h2>  Some more important points with taxes </h2><br>  If at the time of the revocation of the license, you managed to send a payment to the tax or FIU, but the money was "stuck" in the bank - do not worry.  The tax will be considered paid, but you will have to make one visit to the inspector with the documents.  Since the regulatory authorities do not yet see your money, you just need to submit a payment, an account statement and an explanation of the situation that your bank has revoked the license. <br><br>  When calculating the USN tax, remember that the tax will have to be paid according to the general rules.  Hanging up payments and lost money can never be written off. <br><br>  If you have any questions, <a href="https://kontur.ru/about/management">smart and beautiful experts</a> of the <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">Elba</a> web service will be happy to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239325/</a></p>
