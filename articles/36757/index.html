I read his blog a long time ago and only recently quite by chance found out that the author lives in Voronezh.  Alexander's <a href="http://rmcreative.ru/">blog</a> pays great attention to the wonderful <b>CodeIgniter framework</b> .  Alexander is also the moderator of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/codeigniter/">blog CodeIgniter</a> on Habr√©. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Avid Gang: Tell me a little about yourself ... (where you studied, where you work, hobbies, etc.)</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> I'm not learning anymore.  He graduated from VSU, FKN.  I work now in Murano Software.  I do web development there.  The main hobby is the same as work, but I also like outdoor activities: bicycles, rollers ... <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: Do you like our city, its inhabitants?</b>  <b>You have no desire to go somewhere in another city, country?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> I like the city, I like the people, although there are exceptions.  The desire to leave ... sometimes arises, but not because of the city.

      <b>The greedy upyr: Do you visit Voronezh sites?</b>  <b>What do you think that they lack to reach a qualitatively new level, to declare themselves to the whole country?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark: I</b> visit <a href="http://u-antona.vrn.ru/">&lt;the Great Voronezh Forum</a> and very rarely <a href="http://allvrn.ru/">AllVrn</a> , everything is fine with BVF, but AllVrn recently ruined the final redesign.  There is not enough Voronezh resources in the main relevant information. <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: You saw their new project <a href="http://ego.allvrn.ru/">ego.allvrn.ru</a> , how do you like it?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> No, I have not.  In general, the last of their creations I do not like. <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: Can you say why?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark</b> : They look more like billboards than useful, colorful billboards <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: I learned you through your <a href="http://rmcreative.ru/">blog</a> , or rather I was signed to and read for a long time, and then I learned that you are from Voronezh, you also actively participate in <a href="http://code-igniter.ru/">http://code-igniter.ru/</a> and are the moderator of the blog CodeIgniter on Habr√©, that is, you are actively paying attention to CodeIgniter, why did you choose this framework?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> I developed my framework for quite a long time, but as soon as the work began to take away a significant part of the time I realized that I needed to look for something ready.  That I worked, and the framework developed. <br>  I tried <b>Zend Framework</b> , <b>CakePHP</b> , <b>Symfony</b> and then <b>CodeIgniter</b> . <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: And why did your choice fall on CodeIgniter?</b>  <b>Can you make him an advertisement in a few words, why him, and not the other?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Very easy to learn, fast and does not impose any special restrictions on what I do. <br>  Yes ... even the best documentation. <br><br>  <b>Avid Ghoul: In Russian, as I understand it?</b>  <b>Zend is also well documented, but in English?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> No, the documentation was originally in English.  I also participated in the translation.  English for me as my own.  As for Zend, he also has Russian documentation. <br>  It is simply more difficult both in mastering and in work. <br><br>  <b>Avid Ghost: I recently tried <a href="http://max-3000.com/">Maxsite CMS</a> , written using CodeIgniter, which the author positions as a potential replacement for WordPress, the first impression is not professional that it works much faster than WordPress, the glitches of course still skip.</b>  <b>I know that you wrote about her, you even had something like a dispute with the author.</b>  <b>Do you think she has prospects?</b>  <b>And so she do you?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark</b> : There are prospects.  Unless of course MAX will develop it as actively as now. <br>  In general, a good thing.  For smaller projects, the thing is, although I prefer to write it myself or use Drupal. <br><br>  <b>Avid Gang: You have a lot of useful scripts on your blog, one of them is a <a href="http://rmcreative.ru/blog/post/tipograf">typographer</a> .</b>  <b>The fact that you distribute them for free is your principal position?</b>  <b>Are you a supporter of OpenSource or do you think that after all the future is in paid development?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> No, OpenSource is not a principled position.  If the best solution is paid, it is possible and buy it.  Here you just need to correlate costs with benefits.  But the future of web development is likely to open technology. <br><br>  <b>Avid Gang: You have a fairly popular blog, more than 600 subscribers.</b>  <b>Have you ever had a desire to monetize it?</b>  <b>It seems to me that advertisers would be easy to find, or the same sape doesn‚Äôt particularly like to bother?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> The desire was somehow true, for a long time ... but the banners spoiled the appearance without bringing much income, so they were removed.  No longer tried.  I also subscribed to BlogMoney. <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: And sape?</b>  <b>Context did not try?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark</b> : SAPE did not try. <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: besides the blog, do you have any other projects on your network?</b> <br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Not entirely mine, there is a joint project <a href="http://samlab.ws/">SamLab.ws</a> / <a href="http://samforum.ws/">SamForum.ws</a> <br><br>  <b>The greedy ghoul: Is there no desire to do something like that, for example, aimed at a Voronezh audience?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Desire to eat.  Huge.  But to implement fully until it comes out.  Permanent work takes a lot of time. <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: I get the impression that in Voronezh there is just a huge shortage of professional staff in the field of web development, in many ways the wretchedness of Voronezh sites is related to this, don't you think so?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> No, there are actually a lot of staff, but most of the professionals do not want to get involved in local studios.  The work goes through freelancing exchanges, although it is difficult to find a really standing developer. <br><br>  <b>The greedy ghoul: I see, as far as I know, you're also a freelancer?</b>  <b>What are the main difficulties of freelancing?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Now I‚Äôm more a former freelancer, the most difficult thing is to start, I have to take work with not very fair pay and do it very well for getting good reviews and filling my portfolio, after 5-6 jobs in a portfolio of difficulties, as a rule, does not arise <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: Habr has been updated tonight, you have already managed to see it, what are your first impressions?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark: I</b> only looked at a glimpse until I liked it: the layout went to the Opera, the icons are unusual, RSS is buggy.  In principle, nothing new seems to be there.  I was surprised that they changed the numbering of the pages with the vaunted back to the direct, I like the direct, of course, but still ... <br><br>  <b>The greedy ghoul: And how do you like the community in general? It seems that lately there were too many ‚Äúyellow‚Äù topics, many people are preoccupied with their karma, everything turned into ‚Äúwriting‚Äù karma, constant holivary?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> I do not know ... in the blogs I read, everything seems to be fine.  In general, the community is good <br><br>  <b>Avid Ghoul: And other thematic media projects, auto-cad, dribbler.</b>  <b>How do you like them?</b>  <b>Don't you think they are stumped?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> I did not particularly consider them.  Autokadabru because  I don't have a car, but a dribbler ... I don't even know why.  Probably, I am also cool towards sports. <br>  <b>Avid Ghost: Name five programs, without which you can‚Äôt think about your work?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> they are not five :) <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> <br>  Total commander <br>  Opera, FireFox + FireBug, IE <br>  PDT, IDEA <br>  Thunderbird <br>  Feeddemon <br>  Araxis Merge <br>  SmartSVN <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> you can continue, but it's for a long time ... I love the convenient software <br><br>  <b>Avid Ghoul: Is there any favorite expression or expression that can characterize your present state of mind?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Favorite expression: ‚ÄúThese bees suspect something‚Äù :) <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Guess where ... <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: Our Winnie the Pooh ... a great cartoon!</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> He is the most <br><br>  <b>The greedy upyr: What sites in your reader?</b>  <b>If you can name a few?</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> about 540 feeds <br><br>  <b>The greedy ghoul: ufff ...</b> <br><br>  <b>Sam Dark:</b> Yes, I am an information maniac :) <br>  <b>The greedy upyr: I would like to wish you good luck and most importantly find the time and energy to implement your plans and maybe surprise us all with your project.</b>  <b>Thanks for the chat.</b>  <b>It was nice to chat!</b> <br>  <b>Sam Dark: Thank you.</b> <br><br>  Crosspost <a href="http://sed-plata.ru/2008/08/12/sam-dark-voronezhskij-podzhigatel/">Avidny Upyr</a> </hh></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36757/</a></p>
