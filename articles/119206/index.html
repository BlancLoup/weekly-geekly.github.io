    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Movies and music </h4><br><br>  Imagine that you are the director.  I, of course, do not fully understand this topic and can make mistakes, but: <br>  - you create a script; <br>  - type team; <br>  - shoot and move between sets as your team; <br>  - modify the video on the computer; <br><br>  After that, you calculate the total amount spent on the film.  It is logical that you want to get a little profit for it, so you add value to it (as the saying goes - from the ceiling) and get the amount for which you are ready to sell your creation, into which you ‚Äúhammered‚Äù a lot of money, time and forces  You give your film to a distributor who also does an extra cost so that he can pay for the work of his employees and get some profit for himself.  The cost of the film increases. <br><br><ol><li>  People buy, watch, evaluate, advise to watch / not watch - the director, depending on the profit, understands that he is an <s>asshole a</s> bad director or vice versa, and whether the topic is interesting or not. </li><li>  People do not download licensed thanks to pirates, and partially enriching the pirates in terms of the material side (money) or the intangible side (thanks for the act and increasing its self-esteem and / or fame).  You, as a director, do not understand the interest of the audience, do not cover the costs and, depending on the situation, forget about this topic or continue to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù it further. </li></ol><br><br>  In the first version: everyone is happy.  If the director realized that the topic was not interesting, he would not film the continuation of this film or raise this topic in his career.  If the subject of the film is like, and the director, thanks to the first film, received money for a new film - he makes a sequel. <br><br>  The second option: <br><ul><li>  the director did not understand public opinion and bends an interesting topic; </li><li>  the director did not understand public opinion and does not bend a bad topic. </li></ul><br><br>  From time to time to the films come out "teasers", which highlight the interest of the film.  Of course, often only the most interesting and spectacular moments are posted there, but if you made the decision to go to the film, no one forced you.  Yes, you lured, tried to interest.  And they did it.  To blame other people for weakness is ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. <br><br>  To say that ‚Äúa movie is bad, money wasted in vain‚Äù is easy.  But why do you blame other people for this if you <b>yourself did the act of</b> going to this movie. <br><br>  You downloaded a movie from the Internet, watched it, you arranged it / did not arrange it.  But you took advantage of the results of an alien, albeit low-quality work, without paying anything for it.  Why do you think that you are right <s>and you can't pay for this shit</s> ?  But why, without even knowing about the quality of the labor of others, do you use it?  Once taken advantage of, then pay for it.  Your subjective opinion about quality is worthy of respect, but so that you can express it, then use the service to the full ... <br><br><h4>  Programs </h4><br><br>  In principle, it is also possible to say about programs, only a person estimates the cost of the time spent, coffee and liver, as well as the cost of his intellectual work. <br>  If you are not satisfied with the cost of software - this is not a reason to engage in its piracy.  Saying that "I would have made such a program much cheaper and more qualitative," why did you not do it instead of engaging in piracy? <br>  Many programs provide Trial or limited versions - rate the quality of the product. <br>  If you are not satisfied with the quality of the product, then create your own.  Do not know how?  But despite this, you estimate the hour of work of another person according to your own subjective notions without extra charge of a person and say that this is an excuse for piracy. <br>  Example: my time for one job is ~ 170 rubles, and for the second ~ 900 rubles.  Each work I devote a certain amount of time, effort and mental abilities (we all know how tired the body is from 8 hours of ‚Äúthinking‚Äù).  So, I will evaluate my work time on the program as 900 rubles plus the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program, the implementation of algorithms, time and money spent on training.  Why should I then evaluate my work for 170 rubles per hour, or even less.  According to some people, I generally have to do it for free. <br>  You are not satisfied with my product?  Create your own.  No opportunity / strength / knowledge or just laziness - these are your problems.  Pay for the product.  Being engaged in piracy, you violate my rights.  You are not satisfied with the terms of the agreement?  So do not use. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br><br>  All this is a subjective opinion and, in any moment, I could make mistakes, but I hope I conveyed the essence.  You can find fault with words - I will not comment on such issues, since such a topic is redundant and not interesting. <br><br>  To take someone else's is not good.  Can't you do it yourself?  Take advantage of the fact that there are and abide by the conditions that are indicated in the license agreement.  Being engaged in a piracy, you steal my / someone's money - you should pay for a copy, and appropriate money to yourself. <br>  Is the program bad?  You yourself have made this choice.  The license agreement is also a contract.  And it is bilateral.  And if the manufacturer didn‚Äôt fulfill or fulfilled the terms of the agreement badly, then under the contract you have the right to demand money back (I don‚Äôt know the whole scheme for sure - not a lawyer, correct, if not right, however, I was often returned money for poor-quality software). <br><br>  I wish you success! <br><br>  <b>UDP</b> : a good, in my opinion, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/119206/">comment</a> from the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/aleks_pingvin/" class="user_link">aleks_pingvin</a> , which reveals the essence of the Russian user. <br><br>  <b>UDP 2</b> : I do not occupy either side of the conflict.  I perfectly understand that many moments, how to download from the Internet and watch a movie are much easier than to go somewhere, choose and wait ... But it‚Äôs silly to say that it‚Äôs right and good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119206/</a></p>
