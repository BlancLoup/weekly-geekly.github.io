Flash graphics from investfunds.ru and fincake.ru are not loaded into a mobile safari, and out of 600,000 depositors in mutual funds in Russia, many are likely to be iPhone users.  I fired up to realize this idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28c/e48/943/28ce48943bac7faf9b2cae9b090d841e.png" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a>  It's funny that apps for iPhones can also be treated as a risky investment (no matter if you do everything yourself or ‚Äúbuy someone else's time‚Äù) - in case of failure, you will have a small loss (entry into this business costs 1,000 euros, to open your cafe not an example more expensive), in case of success - experience, connections, and a profitable deposit on the Apple Store.  Who as lucky. <br><br>  Implementation <br><br>  I always liked Apple Stokes - the default application for iPhone to view the course of its shares.  Climbing out to the smallest detail, it has the only negative - the interest to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the stock price of Microsoft appears to me only under the same circumstances that many of my friends ‚Äúlook at the composition of the deodorant‚Äù.  But if it comes to your own money - especially when you have the opportunity to monitor the growth of your share - it is quite another thing.  I wanted to give her a little more than ‚Äúinformal look‚Äù: the pros have long had RBKs and bloomberg, but it seems no one has thought of those who want to check the quotes ‚Äúonce every few weeks‚Äù. <br><br>  During my work on my applications, I made two discoveries for myself: first, it doesn‚Äôt matter how detailed and concise you wrote the Terms of Reference to the designers - an option that you will work with will not be what you intended, but in which There is a special highlight.  Predicting where and how such a highlight will appear is almost impossible.  Secondly, a great and ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù web designer can make a shaped disgrace;  similarly, a designer with average abilities can make a ‚Äúwow.‚Äù  The rule is not universal, but statistically valid: if you only assemble your team, it is worth entrusting the ‚Äútest page‚Äù to several designers at once, the application will be more expensive, but much better. <br><br>  Stokes as reference;  four designers, four pictures.  Will your preferences match mine? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/512/9ec/695/5129ec6955c2c4d0cf356d2fc2c23ac8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba9/a5b/377/ba9a5b377a196183cc0a67f1362eb4fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a66/da7/773/a66da7773642d310b4b6ed7dead5b2f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/062/c30/201/062c3020187624579f4733646f068923.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Design. <br><br>  Choosing what you like, we begin to conjure over the details.  The bottom of the screen is purely intuitive, I want to slide further, but since such functionality is not intended, the impression of "incompleteness" must be eliminated: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/670/338/2ef670338fa510e52eb46219dfe0c6d1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We conjure above the top icons to find a compromise between ‚Äúoriginality‚Äù and ‚Äúapple guidelines‚Äù.  We make the decision to play with the flowers, but ‚Äúleave the zest‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/7ba/d16/d107bad16915904d00d88fa0d02e0d49.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We work on font size and secondary elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f0/0fc/708/2f00fc708b0bb52e46132fee47cdf7f7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Icon. <br><br>  There are almost no people on free-lance.ru to recommend;  I advise you to start your search from the English-language dribbble.com.  I was greatly amused by the fact that Californian iconchildren with a very strong portfolio asked only a little more than high-quality domestic designers. <br><br>  I associate charts of courses with a rolled up newspaper, which was left on a table in a cafe with an unfinished cup of coffee.  I tell my designer about my idea and in a few days I get the first sketch: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a76/b61/dbb/a76b61dbb91d5659d04da453fab884c8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We are trying to get rid of the "wild west" and redraw the icon in the colors of the application: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d97/c76/33a/d97c7633a0aa3bbb3af2b5563d650eaf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But we are moving in the wrong direction, turn around and start work from the beginning.  I leaf through my monthly breinstorming: <br><br>  and what if the newspaper does not lie on a certain green surface, but is attached to the wall with darts?  or a few darts, as if bullet marks, and the graph ‚Äúruns away‚Äù from them upwards?  or is the zagagulina drawn down with a marker, but is the chart actually going up?  or is the schedule tied up in a knot, as it does not happen in reality, but then it goes up?  or some kind of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù schedule, but a quasi-draw is drawn with a marker.  or vice versa, with the marker "plan of attack", as on military maps.  Or maybe money sticks out because of the newspaper, or in general the money is ‚Äúwrapped in a newspaper‚Äù as smuggling, such as with our package?  or, say, the left half in color, and on this half there is already a graph, and the right one ‚Äúunder the pencil‚Äù seems to be a sketch, and there is no graph on it? <br><br>  We pack a couple of pages of text in 72x72 pixels and get the first sketch: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1c/705/e02/b1c705e022dfd0a32cc2d96fa3d97036.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We work on the form and details: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c60/cd1/9cd/c60cd19cd86aa90e8ac0e3d27ed0ad4c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc6/300/d78/cc6300d7895602cde4c47f4eb31e2ef4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Change the palette: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f00/2ec/c97/f002ecc97225209c0286e510d4954c81.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We get rid of extra details in smaller icons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef0/c68/287/ef0c682877306ea644c5c1b432b43594.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The final touches. <br><br>  Fashionable marketing books often offer opposing advice: from ‚Äúfocus on the essentials‚Äù to ‚Äúall attention to detail‚Äù.  God knows how it really is, but when developing apps, one thing is fair: to postpone it for a couple of days, and come back again - better after a short holiday - but with a fresh, unfriendly look. <br><br>  After a couple of days, we add the final touches: a small arrow ‚Äúunder OS Lion‚Äù to make the selection of periods more visual and polish the icon to leave only the main elements in it.  We are finalizing the secondary screen: we have two active buttons in the header, but it is obvious that when entering the number of shares in the property, only one must be active - to confirm the input value.  Yes, and the top buttons themselves should be highlighted with a finger: the designer forgot about it in his original sketch, but I should remember this before the release of the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28c/e48/943/28ce48943bac7faf9b2cae9b090d841e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eda/da6/9e2/edada69e28e7e4aa6b095a70c673a762.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4b/085/ced/f4b085cedfe59c56e6542e8a4494dfb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My colleague Andrey Vinogradov, who is responsible for testing the application, not without reason believes that it is worth updating an already finished application a couple of times a month, so that users would ‚Äúnot forget‚Äù about it - a red circle against the App Store icon will remind you that installed on your phone and - maybe - make you recommend it to your friends.  I hold the opinion that ‚Äúit is worth building for centuries‚Äù, and after two dozen fixes, the twentieth (after the first alpha version) build goes to appstore.  I added a ‚Äúwrite to developers‚Äù button to purposefully collect feedback on the application in my mailbox: in a couple of weeks 1.1 will be released, which is supposed to be final. <br><br>  Promo. <br><br>  K7AMLRNY4PML <br>  F43TWXXYHL7K <br>  9K9WTKTMMFX4 <br>  KRKPHWP3LEXY <br>  PR9XNPXYFE4T <br>  Y6HJML6XWNAP </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126947/</a></p>
