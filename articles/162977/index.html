  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hey, marketers, what's wrong with you? Or about promoting free apps.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My consulting experience suggests that there are two professions that everyone understands.  This is people management and marketing.  You can be sure that you will receive a bunch of tips on this topic, you just have to give a hint that you are doing something. <br><br>  A week ago, I wrote an article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162121/">How much does it cost to create an application or the whole truth about money</a> ."  And, of course, many interesting, useless and harmful tips were voiced in the comments. <br><br>  The main problem is that our marketing is either philistine (‚Äúit seems to me that it should be like this‚Äù) or book marketing (‚Äúbut Kotler says that ...‚Äù).  In the first version, the councils are a mixture of banalities with stereotypes, in the second, knowledge is outdated by half a century.  Doing marketing on books, it's just the same as working on PCX86 - it seems you can, but what‚Äôs the point?

The rating method is subjective, not proven, except for your own feelings. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Rating of the most harmful marketing tips: </h4><br><br><h4>  1. The hunt for piranha.  Formulate a target audience and sharpen marketing for it. </h4><br><br>  To understand who will use your application takes 5-7 minutes.  If you need more, then you have a problem with the concept of the application, and not with marketing.  But the greatest harm lies in the phrase "sharpen marketing." <br><br>  All this absurdity comes from the times when each copy of the product was worth a lot of money, and the sales were personal.  And accordingly, the seller always had a choice - to which of the potential buyers to go.  Who argues - do not sell Maybach in South Butovo. <br><br>  But with free apps, it's not like that.  Your target audience is everyone who has a device.  A copy costs you nothing.  But each installation raises you in the rating.  Even if it is a grandmother in deep sclerosis downloaded to the phone of her grandson. <br><br><h5>  The barely axiom: </h5><br>  Never narrow your audience.  Maximize your audience as much as your project concept allows. <br><br><h4>  2. Thirst is nothing, image is everything.  Make a website, brand, print in cool offline publications. </h4><br><br>  The task of marketing is not to amuse the self-esteem of the creators - the task of marketing is to attract the consumer.  Website creation rarely costs less than $ 1,000.  To recoup even this thousand free application you need (with monetization of 10 cents) to download your application 10,000 times from the site.  According to my data, the conversion from a profile site (writing about applications) does not exceed 15%.  That is, you need to get at least 50,000 unique visitors to your site.  Where do they come from?  With a keyword search?  A website is a product that in itself requires separate marketing ... As they say, in order to sell something unnecessary, you need to buy something that is not necessary, but we have no money.  Offline publications as expensive as meaningless.  Conversion from ‚Äúpaper‚Äù to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù makes even experienced sergeants cry. <br><br><h5>  The barely axiom: </h5><br>  Do image things to a minimum.  The site is exactly that, so it was not a shame, and it could be shown to colleagues, investors and publishers.  The video is nice and clear.  To consumers, your site or video is generally not needed if you do not offer something unique on it. <br><br><h4>  3. Agency OBS.  Go to social networks, chat on blogs, engage in SMM. </h4><br><br>  A pack of fighting trolls, trained in the secrets of network marketing in the monasteries of Shaolin will provide you with the development of a group on Facebook, capture twitter and forums ... Marketing on social networks is of course cool.  But the question again arises - how and how much will it cost?  If you have a group per 100,000 people, this in itself is a project that will have to deal with for a long time.  And the advertising budget for the collection of a group of 100k - in itself is very significant.  Many applications are sold in a bunch of countries - by whom and how will you communicate in Dutch or Swedish?  Who will write posts to the group and moderate it?  As long as your customer base is close to millions, you do not need it and can not afford it.  And if you have millions of users, it‚Äôs not for me to advise you. <br><br><h5>  The barely axiom: </h5><br>  You do not have the strength and money to do network marketing and development at the same time.  So - choose who you are - application creators or bloggers and network identities. <br><br><h4>  4. Antibiotics are useless.  Create a viral video.  Run a viral ad. </h4><br><br>  How?  Tell me how to create a viral video?  If you can create a video that people will send to each other - what's stopping you from creating an application that people send to each other?  And why did you decide that the usual "ignition" of a viral video is not worth the money?  Budgets there are beginning to approach the advertising budgets of applications.  And why, pray tell, are you sure that people will like it and they will spam friends and enemies with links to your masterpiece? <br><br><h5>  The barely axiom: </h5><br>  If you believe in luck - go to the casino.  There at least everything will be fast and in a good atmosphere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162977/</a></p>
