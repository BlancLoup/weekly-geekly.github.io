  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CRM for students</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Anyone who has recently been or is at the moment as a student of a specialty directly or indirectly connected with IT, surely, more than once or twice raised his hands to heaven in the question: "How long !?" Of all the bottomless ocean of students' problems in the learning process <s>(minus laziness, freedom, alcohol, women, etc.)</s> I identified three key points that require serious automatization.  Three wishes.  Like in a dream. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1. <b>Organization of information</b> </h5><br>  To keep up with the time, in the educational process textbooks are relegated to the second and even third plan.  More and more information and materials, especially in recent courses, reach students in the form of printouts, electronic link files and just search keywords.  This practice, undoubtedly, is very conducive to improving the skills of orienting a young IT professional in the vast expanses of the worldwide network, however, at the same time, it has a negative effect on the organization of all this material.  Now you can‚Äôt put together a stack of textbook and synopsis for full preparation.  As a result, a monstrous information dump is being formed, which somehow organize a huge problem, not something that is normal for it to prepare for crediting events.  This is the problem number one. <br><br><h5>  2. <b>Communication</b> </h5><br>  Communication of students and teachers.  Of course, there are lectures and seminars, but who among us did not run with a tongue on his shoulder in a glorious hunt for a teacher, who did not watch at the doors of the chairs, who did not spend time waiting for audiences at the door.  In essence, the contact between the student and the teacher outside the classroom is not just complicated, but extremely complex.  And this sometimes becomes a matter of life and death (in the context of the student's value system, of course).  This problem is somehow solved by the mass acquisition of teachers by e-mail, but in an emergency situation, the search for contacts of the right teacher is still chaotic and almost religious.  This is problem number two. <br><br><h5>  3. <b>Writing</b> (and announcements). </h5><br>  This I left for dessert as the most blatant manifestation of the unpredictability of life, the inscrutability of the ways of the Lord, and other manifestations of chthonic chaos in the life of students.  The exact schedule, as the weather forecast is known only for yesterday.  Two to three weekly cycles of classes, alternation of lectures and seminars, classes in different buildings for different groups on different days, and other wonderful things.  this problem currently has no real solution, besides the surprising product of evolution, some students extrasensory perception of schedule changes at the level of oscillations of thin subspace membranes <s>(popularly referred to as ‚Äúrectal sense‚Äù)</s> .  Therefore, tardiness, confusion, skips, warm-ups and the like takes place on an alarming scale.  This is problem number three.

    <h5>  <b>gold fish</b> </h5><br>  By the nature of my activities relating to information systems in general and CRM in particular, it suddenly became clear to me, as a day, that it is CRM technologies that can offer a comprehensive solution to all these problems. <br>  A centralized system that includes a repository of materials for students, as well as a database of students themselves for teachers, their progress, reports, project themes, and all that the instructors in thick, greasy diaries keep.  Information about the teachers themselves, up to the availability of a system of accounts.  Well, at least email addresses and phone numbers.  Electronic schedule with auto-notification of all changes.  Here is a brief list of what such a system may include.  The presence of a database of students' academic performance will significantly simplify reporting and monitoring, will allow for a variety of analysis and similar joys.  And, of course, access to all this happiness online. <br><br><h5>  <b>Tina sea</b> </h5><br>  Partly such functions are attempting to take on university Internet portals, but, as a student of one of the most advanced universities in this regard, I cannot say that they are coping with it. <br><br>  A little dusting the expanses of the world, I found several analogues.  But all of them for one reason or another are not suitable for the homeland of Pushkin and Dostoevsky.  The most interesting option for me seemed to be the BlackBoard system, but the specificity of our country, the teaching staff and some experience of various kinds of implementations tells me that it will be easier to develop your own solution and implement it already, rather than painfully adapting an alien solution (although this is another question). <br><br>  I would like to hear the opinions of habrovchan at the expense of voiced problems and ideas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117922/</a></p>
