  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bullying 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Introducing my new story.  Genre: fiction, cyberpunk.  My readers usually complain that the stories are short, and the intrigue is revealed too quickly, so this story is longer than usual, they asked for it themselves =). <br><hr><br><h2>  Bullying 2.0 </h2>  I sat in the office and lazily looked through the mail.  No new orders.  This has been going on for a couple of weeks.  My computer detective agency, consisting of one person, me, was not very popular.  There was no money for PR, and there were mainly orders from old acquaintances or their friends.  Sad thought broke the telephone call. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  My mood has increased.  Interaction with people of this rank promised to be interesting.  Yes, and in the event of a successful solution to the problem, advertising will be just great. <br><br>  Boris did not take long to arrive and arrived in ten minutes.  We shook hands. He went to the computer and opened his mailbox in the browser - there were 87010 letters.  A red message indicates that the box is full.  Without looking at the headers of the letters, Boris selected all the letters and deleted them.  And ... when the page was refreshed after deletion, the counter of new letters already showed about 100. <br>  Boris took off his glasses and rubbed his tired eyes from the monitor.  Boris left without saying goodbye, keeping his eyes on the poster hanging on the door.  I also decided not to waste time in vain and requested all the necessary data from the security service.  They have already been warned and promptly provided information.  Volumes of bullying are just amazed. <br><br>  Harassment-spam ... For the first time in my life, I even sympathized with Boris.  The thing is not an ordinary, the way of baiting is absolutely incomprehensible and defies any explanation.  But, damn it, people are definitely behind this, and not some UFO.  Therefore, a technical search is hardly appropriate here, you need to think about the human factor.  My task is to stop spamming.  I will find people who are behind this - I will solve the problem.  And at the same time and the way will be known.

      I decided to concentrate on email addresses and instant messengers contacts for instant messaging, Jabber and ICQ.  After analyzing the sender contacts, it became clear that they were somehow related.  Form a chain, moreover, visible to the naked eye almost any search engine.  If you search for one contact in order to find the addresses associated with the original one, then those found will also appear in the list of pickers of poor Boris.  It is important to find the root contacts.  The beginning of time.  The task is not trivial, so it‚Äôs still necessary to work.  It's time to stretch your fingers. <br><br>  Overlaid with packs of cigarettes, cans of energy drinks, and a jug of cold coffee, I launched the development environment label, which was already overgrown with virtual dust. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br><br>  The night passed terribly.  Thousands of written lines, hundreds of erased ... Cigarette smoke clearly felt like the owner in the room and swam even inside the system unit, as evidenced by the fierce squeaking of fans.  At about four o'clock in the morning I almost fell asleep right on the keyboard, but by dawn I managed to get a code similar to the truth. <br><br>  The next week was intense.  I drove the written scripts on three computers to analyze the connections of the contact workers with search engines and various social networks. <br><br>  Computer analysis to solve the problem was clearly not under force, and in the services where Boris turned, probably not fools are sitting and have already tried similar methods.  The only thing that could have been supposed by the results was that the pickers were definitely Russians.  Although it is easy to guess about this and so, Boris is not so well known abroad. <br><br>  It is necessary to include the head.  Almost all connections between groups in serious social networks come from recruitment agents.  Personnel play the role of conductors in this intricate web.  But how to isolate the original circle, the original contacts? <br><br>  The thing is truly fantastic.  So it is necessary to look for fantastic solutions. <br><br>  I changed the parameters of my scripts for analysis so that, at the output, I would get more or less isolated groups of people connected by interests in the most recent IT developments.  It is necessary to look for specialists of the highest class with vast experience, at the same time young enough.  It is hard to imagine that children or old people would engage in this persecution.  Surely, these are ambitious young people whom Boris has annoyed, voluntarily or involuntarily. <br><br>  Of course, one would be engaged in scrupulous work, isolating these people from the other end.  But, given Boris‚Äôs fame, one can imagine that such work would require hundreds, even man-hours, and man-years.  This is clearly not my way. <br><br>  The script gave an estimate of working time: two days.  Well, it remains only to wait ... <br><br>  *** <br>  <i>This was the first part!</i>  <i>=) The second part will be published in two days.</i> <br><br>  UPD: And here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_talented/38987.html" title="The second part of the Travli">she is</a> :) <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22626/</a></p>
