  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tsypa-dripa TsA-TsA-TsA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you understood from the title, today we will focus on the target audience.  Nothing pleases a client more than an attempt to sell him a product, the Central Asia of which he is not.  Do not sell validol athletes.  Or sports nutrition lovers of beer.  Fun?  And then ... In the software and B2B sales sector, for some reason, some companies forget about it.  And here we hear from all sides: ‚ÄúThe best CRM in the Russian Federation‚Äù, ‚ÄúCRM for all‚Äù, ‚ÄúCRM No. 1‚Äù.  A smart man immediately wonders.  Best for whom?  So that you do not have such questions, we decided to clearly describe our Central Asia.  Then ‚Äúour‚Äù customers will immediately understand that this is their CRM, and ‚Äúnot ours‚Äù customers will not spend their valuable time on testing and trial launch of YoollaCRM, immediately switching to other solutions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9af/28c/99f/9af28c99f2b8493287c0bc5257c03250.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So!  If you: <br><ul><li>  a travel company that is eager to please each client and pick up a cool tour for him from more than 20 operators, displaying it all in the client's card.  Congratulations!  You are NOT our customer.  <i>Explanation: Usually such companies require an ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù pick-up of tours.</i>  <i>Or the aggregator of tours from all sites of all operators with whom they work.</i>  <i>With the further possibility of choosing a tour already from everyone and linking the history of all searches for tours for each client.</i>  <i>We do not have such functionality and are not expected yet.</i>  <i>Such clients addressed us and we politely refused them</i> . </li><li>  Real estate agency, which stores more than 20,000 options for apartments, houses and plots, and you want for our clients in our CRM to make various selections based on geotags and filters of complex samples (number of floors, area, presence of a grandmother at the entrance).  Congratulations!  You are NOT our customer!  <i>Explanation: these companies also need first a database aggregator from all real estate sites that they know and further work with this data.</i>  <i>Writing an aggregator for real estate sites is a separate ‚Äúsong‚Äù and we will not sing it yet.</i> </li><li>  The owner of an online store of consumer goods.  No matter what.  Congratulations!  You are NOT our client either.  <i>Explanation: We do not have sections that track delivery or order status.</i>  <i>We do not have an emphasis on the individual as a client.</i>  <i>We do not have a comprehensive catalog of goods for 50,000 items, which is on the websites of online stores.</i> </li><li>  Training (training) company.  Coaches, driving courses, development centers, training centers, etc.  You are all NOT our customers.  <i>Explanation: for such enterprises it is required to maintain the schedule, the employment of groups, teachers, classrooms or cars.</i>  <i>In YoollaCRM this is nothing.</i> </li></ul><br>  If we combine all these non-customers, then we can derive an almost universal rule NOT a CLIENT.  If the business is focused on fast and one-off sales in the B2C sector, then this is not our client.  There may be exceptions.  But the general idea is correct.  Our CRM targets the B2B sector.  On active sales.  For long and medium deals.  From a couple of days to several months.  It is these customers that we welcome in the ranks of our users.  So who are they?  Scroll!  In the Studio!  So, if you: <br><ul><li>  Production company with a focus on personal approach.  These can be: the production of advertising structures, the production of clothing for production, the production of electrical cabinets for the needs of enterprises (possibly with installation, possibly without), the production of custom-made software, the construction company, the DSU, printing houses, the production of metal structures and many, many others production workers, or trade and production workers.  <a href="http://yoolla.ru/">YoollaCRM</a> for such companies provides for easy issuance of a set of arbitrary documents, control of payment terms, financial planning.  I, intentionally, do not write about banal things, such as calendars, reminders and customer list :-).  It `s naturally. </li><li>  Service company that has regular customer payments.  For example, maintenance of elevators, refrigerators, computers.  These companies need to regularly submit documents and monitor payments.  These mechanisms are implemented in YoollaCRM and help save staff a lot of time. </li><li>  Trading company in the field of B2B.  Sale of metal, chemicals, fertilizers, raw materials, equipment, spare parts, components and assemblies.  Even selling advertising space or time.  Such companies are important, each client and all contacts with him.  In addition, YoollaCRM contains a detailed product catalog, which helps managers to better navigate the selling positions.  See their images, know all their technical characteristics: size, weight, composition, steel grade, additional options, etc.  All this functionality is incorporated in the catalog and can dynamically change for each company.  In addition, in our CRM there is a knowledge base.  This is a kind of Wiki inside the company, which is replenished by the employees themselves.  After reading which, the beginner will not have the question ‚Äúis the VHy67-2012.4 node suitable for operation in harsh winter conditions‚Äù. </li><li>  Insurance and credit brokers.  This is the only exception that we know about from the B2C sector.  Although, as you know, these services exist in the B2B market.  For these companies, we also have in store: document templates, knowledge base, and e-mail mailing lists.  These tools will facilitate the issuance of contracts, the calculation of rates on loans and insurance, as well as, mass notification of customers about new products or promotions. </li></ul><br><br>  Here, in brief, the entire list of our target audience.  If you do not find yourself in this list, it does not mean that <a href="http://yoolla.ru/">YoollaCRM is</a> not for you.  Perhaps you are just making up a very small segment of the market and we did not consider you in our review.  In any case, try Yoolla, write reviews, and we will try to make it even better.  Not for all.  Only for your target audience.  :-) </div>
