Humidity is also important only in the active period. </p><br><p>  In my opinion, there is not enough noise sensor - its intensity together with temperature and humidity can tell about the beginning swarming. </p><br><p>  Let us dwell on the temperature: </p><br><p>  One sensor is relatively informative only in summer, when the bees actively move the air in the hive space - they do not allow it to overheat and "evaporate" the water from the honey. </p><br><p>  In the winter, they are knocked into a "tangle" of about 15 cm in diameter, fall into a half-sleep and migrate in honeycombs, eating honey stored for the winter. </p><br><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãmovement in the 12-frame "Dadane" - 40x40x30cm (DR-V), measuring the "average temperature in the hospital" under the ceiling is useless. </p><br><p>  <strong>The extreme minimum, in my opinion - 4 sensors at a height of 10 cm from the top of the frame - squared 20x20cm.</strong> </p><br><p>  Humidity - yes, in the podshnikhnik, electric microphone - where bees will not close it with propolis. </p><br><p>  Now about the humidity </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c1/b59/732/2c1b597324143fda3b631ba25293a6c1.jpg" alt="Realhive"></p><br><p>  Eating honey over the winter, bees emit more than 10 liters of moisture! </p><br><p>  Do you think it will add health to the foam hive? </p><br><p>  Would you like to live in a house of such material? </p><br><p>  How about honey with toxins? </p><br><p>  Polyfoam at a temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius allocates them oh, as a lot - it is heated to her hive inside in summer. </p><br><p>  The walls of the hive must 'breathe' like thermal underwear - optimally - wood - planing outside, inside - no - and not painting in any case! </p><br><p>  And finally, as I think to do it: </p><br><p>  Remember in the beginning I talked about the price of the issue? </p><br><p>  I put it at the forefront, but because while the weight sensor - in the furnace. </p><br><p>  Basic set: </p><br><p>  The microcontroller - Atmega328P, in sleep mode, power for example - crown via dc-dc (no solar panels!). </p><br><p>  "Frame" with the device - MK, power, 4 temperature sensors, humidity sensor, microphone, external connector for connecting modules. </p><br><p>  Extensions: </p><br><p>  LCD1602 based indicator (maybe one for the whole apiary) </p><br><p>  Wi-fi / bluetooth - in general, wireless modules for control from a smartphone. </p><br><p>  So, gentlemen, interested in your opinion - </p><br><ol><li>  How interesting will the development of this topic be to the Habr community? </li><li>  A good idea for a startup? </li><li>  Any constructive criticism is welcome! </li></ol><br><p>  With you was IT beekeeper Andrew. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63f/3e5/dae/63f3e5dae517ad4f31aefe61a16694ea.jpg" alt="Realhive"></p><br><p>  To new meetings on Habr√©! </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD Truth is born in disputes, in the discussion on Habr-e - it is corrected!</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Determined with iron and methods - the minimum set for one hive (3 parameters - temperature, humidity, noise level) + battery control</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>battery capacity should be enough in the active season - for a month, during the wintering period - for 5</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>PS And yes, infa will be given via WiFi</strong> <br>  <strong>PPS It remains to make a prototype</strong> </p></div>
