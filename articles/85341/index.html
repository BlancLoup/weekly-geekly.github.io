Of course, the situation may change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b5c/3ba/f2e/b5c3baf2e50fa28e10f8f517fd8aac50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the editors of <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/347011/Google_Microsoft_Apple_Who_Will_Thrive_">Computerworld</a> wondered: since each of the companies mentioned peeks at a bold piece of its opponents, which of them is best prepared for the near future, and who is more likely to lose the fight?

    <a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Apple </h2><br>  Despite the fact that Apple is now at the height and things are going uphill, the company is the most vulnerable of these three giants.  This is due to the fact that Apple‚Äôs success is built on the unique insight and talent of one person - Steve Jobs. <br><br>  For most companies, replacing one CEO with another will not really change anything, and the company will exist as before.  In the case of Apple, this is far from being the case; Apple is Jobs.  Until his return to the company in late 1996, Apple floundered and tried to survive.  He closed unprofitable projects (such as Newton, for example);  under his keen attention developed several super-successful projects: Mac OS X, iPod, iPhone and iMac;  he restored the company.  Last year, the respected Harvard Buisness Review magazine recognized him as the most valuable senior executive in the world, because under the leadership of Jobs, Apple increased its market value by $ 150 billion. <br><br>  This is both good and bad news for Apple.  While Jobs is in business - everything is fine.  (note from Vitol: the phrase sounds funny in English: "Jobs is on the job").  But he will not lead companies forever, and nearby there is no one comparable to him in vision and flair.  According to Preston Gralla from Computerworld, with his departure, Apple will move into a phase of a long and slow decline. <br><br>  Apple's business model, unlike those of Google and Microsoft, is very similar to that in the Hollywood film studio, which needs blockbuster hits to make serious profits.  When Jobs leaves, such hits will cease to appear. <br><br><h2>  Google </h2><br>  Among these three companies, more than others have a chance to flourish in the future.  She has almost a monopoly on search on the Internet, which is one of the key elements of the engine of economic growth of the world economy.  This gives Google an excellent foundation for expanding and financing new directions. <br><br>  Although sometimes the company shows a spontaneous and unsystematic approach to promoting its products, Google has firmly focused on fast-growing sectors, especially the mobile device market.  In this regard, Google is well prepared to capitalize on the boom in mobile advertising that is expected in the coming years.  And although Google most likely will not be able to make a serious competition to Microsoft in the field of operating systems and applications, it will still get enough revenue in its other areas to become at least a strong player in this business. <br><br><h2>  Microsoft </h2><br>  Finally, there is Microsoft, which can be placed somewhere between Apple and Google.  Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not need megahits for its growth.  Taking a deadly grip on the market for operating systems and office applications, and having excellent and reliable corporate solutions, the company will constantly grow.  Google will not break almost the monopoly position of Microsoft. <br><br>  The success of Windows 7 has shown that the release of a new operating system can bring good profits.  Thanks to the rapid sales of Windows 7, Microsoft earned more revenue in the quarter than in the entire previous year.  On the other hand, although Microsoft will not be able to push Google away from the leadership in the field of search, Bing demonstrates the ability to earn good money in this matter. <br><br>  So, looking forward, we can assume that Google is waiting for a heyday, Microsoft will remain at about the same positions, and Apple will lose its magic, powered by Jobs. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/146621/2010/02/apple_microsoft_google.html">Macworld</a> for <a href="http://macovod.net/2010/02/google-apple-microsoft-kogo-zhdyot-procvetanie/">Makovod</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85341/</a></p>
