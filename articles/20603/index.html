  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Code of honor web advertiser and banner builder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet is of course the element of information.  This makes it extremely attractive for the advertising industry.  Where advertising is money.  And money spoils everything.  In pursuit of money, advertisers sometimes try to put more information that is favorable to them in our head, ‚Äúgetting into trouble‚Äù, i.e.  trite going to a legitimate but immoral deception of the user.  It may be a small deception - a penny and half a penny - but we encounter it a hundred times a day, and therefore we feel sad in the evening. <br><br>  I collected from pieces of statements by the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/novikov/" class="user_link">Novikov</a> , trying not to change their meaning, the following thesis: <br>  ‚ÄúA good advertising move, ... as a result of which the user (consumer) feels deceived, ... is a bad advertising move.‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, I propose to develop and popularize a certain ‚Äúcode of honor for a web advertiser‚Äù.  His task will be to protect us all (after all, we are all Internet users) from various abuses. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Some provisions that should, in my opinion, be present in the code: <br>  1. Not to depict standard controls on the banner, and not to mask entire banners as controls.  (meaning buttons, checkboxes, text fields).  Because  it's just a hoax. <br>  2. Do not blink in the banner vile frequencies and color combinations.  Remember, the user needs to maintain a good mood until the end of the day and good vision and a healthy psyche until the end of life. <br>  3. Actions attached to a control or an active zone must conform to the established traditions and intuitive assumptions of the average user: the ‚Äúclose‚Äù button should close the ad unit (or something else that it is located on), and not vice versa, open ten more. <br>  4. Do not lie in the texts of banners and sponsored links.  And do not publish messages that are deliberately misunderstood.  For example, the other day I saw the banner "Petrosian's wife died!".  Petrosyan's wife is Stepanenko.  And in the article that opened, it was reported that the wife of the former (ai, the word lost) Petrosyan‚Äôs wife died, with whom he divorced 10 years. I don‚Äôt say that my wife is less sorry for me than this one, but in a banner I was told a lie. <br>  5. Do not create rekamu, preventing technically or visually viewing target content.  I will focus on a technical obstacle: most browsers have a limit on the number of simultaneous connections initiated by one window.  Sometimes it happens that some cheeky banner networks place much more banners than their servers can pull.  And the browser for several ten seconds stands and waits for a response to a request from the server of the banner network, and the site, which generally loads quickly, stands and waits.  Sometimes it comes to the fact that I have to manually break connections through the firewall to the banner network server in order to enable the browser to load the page. <br>  6. The link from the banner should lead to the page directly related to the meaning of the banner itself.  If we advertise a news site in general, then you can not link to the main page, but if we inform about a specific news in a banner, then we must take it to the page where this news is central, in a pinch, where the final link to this news is good visible.  Objectively clearly visible!  Example: I see a banner <br>  [Professor Kapitsa: ‚ÄúThe new crisis is more dangerous than the plague and the world war‚Äù].  I click on this link, I wonder what prof.  Kapitsa, but instead I get to the main page of Izvestia.ru, I don‚Äôt see references to Kapitsa‚Äôs statement there and I feel deceived. <br>  7. (doubtful position).  Links from banners should be clear.  When I see the link (I specially break spaces into lines): <br><br>  http // rotabanner.izvestia.ru // cgi-bin / href / 3135? 13642 &amp; login = livejournal.  livejournal &amp; referer = http% 3A% 2F% 2Fads.sup.com% 2Fadv% 3Fi1% 3D10471882% 2 6vid% 3D160088033% 2 6r% 3D37 9162183% 26srv% 3D1% 2 6cp% 3Ds2.entry% 2 6i2% 3D104 71882% 26ad 3 3DJournal-Badge <br><br>  I can‚Äôt even imagine where it‚Äôs going to bring me, and, remembering about the constant deception on the Internet, I‚Äôll still think about whether to click or not.  I understand that my click needs to be calculated, but is it really impossible to do this with a clearer link?  This is all the more true for flash banners, which generally cannot be seen where the link leads. <br><br>  I will be glad to hear other suggestions and corrections to the code. <br>  The Internet is in a sense our house, and the house needs to be kept clean, is it not? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20603/</a></p>
