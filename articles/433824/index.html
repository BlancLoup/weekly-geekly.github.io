Qualitative transformation can only be carried out by the head of the enterprise, or very expensive consultants.  The changes will take years - with our blockheads on the ground.  No one will understand the essence of transformations, so no one can develop them.  Instead of one inert system, we get another - more efficient, but also inert.  Any relatively large change in market conditions will require a quick restructuring of the company, but we do not have people who are ready to understand and implement these changes. <br><br>  Or is there?  Maybe look around?  Who do we have besides the managers?  Sellers, designers, suppliers, marketers, personnel officers, accountants, storekeepers, production workers, workers, system administrators ... So who else?  Over there, what kind of guy is sitting in a corner, picking at the computer? <br><br>  This guy is a 1C programmer.  And he is the best candidate.  Do not believe?  This is normal, no one believes.  Including 1C programmer himself.  But it is a fact, alas. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Rest </h4><br>  I came to the conclusion that the 1C programmer is best suited for implementing changes, I came up in the course of working together on changes. <br><br>  Representatives of other professions do the best with submitting innovation proposals regarding their own work.  Maximum - related units.  Please note - it is the submission of proposals, and not their implementation, or, God forbid, an analysis of the impact on the company as a whole. <br><br>  Exceptions, of course, are, but they are not systemic, not related to a particular profession.  There are just people who are inclined to work on the changes, they see this as a buzz.  But these are units, if not fractions of a percent.  Unfortunately, there are many charlatans among them who, under the desire to ‚Äúchange something‚Äù, hide the banal unwillingness to work. <br><br>  Separate qualities necessary for working with changes are available for different professions.  But for real transformations, not individual qualities are needed, but their totality.  That it is concentrated in the 1C programmer. <br><br>  I will explain these qualities and features further, and you will understand why the rest cannot cope. <br><br><h4>  Horizon </h4><br>  One of the main qualities of a 1C programmer.  It's not about knowing all the songs of the King and the Jester, works by Rembrandt or foreign languages, but about the outlook in the business system. <br><br>  1C programmers are engaged in the automation of almost all the services of the company.  Therefore, they are forced to understand the specifics of the work of different professions.  Not very deep, not one hundred percent of the professions, but much wider and deeper in the aggregate than an employee in any other position. <br><br>  The accountant, it seems, also works with all services, but only through the prism of accounting.  Personnel - through the prism of charges.  The economist is also through accounting, only managerial.  This is like narrow specialists among doctors, and the 1C programmer is like a family doctor. <br><br>  Complements the outlook of the 1C programmer work in different companies, or on different projects, if he was in France.  Personally, it seems to me that every 1C programmer should work in French, precisely to broaden his horizons.  The main point is to see with your own eyes the same accounting processes in various industries, regions, companies. <br><br>  As you know, there is such a practice for managers, in Western companies - to lead through the entire company.  Week to sit in sales, then in supply, then in production, etc.  Understand the essence, spirit, problems of the profession and the department, without going into details. <br><br>  So, 1C programmer has already passed this practice.  In the changes without any outlook. <br><br><h4>  Abstract thinking </h4><br>  Banal, inherent to all programmers (not only 1C) quality.  Abstract thinking helps to systematize what a person sees, to find the general in the particular, and to understand the patterns. <br><br>  Well, the same thing in reverse.  Invent a general, or pattern, and apply to the particular phenomena of life. <br><br>  Without abstract thinking, changes will be tough.  Take the same theory of constraints.  If Goldratt‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Goal‚Äù is read by the production worker, he will see how production can be improved.  The supplier will see how to improve purchases.  And the 1C programmer will see how to improve any process, because he will understand: TOC is an abstract method. <br><br><h4>  Limitations of abstract thinking </h4><br>  Here it turns out funny.  In the world of ordinary (not 1C) programmers, it is believed that 1Sniki are poor because they work with a limited platform.  In particular, we are talking about abstractions. <br><br>  In most other platforms, the programmer can do, if not everything, then almost everything that his soul asks for.  Because in most platforms there is nothing pledged by its developers.  On the one hand, it is freedom.  On the other hand, it is the need to implement the same functionality each time (for the customer‚Äôs money). <br><br>  The 1C platform cuts freedom, especially in abstractions - they already exist.  Documents, directories, registers, reports, processing, etc.  Many years ago, developers decided that these abstractions would be enough to describe business systems.  At first, everyone quarreled, scolded, and then they got used to it. <br><br>  From the point of view of working with changes, this disadvantage magically turns into an advantage - there is no need to do much inventiveness, much better - the right combination of already known methods. <br><br>  Just take a look at the world of the rest of IT, outside of 1C.  They are chasing new technologies.  Blockchains, frameworks, face recognition, tracking and other heresy.  The meaning is the same: someone comes up with technology, someone tries to adapt it for real tasks, someone enters its business under the slogan "this is the future, have time to jump into the fleeing composition." <br><br>  1Sniks have spent their whole lives only on those who put real life in metadata.  The same is needed in the changes, only the metadata will be different (let's talk about this separately). <br><br><h4>  Philosophy of profession </h4><br>  The most probably difficult perceived quality, but personally it seems to me the most important.  The 1C programmer only deals with what changes.  Changes - his work.  Almost all of his tasks are creating, debugging, and making changes. <br><br>  Compare with the other professions that are more like a conveyor - take it here, process it, pass it on.  He came in the morning, left in the evening - nothing changed after you.  He just twisted the pedals, created a driving force, somewhere at the very end of the chain she settled down (in the form of dividends, for example). <br><br>  There are other people who deal only with changes - the same designers, for example, or designers.  But they lose on the totality of qualities. <br><br>  The essence of the change in the configuration of 1C and the business system is the same.  It is only necessary to master other techniques, work with other objects and a wider range of tools.  But the essence is the same. <br><br><h4>  Prevalence </h4><br>  1C programmers are everywhere.  Yes, they are not enough, demand is higher than supply, especially for experienced station wagons.  But the main thing is that they exist, and, with some effort, you can find 1Snika. <br><br>  The second, not so obvious aspect of prevalence is a consolidated network.  1Sniks are rather closely connected with each other, through specific communities on the Internet.  With that, they sit inside a large number of enterprises.  Do you understand?  This is an almost ready-made secret society, like Azazel or Fight Club. <br><br>  It is clear that this situation was not created intentionally (although, who knows).  But this network has no analogues, at least in Russia.  Now these guys are exchanging professional information among themselves, and very successfully.  They exchange in such a way that no other specialties, including non-programmers, ever dreamed of. <br><br>  In the work with changes, this is extremely important, especially now, in conditions of total incompetence and an acute shortage of practical information.  This is a ready-made communication network, with already rebuilt connections, which is simply stupid to ignore - it is better to use. <br><br><h4>  Good understanding of numbers </h4><br>  1C is a platform for automation of accounting and management.  With the management of things, it does not matter, but on the basis of experience accumulated mass. <br><br>  1Sniks know better than anyone else where and what numbers are in the system.  Yes, the financier handles cash flow better than the 1C programmer.  But, let me remind you, we are talking about a set of qualities - in general, according to all figures at the same time, there is no better specialist. <br><br>  And here it‚Äôs not just the knowledge of numbers or sample reports, but also the practice of building systems that generate these numbers.  In fact, this is another abstraction owned by 1Sniki (and, fortunately, they have no equal here). <br><br>  The ability to handle counted numbers, and most importantly, the ability to count new numbers is extremely important to work with changes.  Everything starts with numbers, everything goes with numbers, everything ends with numbers. <br><br><h4>  System thinking </h4><br>  System thinking 1Snika often use customers and users, without realizing it.  Remember how often, after discussing a task, the question sounds: how will this refinement affect the rest of the system? <br><br>  This question, seemingly trivial, reflects one of the key facets of system thinking - the ability to see relationships and understand their work, including the relationship of relationships. <br><br>  And now remember, which profession is being asked such a question?  And if they ask, what answer do they get?  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I can only answer for my department.‚Äù <br><br>  The 1C programmer almost always works, taking into account interconnections - both program and process.  Solving the problem for suppliers, he, forcedly, takes into account the interests of sellers, storekeepers, financiers, etc.  Because the suppliers themselves are not capable of this, as sellers, storekeepers, financiers, etc. are not capable.  If you pay attention to how many interests and goals should be taken into account at the same time, then you will really feel sorry for this guy. <br><br>  Without understanding the relationships in the systems, and most importantly - without the ability to work with them - there is nothing much to do in the changes. <br><br><h4>  Debugging </h4><br>  Debugging is the execution of the program's algorithm step by step, in order to find errors, nonoptimalities, etc.  At first glance it seems that the term is purely professional. <br><br>  But, if you look at debugging a little higher, it becomes on par with the general philosophy of the profession - with the changes.  The programmer checks with the help of the debugger most of his changes.  He sees, and at the same time, the result of his changes, and the process of their work. <br><br>  Such work, or such a way of spending time as debugging, is rarely seen in other professions.  It happens with the designers when a new product is checked on the stand.  Or circuit engineers, electronics engineers - in general, engineers of all stripes, with their, alas, limited outlook. <br><br>  Without debugging, changes are rarely successful - only in the case of great luck, or a simple and understandable task.  Most changes require debugging.  I took the existing process, analyzed, made changes, launched, monitored the performance and the result.  I noticed inconsistencies - turned off, went back to the old process, went to think.  Again made changes, launched, you observe.  Oh, that's good, but you still have a bit of a penny to work  You can no longer turn it off, let them work while you are thinking about improvement.  Etc., until the goal of change is achieved. <br><br>  It seems to be a simple and understandable algorithm, but it is rarely followed by change implementers.  They prefer to think long, write a big document right away, teach everyone for a long time, then run and fail.  Start squabbling, search for the guilty, blocking oneself, etc.  - everything except what is really needed - except debugging. <br><br>  For a programmer, such an approach is suicide, although sometimes, long ago, it was necessary to do so ‚Äî to write a program on paper, then hammer it into the computer once, and immediately start it.  For example, on programming exams, or on old computers. <br><br>  It is obvious to any programmer that without debugging it is impossible to make changes to the information system normally.  To make changes to the business system, debugging is needed no less.  But, alas, apart from programmers, very few people understand this. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  I have not listed these qualities in order to simply praise you in front of you.  These are not just the features of a profession that distinguish it from other people.  These are the qualities required for implementing change.  Necessary, but, alas, not sufficient. <br><br>  It is not enough to be only a 1C programmer to jump off and run, change everything around.  There is still enough to learn, to gain experience, to enrich the general body of knowledge about changes (so far, alas, mostly theoretical), to reconsider some views on business and processes, etc.  The volume is large, but foreseeable, although of course there is no limit to perfection. <br><br>  The main idea that I want to convey: 1C programmer is most suitable for working with changes.  Others are also suitable, but to a much lesser extent.  You can, if not lazy, make a sign with the qualities that I have listed, and calculate the percentage of coincidence with other professions. <br><br>  This news, on the one hand, is joyful - at last there are people who can boost the country's economy.  Not by selling oil, not by scaling businesses, not by creating state corporations, but by increasing the efficiency in the most correct way. <br><br>  But, on the other hand, the news is terrible, because 1Sniki are cunning, dodgy, but at the same time, terribly hardheaded and notorious people.  It takes a lot of effort to get them moving, and crawl out of their shell. <br><br>  But it seems to be worth it. <br><br>  Of course, representatives of other professions will succeed too.  It just takes more time. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  Dear friends - those that are not 1C programmers!  Please do not worry: 1Sniki will never catch up with you, you are beyond competition.  You can not even remember about them at all, not worry, and not try to compare 1C with-what-would-be-no, <s>except shit.</s> <br><br>  1Will never catch up with you, because they won't even try.  Not because they are afraid, or shy.  They just don't need it. <br><br>  Here you have a simple detector.  If 1Snik tries to ‚Äúbecome a real programmer‚Äù, then it is not 1Snik.  This is not good, not bad - just a dude who ever made a mistake with the choice of profession, and now returns to his mainstream. <br><br>  If 1Snik writes something on js or php, and at the same time curses (‚ÄúBitch, what a shit, but, and fuck only contacted this task, fucking hipster customers, just to see the picture in the smartphone‚Äù), then this is real 1Snick. <br><br>  This 1Snik will not follow ‚Äúreal programmers‚Äù, because it doesn‚Äôt need to go where they are.  There is nothing there but the setting sun, which no one will ever catch up with.  And the production somehow needs to work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433824/</a></p>
