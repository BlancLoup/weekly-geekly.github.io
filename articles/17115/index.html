I'm a dog.  A male, as you can see.  Alpha male.  This, of course, you can not see, but take my word for it.  Besides, I, like you, most of the time I am on the Internet.  Today I would like to invite you to test the alpha version of the new store <a href="http://new.dostavka.ru/">new.dostavka.ru</a> .  More precisely, it is somewhat more than just a store.  And it's not even easy to test, but to participate in the completion.  Why you?  In my opinion, here gathered mostly experienced, multi-witted, with considerable experience, who are able to quickly penetrate and figure out what's what.  In general, your opinion is interesting to me. <br><br>  Warning: The best alpha testers will receive rewards! <br><br>  Interesting?  Then more in detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why exactly am I telling you all this?  Because in this project, I would like to say ... person-in-charge, i.e.  decision maker.  More precisely: the decision maker.  It sounds a little crazy, but it's true.  And is there something in our time that can be considered wild?  Well, except that the election of deputies :)

      Recently it has become fashionable to launch new projects in beta.  Well, so as not to train on cats (which would be absolutely fair for them!), But on regular users.  We decided to go even further.  We were not afraid to submit an alpha version, i.e.  version is not finished, the development of which is still ongoing.  What for?  Well, since we have been doing this for a long time, our eyes have already become somewhat blurred.  We hope that your experience, and even more so a collective approach, will help us to make this project better and more advanced.  Therefore, we show it to you ahead of others.  Your suggestions and bug reports will be useful to us.  Well, then this is some guarantee of indulgent attitude on your part.  Thank you for that. <br><br>  As a lyrical digression: Let's remind ourselves how we usually buy on the Internet: we go to some store, look at the goods, prices, just about trying to figure out which one might suit us, but we are tormented by doubts and fear ‚Äúbut suddenly then?  Suddenly it won't work? ‚Äù, Then we start looking for information about this product on the Internet, on forums and blogs - there is information, many users have already shared it.  However, the entire search process takes considerable time. <br><br>  Since there is no resource where everything useful would be brought together.  Not yet. <br><br>  However, each person understands something or even an expert.  Although in most cases not even expert advice is needed, but simply the opinion of the owner.  Sometimes a small, marked by the owner feature of the goods will be a drop missing for a decision. <br><br>  And here is the new store.  Shop 2.0.  What it is?  This, in our opinion, is something that has long been dreamed of, but for some reason no one did.  On the one hand, this is a store where you can buy various products, on the other - an information portal containing any useful information about these very goods.  In this case, the information is formally tied to the product.  Information is added by the users themselves.  You can link to any product or product category: custom pictures, reviews, reviews, optional guides, instructions, audio podcasts, videos, labels, discussion on the forum, link, news. <br><br>  Yes, some of this kind of content is already present in some stores.  However, for the first time, we are focusing on a variety of user-related reviews collected in one place. <br><br>  In addition to the information we want to collect and users.  The fact is that traditional online stores look like a physical store at night.  Those.  I can see no one there.  You walk alone like a thief between the shelves - boring.  In our new format, users see that they are not alone.  What is there around a lot of traces (left content) of other buyers, and even they themselves in the face of their avatars.  Any user can ask a question (via private messaging system) to another user or leave a question in the discussion of the goods.  According to our information, most people are conscientious and will not be able to pass by a question, the answer to which they know. <br><br>  In fact, we assume that every buyer will be able to keep a unique diary of the buyer, i.e.  leave your knowledge about the product.  Or at worst give a link to other people's knowledge.  After all, people say: the Internet is a big dustbin, and as in any dustbin you can find a lot of tasty food - believe my experience :) <br><br>  We want this kind of useful information to be next to the option to buy.  This is all coke.  I have a great nose for it :) <br><br>  For each useful action: the user gets points for adding content and a comment.  More precisely kostOchki.  From the word cost.  It costs money!  These points will bring you what you people usually dream about: status, fame, loot. <br>  Money?  Yes Yes. <br>  Having accumulated a certain number of points, you can purchase a certificate for them to pay at the store.  In my opinion not bad!  I bought something, shared my impressions, helped others learn more about the product, his strengths and weaknesses - earned points and compensated for the acquisition.  Actually the policy of exchanging points for money will be published soon. <br>  If the user's money is not interested, well, just for the sake of world peace, can one really share the info with fellow citizens?  Thank you in advance. <br>  Perhaps somewhat immodest (all human is alien to me :)), but it seems to me that today it is the most advanced store in RuNet.  Well, or certainly will be so with your help;) <br><br>  We are waiting for your recommendations and advice. <br><br>  So, I think that more or less everything is clear, ask questions in the comments. <br><br>  P.S.  Dear ladies ... I apologize for not addressing you in the first place, I am not very human with the weak sex, but I also ask you to join the testing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17115/</a></p>
