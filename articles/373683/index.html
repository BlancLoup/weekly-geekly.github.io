      There are already formed giants: Facebook, Amazon, eBay.  Special applications for retail stores are also entering the market.  Their developers have added a competitive advantage - the functionality of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/role-of-social-media-in-extending-financial-opportunities/">social networks</a> .  With it, members of mobile commerce - buyers and sellers - feel a closer connection with each other.  Here are some of the best examples in this area: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Chat find </h3><br>  The app is useful for both buyers and sellers.  The service allows anyone who offers services or products to open an electronic store in the application for free.  The seller interacts with buyers via chat. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.chatfind.com/">Chat Find</a> determines the location of the user, and then displays in its feed publications from sellers within a radius of 24 km.  Then buyers can make a purchase through the app or go to the offline store to see the product live.  The feature of Chat Find is that buyers and sellers can communicate in the app or send emails to each other, establishing friendships before making a purchase.  This allows stores to create their own communities for free and carry out promotions in the app. <br><br><h3>  Lookup </h3><br>  <a href="http://lookup.to/">Lookup</a> is an e-commerce application that was created in India, where WhatsApp is used by more than 100 million users.  Its goal is to use the love of the local population for mobile chat in order to acquaint them with sellers and services. <br><br>  Unlike online stores such as Amazon or eBay, Lookup does not offer embedded payment systems or product listings.  Instead, he uses chat to establish a dialogue between customers and a list of stores that can determine the availability and availability of the desired service or product.  Users simply log in, search, and Lookup allows them to check where the nearest store, hotel or vendor is located.  When the seller connects, the couple can start a dialogue.  Users send a request to the seller, which confirms the order and payment.  Then the product is delivered to the user within a few minutes. <br><br><h3>  Spring </h3><br>  In fact, <a href="http://www.shopspring.com/">Spring</a> is a phototape, displaying products for sale, with a moderated community using its brands - both well-known and young. <br>  The only downside is that Spring does not have a shopping cart in which users can put everything they like.  Instead, buyers spend a finger under the product icon after entering the data on payment and delivery to make a purchase.  However, after making a purchase, they can subscribe to push-notifications from the seller from whom they made the purchase.  We can say that they create their own tape of goods from stores. <br><br><h3>  Wanelo </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.wanelo.com/">Wanelo</a> is an online service where users can find 550,000 stores, including big brands and tiny boutiques.  To get the most benefit from it, consumers should interact very actively with the application - the more products and brands they have in their subscriptions, the more complete the picture of their tastes and desires can make for themselves Wanelo. <br>  This is different from tagging ‚Äúlike‚Äù purchases on other sites ‚Äî for example, Amazon.  Wanelo invites users to create collections of interests from labels and brands both offered in the application and from third-party sites. <br><br><h3>  The hunt </h3><br>  Once you saw a picture of a product in a magazine or online, but you can‚Äôt find it anywhere else live?  <a href="http://www.thehunt.com/">The Hunt</a> reminds you that if you cannot find what you need, then someone else can do it. <br><br>  This handy app engages consumers in a community that helps them keep track of products.  Just take a picture of the right product, and The Hunt user base will find it for you.  This is a community application rather than a commercial project, but sellers are known to use it too.  The Hunt community can not only help you find a product, but also give advice on fashion and trends. <br><br> <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f6/e15/80b/8f6e1580b42a45e78421d1678ed655ad.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373683/</a></p>
