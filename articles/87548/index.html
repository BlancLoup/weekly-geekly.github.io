I waited two weeks, I came to the office on the day and hour and asked to give me a card.  I answer - "Not a question, but you will need to still get a card-piggy bank."  Everything is good, but I already have two such cards at home - from past reissuing. <br><br>  Dialogue with C (employee) Privat: <br><br><blockquote>  I: Thank you do not need, I already have 2 houses. <br>  S: I do not know, it is necessary to receive. <br>  I: But I have 2 and I do not use them. <br>  S: I do not know anything, get a piggy bank or I will not give you a student one. <br>  Me: Where is it written that I am obliged to receive it? <br>  S: That's because you lost your card 2 times already. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After that, I start to panic and get angry. <br><blockquote>  I: And if I do not get a student, where can I get money from a scholarship? <br>  S: In the bank branch upon presentation of a passport. </blockquote><br>  Carrying a passport and a lot of cash in my pocket is not part of my plans, but here the employee finishes me:

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <blockquote>  S: By the way, the amount of UAH 50 is debited from the student every month and credited to the piggy bank. <br>  I: Can they be removed immediately? <br>  S: No, only in half a year. <br>  Me: Can I close the piggy bank? <br>  S: Yes, in half a year. </blockquote><br>  I doomedly sign the papers, get my card and rub the piggy bank and go home.  I read all the papers in the minibus and find out that I can close the piggy bank right now.  2 hours of time already spent. <br><br>  I call from the house to the support service, they confirm that the piggy bank can be closed even now and it is generally strange that they give it to me without my consent. <br><br>  I fly to the bank, nicely throwing paper on the table and a card shouting "Close!".  He says to me "It is impossible, I am a goor."  I explain to him already with foaming at the mouth that he is wrong three times.  He sighs and takes my papers, closes the card and gives it to me.  I am leaving. <br><br><h4>  Average story </h4><br>  It became very disappointing that I was simply deceived and I spent 3 times more time than I was going to. <br>  I call customer support (SP): <br><br><blockquote>  Me: Hello, I am such and such, I want to complain blah blah. <br>  SP: No question, I am submitting an application for a conveyor.  Application number such and such. <br>  I: When will something be known? <br>  SP: You will be called back. <br>  I: OK, thanks. </blockquote><br>  It takes a month.  I call: <br><br><blockquote>  I: Good afternoon, I am such and such, I left the application such and such. <br>  SP: Your application is not. <br>  I: How not? <br>  JV: No, and everything done means. <br>  I: I did not receive a call. <br>  &lt;hangs up&gt; </blockquote><br>  I called again, and then again, my applications went nowhere. <br><br><h4>  The story is short and instructive. </h4><br>  It was not so long ago a friend, his girlfriend works in the support service CreditDnepr.  Told the story. <br>  She laughed and said: <br><br><blockquote>  - Their complaints are practically not considered, but on employees in general. </blockquote><br>  And then I realized that there was no place to look for justice, except to send them a letter of complaint and then sue :( <br><br>  Has anyone encountered similar horrors? <br><br><h5>  UPD: </h5>  2 hours after the publication, Privat called and said that they would understand.  Asked to say dates, etc.  Tomorrow they will call back and it will be clear what's next.  Follow the events. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87548/</a></p>
