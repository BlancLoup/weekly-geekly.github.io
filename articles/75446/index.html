It is no secret that a significant part of Internet users and - especially - fans of this resource - understands computers and technologies in general a bit better than offline citizens.  If we get to the call on the hotline or send a message to a special e-mail address, then really pressed, and all the obvious ways to fix the problem have already been tried.  And we are waiting, not afraid of the word, expert opinion and advice.

      And on that end there is a girl or a boy, who were trained a little on the weekly courses, were given a book, which allegedly contains answers to all the typical questions, and was thrown into the embrasure.  They not only do not understand the subject deeply enough, but also (attention, this is important) are not interested in it.  And in their free time, they are ready to study anything, but not the device of notebooks of the new line of the brand X or differences in the firmware of the Y routers. And they work from 10 to 18, while most of the real problems for some reason arise after the 22nd. <br><br>  But then he went to bed, enraged by his impotence, in the morning dialed the coveted number and in response to his long monologue describing the problem and the already used ways to fix it, you hear the embarrassed: ‚ÄúOh, yes?  And why did you try it?  And what helps?  Standard way?  Yes?  Wow ... Well, then I do not even know what to say.  You have it all very strange.  Can you try to turn it off and on again? ‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Unpleasant?  Yes, not the word.  And yet somehow manageable, because there are forums, blogs and communities where there are good and, most importantly, knowledgeable people.  Especially since there are a lot of them in Runet.  Much more harmful, in my opinion, is the situation when such here Boys and Girls find themselves in the role of ‚Äúmetatrons‚Äù, broadcasting on behalf of the company.  Do you think this happens rarely?  Yes, to put it mildly, very often.  Whether the level of wages is to blame (In Russia, PR-specialists are valued at several times cheaper than in distant Zabugorje), or the lack of a Russian scientific base of PR (bison in this area are almost all self-taught, and what young people learn in universities is better to forget ), or something else ... But a person at least somewhat savvy, who has been brought in by journalists or bloggers, will simply have no one to mentally rub about iron in a standard representation of a foreign company. <br><br>  As a result, there are, as it were, experts in public relations, as it were, but they sit and read their favorite automobile or women's magazine.  And no one calls or writes.  No subject, sir.  And if all of a sudden the company holds a press conference, then even well-worn journalists, not to mention obviously politically incorrect bloggers, get hysterics from laughing more abruptly than at Zadornov's concerts. <br><br>  I do not write this in order to postebatsya or show off.  Not.  The problem is systemic: a low level of PR allows frankly weak journalists to stay afloat (this kind of feeds up like that), and bloggers, to whom everyone is now paying a lot of attention, are simply frightening.  In offline times, the inefficiency of PR could somehow be masked (how exactly - if you want - let's talk in a separate post or in comments), but on the Internet, with its instant feedback, tricks do not work categorically.  Because for each pompous broadcaster there will be a dozen virtuals with specially trained tomatoes, which instantly bring down all the pathos and convincingly prove the ineffectiveness of PR attempts.  So much so that even the guys from the head office will understand (Google Translate for this taxis inhumanly).  There is no effective interaction with the public, there is no mutual understanding, there is no information exchange - and a spherical horse turns out in a vacuum, moving its hoofs past the ideal times of the unrestrained growth of the Russian market and throwing them back at the beginning of 2009.  When the company's business is shaken by a couple of rumors launched by the guys from Savelovsky market - this is not the case, no.  But over the years of prosperity, most companies did not bother to create at least a simple system of opposition to such kunshtyuk. <br><br>  In the words of one well-known telekiller, it would seem - and where is Intel?  Yes, despite the fact that in the Russian branch of the company, the problem was decided how effectively and so gracefully.  Of course, there is a PR service there (Anya, Mikhail, hello!), But after their brief introduction, Alexey Rogachkov, a leading expert on the introduction of Intel products in the CIS countries, usually appears in front of journalists.  He is not a PR man, not a marketer - he is a real engineer who knows the subject so well that it captures the spirit.  This is clearly not ‚Äújust work‚Äù, it is, if you want, a passion, because it is simply impossible to penetrate the subject so deeply only during working hours.  At the same time, the burden of knowledge did not make a bore out of Alexei: on the contrary, with obvious pleasure he dilutes the dry figures of presentations with live demonstrations - and what, in fact, does all this figure mean?  For example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtiwUgOV9MiY">like this,</a> Aleksey demonstrated the capabilities of the Centrino 2 platform. That is, there were both correct numbers and a bright show ending.  None of the IT-companies operating in our market thought of such a cocktail.  Zhanna Friske to invite - you don't need a big mind, no.  But to lure Alexei Rogachkov into his ranks and not to stop him from experimenting ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/0ae/128/24f0ae128048e60ca6328105a06713b4.jpg" alt="Alexey Rogachkov (Intel)"><br><br>  We have a tradition on <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/interactive/interview/475749/">Computerra Online</a> .  Every year, my colleagues and I go to Rogachkov and ask to deal with readers' questions about the new hardware of Intel.  And every time we are surprised at how concise, accurate and <i>non-irritatingly politically correct are</i> his answers.  Especially if you know that "live" he answers the same way, without looking in any directories and online talmuda. <br><br>  Perhaps it's time to wrap up.  The first post simply must be a little lumpy, so I will not write about Intel technical support.  Perhaps you have already made a presentation about it and share it in the comments.  I do not know anything about the work of Alexei Rogachkov outside of communication with journalists and readers of famous sites.  Most likely, it is extensive and multifaceted.  But even if we imagine that people of this level will appear in several other companies and will deal exclusively with <i>communication</i> , it will be a miracle as well.  They say that Jacob Perelman did not make a single discovery, he did not have titles and degrees.  But thanks to his ‚ÄúEntertaining Physics‚Äù, so many future geniuses went to science that they could not be counted. <br><br>  Do you understand what I'm talking about? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75446/</a></p>
