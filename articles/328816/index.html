  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How "plastic" becomes the enemy of the underworld</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Banknote counterfeiting is a big problem for Europe.  Only in the second half of 2015, the European Central Bank seized more than half a million counterfeit euro-banknotes.  And in May 2016, completely stopped the manufacture and release of banknotes of 500 euro due to the popularity of these bills from terrorists, drug mafia and tax evaders.  But given the willingness of organized criminal groups to forge money, the authorities have to find more and more complex measures in order to maintain confidence in banknotes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afc/8dd/c03/afc8ddc03a6f4a168a80564e4a9331c0.png" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That is why banknote manufacturing technologies are becoming more and more complex every day.  With the proliferation of affordable high-quality printers, the banking community switched to using holograms, began to use several colors at once in one bill, introduce embedded devices, such as 3D strips, microprinting technologies, watermarks and inks that change their color depending on the angle, under which light falls on the bill.  Another ingenious innovation was the use of the Euroion Constellation bills (EURion Constellation, a recurring pattern used in the bills since 1996) - photocopier technology is able to recognize this pattern and prevent further replication. <br><br><h3>  Modern security features in new banknotes </h3><br>  The newest banknote with a face value of 50 euros, made of pure cotton fiber paper, came into use quite recently and includes many security features.

That is why the main elements of protection in the European currency are mainly focused on the tactile, tactile and visual sensations that citizens have when they hold bills in their hands.  You can feel the texture of the banknote, some of its elements will have relief, you can see the shapes that will appear on the light, and depending on the angle of incidence of light rays, some details on the bill will change their color. <br><br>  In its new five-pound bills, the Bank of England went the same way. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kOF6p21BzE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  They also use transparent windows, elements that change their color, holograms and fragments that glow in the ultraviolet.  Citizens generally liked the new bills, except for critics from vegans and some religious groups for using trace (i.e. fractions of a percent) amount of beef tallow in the production of such bills. <br><br><h3>  Perfect material </h3><br>  Another effective tool for countering counterfeiters is the use of polymers (a type of plastic) in the manufacture of banknotes.  Today, such a banknote cannot be faked without leaving visible marks, and this allows bill manufacturers to add new security elements that are not available in paper money. <br><br>  But innovation with polymers does not end there.  Polycarbonates, which are a kind of thermoplastic polymers, are now increasingly used for making various certificates and offer a much higher level of security than anything that was previously available. <br><br>  All this became possible due to the fact that modern technologies allow combining several layers in one block at a time.  New polycarbonate IDs may include: <br><br><ul><li>  tactile sensations on their surface </li><li>  laser-played iridescent images or images that change when the angle of view changes </li><li>  ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù into which images can be embedded, as in the ¬£ 5 banknotes described above </li><li>  non-removable personalized laser engraved marks </li><li>  color portraits </li></ul><br>  After the certificate is made, it will not be possible to separate one layer from another, which excludes the possibility of changing the data stored in it or changing the image; moreover, such a document can be quickly distinguished from a fake. <br><br><h3>  In the fight against crime </h3><br>  These new revolutionary banknote manufacturing techniques help Europe stay more secure from criminals and minimize the likelihood of money forgery.  Countries that have already introduced polymer banknotes and polycarbonate certificates noted a sharp decline in fakes and fakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328816/</a></p>
