    <br>  - So, you spent two days here at Seedcamp Eastern Europe ... How does it feel? <br><br>  - I think it was a terrific event. Someone told me that this is the first event with so many teams that presented their projects - there were 20. I heard that other events gathered 3-4 teams, and we had 20 , it is wonderful.  More than 50 teams applied for participation, and we chose 20 of them for the meeting on these two days.  Indeed there are a lot of technically very strong developers and teams with very interesting ideas ... <br><br>  - Well, what about their business skills? <br><br>  - Business skills are needed to communicate, and to find ways to turn technology into a business.  All the technologies here are wonderful ... There are many companies in Western Europe, Great Britain with good business ideas, but without technology at the heart of them.  And then - about the opposite.  And we give them the opportunity to find someone who could help them from the business. <br><br>  - I see.  What are your impressions and predictions about start-ups and venture capital companies here in Ukraine and Eastern Europe? <br><br>  - In general, it seems to me that we are full of enthusiasm about what is happening in Eastern Europe.  Every time I come to Poland, here, well, although I have not been to many places, but there are really strong groups working on cool new ideas, studying in universities.  But what they lack is, I heard it here, these are the places where they would gather.  But I think that today we gave a start, and here in these two days there were a lot of local venture capital companies, so I hope that all these people will be with each other. <br><br>  - What's next Seedcamp plans to do in Central and Eastern Europe? <br><br>  - This year we started with local events.  We are thinking about the possibility of holding a separate Sidcamp ... like what we are doing in London - that is, a separate Sidcamp in Central and Eastern Europe.  Perhaps - this is not yet accurate. <br><br>  - In Ukraine?  Or somewhere else? <br><br>  - Maybe!  I still do not know, we still have to ... What is important is to build European companies, global companies.  So, we like talents in Central and Eastern Europe, but I would speak more about the whole of Europe than about a particular region.  We are talking about the whole of Europe, and not about something separate. <br><br>  About the event and the winners I wrote a few words on <br>  <a href="http://demchenko.info/seedcamp-consider-starting-another-full-fledged-seedcamp-in-central-and-eastern-europe/">demchenko.info/seedcamp-consider-starting-another-full-fledged-seedcamp-in-central-and-eastern-europe</a> <br>  This is my new (still unfinished :)) English-language blog about Eastern Europe, including startups in it. <br><br>  ADF Video from Yutyuba Habr does not take, the video is on the previous link. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26028/</a></p>
