  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For the standard offensively</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, IBM management approved a new set of rules, according to which the company will cooperate with technical committees of international and national standards organizations.  More precisely with those of them that are working on software interoperability issues.  The deciding factor in choosing a committee to work with is that the company will now consider the degree of ‚Äúinappropriate pressure‚Äù exerted on it from outside. <br><br>  The public and the press, including the influential New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C400693880002574CD0027DDFF.html%3Fref%3Dtechnology">took</a> this for an unequivocal hint - IBM is dissatisfied with how Microsoft successfully lobbied for adopting the OOXML format as the international standard ISO / IEC 29500. I recall that in the final voting in March Russia was among the few countries who voted "abstain." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Russian representative office of Microsoft declined to comment on the statement by IBM, citing the fact that formally it does not concern their company. <br><br>  It should be noted that IBM has been supporting ODF for many years, adopted as the international standard ISO / IEC 26300 in 2006.  Now in Russia it is being considered for adoption as a national one.  This is a busy Technical Committee on Standardization - TK22 "Information Technology".

      In the Russian representative office of IBM, we were informed that no major changes were being planned in the work of the company with the Russian standardization bodies.  To say something definite in relation to the CIS countries is still difficult. <br><br>  Director of IBM-Russia state programs Marat Guriev, who spoke as a company representative at the OOXML discussions in Russia, highly appreciates <br>  professionalism of the team TK22.  ‚ÄúWe have quite normal interaction with them,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúI believe that their principled position in the evaluation of draft standards caused a small, but still important historical event, when our country listened to the opinion of experts on such a serious issue during the final vote on the Microsoft project.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIBM has no reason to be offended by us,‚Äù says Askold Pyavchenko, TC 22 Chairman.  ‚ÄúThe process of adopting the ISO / IEC 26300 standard is underway, and it is going well.  One of the copies of the final draft of the project is now in front of me, the other two have been sent for examination at Moscow State University, which is being conducted under the guidance of Professor Vladimir Sukhomlin. <br><br>  I think that the draft standard promoted by Microsoft ‚ÄúOffice Open XML File Formats‚Äù may also become our national standard over time. <br><br>  Before the vote on adopting the ISO 29500 project on an accelerated procedure, we held a joint meeting with representatives of Microsoft at the Bureau of TC 22. Microsoft's strategic initiatives manager, Vladislav Shershulsky, was present from the Moscow office, and Jason Matusow, senior director for interoperability, from the central office. <br><br>  The position of TK22 was as follows.  Currently there are more than 6000 pages in the draft standard.  For the time allotted before the voting, specialists who were not directly involved in the development of the project cannot familiarize and identify the advantages and disadvantages of the project.  To vote ‚Äúfor‚Äù means, in our opinion, ‚Äúto lose face‚Äù, so we decided to abstain.  It seemed to me that this position was accepted by Microsoft representatives with understanding. <br><br>  In our opinion, in order for the ISO 29500 standard to be readable and suitable for practical use, it is desirable to at least divide it into a core and a number of parts, for example, according to a functional sign (work with texts, tables, graphics, multimedia, etc.). <br><br>  At a separate meeting, the chairperson of TC 22, with the presence of Shershulsky and Sukhomlyn, decided to hold seminars at MSU.  They will develop a public discussion of new ideas and the development of leaders in the field of standardization of formats of open documents.  In particular, IBM and Microsoft. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41275/</a></p>
