Just clicking the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button can anyone.  But only a specialist will be able to make sure that after this click the necessary changes occur, the desired result will appear.  Do not worry, anyone can become a specialist.  Even if you just read our blog and discuss it, you will recognize the key points - the ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù that distinguish a mailing specialist from a frantic spammer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Can automated mailing fail? </h4><br>  One of our readers once came to this conclusion: if you send a robot, when personalizing, you can‚Äôt avoid mistakes, so you need to do a personalized posting and manually, and the mailing services are just some kind of error services.  However, this is not entirely true - such difficulties can be avoided.  That is why let's talk today about the important stage that precedes the automated mailing itself.  This is work with your base. <br><br><h4>  Work with the base before creating the base itself </h4><br>  Preparatory work with the base begins when you are still thinking about how to assemble your base.  You need, roughly speaking, two things: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. Make registration quick, easy and attractive. <br>  2. Get the information you need (name, mail + what will be essential for you in the future, for example, gender, year or date of birth, place of residence). <br><br>  The balance between these two needs is real art.  On the one hand, if registration is too easy, you can collect leads with inactive or unconfirmed boxes, and then you simply did not collect anything.  On the other hand, if you confuse the user when registering, offer a too long registration procedure, request too much incoming data and confirmations by e-mail, the client will reasonably think ‚ÄúOh my nafig‚Äù and go somewhere else across the vast expanses, and you will stay with a nose.  Therefore, ideally, first request only the main thing - the name and mail.  Then immediately let us access the site, but with the proviso that if the sent confirmation letter is not answered within, say, 24 hours, then the registration will be suspended.  Then - continue to collect information, encourage the client to tell more about yourself.  How - we have already written before and, no doubt, we will write more, because the topic is big. <br><br><h4>  Work with current base </h4><br>  At this work with the base does not end there.  Check your leads weekly - and here, yes, proceed manually.  As a rule, the weekly influx of leads is modest enough.  Therefore, take the time to sort out your database - you can avoid many mistakes and frankly stupid situations if you do this before launching the newsletter.  In large companies, this is done by database analytics, in a small company you can do it yourself in an hour or several hours, depending on how large your database is. <br><br>  1. Highlight and tag those who do not have a name. <br>  Mark with a special tag (= select in a separate segment) those who did not specify a name so that they would not receive a letter ‚ÄúHello, ping1677‚Äù - ‚Äúnot personalize‚Äù - a good tag for such letters. <br><br>  2. Clean the database from those whose mailboxes do not work. <br>  Remove non-working mailboxes, those with a percentage of rejection - the box is either abandoned or overflowed, but in any case, there is no need to send more letters to it, because  The percentage of failure affects your reputation for the worse. <br><br>  3. Find information gaps <br>  Highlight the segment in which you lack information about the client and think about what kind of newsletter to do to encourage them to disclose more information about themselves. <br><br>  4. Arrange the tags in your database in <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">Unisender</a> - those tags that will be relevant to you - thus completing the segmentation of the database for today. <br><br>  5. Finishing this work, look attentively - perhaps you will find some kind of irrationality or inconsistency in your particular database.  Think how to fix it. <br><br><h4>  Proven base shoots accurately </h4><br>  Now, after pressing the "send" key, you can expect a reduction in unpleasant situations.  Yes, you processed the base with your own hands and eyes.  However, the mailing will still go automatically.  It would take longer for you to send a personal letter to each person rather than a small preliminary work with the table. <br><br>  You need to do this kind of work regularly, as regularly as you analyze the beating from each mailing (and you do it?).  If you spend time on this once a week, you can avoid a situation where you have to manually sort through a large array of data.  Keeping your base clean is as important as it is for a musician, for example, to take care of your instrument, and for a lover of hunting, to regularly disassemble and lubricate a gun.  It is necessary then that with each new volley of mailing you would have the maximum amount of chances to hit the target. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5>  More interesting posts and useful links on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia">facebook page</a> every day.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia"><b>Like.</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149274/</a></p>
