  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Student Electronic Diary Project in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a topic about <a href="http://7paca.habrahabr.ru/blog/18711/">electronic diaries</a> in Britain.  And now we also have a company KORUS consulting rolling out a similar project. <br>  Let's look at the implementation of the priority national project "Education". <br>  <b>added</b> <br>  It turns out yesterday (01/21/09) there was already a presentation of this project at lyceum No. 64. <br>  That would hear the opinion of an insider. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  EDU (electronic student diary) has already been submitted to the Committee on Education of St. Petersburg and received its approval. <br>  Still would not approve, such money there drank probably <br><br>  Moreover, the objectives of the project are very correct and rational. <br><blockquote><br>  The solution creates a single information space that unites all participants in the educational process: <br><br>  * educational institution: teachers, administration and students; <br>  * student's family; <br>  * regulatory and educational authorities <br>  Parents of the student become full participants in the educational process, getting the opportunity to:

      <br>
      * monitor the performance and attendance of children; <br>  * timely see the assessment of the child; <br>  * <b>chat with teachers online;</b> <br>  * receive messages from teachers about events in an educational institution and class, exchange messages, create community. <br><br>  The learning process becomes transparent and understandable, which significantly affects the motivation of students and, as a result, improves the quality of education. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, is not education 2.0?  In my opinion it is the most, if we consider that <br><br><blockquote>  Educational institutions in the face of teachers, class teachers and administrations have the opportunity to inform parents about the results of the child‚Äôs education in a timely manner: <br><br>  * put grades in electronic diaries of students; <br>  * keep cool electronic journals; <br>  * track the progress and attendance of each student; <br>  * to form the average score of the student in each subject; <br><br>  and manage the educational process: <br><br>  * create a schedule of classes; <br>  * monitor the implementation of the curriculum; <br>  * monitor attendance and discipline; <br>  * generate statistical reporting for each student, class, parallels; <br>  * to form consolidating reports on the educational institution as a whole for submission to the regulatory and supervisory bodies of education. <br></blockquote><br><br>  The project looks so ambitious that it is difficult to imagine that it was implemented correctly by NAS.  Here's what they write about the solution architecture. <br><blockquote>  Solution architecture. <br><br>  The information system ‚ÄúElectronic Student Diary‚Äù was created on the basis of an industrial integration platform and integrates with any information systems: previously installed in an educational institution or planned to be installed. <br>  The solution architecture, based on the use of a single data-center, is initially based on a single directory, which allows centrally synchronizing all existing directories and databases in educational institutions and education control bodies at all levels. </blockquote><br><br>  Moreover, all management and interaction is carried out via the Internet, using a browser, so installing software on machines in schools is not required. <br><br>  Everything is written beautifully and in the case, such education can qualitatively raise the level of education and the effectiveness of training. <br>  However, the site of the School of Russia is remembered, the money that was poured in there and what it all turned into. <br><br>  Ps1.  The service is rendered requires a symbolic monthly fee from the parents. <br><blockquote>  Every day, data for each class, for each lesson is entered into the electronic database: attendance, subject of the lesson, grades received by students, homework.  Pupils' parents can access this data via the Internet, for this they must enter into an agreement with a software company and transfer 60 rubles per month to its account, half of which the company promises to give to the school. <br>  According to the initiators of the innovation, the service may interest up to 20 percent of parents.  However, no official survey on this topic was conducted.  In other words, the figure is taken from the ceiling.  Still, 800 parents surveyed the Humanitarian Lyceum, eight percent of the respondents were interested in the electronic diary (up to 20 percent still), but only a few signed the contract.  And this - in the "advanced" school. <br>  Units - today it is quite a correct estimate of the demand for an electronic diary.  To get it, it was enough to randomly call several schools.  For example, in secondary school No. 29 (Leninsky district), where 456 people study, about ten parents signed an agreement.  School number 85 (distant Zasviyazhie): not a single contract, although the school is large - almost 1,200 students. </blockquote><br><br>  Taken from <a href="http://it.ul-online.ru/news/%3Fnews_id%3D5826">it.ul-online.ru/news/?news_id=5826</a> <br>  There are interesting comments from parents of students, both those who agreed to use the service and those who refused. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49890/</a></p>
