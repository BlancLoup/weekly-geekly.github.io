Today, there are several interesting stories about how technologies are changing the space industry on Earth and "there" at the top.  As Yuri Gagarin would say: ‚ÄúLet's go!‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e39/646/b7a/e39646b7a1c24f9590e5709f4ee95857.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Travel to mars </h2><br>  Starting from the science fiction works of Soviet (and not only) authors, continuing with the Great Doom Game and ending with the activities of Ilona Mask, Mars passes through the minds of humanity.  But it will be many more years before we go there.  To fulfill this dream, starting in September last year, you can visit the Kennedy Space Center and visit the red planet using mixed reality technologies. <br><br>  The project "Destination: Mars", developed by NASA and Microsoft.  It uses real images of the Mars Curiosity Mars rover and HoloLens mixed reality glasses, so immersion into the atmosphere will be as realistic as possible.

Buzz conducts a tour of the red planet.  In his works, he talks about the Apollo effect - in his opinion, landing on the moon almost 50 years ago became his catalyst: whole generations are inspired by the study of science and engineering, which naturally moves the industry forward.  The study of Mars with the help of new technologies will lead to a similar effect, the authors of the program say. <br><br><h2>  Space IoT </h2><br>  On April 11, 2017, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/680729">news</a> about the Sputnik company, which plans to launch about 200 microsatellites to near-earth orbit to connect half a billion devices to IoT, appeared in Izvestia.  According to one of the shareholders of the project, Aliya Prokofyeva, the future global seamless infrastructure will transmit the data collected from the sensors, as well as ensure the exchange of small data packets between subscribers. <br><br>  The first device is scheduled for launch in 2018.  By 2025, the project should be fully implemented.  Its key goal is to ensure the growth of services and services based on IoT technologies.  Compared to the terrestrial counterparts, the new satellite system will be more global, homogeneous, cross-border, will provide more reliable information security and traffic control. <br><br>  Several years ago, a similar mission was launched, aimed at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/features/demokratizatsiya-iskusstvennogo-intellekta/">democratizing</a> IoT - <a href="https://pegasusmission.com/">Pegasus II</a> .  Its main idea is to use IoT in an extreme environment in real time.  The project in their free time is done by volunteers working at Microsoft. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0hP_8CeM2A%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjdP4tY63a5sm2n5hKUM9kF_tbOg"></iframe><br><br>  At the end of 2016, the mission successfully passed the first test: a two-hour flight in near space was carried out with two-way communication with the global audience in real time.  Thousands of people were able to take part in the experiment, receiving telemetry data, video and transmitting messages.  Now the team is preparing for a new launch - there will be an eclipse on August 21, and several balloons will go to the highest possible height, where they will take the phenomenon from several points. <br><br><h2>  Virtual engineers </h2><br>  The cosmonauts of the ISS are increasingly immersed in new technologies, for example, they tested HoloLens in the framework of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sidekick">Sidekick</a> project.  Mixed reality glasses became part of a pilot project for working without instructions with various nodes and elements of technical systems.  Their principle of operation is quite simple: a specialist who is remotely sees what is happening through the eyes of an astronaut and shows him what to do using Skype or a graphical editor.  Another interesting feature is that the astronauts see the animation of the process of work of any node. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1IS8Kbzxos%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkQUO2uGh5STw1xU-kIfcytbgM0Q"></iframe><br><br>  According to representatives of NASA, this approach will greatly simplify the preparation of astronauts for new missions. <br><br><h2>  Robots in Europe </h2><br>  People visited only the moon.  Robots are on the Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan and Jupiter, as well as on several comets and asteroids.  This fact does not mean that robots on another planet are easy.  One of our favorite authors on the space theme, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zelenyikot/" class="user_link">Zelenyikot</a> , in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuQbS5adFSKM">lecture in Yekaterinburg,</a> talks about the difficulties associated with this topic.  For example, the key question is not how to build a robot and ride it on Mars, but how to make it land successfully.  Although we very much hope that we will soon be able to rent a robot and control it with the help of glasses of mixed reality.  On Earth, we can already do this - for example, <a href="https://cape.com/">remotely rent a drone</a> . <br><br>  Without a doubt, the most famous space robot is the <s>Shelezyak planet robot</s> , <s>WALL-E</s> , <s>R2-D2</s> , <s>C-3PO</s> Curiosity rover, which is an autonomous chemical laboratory for studying the surface of the red planet.  NASA decided to go further and at the end of March announced the completion of the development of a prototype of a more advanced space robot, which will explore the water surface.  It includes a probe for drilling and sampling, as well as robotic arms for sampling from a distant object. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBzBeYsdNsM%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjheruCX6Xqh_JySzvE498vqUiuWQ"></iframe><br><br>  Such a model of the robot was chosen by chance.  Surely you guessed that it is intended primarily for the study of celestial bodies with an icy surface, the most famous of which is Europe, the satellite of Jupiter.  This is one of the few closest to the Earth satellites, where scientists do not exclude the presence of life. <br><br><h2>  Homebone cosmonaut </h2><br>  Now we will say the obvious thing - most of us will never be in space.  :( <br>  There are reasons for this.  But we are sure that everyone dreamed or continues to dream about it, thinking about the scale of the Universe.  This effect even has a name - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awe">Awe effect</a> (a complex combination of emotions - from fear to admiration).  We experience it from the awareness of how small we are in the infinite Universe (which is also <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9">expanding</a> , which should not be forgotten). <br><br>  Of course, it would be cool to visit the Kennedy Space Center, which is written above, and immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Martian life, but for this you need to go to Florida.  Also not the easiest way.  Therefore, we decided to complete this article with a story about a virtual telescope, which can be used right now. <br><br>  In 2008, Microsoft Research released the first version of <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/">WorldWide Telescope</a> (WWT), a virtual telescope that allows you to view a photographic map of the starry sky and space objects based on images of the Hubble telescope and about 10 terrestrial telescopes.  In addition to observing the phenomena occurring at the present time, you can simulate any moments from 1 to 4000 AD. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d36Ix0uQ1hg%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_aV2EhawCQy1g4_STKx8sQjBacQ"></iframe><br><br>  At the time of this writing, we found an interesting project developed by Lab212 at the end of last year using WWT and Microsoft Kinect - this is a star swing.  Its essence is that you study the Universe, swinging on a swing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Kj_AGNJsL4%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjPlnnxQlK4-6KJ-XlNEcBuJnADUQ"></iframe><br><br>  This effect is achieved by tracking the location of the corners of the ropes, calculating the position of the visitor's eyes in three-dimensional space and combining the obtained data with visual effects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fd/d91/213/9fdd9121301142c8be6312a75c351395.gif"><br><br>  We will be glad if you join us and tell in the comments about other projects that you know) <br><br>  <i>The article was written in collaboration with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ahriman/" class="user_link">ahriman</a> (Alexander Belotserkovsky).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326260/</a></p>
