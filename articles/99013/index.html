      Please immediately bring this information to your employees who are responsible for receiving and processing applications for domain registration in the RF zone. <br><br>  Detailed information: <br><br>  Yesterday, June 12, 2010, the Coordinating Center for the National Internet Domain received a letter from the Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Communications (Roskomnadzor), which provides information on the recent significant increase in the number of applications for registration of electronic media.  In particular, it was stated that if in April 2010 3 applications for registration of electronic media were submitted to Roskomnadzor, then in May there were already 36, and in June 2010 the number of such applications increased to 900. At the same time, most of the applications contain the names of the media, consisting of commonly used words, for example - books.rf, flowers.rf, construction.rf and others. <br><br>  Roskomnadzor assumes that the increased number of such applications is associated with the entry into force of the Regulation on the priority registration of domain names in the domain. RF for certain categories of users (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation), and applicants who register media with commonly used names have the goal of receiving name in the domain. RF corresponding to the name of the media, for unfair use, including for resale. <br><br>  In order to suppress the possibility of obtaining the most requested domain names by means of ‚Äústreaming‚Äù media registration, Roskomnadzor requested the Coordination Center to make changes to the order of priority reservation of domain names for the media. <br><br>  Fully sharing the concerns expressed by Roskomnadzor, the Coordination Center held consultations with representatives of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications and Roskomnadzor, which resulted in a proposal to amend the Regulation on the priority registration of domain names for the media.  Currently, the Council of the Coordination Center is considering the possibility of amending the Regulation regarding the introduction of an additional criterion for those media outlets that can apply for registration of domain names in the domain. RF in a priority order.  In accordance with the proposed wording of the relevant provisions of the Regulation, the right to submit applications for priority registration of domain names will be granted only to those media that were registered before the Regulation entered into force - May 12, 2010 (that is, no later than May 11, 2010). <br><br>  In order to ensure the rights of bona fide users, changes need to be made before the start of the priority registration period for the media, i.e.  until July 15, 2010. <br><br>  The Council voted on the issue of making the Regulation on the priority registration of domain names in domain. The Russian Federation for certain categories of users of the following changes: <br><br>  1. To state clause 1.4.5 of the Regulation on priority registration of domain names in domain. The Russian Federation for certain categories of users in the following edition: <br><br>  "The founders of the media (media) registered before May 12, 2010 in the manner prescribed by the legislation of the Russian Federation, whose products are intended for distribution throughout the territory of the Russian Federation." <br><br>  2. To introduce changes to the Regulation on the priority registration of domain names in the domain. The Russian Federation for certain categories of users from July 15, 2010. <br><br>  Voting will take place on a calendar day on July 13, 2010.  An additional message will be sent on the decision taken as a result of voting. <br><br>  We apologize for the inconvenience arising from the short period of consideration of the issue </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Registrar Position </h4><br>  All registrars act in the interests of their customers and in no way want to spoil the reputation of the domain zone of the Russian Federation.  Therefore, the position of all should be one - lawlessness. <br><br>  We, the registrar of Netfox, are solely against this practice. <br><br>  First, it is a precedent.  At the "desire" of any body, you can change any rules.  Take at least the rules of RU domains, where to insert the desire of any body to select domains.  Remember gosuslugi.ru and sochi.ru, which were selected by Decrees.  It‚Äôs time to create a clause in the rules that allows you not to disturb the President on such trifles. <br><br>  Secondly, it is the practice of the Coordination Center to resolve any important issues without the participation of registrars.  It turns out that the people's opinion, which is expressed through the registrar, is not taken into account in any way. <br><br>  In the agreement between the registrars and CC (as well as with the shopping center) there are no conditions under which the Registrar would be an obligatory element for making important decisions.  The current situation is inflated by <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/about/structure/union/">the Coordination Center Council</a> .  This council includes completely different people, most of whom are not registrars (only one registrar is represented on the Council - nic.ru). <br><br><h4>  Practice change </h4><br><br>  The new chairman of the Committee of Registrars, A. Kondakov, elected by registrars earlier this year, is trying to change the vicious practice of the CC by introducing mandatory Regulations on which any documents on domains are developed and approved by the Committee of Registrars with their direct participation.  But in six months the promotion of the document in the KC never reached the required level, quite possibly because of the domain of the Russian Federation. <br><br><h4>  Effects </h4><br>  The first consequence is the destruction of the reputation of the domain of the Russian Federation, as well as the domain RU.  Can you imagine that, at the request of any body, they can change the rules not in favor of administrators?  And none of the registrars can affect this decision. <br><br>  The second consequence is working with current customers, which are already thousands!  These clients have already paid for the registration of domains for the media, have prepared all the documents and the day after tomorrow they hope to receive their legal domain name.  How can you explain to your customers that RULES change in 2 days, which were approved almost a year ago?  In whose interests? <br><br>  In my opinion, there is lobbying for the interests of richer people who are trying to pull out the most delicious domains for auction.  You know that on October 1 there will be no more open registration?  ( <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D834">proof</a> ). <br><br>  The funds from the domain name auction will go to the Assistance Funds.  What - is not yet clear.  Documents on the Auction are also prepared by the CC Council, and not by the registrars.  I hope no need to point out the coincidence of interests of some individuals? <br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  Every day we see how in Russian hosting, and including domains, drive nails.  And not the users, but the service providers themselves.  If hosting is more or less regulated by market relations, then the activities of the Coordination Center are currently monopolized - they are not allowed to manage the entire system of Registrars, or they are doing everything to delay it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99013/</a></p>
