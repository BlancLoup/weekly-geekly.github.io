      Andrei graduated from MEPhI in 2002 with a degree in Systems Engineering.  Specialization - the development of applications "internal automation" of enterprises. <br><br>  Since September 2002, he has been working at Ekvant telecom company, now known under the Orange Business Services brand.  For 14 years he has gone from a linear (junior) programmer to the head of the information systems development department. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  I aggregate and provide information to management on the progress of development projects - current and future, I draw up and monitor the implementation of semester project work plans.  In large projects I act as an IT analyst and architect.  If necessary, I solve conflicts of areas of responsibility and ways of implementing tasks within the department and with allies.  But in special cases I can correct the code (smiles). <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Enthused <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  9-10 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  6-7 hours. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  Mostly breakfast at night (smiles). <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  Depends on transport.  If I get to work on a bicycle, then I focus my attention on following the road.  In public transport or read fiction, or sleep. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  In the work of a single todo-manager did not work out, it is selected depending on the type of tasks.  Scheduler - Outlook, for tasks I use Jira, I write text files in Notepad.  For personal affairs I use DGT GTD for Android. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Without Google (smiles).  Still, perhaps, without e-mail and the internal Wiki as a knowledge base. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  Jira, the repository for the code is good old CVS.  We plan to switch to Bitbucket. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  Firefox / Chrome, SQL Developer, IntelliJ IDEA, Notepad.  MS - Outlook, Lync, Office. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  Almost all of them and do with the whole department. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  Search for the fault in the problem instead of finding a solution. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  First of all, the one that describes ways of thinking / solving problems (aka templates). <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  For professional literature - reading rooms, for fiction - paper. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  There are no particular preferences, except that the technique should fit me in size.  For example, I prefer a full-sized monitor and keyboard instead of a laptop, and the phone and the reader should fit well in your hand. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  Roommates. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  The above-mentioned bike works great as a daily transport to the place of work and allows you to transform "lost" usually 2-3 hours on the way to and from work into "acquired".  Daily trips cool raise the tone and performance and do not require additional time-consuming.  I try to ride a bike every day regardless of the season, usually rolling up to 20 km.  In connection with the relocation of the office to Moscow-City, my path to work increased, but I try to ride a bike at least 3-4 times a week. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Less negative in assessing the changes occurring around.  Whatever is done - all the better. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  To perceive emerging obstacles and problems not as an inevitable evil, but as a challenge (and at the same time a gift of fate).  No effort in life is wasted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321714/</a></p>
