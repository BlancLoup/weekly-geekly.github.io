  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We want to show you WCAG: we are learning the basics of web accessibility to music.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During his stay in Los Angeles at a meeting dedicated to the development of the second version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard, <a href="http://www.eramp.com/s_david_macdonald.htm">David MacDonald</a> , a well-known accessibility expert and a creative person, wrote a song about this event. <br><br>  WCAG is the most widely used worldwide web accessibility standard for people with disabilities, developed and promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  However, WCAG (and its analogs) are still poorly distributed in the Russian part of the Internet. <br><br>  In order to draw attention to the issue of web accessibility and the general popularization of accessibility ideas in RuNet, the original composition ‚ÄúWe want to show you the WCAG‚Äù (We want to show you the WCAG - English) and its non-artistic translation into Russian will be given here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The composition involves two characters: directly David MacDonald himself, as well as his computer friend named Sharkey, who represents the screen access program ‚Äî specialized software used by people with visual impairments to work on the computer.  Sharkey speaks the voice of the cult speech synthesizer Eloquence, which is widespread in various software products for people with disabilities. 
      <br>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
      Note that the jokes associated with the speed of Sharkey's speech are due to the fact that people using screen readers often set up much faster than the natural human speech synthesizer speed to compensate for the decrease in performance when the screen content is perceived not by sight, but by ear.  Such users, indeed, often work with a very fast-talking synthesizer, whose speech ordinary people, without a special habit, do not understand. <br><br>  Those interested can familiarize themselves with the WCAG standard version 2.0 in more detail: both <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">in English</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG20-ru">in Russian</a> . <br><br><h2>  We want to show you the WCAG </h2><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtuna2AWvqk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGughOOsHpvt53JQ8aJPkLpYxnwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Download the MP3 version of the song as 256 Kbps <a href="">here [7.43 MB]</a> . <br><br><h2>  We want to show you WCAG (translation) </h2><br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  WCAG, WWW-WCAG.  WCAG.  II am a cool DJ, Sharkey!  WWW-WCAG.  WCAG.  SH-SH-SH-Sharqi.  Hey, I'm losing my mind with this rhythm, I have a bit more abruptly, after you have installed a new <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7">quantizing</a> program.  I dance an electric boogie.  Want to see David? <br><br>  <i>David says</i> <br><br>  No, Sharkey, we have to start working on this song.  You can dance while I sing, but do not pull yourself out of the socket.  Good? <br><br>  <i>Sings</i> <br><br>  We are going to write a new specification. <br>  This is the start of the validation tool. <br>  Make available <br>  Going to make it testable. <br><br>  WCAG.  WCAG.  WWW-WCAG! .. <br><br>  We are going to make the Internet understandable <br>  Make it perceptible, write it clear. <br>  With its compatibility <br>  The Internet will be irresistible. <br><br>  WCAG.

Yeah! <br>  We want to show you WCAG. <br>  WWW-WCAG. <br>  This is not a heavy load: open your code and write WCAG. <br><br>  WCAG.  WCAG.  WWW-WCAG. <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  Hey, David, I heard a guy on TV who said that he is the fastest rapper in the world, but I'm faster.  I give it up completely, look ... <br><br>  <i>Sharkey starts speaking at a speed of 250 words a minute, and then returns to normal speed.</i> <br><br>  II am a cool DJ, Sharkey!  WWW-WCAG.  M-I like geek techno music.  I like geek techno music.  Hey, David, am I a cool rapper now? <br><br>  <i>David says</i> <br><br>  Sharkey, I could not understand a word of what you said. <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  Most of my blind friends understand everything that I say with such speed. <br><br>  <i>Stretching words</i> <br><br>  Do you want me to speak really slowly for you, David? <br><br>  <i>David says</i> <br><br>  Very funny, Sharkey.  Okay, let's do this verse together. <br><br>  <i>Sings</i> <br><br>  We are going to make the Internet better: <br>  For people of all abilities, people of all nations. <br>  Even if you surf from space, <br>  You have WCAG, WCAG. <br><br>  WWW-WCAG! <br><br>  We want to show you WCAG. <br>  We want to show you that this world can exist.

WCAG. <br><br>  <i>David, as if reading rap</i> <br><br>  So let me tell you what WCAG is and what WCAG is not. <br>  WCAG is a set of tools supplied with a set of rules that helps your website come alive for people with disabilities and perceptions. <br>  So when they get online, they can have a good time. <br>  It does not matter whether they are blind or due to gestures, or whether their hands begin to tremble with every movement they make. <br>  They will be able to easily find out all that you want to say about something, if only you wake up with the principles that we are going to lay out. <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  Principle 1: Content must be perceptible.  perceived!  perceived! <br>  2: Interface elements and content must be manageable.  Managed ... Managed! <br>  Principle 3: The content and controls should be clear.  Pon-clear!  Are clear! <br>  Principle 4: Content should be reliable.  Na-na-reliable!  Nad-reliable!  On-on-reliable!  Enough to work with current and future technologies. <br><br>  WCAG.  WCAG.  WWW-WCAG. <br><br>  <i>David sings</i> <br><br>  We want to show you WCAG. <br>  We want to show you that this world can exist.  Yes! <br>  We want to show you WCAG. <br>  This is not a heavy load: open your code and write WCAG. <br><br>  WCAG.  WCAG. <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  Hey, David, your music is pretty simple, since you came out of the suburbs and started hanging out on the corners of the central streets.  I like other topics.  It sounded too acoustically, and I was never crazy about acoustic sound.  I like geek techno music, where computers do everything and people don't play instruments.  I think it's more natural when music is played on real purchased computers.  When people play, it sounds so emotional and false. <br><br>  <i>David says</i> <br><br>  All this only because you are a big guy from a pile of zeros and ones. <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  David, between us saying, you know, I was always very sensitive.  My binary genetic code has always been a cause of great emotional instability for me. <br><br>  <i>David says</i> <br><br>  Come on, Sharkey.  You know, I have always loved a person in you, and besides, you are an amazing rapper.  Dude, you have to go to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol">American Idol</a> . <br><br>  <i>Sharkey says</i> <br><br>  I'm going to be a star.  I already see the headlines "Sharqi wins American Idol for people with disabilities." <br><br><h2>  Bonus </h2><br><br>  For those who are especially interested in David Macdonald‚Äôs computer-related creativity, we can offer a bonus in the form of the old version of the same song, but with the name ‚ÄúIt's Fun to Write the WCAG‚Äù (it's interesting to write WCAG), from 2002, which can be downloaded <a href="">here [ 4.41 MB]</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169191/</a></p>
