  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Examples of successful SMM campaigns in runet. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it has become very fashionable to talk about SMO, SMM, the blogosphere, etc.  It's funny to watch when every second advertising agency adds a prefix digital to its name, and every first in this agency has experience with social media for more than 10 years.  It is a bit surprising that experts in the industry appeared before the industry itself was born, but this is not the point.  Very often, the whole "creative" is to cheat the number of readers / subscribers / friends of customer accounts.  And it‚Äôs also good if these are real people, not bots ... But still there are excellent examples of effective application of SMM tools in runet.  We will tell about them. <br><br>  <b>Group of fans of running</b> <br>  Perhaps one of the most interesting examples of the interaction of social media with offline.  The community of amateurs of running and healthy lifestyle under the auspices of Nike in the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club17557426">vkontakte</a> social network.  In the group of more than 14,000 participants.  This is the largest running club in the world.  Group members conduct joint training in 11 parks in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the open air.  Classes are held under the guidance of professional instructors Nike Running.  The schedule of trainings that have already become regular is posted on the group‚Äôs pages.  It is noteworthy that from time to time Nike Running also organizes mass events for everyone.  Free Moscow, which took place on June 25, gathered more than 9,500 participants, of whom 1,500 took part in the competitions, while the rest were present as spectators. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/nikeiei.png" alt="image">

      <b>Promotion on Twitter furniture company</b> <br>  The online edition of <a href="http://cossa.ru/">Cossa.ru</a> published minimum budgets for campaigns in social media.  They look "a little" overpriced, but even so, the cost of the same work in two different advertising agencies may vary significantly.  Nevertheless, one of the cases on conducting an advertising campaign on Twitter shows that working in social media can be effective without transcendental budgets.  The success of this competition is largely due to the simple rules and active audience of Twitter.  Users were only asked to fold the account of the customer of an advertising campaign and, referring to it through the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/name/" class="user_link">name</a> , to offer their version of the name for furniture.  Of the additional costs of the organization, only the purchase of tweets with the announcement of the contest from popular bloggers was used.  According to the results of the action, more than two hundred names were proposed, and the winners received prizes from the Mebish product company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Viral video for building trading house</b> <br>  A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbqMyXESlK7c">short viral video</a> was recorded under the promotion of the Petrovich construction trading house in St. Petersburg.  Gazelle was presented as a sports car, drifting and performing tricks on the ice.  The yellow awning of the car and the funny inscription ‚ÄúYou are lucky!  Petrovich "attracted additional attention to the brand.  For the ‚Äúseeding‚Äù of the video, the placement of the video code on entertainment sites and forums and imitation of activity on YouTube was used.  As a result, in the first two weeks after launch, the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù scored more than 100,000 views in UTube, several hundred live comments and reposts in other social services and forums. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/petrovich.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Promotion of gasoline in automotive forums</b> <br>  TNK used automotive forums to promote its new brand, TNK Pulsar.  Interesting non-standard approach of the company.  And the point is not in some ‚Äúsuper creative concept‚Äù, but in the chosen communication tool.  Instead of creating a group in social networks or a corporate blog, the company decided to work with so-called opinion leaders.  Moderators and the most active characters in automotive forums were offered to refuel at TNK-BP stations free of charge, as well as to diagnose the car and share feedback on the test results forums.  Customers admit that they are very pleased with the results. <br><br>  To assess the effectiveness of the campaign results, a rather controversial method was used (although others do not yet exist) - comparing the results of voting on preferred gasoline brands.  Surveys were conducted before and after the campaign.  According to the organizers at the sites with agents of influence, the number of users who are ready to refuel only with Pulsar TNK gasoline, increased as a result of the campaign from 26% to 70%.  More than 1,200 forum participants have become loyal to the brand.  At the same time, in order to recognize the stock as effective and recoup the costs of its conduct, it was enough to attract 100 users.  It may have been worthwhile to use more accurate methods for measuring (for example, the use of special discount codes at gas stations for community members), but the results look very interesting (although, again, very controversial). <br><br>  We hope that this selection seemed interesting to readers.  In the near future, we plan to write another (at a minimum) review of successful and original social media campaigns.  If you have any unusual cases in mind or you are ready to share your own experience - write to us, together think of what can be done with this.  We, in turn, are planning to create an equally interesting and ambitious, and most importantly, useful project.  See you on the SMM margins! <br><br>  Sincerely, <i><b>TEL Hosting</b></i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125726/</a></p>
