Conventionally, we will consider the thesis a large project, and my post is a kind of algorithm for writing it. <br><br>  Honestly, after reading the above post, I never saw a description of the process of writing a dissertation.  In my humble opinion, the narrative has passed into the category of a set of complaints about a manager, university, etc.  I fully agree with the author in many aspects, however, no one actually said that it would be easy.  In fact, apart from the applicant, no one needs his research work.  Especially if the subject of the applicant does not coincide with the interests of the head.  I don‚Äôt know if the author has already defended himself, but according to his style of presentation, let me make the assumption that there isn‚Äôt yet, otherwise his post would be more informative from the point of view of ‚Äúmisunderstanding of the uni‚Äù. <br><br>  According to observations, at the moment I see only 2 explanations for admission to postgraduate studies by males: 1. I dug up something interesting during my studies -&gt; student conference participant -&gt; diploma with honors (or close) -&gt; graduate school.  2. I just studied normally -&gt; unwillingness after uni to go to the RF Armed Forces -&gt; graduate school (out of 10, 1-2 are successfully defended, the rest are ill).  It happens and 3 category ... stray. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As I remember, after the diploma‚Äôs defense, I was unexpectedly recommended by the commission to continue what was started in the post-graduate education regime (it turned out, not just to me, the order was probably).  Having passed the introductory (philosophy, English, special discipline), I waited with a clear conscience for the order of enrollment, but it turned out that there were 2 budget places, and those who wanted ‚Äúhoo‚Äù.  My disappointment turned out to be 50 thousand rubles.  for each year of 3 years of study, plus the feeling of "cheating."  Well, to be honest, after learning about the personalities of budgetary applicants and the initial attitude of my potential leader to my scientific initiative, I decided to still enter on a commercial basis ... That's where you have come to, later I told myself repeatedly.

      As you understand, I was not going to work as an assistant in the university, studying for money, and apparently the management of the IT department, understanding the situation, did not take much initiative.  If you do not plan to further link the work with the system of higher education, it is highly recommended to get IT experience while studying in graduate school outside the school.  Diploma Ph.D.  without experience - an employer is not particularly appreciated.  I have to write the work itself either in breaks or at home ... Well, let's go ... <br><br><h4>  1 year. </h4><br>  This is the only year when you need to go to the university, at least 2 times a week: classes in English.  and philosophy.  My experience: I was at 1 lesson in English, and at 3 in philosophy.  The result: exams for "ex."  The essence of learning: English - basic for all students + qualification text on scientific topics.  I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù - the second tower to IT education is a translator.  Philosophy: if, while studying at the university, philosophy was (and it should be), I don‚Äôt see a special meaning to duplicate the beauty of this ‚Äúscience‚Äù with postgraduate education. <br>  For another year of study, each applicant is issued a "Plan of a graduate student ....", on the basis of which the graduate student is certified or not.  Formality.  I know people who were certified at non-compliance with the plan and more than once.  Although it was not entirely clear how this could be allowed, because the applicant himself writes the plan ... It is desirable that in the first year the applicant participated in 1-2 conferences and wrote 1 article in the HAC journal.  If postgraduate studies at a technical university, then articles on IT topics are most easily published in a university journal, collecting for this purpose a manuscript, a review (from an external candidate of technical science or doctor of technical sciences), an expert opinion (!!!) and a couple more papers.  Publishing articles of graduate students in journals HAC - FREE!  One "small" condition, your article must be approved by the editorial board.  On IT topics everything is quite strict - you can‚Äôt hang a frank "lazy" in serious magazines.  I was sent from one journal at PVTI VINITI as an appendix to the positive review, even an anti-plagiarism analysis was sent.  Publications in collections of conferences, as a rule, are paid, the cost depends on the method of participation - in person or in absentia.  The wider the geography of participation in conferences, the more attention will be paid to your work, and more precisely the abstract on it.  Many first look at the title of the work, then the list of publications on the work, and the results are already the content of the abstract.  One of the important conditions: if your work claims a scientific novelty in some aspect of IT, there must be an intelligent, documented confirmation - the publication of the results.  Example (from PM): a block prototype of the functioning of the analysis system was developed, information about it was published in print at the end of 2010.  In early 2011, a well-known developer company declares the appearance of a ‚Äúunique‚Äù project of developed software with a conceptually similar deployment scheme.  In this case, the defense of the thesis, which may occur in a year and a half, to the question ‚ÄúWhat is the novelty and relevance of that?  I saw this company a year ago, ‚Äùthe applicant has the full right to declare uniqueness, because  Formally, they presented the results earlier than the company that had managed to market its product over this period.  For IT, the most interesting conferences are held in Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg, Taganrog, Saratov. <br><br><h4>  2 year. </h4><br>  You have already decided on the direction, agreed on the research methodology, have a couple of publications.  If your research has applied importance (the candidate of technical sciences in the IT field has applied importance by default), I think the research program and tools for it should be almost ready.  The tools used are either existing software or, which confirms the novelty and uniqueness of the research, the software package developed by the graduate student.  Ideally, the software should be ready for half of the training period, since  You still have a lot of time for experiments - simulation.  I advise you, after developing software, to register it with Rospatent (computer program, database for computers).  You will receive a certificate indicating the copyright holder and the author of the program.  Usually dissovetami, this certificate is counted as an additional HAC publication.  The registration procedure is not complicated, it costs about 3 tr.  In parallel with the experiments, you must continue to participate in conferences and publish in journals, where you will describe the methodology and results of your research.  Good tone, if you approach the pre-defense with the following set: 3-4 HAC articles + 4-5 Conferences + 1-2 Computer certificate - OBD or patent = 10 pcs.  Some applicants have time to release a monograph ... You do not need to overdo it if you have 20 articles in 3 years, this may cause suspicion. <br><br><h4>  3 year. </h4><br>  Usually by the beginning of 3 years they ask that a draft of a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù be ready.  You continue to accumulate statistics on the results of experiments in real or virtual environments.  Draw conclusions about the applicability of your developments in the IT field.  In the middle of the year the most interesting begins - you will be determined by the specialty: 05.13.06 or 05.13.13 or 05.13.19, etc.  and come up with the name of your work.  It is desirable - it is necessary that in a certain specialty there be advice in the university, if you, of course, do not want to go where it is not known where such advice exists.  It becomes much more difficult when your work is located at the junction of specialties, and as you understand, in IT it is very often.  In this case, the "main" specialty (those d.ts., which during the dissovet) added d.ts.  from tips on butt specialty.  This fact gives rise to various kinds of difficulties, ranging from nomenclature to transport.  If possible, avoid joints in your work.  Depending on the specialty, you must pass the special discipline and get a certificate of passing candidate exams.  It is also necessary after receipt of the specialty, all formulations, definitions, phrases should be adjusted with the specialty passport.  It is very important to write a competent abstract in which to reflect the algorithms, schemes, concepts developed by you, i.e.  all the uniqueness of your IT research, software, database without "water".  If you are not strong in mathematics, and IT, whatever one may say, is closely connected with this discipline, I advise you not to delve into the ‚Äúformulas‚Äù - you will dig into protection.  And if the quorum members also ask questions ...? <br><br><h4>  4 year. </h4> <br>  If you have completed graduate school and passed the pre-defense, according to the law, a year has been laid on the dissertation defense procedure.  This stage is one of the most difficult and has no direct relation to IT topics, but rather to the bureaucratic apparatus of the Russian Federation.  If you were able to meet the 3 years and defend yourself, the 4 year remains to wait for the approval of work in the VAK.  Usually IT work does not cause any special claims, since  plagiarism is not so much as in the humanities. <br><br>  I hope I was able to describe the process of writing a thesis in relation to the IT direction.  As always I will be glad to your comments and <br><br>  Thank you for reading to the end. <br><br>  PS In addition, by the results of IT research, it is imperative to have more than one act of implementation (research results, software, algorithms, etc.) in an organization that has at least an average IT infrastructure (a network of stalls ‚ÄúSomeone has it‚Äù fit).  The presence of an approved act confirms the practical significance of all your work. <br>  PPS Added to the hub "Learning process", there was enough karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181676/</a></p>
