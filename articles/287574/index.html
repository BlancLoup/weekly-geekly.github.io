  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do the media use Twitter? (Review of Western media practices.)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Western media have already felt the beauty of using <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> .  However, many of them are limited to just a simple broadcast of their content.  This is done very simply.  A feed is created with headers no more than 140 characters in Latin letters (if there is more, Twitter will break it apart), then create an account on <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitter</a> , give it our feed and password from our account on Twitter.  Further, Twitter on our behalf publishes on Twitter all the new headlines of our media.  A new material appears - our reader receives a message about it.  Fine!  But what else would you do? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>To start diversify.</b>  That is, use not one Twitter account, but many.  Let every journalist and section on the site (broadcast, podcast) have their own tweet.  The reader should be able to choose what he likes, and not get a pack of all the headlines per day.  After you start a detachment of individual tweets, make a page on your site that contains their full list and description, so that users find it convenient to navigate through them.  This has already been done: <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/standing/twitter.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> , <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section%3FCategory%3DMEDIA">Cincinnati Enquirer</a> , <a href="http://ginewsroom.com/twitter/">Grand Island Independent</a> , and <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section%3Fcategory%3Dtwitter">Des Moines Register</a> . <br><br>  <b>Use not only official content.</b>  Your readers or viewers are interested in not only what your media produces, but also other aspects of your life.  For example, your internal disputes in the editorial, materials that use your editors, the life of leading shows and columnists.  So it makes sense to get these tweets and bring them to the site along with the rest.  So did <a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/online/nbc_4_on_twitter/">NBC4 Columbus</a> .

      <b>Use Twitter as a source of information.</b>  Twitter is used by a huge number of people, the amount of information that they post is huge.  In order not to get lost in this stream, use <a href="http://twitterfall.com/">Twitter</a> .  This service allows you to filter everything that goes on Twitter by keyword and limit the radius of coverage geographically.  The results you see on the screen in real time.  For example, you are a small regional online newspaper.  Filter by the name of the center of your region and get all the tweets that mention it.  It would be nice to put it on the screen directly into the newsroom, as <a href="http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2009/02/25/twitterfall-makes-it-onto-telegraph-newsroom-screens/">did the British newspaper Telegraph</a> . <br><br>  <b>Use Twitter for polls.</b>  Pushing your content via Twitter is good, but not enough.  It will be more useful if you address your readers with a question.  And they will answer you using all the same Twitter.  Just have time to collect votes!  How can you turn in favor of this opportunity?  You can clarify the information - if you have information, but do not check it in any way, contact readers through your tweet, perhaps someone owns it more.  What to do if you need to interview a person who is in constant travels?  Ask him questions via Twitter.  He has no time to write an e-mail, and he will promptly reply with a short answer.  Do you doubt?  And Westerners are already practicing it.  Who does not believe, read <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_for_journalists.php">here</a> , and <a href="http://graphicdesignr.net/blog/2009/02/10/newspapers-that-twitter-i-give-up/">here</a> you can see a far incomplete list of American newspapers that twitter. <br><br>  <b>Use Twitter as a news agency.</b>  Here you don‚Äôt even need to filter, here the ready-made news is submitted in a tweet format.  Just sign up, for example, on <a href="http://twitter.com/BreakingNews">@BreakingNewsOn</a> .  True, this is a western source in English, but what prevents you from becoming such a source?  BUT?  Yes, even in Russian?  The idea for a million bucks.  :) <br><br>  <b>Use Twitter to promote the mobile version of your site.</b>  It is no secret that the majority of online media mainstream is their regular website, and its mobile version is not so popular.  So, if you use Twitter and send people links, then let these links lead to your mobile version of the site.  After all, a person receives sms from you, it is inconvenient for him to open a link to the main site with a lot of graphics.  And the wap or pda versions will load much faster. <br><br>  <b>Use Twitter for live reporting.</b>  Since journalists are constantly traveling to the scene or participating in various events, it makes no sense to wait until they throw off the information on the phone or the live broadcast starts.  Just tweet about what's going on.  After all, readers do not always have the opportunity to watch TV, listen to the radio, read the site.  They will thank you for the sms with the latest information. <br><br>  There are a few more sites that will help you better understand and use Twitter in the media.  <a href="http://tweetbeep.com/">Tweetbeep</a> will send you an e-mail as soon as it finds a tweet containing your keyword.  <a href="http://www.twitterlocal.net/">TwitterLocal</a> is an application that can narrow the geographic reach of twitterter.  <a href="http://www.breakingtweets.com/search/label/About">Breaking Tweets</a> is an interesting mix of world news and tweet reactions to them.  Tweets are selected by the editor manually.  Together they make an interesting product.  In Ecuador, <a href="http://www.hoy.com.ec/">one of the newspapers</a> uses Twitter to train inexperienced journalists, through the Twitter editor-in-chief corrects their activities and gives advice.  All this then falls into a special section on the site. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287574/</a></p>
