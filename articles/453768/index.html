Internet-based SMS sending campaigns have become an indispensable work tool for employees responsible for marketing and communication with customers. </p><br><p>  Most SMS services offer many different filters and settings, thanks to which you can take into account time zones, subscriber regional affiliation, send mailings to specific operators and much more.  Tariffing on services depends on the number of SMS messages sent, the amount of recharge, as well as the choice of the channel for sending.  Depending on your needs, you can choose a suitable SMS aggregator and a comfortable tariff plan. </p><br><p>  To date, the Internet has a large number of services that provide a service for sending SMS mailings.  In order to make the right choice, we offer you to get acquainted with the main advantages and features of their work. </p><br><p>  In this review we will consider the following services: </p><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://sms-prosto.ru/">SMS-PROSTO.RU</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://smsaero.ru/">SMS Aero</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://redsms.ru/">RED SMS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://prostor-sms.ru/">Prostorsms</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://smsc.ru/">SMSC.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.smsint.ru/">SMSint.ru</a> </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction to services </h2><br><p>  The important point is a simple and intuitive interface that provides fast interaction with the service.  In the main sections of personal accounts, the services and the process of creating mailings are described in detail, which allows you to deal with the resources in a few minutes.  Registration takes place in a few clicks and is very simple. </p><br><p>  On SMS-PROSTO.RU, you don‚Äôt even have to invent a password - it will come to the post office and, if you wish, you can change it to be convenient for you in your personal account in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù section. </p><br><p>  On the main page of your personal account you can find the main convenient menu, your balance, the subscriber database section with the ability to make targeted lists, statistics of sent messages, as well as the latest news and information on technical work, which allows you to be immediately aware of changes.  To test the service during registration you are charged 50 rubles.  Separately, I would like to note intuitively simple navigation on the service.  Everything is really simple! </p><br><p>  SMS Aero has an ascetic interface, no frills.  The service offers a bonus of 50 rubles for passing the test.  According to its results, a gift will also be offered depending on the user's preferences. </p><br><p>  RED SMS has a clear interface.  The client is immediately invited to conclude an agreement, change the tariff, and 20 welcome rubles are charged. </p><br><p>  Prostorsms offers to enter your phone number and get access for 50 days of test use to get acquainted with the service.  The trial period works with all capabilities, then there is a limit on the number of messages, and also provides for a change in the tariff. </p><br><p>  SMSC.ru offers to test your service with the help of a demo cabinet.  The interface contains all the necessary information - from the balance and the number of messages to customer numbers, which can be added individually or combined into groups.  The interface is a bit outdated, but functional and simple.  You can register through social networks. </p><br><p>  SMSint.ru has a fairly clear menu, but the work area is a bit overloaded with news, congratulations and thanks.  It does not affect the work, but for beginners it is difficult to navigate.  Otherwise, everything is quite simple.  There are 12 rubles on the account for test mailings. </p><br><h2>  Newsletter </h2><br><h3>  SMS-PROSTO.RU </h3><br><p>  Immediately after registration, 50 rubles are charged to the account, which can be used to test the service.  It is possible to create an unlimited number of databases of subscribers, with the help of which you can conveniently use databases in work.  When you download the subscriber database, the system automatically deletes duplicates, landline numbers and non-existent numbers.  Additionally, it can be noted that there is a function of sending single SMS messages - this is convenient for sending service SMS for small companies. </p><br><p>  When creating a mass SMS mailing, you can select the time to start the newsletter, delete subscribers from other regions and time zones to which you do not plan to send the newsletter.  These can be all numbers from the database or only those that do not have Viber, if you also use the mailing via this messenger.  In addition, you can specify the sending speed - all at once or smoothly, taking into account the time difference. </p><br><p>  There is also a useful function of unsubscribing subscribers from the mailing list and automatically including them in the ‚ÄúBlack List‚Äù.  This function is very useful for clearing the database of subscribers to whom your newsletters have become irrelevant and not interesting. </p><br><p>  When creating a template, you can see how the words look on the phone display.  Additionally, the system counts the number of printed characters and makes an accurate calculation of the price of mailing. </p><br><p>  Any packet size messages are sent at high speed.  You can also send messages with a personal appeal - your name or company name. </p><br><h3>  SMS Aero </h3><br><p>  To try the possibilities of the service, the client is offered 50 welcome rubles.  You can add numbers manually or load the finished database.  The service offers 5 sending channels: advertising, informational, service and international. </p><br><p>  It offers a preview of messages and the ability to edit the text.  When creating a template, you can see how the words will look on the phone display.  You can also specify arbitrary information about the sender, select the text from the previously saved template. </p><br><h3>  RED SMS </h3><br><p>  The service has 2 ways to create a newsletter: on its own database and a database that can be uploaded through various instant payment terminals (Qiwi, etc.).  In the first case, you can download your customer base and send messages to them.  The second method makes it possible to select an audience. </p><br><p>  After registration, a test mailing is offered: stock of free messages.  Even large packets are sent at high speed due to direct connection to operators.  Mailing is possible in any country. </p><br><h3>  ProstorSMS </h3><br><p>  To create newsletters are invited to download the free program.  This is not as convenient as the work from the personal account that other services offer. </p><br><p>  In it, the program can make a group mailing using ready-made templates or send individual messages according to the specified parameters.  The system allows you to monitor the process of sending online. </p><br><p>  You can request a report in the mail or view it in your account.  There is integration with 1C, API, HTTP / XML and instructions for integration into an online store, CRM or a program / application. </p><br><h3>  SMSC.ru </h3><br><p>  When registering, the account is replenished by 15 rubles for testing. </p><br><p>  Sending messages is done in different ways. </p><br><p>  You can do this through an Internet site from your personal account and a wap site from your phone.  There are also programs for Windows, Android, 1C.  Sending is also possible with MS Outlook and SharePoint or from a phone with SMS. </p><br><p>  In addition, there is support for long messages and the possibility of substituting the name of the company, even if it is not in the recipient's address book.  You can also send personal messages with a personal appeal. </p><br><h3>  SMSint.ru </h3><br><p>  In your account there is a convenient field for writing a message.  You can select filters by number, time of sending.  Each number in the database is assigned its own characteristics: operator, gender, birthday, mail and age.  They can be deleted, modified, entered into a stop list. </p><br><p>  Distribution is configured according to certain criteria and periods.  You can assign sending both after a specified period of time and on a specified day: name day, anniversary of working with a company, etc. </p><br><p>  In the ‚ÄúReceive Sms‚Äù section, you can set up alerts when receiving messages from customers whose numbers are added to the list.  Here you can view a list of received messages. </p><br><h2>  Basic services </h2><br><h3>  SMS-PROSTO.RU </h3><br><p>  This service offers not only SMS mailing.  With it, you can send through popular messengers: Viber and WhatsApp. </p><br><p>  In addition, there is a function of SMS-advertising, in which you only need to specify your target audience and provide information about your company. </p><br><p>  The site contains a large library of ready-made scripts for API and SMPP integration, as well as ready-made solutions for modern SAAS systems. </p><br><h3>  SMS Aero </h3><br><p>  The service is not limited to SMS and Viber-mailing. </p><br><p> The resource also has a form for collecting customer contacts on the site.  By placing a widget on it, you can get contacts of interested customers and get a high response.
