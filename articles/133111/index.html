  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search for volunteer guides</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading a sufficient amount of motivational literature, links to which are often found at Habr√©, I decided to try to follow one of the often repeated advice: take and implement your idea, and not think much will / fail, what people around you will say and the like. <br><br>  There were quite a lot of ideas, but it took quite a lot of time to implement, because you want to do everything perfectly at once, so that others themselves were delighted, but in pursuit of quality of forces, there are less and less, and the fuse ends, and by the time when promotion, filling the new site, enthusiasm dries up and the project is postponed to the shelf. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis topic is to tell about a new resource for independent travelers, maybe it will seem interesting to someone.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  This time I decided to use a slightly different approach, I decided to spend as little time as possible on development and design, and as much as possible on the promotion of the idea.  Since the idea does not require the solution of any complex technical problems, I chose technologies that will allow you to quickly implement what you have planned, for this I needed a cms and a design.  As a cms, I chose the most familiar ngcms for myself, and the design sketched in the process. <br><br>  Now, about the idea, I myself like to travel to European countries, the experience is still small, but still, in each of the cities, it was possible to find such quiet small museums, often supported by one amateur of their city (country) who is completely free, for reviewing the visitors book will tell a lot of interesting things about which you can read in an ordinary guidebook.  Before the trip, I tried to find and ask the locals on facebook, but it seemed to me a rather laborious process, and I thought that it would be great to have some one site where I could immediately go to someone who would be happy to talk about your own country or city, make a new international acquaintance, and take a short tour of your city, or just meet for a pizza or a cup of mokachino. <br><br>  More recently, there was information that a group of activists in Finland - about 10 people - conducted such excursions for free. <br><br>  Thus, a brief idea can be formulated as follows: a site for searching volunteer guides. <br><br>  As a result, in a few evenings, during free time from studies and work, I developed such a site, maybe it will be interesting to someone, then I‚Äôm waiting for you at <a href="http://flunter.com/">flunter.com</a> . <br><br>  I will be glad to feedback and advice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133111/</a></p>
