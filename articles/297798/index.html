Marissa Mayer, who has been in office since mid-2012. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Early in Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Yahoo!  she inspired employees and gave them hope for the company's prosperity, but after more than three years of faith in the bright future of Yahoo!  and in Marissa itself, the company's employees are almost gone.  According to information from the American Glassdoor website, where people can anonymously evaluate the companies in which they work or work, only a third of Yahoo!  believes that the company is doing well and developing normally.  In order to feel how small this figure is, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that on Twitter, 61% of employees believe that the company is moving towards a brighter future, and on Google, 77% are even more.  Glassdoor spokesman Scott Dobroski (Scott Dobroski), who analyzed data from the survey, said that "employees have lost confidence in Marissa Meyer herself." <br><br>  Yahoo! staff cuts  started back in August 2014, when the first wave of layoffs began - at that time, employees left the state every month, which could not but create a tense atmosphere inside the company.  Marissa Mayer was forced to take this step after the requirements of the Starboard Value LP fund, which is the company's investors, to cut Yahoo!  for 500 million dollars.

      In March last year, Marissa announced that the "bloodshed" was over, and everyone can breathe easy - no further layoffs are planned.  However, despite her promise, she changed her mind, and another 1,100 employees were dismissed from the company by the end of the year.  Now Yahoo!  has 11 thousand people, many of whom do not favor Mrs. Meyer.  Moreover, the next wave of state mass reductions will take place at the end of January of this year, as we <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/23156/">wrote</a> earlier. <br><br>  Fearing that the company would lose valuable employees, Marissa awarded huge bonuses (up to several million dollars) to keep them from going to competitors.  However, such a policy did not cause excitement among other employees, further reducing the popularity of the CEO. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297798/</a></p>
