Finally, you do not need to get up to the light of a dawn, jostle in public transport and listen to the notation of the chief.  Grace, and only! <br><br>  But over time, all these benefits can turn into bad habits that will not be best reflected on the success of <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/jobs/">remote work</a> .  Moreover, this ‚Äúquagmire‚Äù very quickly and imperceptibly forms that you will not even notice it immediately.  Is that when you calculate your regular monthly earnings and realize that it has decreased.

      In order not to fall into such a trap, one should, first of all, not lose discipline.  And although in symbiosis with the notion of freelancing, it sounds a bit mocking, without it it is impossible to constantly stay afloat, working remotely. <br><br>  Self-discipline is actually at the forefront of success in the freelance field.  But how to support it, read on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who gets up early ... </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/yt/md/vaytmdpwlopqch8cshdft_rqph8.png"><br><br>  Waking up at any time, not observing any time horizons, is a very bad habit.  It not only affects the decrease in performance, but also negates the seriousness of your remote work.  Therefore, it is very important to set yourself working hours and, in particular, the time of your ascent.  If you believe psychologists and other scientists, it is ideal to wake up at 8 am.  In addition, it is in the first half of the day that people are the most active and efficient.  But in the second half, many are experiencing an energy decline.  This also applies to your customers. <br><br>  Those freelancers who prefer to lead an owl lifestyle should spend the time during the day to negotiate with customers.  Many of them work as standard from 9.00 to 17-18.00, and after that they become inaccessible for communication.  Do not disturb them with clarifications or submission of work at a time convenient for you, but absolutely unacceptable for them.  Look for balance.  Still, the client is always right. <br><br><h2>  Meet on clothes ... </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/jm/xc/8ujmxcaf0givbxdil3uhtwdi-2u.png"><br><br>  Just give up work in pajamas.  Even if you are alone in the apartment, and no one sees you.  Your brain and subconscious mind perceive pajamas as an action for relaxation, rest and sleep.  That is why, without removing it, you risk constantly yawn and literally doze in the process. <br><br>  You should not, of course, dress in a business suit or a pencil skirt, but you still need to clean up.  And the last applies not only to clothing, but also to brushing your teeth, taking a shower, combing / shaving.  It helps to cheer up and tune in to the working mood. <br><br><h2>  Flies separately, cutlets separately </h2><br>  Never work in a bed, or near it.  And generally move away from the place where you sleep.  The kitchen is also not the best option.  However, like the bathroom.  It has the same psychological principle as with pajamas. <br><br>  Try to equip a separate (albeit conditionally) mini-office, which will be your workplace.  This will help to focus on tasks and switch the brain from the "home" mode to the "labor" mode. <br><br><h2>  I see no one, I hear no one </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/vi/vd/lcvivdt0ymdxitja9_4kcstldw8.png"><br><br>  Abstract from all Internet junk that is not related to your specific job.  Turn off beeps about changes in social networks.  Do not look there every hour.  Yes, and messengers, too, it is desirable to translate into silence.  A glance enough to understand from whom the message came.  If this is not a client, then it is not interesting. <br><br>  The same fully applies to homemade distractions in the form of a cup of coffee, a sandwich or a cigarette.  Until you complete the task or part of it - no joys of life.  Even the people said that walking boldly only when he did business. <br><br><h2>  Not by work alone </h2><br>  While focusing on the task, do not forget about the well-deserved breaks.  It is good if it will not be just 15 minutes of a snack or a smoke break, but a full exit to the street, meeting with a friend or other motor and communicative activity.  It refreshes the mind, allows you to relax and does not turn into a home worm.  And such breaks are definitely useful for maintaining a healthy physical and mental form.  Both with the first, and with the second, freelancers often have problems. <br><br><h2>  Tasks, plans, business goals </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lb/ug/af/lbugafmjp10dut4rq_lwns5qcps.png"><br><br>  It is very important to have at least a minimum schedule.  Let it be notes for the next day, plans for a month or more long-term goals.  It is important not to overdo it, harnessed into the race for financial success.  The result of the exorbitant work activity will be burnout and subsequent procrastination. <br><br>  Try to calculate how much time it takes you to complete a standard task within your specialization.  This will help to make a plan for the month with the calculation of the number of projects and financial rewards for them. <br><br><h2>  60 minutes for yourself </h2><br>  Not in the plan to go to the hairdresser or a dentist.  For this you have the 5th item. <br>  Be sure to spend 1 hour per day on your improvement and development.  Read specialized literature and articles, participate in webinars, learn a foreign language, or learn a new skill.  You can also devote this hour to your own image.  For example, write a post to your account, update your portfolio on the stock exchange or website, review brief points and so on. <br><br>  This will help you move forward in the field of remote work, thereby increasing your earnings.  The implementation of a huge number of similar projects, not recognizing and not trying new, is going nowhere. <br><br><h2>  At last </h2><br>  But if suddenly you feel that you are tired and exhaled, allow yourself a well-deserved rest, even if only 2 days.  In terms of productivity, it is much more useful than work on the outcome of the forces.  The whip is a whip, but the gingerbread for the work also relies. <br><br>  How do you discipline yourself working from home?) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457040/</a></p>
