It is made specifically for people in Russia, taking into account all the local features that we know about.  And we, as a company that answers more than 250 million inquiries from Russian users a day, know a lot about such features and needs. <br><br>  The built-in keyboard of Keith knows the cases of the Russian language and prompts words when entering with their account.  Searching the address book understands that Alexander, Sasha and Shura are one and the same.  Yandex.Kit recognizes Russian speech well, geolocation technologies and maps from Yandex are built into it.  In addition, the address book in Whale is infinite.  Thanks to data from the Yandex.Reference Guide, you can search for the phones of the nearest pharmacies and cafes right in the dealer interface.  This also makes it possible to determine an incoming call from an organization unknown to you, the data about which will be loaded from the cloud.  And this is not all that Yandex has learned for all those years, which makes search and mobile applications in Russia. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/213103/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/540/b55/2a5/540b552a5cdf47d73cc884bf4ae6c1d5.png" alt="Yandex.Kit"></a>

      Individual elements of China will be presented in February at the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona.  In March, we will be ready to share with you the firmware that you can try on your devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We want to warn that it will be installed on top of the system that already exists in your smartphone without the ability to save data.  Yandex.Kit is a ready-made software solution that is installed on phones or tablets during production.  Therefore, we will provide the firmware only to those for whom it is important to understand how Yandex.Kit works and who are ready for this to run an experiment on their device.  To get to the list of testers, write to us at <a href="">kit-preview@yandex-team.ru</a> and tell us why you want to try the firmware, and what experience you have of testing or developing for Android you have.  It will be important for us to hear your comments and suggestions. <br><br>  Most people in Russia use Yandex services and applications.  We know that even on devices where our search is not preinstalled, people choose it themselves - the share of Yandex on Android exceeds 50%.  We have combined our technologies and knowledge about the needs of the Russian people with the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù of our first manufacturing partners. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hemPcMFGEmc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjc5gsoplpJF4hnMZ4kVrG5iA-UpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Existing mobile interfaces are mainly created by people for whom the native language is English.  For us, knowledge of the Russian language and its morphology is no less important than the creation of machine learning algorithms.  Every day, questions to Yandex in different formulations, with errors and without, are asked more than 250M times.  Search is very important to understand the language.  Thanks to this, we have learned a lot in this area, which allowed our team to create a keyboard that knows all the complexities and peculiarities of the Russian language.  Type in sentences faster due to fewer clicks.  We know which word you want to type next.  Our keyboard is the fastest in terms of typing speed among analogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86f/bce/41a/86fbce41a95c4c67ea942c2c8ad64468.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's go to the address book.  Most often, we write down contacts in a hurry, and we can not always remember exactly how we did it.  Our address book doesn't care how the contact is recorded - Alexander, Sasha or even Shura. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11e/7c5/1bf/11e7c51bf9ff80401c7b4d99a1902192.png" width="453" height="800" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, we have an endless address book, the technology of which we patented a couple of years ago.  By uploading data from the Yandex.Referred Directory, which contains contacts of 2M organizations, it will determine which organization called you and help you find the phone of the nearest pharmacy without switching to a separate application.  How we invented and implemented this, in detail described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dmitrdem/" class="user_link">dmitrdem</a> in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/186988/">post</a> about the diler in Yandex.Shell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/c75/b2c/39dc75b2cc528cec4e03fb93f6383d34.png" width="453" height="800" alt="image"><br><br>  In Whale, there is a feature that I personally like very much.  As you know, the most popular way to create a complex password is to type it in Russian letters on the English layout.  It is convenient to do this on desktop keyboards, and with mobile there were problems: it was necessary to install special applications that helped to make such a "translation".  We made a special mode in the keyboard Yandex.Kita.  Now both Russian and English letters can be seen simultaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4a/bda/74c/b4abda74c29c2fe09566f3ec62d9a2a1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In some applications with geolocation, you will see Yandex.Maps - we have implemented a special mechanism that, when the application is addressed to the mapping API that is missing on the device, redirects the request to the built-in Yandex MapKit.  Speech recognition uses our voice technologies - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/198556/">Yandex.SpeechKit</a> . <br><br>  In addition, we carefully approached the question of Keith consumption of the smartphone battery and tried to minimize the number of processes running on the device at the same time.  Due to this device, Yandex.Kit work longer than analogs.  Our main task in its creation was to make a smart, but at the same time easy to use phone. <br><br>  We have applied our knowledge and experience in creating interfaces, so that even an unprepared user can easily understand the smartphone.  Yandex.Kit is comfortable and beautiful, and it will be ready to work in a few minutes after the first power up.  We made sure that it was easy to move from an old phone to a new one: Yandex.Move helps you to transfer the most important thing - contacts from the address book. <br><br>  We paid special attention to the usability of the phone.  For example, here is one of the important interface changes.  We realized that people rarely use the list of applications, so there is no it in Yandex.Kite - all new applications are added directly to the home screen.  We use Yandex.Shell as it.  But this is not the Shell you are used to seeing.  We completely redraw it - removed all unnecessary, updated the design of the main elements.  It has become even more beautiful, light and comfortable.  Carousel began to work more smoothly.  As a result, Yandex.Kit got an ergonomic intuitive interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b2/d64/0f5/6b2d640f55bf1c341920b5dca0e7624a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea6/086/504/ea6086504985926bf560ae7357bf4b98.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Smartphones from our partners with Yandex.Kit will go on sale this spring - it will not be possible to install it on your device separately. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213103/</a></p>
