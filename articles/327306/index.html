Especially love Star Wars.  And once I realized that no matter how many stories were multifaceted, its morality can be adapted to many things.  And actually, because I decided to write a small collection of lessons, one for each episode of two completed trilogies. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Lesson 1</b> : Never let your hobby become a force capable of harming you (and even worse, so as not to harm others). 
      <br>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/809/349/6848093491a841dbac4fcdc09c128527.jpg"><br><br>  It's simple, when Qui-Gon met Anakin (who was destined to do a lot of good and bad), he began caring for the boy as his own hobby.  No more, no less.  He defended him in front of the Jedi Council, and carried him everywhere with him to dangerous missions (for example, to the war, to Naboo).  In the end, he gave the boy a start in life, which he used to the full extent.  But what is the result of this trip?  Qui-Gon himself died in the first film, and by the third Anakin destroyed the Republic, which was so important for the Galaxy. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : a hobby in a business that starts innocently may well play a very bad joke with you.  Do not get carried away too much. <br><br>  <b>Lesson 2</b> : Never trust less important colleagues to less experienced colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d99/e5c/d44/d99e5cd444f740f08fdf111b7ae1fcc6.jpg"><br><br>  In the second episode, Obi-Wan entrusted Anakin with an important mission - to protect Senator Amidala from possible assassinations.  And Anakin failed miserably a mission.  He broke the covenants of the Jedi and fell in love and became attached.  He left his prescribed shelter, and set off on a dangerous journey to Tatooine, where he destroyed the whole village of savages from a sense of revenge.  And when he tried to rectify the situation and go to rescue Obi-Wan from captivity, he landed behind bars with him.  And along with Senator Amidala. <br><br>  More experienced people had to save the situation, such as Master Windu and Master Yoda with the rest of the guys. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : young people need practice, but adequately assess their strength and use their strengths. <br><br>  <b>Lesson 3</b> : Check the facts, how convincing they would seem <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80a/6e8/a83/80a6e8a83ee7461e8bc56f83eec99714.JPG"><br><br>  In fact, the third episode could have a completely different ending, if Anakin (and already Vader) checked the words of Palpatine.  Ultimately, he could check if his children were still alive.  From the fact that he would verify the facts cited to him and reveal their falsity - it could happen that Vader overthrew the Emperor, seized power, and maybe even returned to the bright side. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : they have two facts, always check. <br><br>  <b>Lesson 4</b> : The team must be able to form, sometimes at the cost of lack of control <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/913/bcf/38d/913bcf38d54c404d86d1d5da531e4941.jpg"><br><br>  In the fourth episode, Obi-Wan, drawing Luke along with him on a dangerous journey, hires a ship with a crew from Han Solo and Chewbacca.  And as an experienced strategist, Obi-Wan understood that victory in their adventure is possible only if he can make a team of them.  What he actually promptly and engaged.  He told stories, spent time with the whole crew.  And in the end, during the clash on the Death Star, he divided responsibilities, sending Luke, Han and Chewbacca to release Leia, and he set off to carry out a more dangerous mission.  As a result, the newly minted team had to rally, even against their will.  And the sacrifice of the old Jedi, put an end to a kind of team building.  As we can see later, this team has become a family.  The real and practical management of a distant galaxy. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : sometimes the manager needs to relieve the team from control, properly separating tasks.  Trust and divide. <br><br>  <b>Lesson 5</b> : You can win, but you need to be prepared for a retaliatory strike <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/687/783/d83/687783d839ef4820a03b235492717d99.jpg"><br><br>  The fifth episode, in itself as a film, presents a very important lesson.  After a victory, or a first strike (call it what you want), there is always an answer.  Life with us and business do the same.  Luke, going to the distant planet Dagoba to study at Yoda, is full of determination and hope.  The training does not go smoothly, but still, slowly and confidently, the teacher and the student moved to a successful end. <br><br>  Unfortunately, we as humans do not always have enough patience.  As soon as Luke through the force feels that his friends are in trouble, he throws everything and goes to help.  Nobility, you think.  But no.  Luke was definitely not ready for this meeting with Vader.  And for that there are several deep reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  he has not completed his Jedi training, which means he is still not quite emotionally ready to resist temptations (the dark side) </li><li>  his combat technique is not thorough, and Vader is much stronger and more experienced </li><li>  his friends would have done quite well on their own (which they did in fact), that is, he did not have enough strong faith in his own friends </li></ul><br>  Having suffered defeat and having learned the terrible truth about Vader, Luke loses his brush.  But if he prepared more, trusted friends and finished his studies - he would be ready for such an imperial response and could cope with them more adequately. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : be prepared, constantly learn and do not rush from hot to the pool.  The counter strike may be more painful than yours. <br><br>  <b>Lesson 6</b> : Even if everything went wrong, it does not mean that everything is lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1c/ec4/5d0/e1cec45d014a409bb9a8bb2e2e9025b6.JPG"><br><br>  At the end of the sixth episode, during the final fight between Vader, the Emperor and Luke, the latter began to be seduced by the dark side of power.  As we know, for the Jedi this is the last thing.  This scenario was completely suited to Palpatine, who wanted to change the old chain dog to a new one.  Actually, he almost succeeded when Luke decided not to restrain himself to attack the old Sith. <br><br>  But having thought about it in time, he returns to the correct principles and will save the situation.  Saves the Galaxy, saves Vader and gives the Republic a chance.  This development is like a good old fairy tale, but the lesson is really important. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : if it seems that everything went downhill, stop and exhale.  The decision will come by itself, well, or it will become easier for you to find it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327306/</a></p>
