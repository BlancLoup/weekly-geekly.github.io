Last year, we just finished the <a href="http://www.ringcloud.ru/">virtual PBX RingCloud</a> and tried to do a good beta test before launching the production solution.  I think we did it.  Under the cut - infographics, distribution of testers to testers and content photos (even from Berlin against the Reichstag !!!). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On August 19, 2014, we announced the start of beta testing of our virtual PBX. <br><br>  The purpose of this beta test was to collect information about errors and shortcomings that were made during the development process.  Beta testing was conducted in three areas that interested the company in terms of quality performance.

      ¬∑ Testing usability; <br><br>  ¬∑ Testing SIP interactions; <br><br>  ¬∑ Testing security solutions. <br><br>  We searched for testers through social networks, advertisements and articles on specialized sites.  The prize in each nomination was announced Apple iPad 3. The winner was the one who discovered the most errors. <br><br>  We recorded 272 registrations in the system for testing.  But, as a result, 117 testers registered in the system.  For participants, a scheme of actions was developed according to which they tested our virtual PBX. <br><br>  Testers worked remotely.  Especially for participation in beta testing, we set up our system for receiving requests for malfunctions.  All that was required of the participants is to send a letter to us at a special mailing address. <br><br>  The end date of the beta test was September 5, 2014, and the results were announced on September 12. <br><br>  In each nomination we were sent errors and system malfunctions.  Usability was sent to us by 20 testers, by connecting 6 people and by safety 2. <br><br>  As a result, we received 228 errors, 98 of which were taken to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28d/df7/af9/28ddf7af9e074d819cbe99e91bcfe080.jpg"><br><br>  In the Usability nomination a real struggle unfolded between the participants, up to the very last day of testing.  Most of all the errors sent to us: Catherine Artomonova, Ryzhikov Denis and Alexander Bogomolov. <br><br>  Between them, our development team and choose the winner.  Determining the winner was difficult.  All participants approached testing creatively, showed a creative approach to interface analysis and helped us make the interface even simpler and more understandable.  Following the results of testing, we presented the Apple iPad to Ekaterina Artomonova, who made the most significant contribution to improving the usability of our virtual PBX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b7/704/e10/0b7704e10ee94039901a224751b5d769.jpg"><br><br>  In the course of testing the security of our system, many aspects were checked, many attempts were made to break by our beta testers, for which we thank them so much.  The most active participants in this nomination were: Stanislav Eremin and Loktionov Lev. <br><br>  I would like to highlight the attempts of bruteforcing and SQL-injection attacks from the variety of tested vulnerabilities, although they did not lead to the result, but still made us understand that we are moving in the right direction.  For this type of attack, I would like to especially thank Stanislav Eremin, who approached the issue very professionally, and also pointed out many XSS vulnerabilities, security issues during registration and CSRF vulnerabilities, for which we gave him an Apple iPad.  The most interesting thing is that during the beta test Stanislav moved to Europe to implement a new project, but we kept our word and delivered a gift to Berlin! <br><br>  Because for the <a href="http://www.ringcloud.ru/">virtual PBX RingCloud</a> there are no boundaries.  Thanks for attention! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3b/36d/443/e3b36d4437c141a6b86a80f69610c9a7.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289930/</a></p>
