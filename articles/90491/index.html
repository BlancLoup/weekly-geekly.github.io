  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You must be a fool to start a company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you really think about it, launching a new business is the lot of fools.  I do not have specific statistics, but I would say that at least 70% of all startups are closed in 5-7 years.  And even if you are successful enough, you should be resistant to stress and able to recover quickly from failure.  Statistics works against you - you are simply doomed to failure.  Have I gone too far, and have I offended everyone with whom I work as a venture capitalist?  I do not think.  In fact, I love working with fools and never really believed in statistics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me give you a comparison that will help me get my point across.  Meet any couple shortly before the wedding.  No, really try it.  And just before they go to the altar, ask them about their chances for a successful marriage.  Of course, they will answer that their chances are 100%.  All marry and marry expecting 100% success.  This is silly, because almost half of marriages end in divorce.  But people get married without paying attention to statistics.  All because of the emotions that make you "dive" into marriage, even if you know that the statistics are against you.  You are stupid, stupefied with love!  OK, as long as I don't get too excited, let's go back to the point of this note. <br><br>  When you start a new business, you know that the probability of success is small.  In fact, if you look at the venture capitalists' deals, the chances are even less than at casino bets.  But, as I said earlier, and I will repeat it again, in order to be an entrepreneur, it is important to withstand stress and the ability to recover from failures.  In addition, to really ‚Äúdive‚Äù into business, you need to have a passion for entrepreneurship.  This is not a lifestyle, and being an entrepreneur is not as glamorous as it is often said.  To go this way you must be a fool and be prepared for failure.  You must take enormous risks and blindly step forward.  You will never have a 100% guarantee of success.  To be completely honest, you will never even have a 50% guarantee.  But this is exactly why I love my job so much.  The people I work with are so stupid that I am doomed to enjoy working with them, no matter how difficult it is.  Those who are not stupid enough do not attract me, and I usually do not work with them.  And it completely suits me. <br><habracut></habracut></div>
