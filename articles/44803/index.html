At first glance, this sounds paradoxical, because, if you think about it, those others do similar things. <br><br>  The differences, of course, are: the illustrator solves first the aesthetic, and the designer the marketing task.  Simply put - the task of the illustrator is to make the eye pleasing, and the designer to be sold.  But even despite the above differences, at a certain stage of work, both the designer and illustrator are engaged, in principle, with the same thing - they build a composition, highlight the main thing, harmoniously select colors, etc.  But it is necessary to change their places for a while, the amount oh how it will change.  And the illustration will be useless and the design is ugly.

      Do not believe?  Then I suggest to spend a little experience <a name="habracut"></a>  (I personally conducted it repeatedly).  Ask the illustrator to make a business card.  Do not draw an illustration on the whole business card, namely to make the design of a business card (possibly including some kind of illustration).  I am sure the business card of most illustrators will be very, very mediocre. <br><br>  Looking at the design made by the majority of illustrators, I personally have questions - where is the ability to build a composition, where is the subtle, intuitive elaboration of the color gamut, where there is an attentive attitude to details.  Where has it all gone?  As if starting to make a business card (or design of something else), the illustrator completely forgets what he studied for so long and what he successfully uses when drawing illustrations. <br><br>  It seems to me that one of the reasons lies in the different perceptions of the illustrator of his work and the work of the designer. <br><br>  I remember in Habr√© was a post, which is quite a scientifically explained why a person is more willing to work for free than for little money.  The author explained this by the fact that in the first case, a person thinks on a social plane (I do it for free, that means I am helping someone), and in the second case - on the plane of earnings (I earn little). <br><br>  Something similar, it seems to me, is happening in our case.  When the artist begins to do design, his thinking switches to another plane, where the previous knowledge remains unsuccessful.  Few, very few illustrators are able to apply their artistic skills in the field of design.  My opinion. <br><br>  What is the conclusion from all this, I drew for myself.  The illustrator should illustrate, and the designer should do the design.  It sounds trite, but many really don‚Äôt understand it.  Using a bunch of illustrators, the designer is much more efficient than just an illustrator: the first will create high-quality illustrations, the second will determine a worthy place for them in their design. <br><br>  And finally, I will give one more example.  To ask an illustrator to make a design for a small amount of money is also the same as ordering a design, for example, a booklet in a printing house where you want to print it - it will certainly be cheaper, but the result in most cases will not please you.  Everyone must do their job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44803/</a></p>
