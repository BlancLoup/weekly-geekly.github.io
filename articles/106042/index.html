  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rethinking mobile phone concept</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What do we use our phones for (smartphones, communicators, for whom do you like more)?  There are 5 main areas: <br><ul><li>  Web (everything done through a browser) </li><li>  Voice communication (regular calls, skype, fring) </li><li>  Text communication (sms, e-mail, IM) </li><li>  Multimedia (viewing and creating content - photo / video / audio, reading books) </li><li>  Games </li></ul><br>  The division is very conditional, because all the directions are closely intertwined, it suffices to recall the messages, games and videos in social networks.  The Internet is the first item not by chance - its role in our life is comparable only with heat and food, and continues to grow.  ‚ÄúSocialized‚Äù devices are becoming more and more common, from phones with Facebook and Twitter clients stitched to tablets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, voice communication is not in a hurry to take positions, everything else still complements the main function of the <i>phone</i> - voice transmission.  At the same time for reading blogs and books, games, watching videos, you need a large screen with a high resolution, a powerful processor and a video accelerator, and to power all this happiness - a capacious battery.  As a result, we get 2 problems inherent in modern devices: immodest dimensions of what was once called a phone, and a very modest time of its life from a single charge. <br><br>  Everyone solves these problems in his own way - they don‚Äôt care at all, it‚Äôs convenient for someone to hold a 4.5-inch brick at the ear and carry a charge with them, and some have 2 devices with them at once: a regular phone for talking and sms and something more advanced ‚Äî for example, MID ‚Äî for everything else. <br><br>  Each of these approaches has obvious flaws, but in the latter, in the author‚Äôs subjective opinion, they are the least.  This separation of functions makes it possible to make each device as convenient as possible for its intended use.  A larger device can be really <i>big</i> - with a screen of 7-10 inches, because it does not need to be kept near the ear.  The large size allows you to provide the device with a powerful battery, which solves the problem of short run time.  At the same time, such dimensions do not prevent almost all the time to have a tablet with you.

      For a mobile phone, telephone functions are most important.  As long as the numbers are running (and they are unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future), a numeric keypad will not be superfluous.  The touch screen is nice, but for the convenience of dialing numbers, it doesn‚Äôt compare with the good old buttons with which you can quickly dial a number blindly.  But all the other keys (except for two "tubes") can be safely removed, making room for a comfortable numeric keypad and screen.  All navigation can be touch (this is very intuitive), but the screen should not be too big - two or three inches is enough. <br><br>  With the help of a classic phone, now you can do almost everything the same as with a tablet - but much is very inconvenient.  We have to put up with a defective browser, small print, weak hardware, not to mention a small screen.  But why torture yourself?  Let the mobile phone serve only for those tasks for which it is the most convenient means - calls and urgent messages, and for everything else there is a tablet.  The most important function of the phone is to display the list of contacts in a convenient way, and so that calling the right person by the desired number (mobile, city, Skype) or writing a short message (sms, icq, VKontakte) was as simple as possible.  And of course, normal synchronization and transfer of contacts is just necessary - in order for them to be available from any device and not have to manually enter numbers. <br><br>  Thus, the phone from a universal device turns into a highly specialized, but indispensable.  If you continue to fantasize, you can see that no one (except cellular operators) does not interfere with supplying mobile phones with communication functions via SIP or the city network using wi-fi - then the landline phone is completely unnecessary.  And all-in-one devices (like the Motorola Droid X) are needed by those for whom it is important to have only one device for everything at once. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106042/</a></p>
