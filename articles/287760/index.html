Blogger World Navigator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/195904.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/195904.html</a> <br><br>  <b>Only we have a real blog review!</b> <br><br>  Recently, I have been increasingly informed that fake Leshi Khaletskoye are touring the country, who are also trying to review blogs, presenting these pseudoscopes as real ones.  Fakes are almost no different from the original, except for one important quality - they are not encouraging.  Therefore, I urge you to be extremely attentive and check every review for quality.  The quality mark is usually on the first page and contains a set of letters that easily folds into the phrase "Computer News". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Evil aunt was too lazy not to let me write the next issue of ‚ÄúThe Territory of Sound‚Äù this week, however, something for the musicians was written in this review.  One of the largest music companies, SonyBMG, no longer accepts demo recordings from artists on physical media.  For these purposes, she opened two sites at once, where you can download a music file, photo and author biography.  Both resources - <a href="http://www.columbiademos.co.uk/">www.columbiademos.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.rcademos.co.uk/">www.rcademos.co.uk</a> - are, rather, blogs, where everyone can communicate with like-minded people.  " <em>Blogs are one of the most noticeable trends. Every day, 100,000 blogs are being started at once, the blogosphere doubles every 230 days. So it was very reasonable for the majors to adopt a new tool that allows them to quickly get acquainted with promising talents</em> ," commented the decision SonyBMG its executive director Ged Doherty.  It should be noted that SonyBMG is not a pioneer in this case.  The first blogs began to use social networking projects like Sellaband and Bebo, thus trying to attract talents and make them known to the maximum number of users.

      The Internet is rich in various communities of interest.  There are different lovers of shaved armpits, glamorous fascists, bearded emo (no, not ostriches), freaks against cosmetics, a community of piraasts (this is from the word "PR") and other amusing human clusters.  Feminists, of course, are also human, and using blogs is considered to be a business at all, even useful.  In this connection, there are some <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/feministki/429415.html">very convincing arguments</a> in the community against the ban on abortion.  Here is one of them: " <em>Only an idiot can call a 5-week embryo a baby</em> ."  Of course, I also have nothing against abortion.  In general, I support the complete and final resolution of everything and everyone, so that humanity can destroy itself and hamsters come to power.  And among this paradise I will be - smart and beautiful in a white coat. <br><br>  If you have few of my reviews and even after careful reading you are looking for interesting blogs, the results of <a href="http://ezhe.ru/POTOP/results.html%3Fdo%3Dres%3B2007">ROTOR</a> will help you.  The EZHE Union, which unites more than 500 Internet workers, has been delivering ROTOR Awards since 1999.  This year, in the first round, held from March 19 to March 23, the jury nominated the participants of the competition, as well as determined the finalists by categories.  In the final round, winners were selected from among the finalists and prizes were distributed.  The awards of the ‚ÄúROTOR-2007‚Äù competition were presented in more than 25 categories.  Among which, of course, was the "blog of the year", which went to the <a href="http://www.teatr-live.ru/">Theater Diaries</a> .  The remaining winners can be viewed at the link already provided. <br><br>  And now I will teach you what I do not know and have never known how to earn money.  And my little furry friends blogs help me in this as always.  To seed a <a href="http://seo-lynx.blogspot.com/2007/03/ii-metacafe.html">small income allowance</a> on video clips, in particular, with the help of the MetaCafe service.  Highlights are revealed: how to make an interesting video that is popular, what requirements are placed on your video, as well as some good examples.  Interestingly, the article is constantly updated with answers to critical comments on it.  And for dessert, I prepared for you ‚ÄúMarketing in a Small Town,‚Äù a blog that appeared in old reviews more than once and which I decided to remind you of again.  And I recall in connection with the article " <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/2007/04/blog-post_03.html">Monetizing Blogs</a> ."  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe article is not money in advertising systems like AdSence or Yandex.Direct, which can be placed on a blog, but in the audience of a blog.  Quote: " <em>Readers of blogs are no different from visitors to the store. We all have money, and in a month we all (or almost all) will not have this money - for we will spend it. For example, I read about a thousand people per day. If the average income is $ 500, then we get half a million bucks that my readers spend every month</em> . " <br><br>  There should have been a link to a very interesting post in a very interesting blog, but for some reason it is not here ... <br><br>  Despite the fact that all other blog reviews are wrong, I, nevertheless, give you links to them, but only so that you go on it, get upset and come back - to the true review.  So, " <a href="http://ain.com.ua/index.php%3Fitemid%3D4924">Blogger week with Dmitry Gubenko</a> ."  The results of the first month of the existence of the ‚ÄúBlogger Week‚Äù are shot down.  Actually, the review is Ukrainian, moreover, it comes out in the form of a radio program (but no one will force you to listen to this program through the link ‚Äî the adapted text lies there), and with an obvious political bias.  But my business is small - to offer you interesting reading matter, and you really need it or not, it's up to someone else to decide. <br><br>  Yandex acquired <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">MoiKrug.ru</a> , one of the largest social networks.  Purchase cost, according to various estimates, 1-5 million dollars.  For me personally, it follows from this that Yandex is in full swing creating its own blog service.  Given the large client base of Yandex, which has long been rumored in the market that they want to launch their blog project, and the availability of their own Yandex.Money payment system, there is no doubt that they have good chances to take the leading position in the Web 2.0 sector .  It is possible that in time they will compete with LiveJournal.  The head of the SUP Fabrik blog service, Anton Nosik (in one of the reviews was a mini-interview with him), on the contrary, hopes to cooperate with Yandex, not considering it to be a competitor.  Finam analyst Vladislav Kochetkov notes that now MoiKrug.ru is losing in attendance to other social networks, such as Odnoklassniki.ru, but its ‚Äúinteresting business model can be updated due to traffic from Yandex.‚Äù  Yandex bought not only the business, but also one of the best development teams in Russia.  Obviously, the company offered the service owners a good premium, which is associated with a shortage of assets in the market, as well as with the desire of Yandex to strengthen its social network component - one of the most promising areas of development, ‚Äùadds the analyst.  Well, we will closely monitor the development of events, because YandexBlogs are very interesting. <br><br>  " <a href="http://www.aliveinbaghdad.org/">Alive in Baghdad</a> " won the top prize in the "Best Video Blog" nomination for the <a href="http://vloggies.pbwiki.com/">Vloggies</a> award.  Hall applauded standing.  Commentators call this work a model of new journalism.  Taken together, the content of the blog, its triumphant success in the United States, the award of the prize of professionals, which is not yet related to big money, the true initiative of the resource (live on voluntary contributions from the audience) makes an impression.  Especially against the backdrop of our blogosphere, with its spitting on accuracy as the most sought-after genre. <br><br>  By the way, they say, in the 20s of the last century, racial laws of the Nurenberg type acted in the United States.  In particular, the applicant for entry into the United States had to prove his Aryan origin in how many generations there.  This I am so gently preparing you for the next link - " <a href="http://i-grappa.livejournal.com/336125.html">Interesting with the swastika -2</a> ".  I, as well as the author, in no case do not incite or propagandize.  My grandfather earned paralysis, sitting in Belarusian swamps surrounded.  These are just interesting photos that will show you the story a bit from the other side.  I was especially touched by children's costumes for Halloween in swastikas.  I remember that recently Prince Harry had already received a year and a half ago for coming to a party on the occasion of Halloween in an SS suit. <br><br>  And my grandmother told me about her childhood, and I could not believe that such a thing could be somewhere on the planet.  The following <a href="http://skella.livejournal.com/50806.html">story</a> 's grandmother also told him about her childhood: ‚Äú <em>You run into the frost, you wrap yourself with heavy logs, you sweat all over, your feet in valenoks sweat, your footcloths get wet, and then you freeze. you don‚Äôt feel at all. Tears flow - it seems that you cut off your legs. You walk up to a tree, knock it on you a couple of times with a felt boot, and you don‚Äôt feel anything. Just knock it like a tree hit a tree. Everyone will press and warm themselves to it.</em>  <em>la boots warmed, because they were not removed ... to foot wraps and skin froze. Then, when otogreyutsya boots, take them off. The wet cloth is unwound from foot, and the skin with a cloth behind ...</em> ". <br><br>  For my favorite people, and these are only those who have chosen WordPress as a platform for their blog, a wonderful article " <a href="http://log-it.ru/2007/04/03/40">Video Blog</a> ".  How to embed a video in a blog?  It would seem that everything is simple - I copied the finished piece of code from the site, pasted it into the post editing window, saved it and you can enjoy it.  Yes, everything works well.  Until you want to edit this post.  As a rescue, the author offers the Embedded Video with Link plugin. <br><br>  And the last article in this review will help young writers and literary agents.  The author‚Äôs conclusion is simple: ‚Äú <em>EVERYTHING is published now. You can find any author. Go to the shops where you work under the order and copy your price lists. With an adequate level of patience, you will eventually find it</em> .‚Äù  It is noteworthy that the article deals with demand, interest in the Russian (count, and in the Belarusian) book market absolutely to all genres of modern literature.  For example: ‚ÄúChildren's literature up to 11-12 years old is a very demanded section, because parents want to see their children read.  Children themselves are very rarely asked to buy something, rather the opposite.  They buy, again, what they themselves read in childhood.  But some are rather apathetic and take only what is available.  We try to always be a classic. ‚Äù  In general, a very <a href="http://logicz.livejournal.com/36331.html">informative article</a> . <br><br>  <b><strong>Leshikus Haletskyavicius</strong></b> <b><br><br></b>  <b><a href="http://kv.by/index2007140602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ14, 2007)</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287760/</a></p>
