External research is one of the key components of Microsoft Research, which includes close cooperation with the academic and scientific environment to solve the most complex global scientific and social problems.  The range of tasks is varied: health and welfare, education, computer science and environmental science.  In the past, Dr. Green was engaged in research in modeling molecules and equations of state of fluid mixtures - in his work for a bachelor's degree in physical chemistry (1989, Sheffield), and PhD thesis on molecular simulation of fluid mixtures (1992, Sheffield).  Then he was engaged in the simulation of the packing of polymers and proteins (1993-4).  His research required the transfer of software applications and optimization for highly parallel and distributed computing in a number of areas, including computational chemistry (molecular dynamics and applications for quantum mechanics), radiography, hydrodynamics, and fundamental engineering.  Dr. Green then focused on high-performance computing and was responsible for Europe‚Äôs largest parallel computing programs for the European Commission, the main suppliers of high-performance computing in the United Kingdom for research and military organizations.  Then Dr. Green moved to SGI / Cray - where he helped found the European branch of professional service, on the basis of which he organized a small team for Selectica Inc.  Selectica specialized in online configuration technologies and logical systems provided as a web service.  Due to experience in high-performance and distributed computing, as well as web services, IBM invited Dr. Green to develop the initial strategy of GRID computing in Europe, Central Asia and Africa, which soon became global.  Dr. Green moved to the USA where he worked on the IBM EBO.  Dr. Green moved to Microsoft Research from BT, where he was responsible for the proposals for all sectors in the global services system.  He also worked on strategic activities and business development activities in a variety of business areas, including healthcare, security, working with the public sector, energy, and environmental sustainability.  Within the latter direction, he founded BT program, which is responsible for business proposals to commercial customers, allowing them to reduce environmental pollution by carbon and develop business practices that focus on environmental protection, and take into account the impact on the economy and society. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217141/</a></p>
