      I want to share with the Habra community the experience of obtaining a universal e-card (UEC), or rather, the misadventures that I had to try to achieve this goal. <br><br>  The post has a narration format, so if you want specific instructions and results, then I ask at the end of the post.  For a start, a little copy-paste from the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/what-is-uec-citizens-general">official website of the UEC</a> and from the <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/ecard/about_UEK/">website of the Moscow government</a> about what UEC is and why it is needed. <br><br><h5>  What is the UEC and what it eat </h5><br>  <b>What it is?</b> <br>  A universal electronic card is a card that contains information about a user in a visual and electronic form that provides access to this information to confirm the user's rights to receive state, municipal and other services.  In cases provided for by federal laws, a universal electronic card can be a document proving the identity of a citizen. <br>  UEC will replace the social map of Muscovite.  The main difference is that the universal card is issued to all citizens, and it will be possible to use it in any region of Russia.  During the transition period, the Muscovite‚Äôs social card services will be provided in the same amount. <br><br>  Continued - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>For what?</b> <br>  With the help of a universal electronic card, you can receive and pay for state, municipal and commercial services in electronic form at any place convenient for you and at any time without queues.  A universal electronic card can be used when personally contacting government and other organizations to speed up service to citizens. <br><br>  <b>What does it include?</b> <br>  The universal electronic card combines the functions of mandatory medical and state pension insurance policies, travel documents for transport, and a bank card. <br>  It is designed to simplify bureaucratic procedures, improve the quality of public services and raise citizens' awareness of their rights. <br>  For children there is a preferential fare for public transport, subsidies for food in children's educational institutions and a number of other services that can be obtained with the help of UEC. <br><br>  <b>What gives?</b> <br>  <u>In state structures</u> <br>  You can use a universal electronic card for submitting applications, registering documents, obtaining references, statements in state and municipal structures.  The need to collect additional references and documents will disappear.  Many services can be obtained remotely.  Using the banking application, you can use the UEC to pay for services, taxes, government fees and make other necessary payments. <br><br>  <u>In transport</u> <br>  Universal electronic card - a universal ticket for all types of transport.  Rights to free or reduced fare will be confirmed by a card. <br><br>  <u>Payment for commercial services</u> <br>  Using a universal electronic card, you can pay for commercial services (including utility bills, tickets, communications, in-store purchases) as with a regular bank card. <br><br>  <u>Online payment *</u> <br>  It can be used on the Internet, ATM, bank payment terminal, public transport to pay for travel, in fast-service networks, in state, municipal and commercial access control systems, as well as in a regular store to pay for purchases <br><br>  <u>In the clinic</u> <br>  In order to avoid the queue at the registry, it is possible to make an appointment with a doctor through an infomat located in a medical institution.  The possibility of remote recording to a doctor through self-service terminals (ATMs, info kiosks, infomats) is planned throughout Moscow. <br><br>  <u>At school</u> <br>  The main purpose of using a universal electronic card in the field of education is to ensure the safety of students, the elimination of cash payments on school grounds, the organization of payment of preferential food on the fact of using the card, informing parents about attendance and progress of students. <br>  Universal electronic card can be used as a pass to the school.  In this case, parents will be able to control the time of arrival of the child to school and the time of the end of classes. <br>  With the help of UEC, free and preferential meals will be provided, it will be possible to pay for the child‚Äôs meals at school and to check whether the child received it. <br><br>  <i>* in the presence of the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/what-is-uec-citizens-general/readers">reader</a> (card reader).</i>  <i>As I understand it, it is purchased separately and while it is not in free circulation.</i> <br><br><h5>  And now the experience gained <s>by the</s> empirical method, and no theory and rose-colored glasses. </h5><br>  It all started with a random visit to the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/">official website of the</a> UEC in 2012, somewhere in the summer.  I was eager to get this card, the benefit of using the <a href="http://pgu.mos.ru/">public services portal</a> was quite positive, so I immediately went to the search engine to learn more about this innovation.  As a result, it turned out that the issuance of the UEC is regulated <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2010/07/30/gosusl-dok.html">by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation of July 27, 2010 N 210-FZ</a> , article 25 of which reads as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  1. Unless otherwise established by a resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation or a law of a constituent entity of the Russian Federation specified in Parts 2 and 3 of Article 26 of this Federal Law, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013 inclusive universal electronic cards are issued to citizens on the basis of applications for issuance of universal e-card. </blockquote><br><br>  Formally, everything is correct, and I can come to a branch, for example, Sberbank, and write an application for obtaining UEC.  However, it was not so easy.  And it was not the fault of the state, as is customary and pleasant to assume, but on my own ‚Äî after arriving at the local branch of Sberbank, the employee said that the UEC will be issued on a written statement from January 1 to December 31, 2013.  After such a small incident, I come home and open the search engine again.  It turns out that the aforementioned Federal Law (Federal Law) was amended, which is regulated <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2011/12/06/izm-dok.html">by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation dated December 3, 2011 N 383-, Moscow</a> , which states that: <br><br><blockquote>  16) Part 1 of Article 25 shall be amended as follows: <br>  "one.  Universal e-cards are issued to citizens on the basis of applications for issuing a universal e-card from January 1 to December 31, 2013, inclusive, unless an earlier period is established by the law of the constituent entity of the Russian Federation and (or) regulatory legal acts of the highest executive body of the state authority adopted in accordance with it subject of the Russian Federation. " </blockquote><br><br>  Thus, for several months I forgot about this idea.  However, on the night of December 31, 2012, on January 1, 2013, I firmly decided that on January 1, I would go to apply.  No sooner said than done.  I went to the official website of the UEC and looked at the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/get-uec">list of places</a> where you can get the UEC, the closest to me was a branch of Sberbank at Art.  The airport (Moscow), namely, Leningradskoye Shosse, 58. On arrival there closed doors waited for me, or rather, the doors were open to enter a room with ATMs, but the bank itself was apparently on a holiday break.  And again I had to forget about getting UEC for 8 days, and on January 9, on the first working day, I went again to the same address to get UEC.  Before that, however, I looked at what documents are needed for registration of the UEC; they turned out to be a <a href="">passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation</a> and <a href="">SNILS</a> (insurance number of an individual account).  Upon arrival at the place, I approached the first Sberbank employee that came across to me and asked about UEC.  I was asked to sit down and wait.  After a couple of minutes, the girl came and said that their department (and most likely all the others) would register the UEC from the 1st, or from the 4th of February, 2013.  Therefore, you can leave an application for obtaining UEC from them and wait almost a month.  And this is without taking into account the time of making the card!  I did not arrange such a deal of affairs, despite the fact that in the Federal Law, or rather in the amendments to it, it was said that from January 1, it will be possible to receive the UEC, and for me it became news that the Federal Law does not work on holidays.  Of course, I exaggerate a lot, the Federal Law always and everywhere works in theory, but in fact, on January 1, neither the department near my house, nor the department indicated on the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/">official website of the UEC</a> did not work.  I do not exclude the possibility that any one branch of Sberbank in Moscow worked, but I did not check this theory empirically.  In addition to Sberbank, they also accept applications in secondary schools, if you believe the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/get-uec">official site</a> , but as I said, go all over Moscow and check where it‚Äôs open and where it isn‚Äôt, there was no desire.  But there was a second option, which I read about below. <br><br>  I was offered, if I do not want to wait, to go to another branch of Sberbank, at <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CVFWYK8w">Greater Georgian, 37</a> (in the panoramas there hangs a building grid, but at the moment there is a working branch of Sberbank) - it is relatively close - art.  m. Belarusian.  Naturally, I was not going to stop halfway, so I drove to the address indicated.  As soon as I got to the branch of Sberbank that was indicated to me, I went to the first employee I found and asked if they could arrange a UEC.  I was told that it is possible, for this you need to go to the window number 3.  I asked: "And the electronic line?".  After all, you need to take a ticket and wait for me to be called.  She said that this is not necessary.  I went to the window number 3, and waited for the girl to serve another client.  After 5 minutes of standing, she asked me, am I to her?  I said that yes, I am to her about the UEC.  She said sit down, she will call me.  After another 10 minutes, she was freed and, looking at me, began to serve another client.  I approached and asked how so?  She asked if I had a coupon?  I told her that I was told that he was not needed.  After that, she said she would call me again.  I already stood by and did not sit down anywhere, so as not to miss my turn.  In the end, when all her attention turned to me, she asked for a passport.  Not a word about SNILS, but he was in the passport, and then, as it turned out, when signing the papers, my SNILS number was indicated in one of the fields.  In addition, it was necessary to specify your phone, e-mail and code word.  Special problems have arisen with him - to come up with a normal word on the move is not so easy as it seems, therefore it is better to invent it in advance.  But first things first. <br><br>  After all the data was entered on the computer, an employee of Sberbank told me that I now need to take a picture. <br><br>  According to the same document, which is referred to as <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2010/07/30/gosusl-dok.html">Federal Law of the Russian Federation of July 27, 2010 N 210-FZ</a> , Article 22, paragraph 3, subparagraph 3 states that the UEC must contain a photo of the cardholder: <br><br><blockquote>  3. A universal electronic card must contain the following visual (unprotected) information: <br>  1) last name, first name and (if any) patronymic of the user with a universal electronic card; <br>  2) a photograph of the applicant (in the case of issuing a universal electronic card at the request of a citizen in the manner prescribed by Article 25 of this Federal Law); <br>  <b>3) the number of the universal electronic card and its validity period;</b> <br>  4) contact information of the authorized organization of the subject of the Russian Federation; <br>  5) the insurance number of the individual personal account of the insured person in the mandatory pension insurance system of the Russian Federation. </blockquote><br><br>  On the official website, in the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/q-a-citizens%3Fview%3Dcategory%26layout%3Dcategorylist%26task%3Dlists%26catid%3D4">"Questions and Answers" section</a> about photography, it was also said, namely: <br><br><blockquote>  When you apply for a universal electronic card directly at the point of receiving applications, citizens are photographed, received the original signature using an electronic pen and entered personal data in electronic form. </blockquote><br><br>  The employee asked to go after him to take a photo.  I already imagined a booth, as in the Ministry of Internal Affairs / FMS / FMS, when you receive a passport, but everything turned out differently.  We walked over to the plain wall, the employee took out an iPhone (I did not understand 4 or 4S, because the device was in the case) and took a picture of me.  The explanation was quite logical: "We have no equipment, we have nothing at all."  I did not really protest, but in vain.  We had to leave, because  subsequent events markedly reduced my self-esteem.  After the act of photographing, I again went to window No. 3 and waited for about 3-5 minutes until the iPhone finally decided on the computer to transfer the photo.  Unsuccessful attempts to insert and remove the cable did not lead to success.  In the end, still managed to transfer the photo to the PC.  The paper went to print, they gave it to me for a signature, it contained information from the passport and the number of SNILS, but besides that, there was a photo.  Black and white  In the upper right corner.  The photo was mine, but my eyes were skewed than that of a hare, my forehead was like an airfield, my head was bald, my nose was like a 10-bee bite - healthy and swollen, and my expression said that I regularly smell glue and I have mental disorder.  And not one.  And this is not 25 yet!  I could not resist, and laughed.  With tears.  After I left, I still signed the papers, since the data was correct and they gave me a paper with a request number, according to which I can track the readiness of the UEC and the expected date of readiness of it - 09.02.2013, according to the paper.  By the way, I submitted the application on 01/09/2013.  The <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/q-a-citizens%3Fview%3Dcategory%26layout%3Dcategorylist%26task%3Dlists%26catid%3D4">Q &amp; A</a> on the official website states that: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe time limit for issuing a card since writing an application for receipt is 30 days.  In reality, it only takes a few days. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Let's look at how it will look in reality.  Tracking, by the way, goes through the <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/">website of the Moscow government</a> and when filling in the fields ‚Äúapplication series‚Äù and ‚Äúapplication number‚Äù, the message ‚Äúaccepted for processing‚Äù is displayed. <br><br>  Now, ostensibly with peace of mind, I was on my way to home, but at the same time leafing through the official website of the UEC, in the same ‚ÄúQuestions and Answers‚Äù ‚Äã‚ÄãI came across interesting information: <br><br><blockquote>  Question: "What is the procedure for receiving and processing applications for a universal electronic card?" <br><br>  Answer: ‚ÄúWhen you apply for a universal electronic card, you can take photographs of citizens, receive the original signature using an electronic pen and enter personal data in electronic form directly at the application reception center.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  I was terribly interested in what they would think of instead of an electronic pen?  One of the options is to ask to sign on an empty sheet of paper, scan it and thus receive my electronic signature. <br><br>  At the same time, I also found <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/faq/%3FSECTION_ID%3D154">another</a> , not less than the official website of the UEC, which is controlled by the Moscow government, where it is said that you can apply for UEC via the Internet, but when you click on the link, the message is displayed: ‚ÄúThe personal account will open with the start of the application campaign ". <br><br><h5>  The practical result of how to get UEC </h5><br>  In order to get the UEC, you need to have with you: <br>  1) <a href="">Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation</a> <br>  2) <a href="">SNILS (insurance number of an individual personal account)</a> <br>  3) Come up with a code word in advance (you can use Russian), as well as remember your e-mail and phone number (you can be mobile). <br>  4) If you live in Moscow, then drive up to the branch of Sberbank at the address <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CVFWYK8w">Greater Georgian, 37</a> and apply for UEC.  In this case, if you believe the official site, then you can apply in other places, namely: <br><br>  a) To issue a universal electronic card for newborns - parents or legal representatives, you must contact the district registry office.  Address to find the point of receipt of applications for receipt of UEC.  <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/ecard/items_for_receipt_of_applications/">Search for places of application for UEC on the website of the Government of Moscow</a> <br>  b) Privileged categories of citizens (pensioners, disabled people, persons receiving social support, etc.) - to the district department of social protection of the population.  Address to find the point of receipt of applications for receipt of UEC.  <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/ecard/items_for_receipt_of_applications/">Search for places of application for UEC on the website of the Government of Moscow</a> .  You need to choose the category of citizens "beneficiaries" <br>  c) Students of educational institutions (parents of students) should contact their educational institution.  Address to find the point of receipt of applications for receipt of UEC.  <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/ecard/items_for_receipt_of_applications/">Search for places of application for UEC on the website of the Government of Moscow</a> .  It is necessary to choose the category of citizens "students" <br>  5) If you do not live in Moscow, then you can find the organization nearest you that is authorized to receive applications for receiving the UEC on the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/get-uec">official website of the UEC</a> .  However, having real experience using this list, it is better to go to the nearest branch of Sberbank and ask where you can apply for UEC. <br>  6) If you believe the official site, then you can apply for a UEC in the RUSZN (District Social Security Administration), the district administration, the MFC (multi-functional center), one window, kindergarten, school, university, registry office, bank branches.  <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/ecard/ways_of_applying/">Source of</a> <br><br>  Optional: <br>  1) USB flash drive with photo in .jpg <br>  2) In the event that an employee refuses to insert your USB flash drive into a work computer (and by the way, he will correctly do it), then you can suggest an iPhone with your photo saved on it. <br><br>  I had the idea to submit an application electronically, but so far there is no such function, according to the <a href="http://uec.mos.ru/uek/faq/%3FSECTION_ID%3D153">UEC website of the Moscow government</a> <br><br><blockquote>  Question: Where can I download the sample application form? <br><br>  Answer: The universal electronic card will be issued in a declarative manner from January 2013.  At this point, all forms of application forms will be available on our website and official websites of the subjects of the Russian Federation. </blockquote><br><br>  Getting a card for free, in addition, you can get a card by a written application from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  From 2014, the card will be issued for all, except for those people who have previously sent a refusal to receive the UEC.  To use the card you will need to enter a PIN.  Also in the card will be a banking module that allows you to pay for services.  At the moment, only 3 banks have joined this program, according to <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/for-sitizens/citizens-links">this</a> list of banks.  However, according to unconfirmed information, this list also includes Sberbank, Uralsib, AkBars, Center-invest, Bank St. Petersburg, Avtovazbank, Moscow Industrial Bank, Surgutneftegazbank, Northern Credit.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/55241/">Proof</a> <br><br>  I see this as a plus - if there is a multitude of banks participating in the UEC program, it will be possible to deposit and withdraw money from a card without%.  And now, if banks do not have partnership agreements, then withdrawing cash from a card issued by another bank is subject to%. <br>  Now I am waiting for the date when I will be notified that the card is ready. <br><br>  In addition, on <a href="http://www.sbrf.ru/moscow/ru/person/bank_cards/uek/">the UEC Sberbank page</a> there are tariffs for card servicing (there are almost 0 rubles everywhere, except for a couple of banking points), as well as its description of its capabilities within the bank, such as card currency, expiration date, tariffs, and The most interesting item is advanced card operations.  I don‚Äôt want to copy-paste - everything is written in a simple and understandable language.  By the way, there are addresses of departments in which it is possible to establish UEC.  For Moscow, this is only one branch of Sberbank - just the one on Bolshaya Gruzinskaya. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that if we abandon conspiracy theories, ‚Äúnumbering people with satanic numbers,‚Äù as was the case with the TIN and other ideas not supported by facts, then it‚Äôs a very ambiguous decision for me to enter the card for <a href="http://ria.ru/economy/20120922/756385398.html">5 years</a> , and besides, I personally I don‚Äôt really need it - I have a debit card that works all over the world, there is a public services portal through which I can pay fines and make an appointment with a doctor or pay for gas and electricity.  Another thing is that if the introduction of the UEC simplifies these procedures, because the words of sconce (o) uzer and the Internet still inspire fear in the older generation, and the relatively more familiar ATM can be one of the solutions for reducing queues when paying for utility services or getting singing. <br><br>  Along the way, digging into the tags on the Habr√©, I found interesting articles about UEC, especially <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/133602/">this</a> article is full of technical information, in particular, it is interesting that the filling will be from Mastercard. <br><br>  As well as other articles describing the UEC: <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164461/">From January 1, 2013, Universal Electronic Cards will be issued.</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/133874/">Electronic cards for citizens of the Russian Federation</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/119258/">About the national payment system</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/111792/">The appearance of the Universal Electronic Card is revealed</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162095/">Answers Minister of Communications to the questions of users: part 1</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/55241/">Personal experience of obtaining a universal identification card</a> <br><br>  UPD: Just a few hours ago, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, dated January 11, 2013, fell into the hands, where on the <a href="">first page</a> there is another list of addresses in Moscow where you can apply for a UEC.  I apologize for the quality - I scanned an old scanner from paper. <br><br>  UPD2: Simultaneously with the execution of the application for issuing a universal electronic card, a citizen prepares an application for opening an account in a selected bank - issuer of an electronic banking application of a universal electronic card (from among banks that have entered into an agreement with a federal authorized organization). <br><br>  UPD3: Another interesting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165511/">post</a> . <br><br>  UPD4: <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/images/doc/reiting-29122012.pdf">Rating of the implementation of the map implementation plan by the subjects of the Russian Federation as of December 29, 2012.</a> <br><br>  UPD5: <a href="http://news.mail.ru/economics/10336287/">Interview</a> with the President of the UEC ‚ÄúUEC‚Äù, where the question of why there is no integration with such systems as Visa / MasterCard was also discussed. <br><br>  There is also simply a monitoring of the readiness of regions for the introduction of the UEC. <br><br>  UPD6: According to unconfirmed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165511/">information</a> , in St. Petersburg, in addition to the SNILS and the passport of the citizen of the Russian Federation, in order to receive the UEC, you must also present a policy of compulsory medical insurance (OMS). <br><br>  UPD7: UEC service <a href="http://www.sbrf.ru/moscow/ru/person/bank_cards/uek/">tariffs</a> in Sberbank. <br><br>  UPD8: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165511/">More</a> information about the UEC. <br><br>  UPD9: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175741/">Part 2.
