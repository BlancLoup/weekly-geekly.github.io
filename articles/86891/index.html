In general, I have had a lot of mobile devices in my life, so to speak, a lot: <br><ul><li>  <b>Java ME</b> - Samsung SGH i600, Samsung SGH C100 (last century), </li><li>  <b>Palm OS</b> - Sony TJ37, </li><li>  <b>Windows Mobile</b> - HP iPAQ HW 6515, iMate SP5 (one of the best phones of all time), Fujitsu-Siemens Pocket Loox c550 (one of the best communicators of all time), </li><li>  <b>Symbian</b> - Nokia E51 (but I didn‚Äôt immediately like the <b>symbian</b> ). </li></ul><br>  Maybe I missed something, but this is rather because these missed gadgets are not even worth mentioning. <br><br>  And finally the <b>iPhone</b> .  Generally on the day when the presentation of the device was held, I swore to watch this presentation.  Because I was afraid that the iphone will become my obsession.  I knew it would be a big deal.  But a year later, I still looked at the presentation and bought the phone.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>And it went ...</b> </h4><br><br>  Breaking, firmware and other trouble.  <b>Frankly, the phone was terribly uncomfortable!</b>  I am not an Installer, no Cydia were ever needed.  And I have not installed broken programs for a long time.  If in my country (Azerbaijan) the iPhone was officially sold, I would be the first to buy it.  And I would not dance with a tambourine.  But alas ... <br><br>  The app store was still half empty.  I read news about the fact that people write idiotic programs and get richer for them like Russian oligarchs.  In short, I fired up to write at first an idiotic program (to look around and to try the pen) and then super-duper cool program for iphone and fabulously rich. <br><br><h4>  <b>Attempt number races</b> </h4><br>  <b>Apple has the best documentation and tools for programmers from all that I have encountered so far</b> .  Strangely enough, Objective C language and Cocoa framework, in spite of its verbosity and not C ++ - figurative view, I really liked.  And the lion's share of this sympathy came at the opportunity to send sobscheniya all indiscriminately objects.  It is also important that I still have not met a single function that would not work or did not work correctly or was not exhaustively described in the documentation.  <b>The same C # and its Dot.Net, for all its popularity, has dofig flaws and badly described</b> . <br><br>  So, I decided to start with <b>iCouple</b> . <br>  The idea is very simple: <br><ol><li>  We take an old algorithm of sovok times about the prediction of the happy / unhappy life of two persons, in the case of their marriage </li><li>  We make out the algorithm for iPhone </li><li>  We decorate with drawings </li><li>  And that's it! </li></ol><br><br>  Here's what happened: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f84/ae9/80d/f84ae980dfe586448cc986cbc28c2158.jpg"><br>  You can <a href="http://itopchiyev.com/products/icouple/">read</a> here <a href="http://itopchiyev.com/products/icouple/">http://itopchiyev.com/products/icouple/</a> <br><br>  <b>No, I did not get rich!</b>  <b>And yes, the experience was good!</b> <br>  What did I understand from this experience? <br><br>  Here's what: <br><ol><li>  Price must be chosen carefully </li><li>  You need to write something that he himself would be happy to buy </li><li>  If the program has not taken a good start, then it will never take it. </li></ol><br>  The program was sold at a price of 0.99 thalers. <br>  Subsequently, I made it free.  And then she became just packs snatching.  It can be seen people love freebies (also a lesson that I ever use).  Downloaded and downloaded mainly from <b>France and Russia</b> .  I don‚Äôt know why some cool French resource from France can write a cool revs ?!  But I understand about why from Russia.  I think because I just got to the point when in Russia they just started selling iPhones and iCouple was one of the rare prog localized in Russian. <br><br><h4>  Attempt dvass number </h4><br>  After a short rest, I proceeded to <b>Net Reversi</b> . <br>  This is Reversi with the version for iPhone, and still not the finished version for Mac. <br>  It has the ability to connect to a network game on a local network on two iPhones, on an iPhone and Mac, etc. <br><br>  Here is: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c46/abc/947/c46abc94795b4934ce49bc5c14b9bfd1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8dd/979/68b/8dd97968bf0a694029a87d66d2602545.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2de/f9c/c0c/2def9cc0ceec523689df29bd1fc678bd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c39/8a6/ec5/c398a6ec5591dfd3ca9cd0b363f31dcb.jpg"><br>  You can read here: <a href="http://itopchiyev.com/products/netreversi/">http://itopchiyev.com/products/netreversi/</a> <br><br>  <b>But alas, this attempt was unsuccessful!</b>  Yeah, I put my soul in, spent a lot of time! <br>  And here you are!  A couple of mistakes brought down the whole project. <br><br>  <b>Errors:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Look BEFORE</b> you start anything!  These reversi was in AppStore even a dime a dozen.  Our post-Soviet too.  And I did not know. </li><li>  Without marketing, you can‚Äôt catch fish from the pond either!  I realized that writing a program is not enough.  It is necessary to issue it.  Tell people about her. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  <b>Attempt number 3</b> </h4><br><br>  <b>SQLite Editor</b> is a program for working with databases.  I tried to make it convenient and necessary for programmers and administrators.  I did not concentrate on lamers.  And this application is not for maintaining a list of any crap like Tu Du or Tu Bai, etc. <br><br>  Here is a look: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f3/400/d96/7f3400d965d19237b712e22afb3c1da3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d88/35d/06c/d8835d06c6c48e3d6040ee621ca0a72d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/913/5b2/e17/9135b2e175af8def68da7bcea4b0754d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4db/624/df8/4db624df899c9958d070d100b374dffe.jpg"><br><br>  Read here: <a href="http://itopchiyev.com/products/sqliteeditor/">http://itopchiyev.com/products/sqliteeditor/</a> <br><br>  Here this attempt paid off the forces spent for it.  She continues to make a profit.  And her price is professional $ 14.99. <br>  And I feel good and buyers. <br><br>  <b>But still she just paid for herself, nothing more.</b> <br><br><h4>  <b>And finally the ATTEMPT NUMBER FOUR</b> </h4><br><br>  No, of course I didn‚Äôt stop at this! <br>  I liked one toy called <b>Smule Ocarina</b> .  Well, on it you can play different melodies with different combinations of clicks.  It seems like a virtual Ocarina (this is a rounded ceramic flute). <br>  And I wrote a small program for Mac, in which you can collect notes, and then looking at these notes on the screen or on the printout, play them. <br>  <b>Again, people love free stuff.</b>  <b>She began to download en masse.</b> <br><br>  Then the idea came to write a rethought game using both, someone else's and your own ideas. <br>  <b>I spent about half a year.</b> <br>  Posted by: <br><ol><li>  <b>The full version for iPhone</b> with all 27 instruments (I will increase the number of instruments in the future) and the trainer and editor of notes and the ability to download notes to and from the web server. </li><li>  And <b>4 (FOUR) free</b> , each with its own tool.  They can only play. </li><li>  <b>One free for Mac</b> with an editor, all the tools and the ability to download notes to and from the server, but of course you will not play it. </li><li>  As well as a full-fledged <b>web portal</b> .  Allows you to write notes directly in the browser, listen to them, download from files, download, plus all the gadgets of WordPress. </li></ol><br><br>  I have not published these applications yet.  All is not amused.  I will correct it there, then I will finish it. <br>  Honestly, I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll forget something to undertake, and I‚Äôm <b>looking forward to</b> all my half-year spent on this project.  A lot of ideas.  Every time I force myself to leave them all for later.  Very much delayed the project. <br><br>  <b>Specially and exclusively for Habrahabr's readers I</b> publish screenshots and other info about the project: <br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/8.jpg"><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/7.jpg"><br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/6.jpg"><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5.jpg"><br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/4.jpg"><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/3.jpg"><br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2.jpg"><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/1.jpg"><br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/final.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2.png"><br><br>  Here video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7Wlqm99SuTM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wlqm99SuTM</a> <br><br>  Here is a link to the site: <a href="http://fingerstune.com/">http://fingerstune.com</a> <br>  And here dofiga info: <a href="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/%3Fpage_id%3D2">About</a> , <a href="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/%3Fpage_id%3D48">FAQ</a> , <a href="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/%3Fpage_id%3D398">iPhone version Help</a> , <a href="http://fingerstune.itopchiyev.com/%3Fpage_id%3D392">Mac version Help</a> . <br><br>  In general, this is not all that I wanted to say. <br>  ;) <br><br>  <b>I also wanted to offer this</b> : If you (the reader) have an interest in this project and he knows English (this is so that Pindos can explain to the stupid that this is not a rapidsher mirror and MP3 is not heard here), I would be glad to find an assistant and offer you post the moderator on the site and a free full version of FingersTune in addition.  Contact here <a href="http://forum.itopchiyev.com/forum.php%3Fid%3D10">http://forum.itopchiyev.com/forum.php?id=10</a> <br><br>  By the way, since all versions of the program have not yet been published, I suggest going to this page to check the status of applications and links for downloading / buying them. <br><br>  PS <br>  If this attempt is not <b>successful</b> , then this will be my last attempt. <br><br>  Pps <br>  I think in this text dofiga errors.  But I hope you do not kick me for it. <br><br>  PPPS <br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  UPD. <br>  Video updated </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86891/</a></p>
