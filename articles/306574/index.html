It turned out that the psychological effects of behavioral targeting are much stronger than we thought.  We have translated a <a href="http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/marketing/the-psychology-of-behavioral-targeting-goes-deeper-than-youd-think/">ContentStandard</a> article about this study for you. <br><br>  In short: The user is better at advertising, if he understands why you are showing it to him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main conclusion of the study: the psychological effect of tragedy advertising depends on whether the user is aware that the ad was chosen for him.  Show the reader an advertisement for some expensive, sophisticated product.  If he knows that this advertisement has been chosen taking into account his personal characteristics, he will feel more refined in kind.  Subsequently, the user will be more interested in the brand.

      A new understanding of the psychology of behavioral targeting will be useful for marketers.  Companies will be able to achieve user loyalty, helping them to feel better. <br><br><h1>  Increase customer self-esteem </h1><br>  Ohio State University conducted several experiments to find out how users respond to advertising.  For the first experiment, the researchers selected people who knew about the use of behavioral targeting.  A group of people who believed that advertising is formed on the basis of their internet history, became interested in discounts on visiting the "refined" restaurant.  Another group of participants thought that advertisements were not chosen for them personally, but depending on age and gender, and did not show interest in the service. <br><br>  The second experiment confirmed the first.  Its participants were shown advertising expensive watches.  However, some were told that this ad was targeted directly at them.  At the end of the experiment, these participants rated themselves as more sophisticated people compared to those who were not informed about the use of advertising targeting.  ‚ÄúThe ad let them know that their search history speaks of their exquisite tastes,‚Äù the researchers write in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/targeted-ads-dont-just-make-you-more-likely-to-buy-they-can-change-how-you-think-about-yourself">Harvard Business Review</a> .  They accepted this information and considered themselves more sophisticated consumers, and this shift in their perception of themselves increased their interest in the product. ‚Äù <br><br>  Another experiment showed that the psychological effect of advertising persists.  After reviewing advertising for environmentally friendly products, participants identified themselves as ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and reported that they were more willing to purchase such products and make donations to protect the environment. <br><br>  Researchers make one significant caveat: targeting must be targeted.  Otherwise, the effect will not be.  For example, participants in the experiment advertised how great it is to have hot chocolate while enjoying the outdoors.  Those who love this type of leisure, paid him even more attention.  At the same time, the advertisement worked: these participants became interested in buying hot chocolate.  But those who did not show any interest in outdoor recreation experienced neither the desire to spend time or to buy the advertised product. <br><br>  All experiments were conducted in a "laboratory" environment.  Advertising was not really based on the behavior of the participants.  Participants were simply forced to believe it.  This means that in the real world, when an ad is based on a user's search history, and he understands that he is dealing with advertising targeting, the effect can be much stronger.  If the user does not understand that the advertisement targeted directly to him, the effect will disappear. <br><br><h1>  Change self-perception </h1><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtargeting to influence consumer behavior is not new.  But the ability to influence the feelings of customers opens up great opportunities for marketers. <br><br>  Most modern people, of course, are aware that the data on their behavior is used to help advertisers to effectively ‚Äúget‚Äù them.  <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2015/07/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B9-%25D1%258D%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2589/">The growing popularity of ad blockers</a> , among other things, is caused precisely by the concern of users over interference in their privacy. <br><br>  At the same time, personalized advertisements are effective.  <a href="http://www.adlucent.com/blog/2016/71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads">A recent survey</a> conducted by Adlucent showed that 71% of respondents prefer to see ads based on their interests and consumer habits.  It turned out that users are twice as likely to click on ads from unknown brands, if they were made according to their preferences. <br><br>  Brands need to understand that the performance indicators of advertising campaigns using targeting go beyond the CTR and conversion rate.  Advertising can change consumer self-perception.  Brands that work with strong personality traits - sophisticated, adventurous, funny, intelligent, etc.  - may benefit more from targeting. <br><br>  Look at the ads from the retailer of women's clothing MM.LaFleur.  The brand appeals to smart and professional women who want to look good without extra effort.  Women who see this ad, imagine that they have these characteristics on themselves and may be more inclined to buy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cee/f07/c65/ceef07c656bdd70abcff993f6ce91656.png" alt="women's clothing" width="483" height="614"><br><br>  The second conclusion from the research is paradoxical in its own way.  Giving consumers a clear understanding that an ad targeted specifically to them can be beneficial.  Only when users are aware that they are dealing with behavioral targeting, and changes in self-perception occur.  This means that brands have room for targeting maneuvers and can approach the process more creatively.  For example, a travel agency can create content with an advertising message like, ‚ÄúWe know you like adventures.  Show your wild side by visiting our agency. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  Comment Relap.io </h1><br>  This targeting case is, in fact, part of a big story about how important it is for the user to understand that the brand is interested in it.  Then customers attach more importance to advertising, they show mutual interest and involvement.  Hence, the trends in <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/04/kak-delat-nativnuju-reklamu-v-rossii/">native advertising</a> , <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/07/9-good-content/">content marketing</a> , spot targeting - all this gives brands the opportunity to humanize communication with the customer and through communication to win his loyalty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306574/</a></p>
