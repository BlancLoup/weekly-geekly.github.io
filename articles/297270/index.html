It is difficult, everything does not always go smoothly.  Let's just talk honestly.  Not only do you come across the stupid truth.  Or maybe she is not so ... stupid? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c9/466/e82/5c9466e82be8441a9676a0ce4f2d9c1a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>1. Your resume will not be read completely.</b> </h4><h6>  Remember the rule of 6 seconds?  There is even a game where everyone can feel like a recruiter. <br>  Viewing a resume really takes a very small amount of time.  Just because a good HR already has an eye for it, it highlights only the information that is really important.  Experience, achievements, professional skills.  And more often it is even in the key words: the positions held by the person, where the work is, what they own.  Still want your resume to consist of two pages? <br>  Therefore, we advise you to abandon all (all) not too important words: which are in your resume.  Yes, all sociable and responsible. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. A cover letter also will not deduct</b> </h4><h6>  The pace and rhythm of the working day of modern man no one needs to describe once again.  No matter how important and subtle moment the employment would seem to you - this is someone's work.  Nervous, with a bunch of cases and deadlines.  And this man received 100 letters that need to be raked.  And answer.  And also not to be mistaken with the right choice.  Of course, you just need a huge portfolio of professionalism in order to see the right candidate in the stream.  And you need to gain wisdom and write a cover letter that will show the recruiter that he needs you. <br>  It should be short and clear.  What I can, what I can give, why this particular company.  Of course, this should not affect how closely you approach to writing it, but just save your time and HR-manager time.  Read the letter out loud to yourself.  If something hurts the ear, then immediately throw it away. <br>  We advise you to abandon the lyrics.  And use our tips.  Here, for example, we have collected an entire letter from just 10 sentences, and here we talked about how to enjoy writing a cover letter.  And we gave examples of catchy letters. </h6>

    <h4>  <b>3. Errors are always visible.</b> </h4><h6>  If you think that quickly looking through the resume HR will not see jambs - you are greatly mistaken.  All shortcomings always come straight to the fore.  We tell you this because we have seen a lot of resumes.  And if you saw in it a flaw like a spelling error, then you immediately want to close it.  Everyone has the right to make mistakes.  But in the summary they are always visible, because this is you.  Send a friend once again, let him look. <br>  It‚Äôs not so silly to lose chances to get a job.  Check everything.  In the same <a href="https://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/orfograf/">spelling</a> , for example. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. You should be able to tell about yourself in two sentences.</b> </h4><h6>  No matter how beautiful and versatile person you are.  No, seriously, learn to highlight the main thing.  Learn to sell yourself.  There are some simple exercises that will help you. <br><br>  <b>// Hold your breath</b> <br>  You have to tell all about yourself the most important things for the time until the air runs out in the lungs.  It is 10-12 seconds.  Try it. <br><br>  <b>// Explain to the "eight" (seven and nine-year-olds will do too)</b> <br>  Yes, tell the child about prospects, ambitions, about who you are.  if he understands it is a success. <br><br>  <b>// Tell the story</b> <br>  Already many times talked about the strength storytelling.  Repeat.  Remember the story that characterizes you, which can make your image the way you want it to be.  Do not invent only. <br><br>  <b>// Intrigue</b> <br>  But do not overdo it.  This is straight 80 lvl job search and interviewing.  If you have little time, then you should be interested in a recruiter or HR, so that they want to hear more. <br><br>  <b>// Details</b> <br>  They are in everything.  In clothes, speech, history.  Let you be remembered as ‚Äúthat guy who somehow at work managed to sell the cow to a vegetarian‚Äù or ‚Äúa girl with a brooch in the form of a huge fly‚Äù (only without stuffed animals, aha!). <br></h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Do not hide your age</b> </h4><h6>  Girls, drop the excitement!  It just doesn't make sense anymore.  We do not live in the Middle Ages, information about you, your age will help to find social networks and simple mathematics. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>6. There are questions that you hate to answer.</b> </h4><br><h6>  And you do not have to do this.  Age is a separate story. <br>  So, you can not answer questions about children, religion, personal life, whether you smoke, drink alcohol, how much you weigh, what is your financial situation. <br>  Just be careful, do not close, but do not let not too polite people ask incorrect questions.  Everything is within reason. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>7. Your pages on social networks give out the whole truth about you (and sometimes it's funny)</b> </h4><h6>  Photos, music, subscriptions (!), Spiteful comments, black humor - HR will carefully study this more carefully than a polished resume.  When they receive your resume, 90% of HR managers look at all your social media profiles.  They even have special tools to find you there. <br>  So, if you decide to look for a job, then try to maintain your image, engage in order to create the right image on social networks.  This does not mean that you need to limit yourself in something and restrict serious photos to be put on your passport everywhere (yes, this is also funny).  Just know that the boundaries between personal and professional in the field of job search are pretty much erased. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>8. In the job search, there is little room for emotions (and time).</b> </h4><br><h6>  No, no one is heartless, everyone just has a lot of work and everyone wants to do it quickly and efficiently.  The modern candidate should feel this straight with his fingertips and try to adjust to the pace and rhythm of life.  You just have to be trendy in every sense.  And be prepared for the fact that everything will not go as easy as it seemed.  Especially when you just start looking for work, when there is no experience, when everything seems terrible.  No one wants to offend you.  HR really wants to find a suitable candidate so that he likes it too.  And at the interview, he too is overcome by thoughts about how to cook dinner or when to pick up a child from kindergarten.  And he may forget to answer the summary (although it is very unpleasant when you are on the other side of the barricades). </h6><br>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/ty-boishsya-i-ya-boyus-kak-zhit-so-strahom-pered-porazheniya/">You are afraid and I am afraid.</a>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/ty-boishsya-i-ya-boyus-kak-zhit-so-strahom-pered-porazheniya/">How to live with the fear of defeat?</a> <br><br>
<h6>  In general, few people warn young people today that it will not be easy.  The job search is also relevant, but it only means that you need to test your ability to adapt to the demands of the time.  Be brief.  Try to maximize your goals and objectives.  Be decisive.  And most importantly.  To be ready to work, work and look forward, even if things didn‚Äôt go so smoothly. <br></h6><br><br><h4>  <b>9. No perfect place to work.</b> </h4><h6>  Companies, team, responsibilities, lunch, vacation.  And this is also normal.  you can continue to look for him, but stop posing as the very white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland - you are not late, give yourself the opportunity to get work experience, communication, experience solving complex problems.  In general, do not put a cross on the first job, do not give up the profession, if something does not go right away. <br>  You will be surprised at what details can sometimes make you love the work with all your heart.  Maybe you will help people, or maybe you will make friends with colleagues, maybe you will have an excellent opportunity to develop, or maybe you will find another position in this workplace, which also seems interesting - it is always more interesting to look for than to find. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297270/</a></p>
