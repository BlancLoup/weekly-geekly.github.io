Nevertheless, over the long years of leadership, the Finnish manufacturer has created quite a few interesting devices that can be considered the ‚Äúicons‚Äù of the entire phone / smartphone sector.  There were successful solutions that were not very good, but all this contributed to the development of the smartphone / phone market.  <i>There are a lot of photos under the cut, so be careful if you have paid traffic.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

The fact is that the phone had an internal, not an external antenna.  It was a new word in the "telephone construction".  In addition, the device, despite its small size, was equipped with an infrared port, making it possible to exchange data. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 3310</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d26/cc9/a52/d26cc9a5258712987cb56eda623c961d.jpg"><br><br>  Probably, this is one of the most famous phones of the Finnish manufacturer.

Therefore, I propose to continue and add to the list in the comments. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4689034/nokia-iconic-mobile-phone-photo-essay">theverge</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192418/</a></p>
