      <b>Detection and localization of arbitrary text on images obtained using mobile phone cameras</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180609/">Rus</a> <br>  The main task in the application is the detection and localization of the text, and then its selection and binarization for ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù in OCR, for example tesseract.  And if the algorithms for detecting text in scanned documents have long been known and have reached 99% accuracy, then the detection of text of arbitrary size in photographs is still a current area of ‚Äã‚Äãresearch.  The more interesting the task will be, I thought, and undertook to study the algorithms. <br><br>  <b>Optimize keywords for apps on the App Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180853/">Rus</a> <br>  Today, many developers and most of the mobile application promoters talk about keyword optimization for the App Store.  I want to make clear once again that ASO in general (a long introductory article on the App Store Optimization can be read here) and the optimization of keywords in particular is not a panacea.  But this is an indispensable thing that you can master and do yourself, save a piece of the marketing budget and enjoy something like these figures in the statistics: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/640/57f/308/64057f3083af172a14e9baaca90d7493.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>New native Facebook share for iOS</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/nativnyiy-share-facebook-ios.html">Rus</a> <br>  Facebook announced the availability of a new native share-dialog for iOS, which will give developers an easy way to embed Facebook sharing - including Open Graph actions - in their applications. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Google Play Developer Console: New Features - New Issues</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180701/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/234/acc/802/234acc80215a7a8c59704d3a6d140fc2.png" alt="image"><br>  I hope this experience will be useful and will save time for developers faced with this problem.  And in fact, this is even for the better - more developers will begin to think about bringing the look of applications to the style recommended by the platform. <br><br>  <b>TeamViewer QuickSupport for Android is now not only for Samsung</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180421/">Rus</a> <br>  The TeamViewer QuickSupport mobile application, which previously was available only to owners of Samsung phones with a TouchWiz shell, now works on any other android smartphones, although this has not been officially announced.  At the same time, the application began to require root access. <br><br>  <b>Sphere from two triangles</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/android_dev/posts/">Rus</a> <br>  Once, when insomnia tormented me, I decided to try to combine these two approaches: draw a rotating sphere (with a map of the planet stretched on it) through OpenGL, but at the same time leaving it flat. <br><br>  <b>Voice control in Android applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180515/">Rus</a> <br>  I thought, what if I could write the calculator completely on voice control (would it be convenient?).  But first I had to deal a little with the voice control itself, more precisely with voice input (control still needs to be achieved).  In addition, I just downloaded Android Studio, and I could not wait to try it out in practice (well, on the mini-project). <br><br>  <b>Adding Google Apps to the Android emulator (Intel x86 Atom System Image)</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180507/">Rus</a> <br>  All Android developers know how slow the emulator works.  Last June, Intel introduced Android, which runs in x86 mode (without ARM emulation).  And of course, the speed of the emulator has become amazing.  But there are no Google Apps in the system images of these emulators (Maps, GMail, Calendar, Google Play, Google account, ...). <br><br>  <b>We study the principles of interaction between Ubuntu Touch and Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180505/">Rus</a> <br>  A couple of months ago I was porting Ubuntu Touch to the Allwinner A10 platform, <br>  in the process of taking notes on my memory.  Now, in my opinion, they are still relevant, until Ubuntu Touch has finally moved to its graphic server Mir and so on. <br><br>  <b>Google Glass apps launched on Nexus 7 tablet</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180645/">Rus</a> <br>  The user zhuowei with Reddit decided to try to run the "points" applications on his Nexus 7 tablet, and, not surprisingly, he did it all. <br><br>  <b>50% of search queries in Google Play are written incorrectly: 5 tips for better opening applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/5-sovetov-dlya-luchshego-otkryitiya-prilojeniy.html">Rus</a> <br>  Beginning in order, Google spokesman Ankit Jane noted that when working with application names "it is very important to be creative and not to miss the details," because the name is the most important piece of meta-information that helps to detect the application. <br><br>  <b>Samsung opens Smart App Challenge 2013 with a prize fund of $ 800,000</b> <br>  <a href="http://developer.samsung.com/ssac2013">Angl</a> <br>  Samsung launches the new Smart App Challenge 2013. The top ten apps will receive a total of $ 800,000, and the winner will receive $ 200,000. <br><br><h4>  Blackberry </h4><br><br>  <b>How Blackberry cares about developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180807/">Rus</a> <br>  This post is about how to encourage and help developers.  Provide them with test devices, reward with money / smartphones / tablets. <br><br><h4>  Other </h4><br><br>  <b>Jolla announced the first smartphone on Sailfish OS: the beginning of sales at the end of the year, price - ‚Ç¨ 399.99</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c70/785/10d/c7078510d3084b82e4b60f4d283f55ed.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180309/">Rus</a> <br>  The Finnish company Jolla, which develops the operating system Sailfish OS - the heiress of MeeGo - revealed its plans for the release of smartphones, their characteristics and price. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>Unity for iOS and Android is now free for indie developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180441/">Rus</a> <br>  It is worthwhile to clarify that only the base license is given free of charge, which cost $ 400 for each platform.  If you are interested in additional features, such as dynamic shadows, rendering in texture, post process and some others, then you still have to buy a Pro license, which costs $ 1500. <br><br>  <b>Its cloud backend in one line of code.</b>  <b>Overview of BaaS Platform "Backendless</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/backendless/blog/180367/">Rus</a> <br>  The post will be interesting to those who are interested in how to gain time when developing mobile, desktop or browser applications.  This information will help your applications to be more functional and go out into the world many times faster. <br><br>  <b>Brow.si makes mobile sites look like apps.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/brow-si.html">Rus</a> <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/66642803&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiNAoe3YvXXMGwNefDP4OpGIgth7Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Introducing Brow.si" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The Israeli company MySiteApp, which previously released the UppSite tool for turning websites into native applications, offered everyone a new Brow.si service for creating websites that behave like applications.  Brow.si is a multifunctional toolbar that can be embedded into any site using Javascript.  Now the service is in open beta. <br><br>  <b>Burstly integrates TestFlight, FlightPath and SkyRocket into a single structure</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.burstly.com/">Angl</a> <br>  Burstly today unveiled its new vision and its corresponding corporate structure, opening its SkyRocket monetization tool for all mobile developers.  Previously, it was available only to large publishers.  Burstly is now three products under one brand - TestFlight, FlightPath and SkyRocket.  Together they offer a full cycle of support for mobile developers, starting with beta tests, through analytics and monetization based on it. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br><br>  <b>Got tired of smartphones?</b>  <b>GSM Arena calls for the release of more smart phones of a reasonable size.</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180425/">Rus</a> <br>  In GSM Arena they decided to take the initiative in their own hands, and urge the largest manufacturers of smartphones to stop ignoring the needs of people who need smart phones of a reasonable size, and at the same time with a decent configuration. <br><br>  <b>DryBox: a rescue station for "drowned" phones</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180597/">Rus</a> <br>  Of course, not all telephones are watery, especially if some measures are taken.  But still a significant part of the devices that fell into the water, fails either immediately or after some time.  The developers of DryBox claim that their device is able to radically change the situation. <br><br><h4>  Promotion </h4><br><br>  <b>Word of mouth gives 57% of information about new games</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/sarafannoe-radio-daet.html">Rus</a> <br>  When it comes to opening apps, the best resource you have is your players.  Applifier surveyed 1,800 mobile players and found that traditional and online opinions, word of mouth, give 57% of new game information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180977/</a></p>
