Announcing the return of money to everyone, thereby backed up his words, and here it is the effect - the unrest quickly subsided, and Apple is engaged in the sale of the iPhone. <br><br>  But on the horizon, a new problem loomed, which may be no less serious than the fall of the signal with the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù capture.  Apparently, Apple engineers will have to retire to their underground laboratories in order to test the strength of the iPhone 4. Not simple, but in protective cases, some of which turned out to be not so protective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, the preamble is about how accessories for iPhones are born.  Apple manages to make money on everything that is somehow related to their offspring.  Simply put, it sells licenses to third-party companies that produce the same covers, allowing them to put the MFI tag (Made for iPhone / iPad / iPod ...) on their products, as well as being displayed at the Apple Store.  The situation, by and large, is similar to the one that was formed with applications in the app store - the developers are being tested, as well as paying a margin from sales.  In the case of MFI accessories, Apple takes 10-15% of revenue. <br><br>  Of course, if this were not beneficial for the manufacturer, no one would agree to such conditions.  But it is profitable.  The company for the production of cases, covers and other things, in fact, immediately enters the world market.  For Apple, this is also a very nice addition, in addition to the profits from sales of the iPhone

      However, not everything turned out to be so cloudless, it was covers and pumped up.  As it turned out, the popular tough models that fit completely on the back panel (slide-on) are disastrous for the back glass cover of the last iPhone.  The ingress (often inevitable with long-term use) of small debris and sand grains into the gap between the cover and the back wall, leads the latter to a state of total scratching, and sometimes leads to the appearance of cracks. <br><br>  In connection with this fact, Apple decides to ban the sale of covers from third-party manufacturers in their stores.  After all, otherwise, once having fastened such protection, when it is removed, the client can be greatly distressed by the opened view of the crippled phone.  The most unpleasant will be those "third-party producers", who were sharpened by the release of apple-compatible products.  But they will have to suffer, and besides, the brave souls will be able to buy their goods in other places. <br><br>  Now, when Apple testers are gone to torture iPhone glasses for compatibility with slide-on cases, the likelihood that the next iPhone will get rid of the glass back cover increases. <br><br>  via <a href="http://gdgt.com/discuss/with-antennagate-over-is-glassgate-next-iphone-ani/">gdgt.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106122/</a></p>
