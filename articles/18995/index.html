      As an example, I will cite a couple of programs that are now (and will continue to be for a long time) the ‚Äúanchor‚Äù of switching to open operating systems (write here the name of your favorite distribution). <br><br>  So, let's go to any office and carefully look at what we see there.  Any office management translate into free software - no problem.  If you ‚Äúconjure‚Äù a little over an office worker, she will learn how to print documents in OpenOffice too. <br><br>  Difficulties will begin where we touch on such specific software as accounting systems (one of the subspecies is accounting software) and legal reference systems.  I hope no one will deny their importance, right?  And so what are these difficulties. <br><br><h1>  Accounting systems </h1><br>  Those who have ever worked on the support of 1C knows that 1C takes not so much money for their boxes.  Real money starts where you need real-time updates and non-standard solutions.  And what is the "operational updates"? <br><br>  All developed countries live in stable legislation.  For example, a declaration on a tax may not change for several years, this is a reality.  In Russia, almost every declaration for any tax changes at least once a year.  And in total, this is about 10-20 changes per year.  At the same time, these changes our state likes to do without regard to the moment at which they are made.  In my memory, the introduction of a new form of declaration in electronic form is still fresh two weeks before the deadline for their delivery.  It was, believe me, an enchanting nightmare. <br><br>  So, back to our sheep, sorry, to our realities.  None of the offices abroad (that Microsoft with their business solutions, that SAP) do not want to climb into the sector, which concerns the legislation en masse. <br><br>  It means literally the following, that for big money guys from SAP or Microsoft are ready to make a decision that meets the current legislation on taxes and fees, but it will cost absolutely crazy money.  And this is the main reason why these systems are not very popular with us.  You can transfer to them commodity accounting, management accounting, but in any of them the ‚Äúaccounting module‚Äù will cause a hysteria in the chief accountant. <br><br>  The reason for this is that Russia is far from complying with IFRS, that is, international accounting standards mean nothing to us.  The firm may, if it wants, keep records under IFRS, but this is an addition;  The principles of IFRS work are completely different. <br><br>  Therefore, today the only available, operational (and even then, with flaws) solution is 1C.  They really have long been in this swamp, they have been releasing reporting forms for Russia for a very long time, and Boris Georgievich Nuraliev, believe me, not one or even two dogs have eaten it. <br><br>  Therefore, it turns out that the accounting market is entirely (or almost entirely) under 1C.  And then, for many, 1C is expensive! <br><br>  And what about 1C and open source software?  And nothing special.  Today, you can keep the server for the accounting base under FreeBSD, for example, I did this for a while, this is not a problem. <br><br>  But if we talk about 1C, then there is an important feature.  For small businesses, you can keep the database in a file format (hello, dBase!) And use FreeBSD as a file server, but for serious large-scale work this will not work.  And 1C, unfortunately, allows you to use only MS SQL! <br><br>  No, of course, if you search the network, you can force 1C to work with another database, but it‚Äôs not all that simple: we need the standard configuration from 1C to work with MySQL, but this will never happen.  Too sharpened by MS SQL. <br><br>  In the end, it turns out that everyone is talking about open source software, and manufacturers of accounting software are in no way going to go this way. <br><br><h1>  Legal Reference Systems </h1><br>  And here the situation is even worse.  Here prices are quite high (about 10 thousand per month - these are flowers).  At the same time, the main difficulty lies in efficiency and trust.  Believe me, the choice of the help system can sometimes get very expensive if the system does not contain any documents, or contains typos. <br><br>  And these systems are not going to switch to any open operating system either.  Well, no way!  They can talk about it until blue in the face, but go - no. <br><br><h1>  Output? </h1><br>  ‚ÄúIs there any way out?‚Äù The reader will ask.  Yes there is.  And no.  At the same time. <br><br>  Of course, most developers will ask - what's the bad web for this?  Make and cheer.  And let them open any browser, even though Safari on the iPhone and are hacked to the fall, but there is a very serious problem called performance. <br><br>  And the thing is that if you can think of something with the legal system, that is, you can assemble a stadium of servers like Google‚Äôs and give access to legal documents, but it will be too expensive for end users.  No one will pay for computer time, which belongs not only to him, and then also pay for traffic (believe me, traffic outside the Moscow Ring Road is still very seriously paid).  That is why the discussion of the fact that the Consultant + site works only under IE <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/33998.html">is</a> meaningless <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/33998.html">here</a> .  An insignificant percentage of users use the system this way. <br><br>  And if we talk about the accounting system, then in general no one will agree to take it out of the enterprise.  It turns out that there is a way out, but it costs too much, there‚Äôs no way to do without a fat client, which should be cross-platform. <br><br>  Of course, you can look in the direction of Java, but we are again stuck in performance.  Too she is critical.  It is possible to look in the direction of Wine, but this again leads to licensing. <br><br>  And now, for the third year now, as the head of the company, I expect that at least some Steve Jobs will appear in our homeland.  But I'm afraid I'm waiting in vain.  Software manufacturers simply do not want to change something, and the public, instead of trying to port something at least for one specific distribution, only screams about the need for free software. <br><br>  Believe me, business is waiting for this software.  And he wants it.  Only no one does it. <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18995/</a></p>
