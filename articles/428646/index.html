  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Last year's iPhone models also slow down as the battery wears out.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb5/a90/9e7/cb5a909e7f1a40b22eba589a63bb0e0b.jpg"><br><br>  Only a few days ago on Habr√© was published the <a href="https://habr.com/post/427749/">news</a> that Apple and Samsung were fined in Italy for 10 million euros and 5 million euros, respectively.  The reason is the proven fact of the so-called planned obsolescence of smartphones.  Representatives of the law felt that companies deliberately slowed down the work of old devices in order to gently push users to the idea that they needed a new, more powerful phone. <br><br>  The fact of slowing down was recognized first by Apple Inc. and later by Samsung.  All this happened at the end of the past - the beginning of this year.  Investigations into corporate actions began in Italy and France.  One could think that companies would give up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãforcibly slowing down smartphones.  But no, at least Apple continues to use "performance management" (i.e. throttling), and this concerns quite current models - the iPhone 8, 8 plus, iPhone X. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  True, now the user can turn off trotting if they wish.  Apple has added the ability to disable throttling in the iOS 11.3 update.  It was a rather large update that corrected many problems with the corporation‚Äôs devices that plagued its own customers.

      By the way, throttling, as previously stated by the company, is not a necessary measure for those same iPhone 8, 8 Plus, iPhone X. Just because of some design features of these smartphones, as Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/6/16979288/iphone-8-x-hardware-improvements-battery-throttling">told the</a> US senators.  According to the company, advanced hardware and software are used in the iPhone 8 and later models.  All this allows for a more accurate assessment of energy needs and the ability of the battery to provide this energy while maintaining the overall performance. <br><br>  Thus, in the new smartphones the probability of a sudden shutdown of the device was much lower than that of previous models - applications could receive the necessary information about the current power consumption of the device and did not overload the battery.  However, the company still recommended replacing old batteries, since they are no longer able to perform the necessary functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/630/1ab/df6/6301abdf69800436538fdf6629568e90.jpg"><br><br>  However, after the release of the iOS 12.1 update, the technical support page showed information that the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X may also experience problems with a too high load on the battery and suddenly turn off.  And therefore, they need that very function of slowing down work when the battery becomes outdated, which caused such user dissatisfaction.  That is, throttling.  The company, however, added that the performance of the devices is not too affected, because they have "advanced design and software." <br><br>  Unlike the previous situation, the company tried to provide customers with information on the impact of new software on the performance of smartphones.  But still, this information is not in the most accessible place, so only an advanced user can know about all this.  Actually, it is still not too clear how old the battery with a low level of "health" slows down the work of the entire system. <br><br>  It is only known that the charge and voltage of the battery, as well as the ambient temperature, are taken into account.  The cooler the street and the less ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù the battery, the slower the processor.  Interestingly, a special algorithm that reduces the frequency of the processor began to work, starting with the update iOS 10.2.1, released in January 2017. <br><br>  The same Apple in the course of the proceedings dramatically reduced the cost of batteries - from $ 79 to $ 29 for replacement in smartphones for which the warranty ended.  In addition, information was added about the state of the battery in the operating system, where, among other things, you can disable throttling. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428646/</a></p>
