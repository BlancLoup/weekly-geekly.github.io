      Where it can be applied: <br><br>  Small power backup system. <br>  This is not an uninterruptible power supply in the classic sense of the term - UPS. <br>  This is a variant of long battery life, up to several tens of hours of load, instead of using a portable power station. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The system is quite autonomous and does not require user intervention to change the modes of operation.  Everything happens automatically.  There is a network, the load is running from the network. <br>  When the external voltage of 220 volts disappears, the inverter automatically switches to battery mode. <br>  In the mode of operation from the mains, the inverter operates as a charger, ensuring the charge of the connected batteries. <br><br><br>  Appearance APSX-1250 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b85/b9d/ddd/b85b9dddd5a07b45b6369f0227335e4a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>entrance</b> <br><br>  12 Volts DC, rechargeable battery. <br><br>  230 V for supply to load <br><br>  <b>Output</b> <br><br>  230 V, 50 Hz;  2 weekend sockets.  To connect the load.  Two sockets type C13.  Included is an adapter from the C13 connector to a standard plug connection - allows you to use an extension cord to connect consumers. <br><br>  Switching mode time: Basic-Autonomous about half the period.  In other words, switching is fast enough, but it can be "visible" for sensitive consumers. <br><br>  Maximum output power converter: 1250 W constant load. <br>  Recommended maximum load power up to 700-1000 watts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26b/766/46f/26b76646f117fed9ff7d5098b9bf7fe2.jpg"><br>  APSX-1250 Included in the delivery set is a cable and an adapter <br><br>  <b>Battery charge</b> <br><br>  A three-stage charger for bulk and sealed rechargeable batteries provides a charging current of 7.5 / 30 A. <br><br>  In the photo view of the bottom or rear panel of the inverter.  The photo shows the terminals for connecting batteries.  Connectors for network and load. <br><br>  Protective thermo-breakers for operation in battery charge mode and connected load. <br>  A fuse in the battery circuit is not supplied. <br><br>  <b>Typical user errors when connecting inverter APSX 1250</b> <br><br>  Almost all users do not install a fuse in the battery circuit.  This is one of the main errors connecting the inverter. <br>  In addition, I had to observe many cases of non-compliance with the cable section for connecting batteries. <br><br>  <b>Recommendations for connecting the inverter APSX 1250</b> <br><br>  The maximum operating current in the battery circuit when switching to battery mode can reach 119 Amperes. <br>  Obviously you need to install a fuse in the battery circuit.  This is stated in the instruction manual. <br><br>  In the photo as well: Sample cable for connecting the battery.  Everything that looks different will work, maybe it will, but it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs not long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d76/88f/f9b/d7688ff9bd7efb39d6069432c103f08b.jpg"><br>  Sample cable connection <br><br>  <b>Reliability of any other type of connection</b> <br><br>  Bare conductors, without terminations with a sleeve and a tip for connecting to a battery. <br><br>  Solder wire without sleeve. <br><br>  All this is a big question.  In other words, there is no guarantee of reliable operation for many years. <br><br>  Why?  The answer to this question is very simple.  During operation, the current in the battery circuit can reach high values.  It is necessary to take this into account when applying the appropriate cross-section of cable connections to the battery circuit. <br><br>  In this case, the presence of a reliable contact on the terminals of the battery terminals and in the cable connection terminal is mandatory.  The operation of the logic and control and management of the inverter is provided by the internal node, which operates on battery voltage.  The slightest violation of the battery circuit, the loss of contact for a fraction of seconds and the inverter will turn off, and the load will be de-energized.  The system will become completely inoperable. <br><br>  In addition, most cases of failure of batteries and inverters - this is not the right connection. <br>  When using open, non-sealed or automotive batteries, the inverter must be isolated from the batteries and never install the inverter in close proximity to such batteries. <br><br>  <b>Configuration and configuration</b> <br><br>  Depending on the use of the type of battery, their number, it is necessary to configure the inverter. <br>  For this is responsible two groups of switches next to the LEDs that display the mode of operation and the battery level. <br>  All switching and settings must be made before connecting the network and batteries, and only then make the connection. <br><br>  Very important note: In most cases, the factory settings, the position of the switches does not match the actual system you are installing and plan to operate. <br><br>  The switch configuration is not correct - and battery failure is possible, the inverter does not work reliably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9dc/cd1/173/9dccd11730758d9d30cbc98e1e74264f.png"><br>  APSX1250 Inverter, Switch Configuration <br><br>  <b>Recommendations for use as a backup power supply system for heating systems, automatic control of boilers for heating systems</b> <br><br>  One of the applications of these inverters is back-up power supply of circulation pumps and automation of heating systems. <br>  In such an application, ground and neutral control is important.  Otherwise, automatic heating systems do not work. <br>  When connecting the inverter, it is necessary to take into account the control of these circuits and to ensure the presence of a neutral when the inverter is connected. <br><br>  In most cases, automatic control of the boilers does not work if the connection scheme is not correct, not only for inverters, but for connecting portable backup power plants. <br><br>  <b>Table of the estimated battery life for the inverter APSX 1250</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fe/627/770/0fe627770ed695b3486fa4b8ad78db53.png"><br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169293/</a></p>
