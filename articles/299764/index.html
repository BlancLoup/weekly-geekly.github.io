The customer service department helped the advertiser with creating advertising campaigns, choosing a placement strategy, optimizing results. <br><br>  But, if any client of Yandex could contact the technical support service, the customer service department worked with organizations whose average check exceeded a certain level.  For Moscow and St. Petersburg it is 21 thousand rubles, for the regions - 9 thousand rubles.

      Now, Yandex specialists decided that it would be worthwhile to combine these two directions and create a ‚Äúsingle window‚Äù for consulting clients. <a name="habracut"></a>  The updated service is not only a single channel of communication with advertisers, but also a single point of gathering information about market needs, they note in the company.  The new integrated customer service structure will be headed by Natalia Kovaleva. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe see active development of the SMB segment (small and medium business) on our radars.  This segment is growing both extensively - about several thousand new advertisers come to Yandex every month, and intensively - customers of this segment are growing more actively than customers with a large budget.  This is understandable, since it is much easier to increase the average check from 10 thousand rubles to 30 thousand rubles than from 1 million rubles to 3 million rubles.  Therefore, we set ourselves the task of helping SMB customers grow faster, ‚Äùshe <a href="http://www.sostav.ru/publication/yandeks-pomozhet-s-reklamoj-malomu-i-srednemu-biznesu-21654.html">told</a> Sostav.ru. <br><blockquote>  Yandex promises that issues will be resolved every day and no weekend from 5 am to 12 am (Moscow time). </blockquote>  True, the changes affect only those clients with whom Yandex works directly, the system of cooperation with agencies remains the same, representatives of the company emphasize. <br><br>  According to Maxim Grishakov, Yandex‚Äôs Commercial Director, in the new structure, the form of consultation will not depend on budgets, as it was before, but on the advertiser‚Äôs task. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are planning to launch customized development programs for different groups of advertisers.  Examples of such work are targeted mailings, topical webinars and video lectures, tips on interfaces, ‚Äùsays Natalia Kovaleva. <br><br>  Great emphasis "Yandex" plans to work with regional advertisers.  ‚ÄúOutside of Moscow and St. Petersburg, more and more businesses are connecting to working with online advertising, realizing that without it, it‚Äôs quite difficult to promote their services,‚Äù Grishakov added.  ‚ÄúAnd, of course, as a result, we expect that the share of our revenues from the regions of Russia will increase.‚Äù <br><br>  Summing <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24128/">up the results of</a> 2015, the CEO of Yandex in Russia, Alexander Shulgin, especially drew attention to a record number of advertisers (more than 394 thousand) in the fourth quarter.  Shulgin believes that the company has completed the fourth quarter "with excellent results." <br><br>  "Megamind" <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/22836/">wrote</a> that in January 2016, Yandex had to allocate into two separate structures two units that bring him non-advertising income, Yandex.Taxi and the Yandex.Vertical ad service.  The provision of services will help diversify risks and reduce the advertising share in the revenue structure of Yandex, which now amounts to almost 99%. <br><blockquote>  At the end of 2015, the share of mobile revenue from contextual advertising was 21% for Yandex, the share of mobile traffic in search queries was 25%, follows from the company's annual report.  In 2014, these figures were 15% and 22%, respectively, in 2013 - 10% and 14%, according to Vedomosti. </blockquote>  In addition to combining departments for working with advertisers, Yandex began to connect external advertising platforms to its <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Yandex.Direct</a> contextual advertising sales system, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/03/30/635733-yandeks-reklami">the</a> newspaper <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/03/30/635733-yandeks-reklami">reports</a> with reference to the company.  The first to join the service is the international exchange for the sale of online advertising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaato">Smaato</a> . <br><br>  Now advertisers will be able to place ads not only in the search for Yandex and on the sites of its advertising network (YAN), but also on third-party sites in mobile applications. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe advertisers' bonus also lies in the fact that the basic conditions of partnership with Yandex do not change - the cost per click does not increase, but the coverage grows,‚Äù the company's specialists say.  And Yandex itself, by increasing the number of advertising sites, will receive more mobile traffic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299764/</a></p>
