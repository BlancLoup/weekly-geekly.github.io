      10:00 - <b>Opening of the conference and opening remarks</b> <br>  <i>Pavel Gontarev, Head of B2B.ru Mail.ru Group</i> <br><br>  10:15 - <b>Discussion ‚ÄúHyperskeepers across Russia, or Who Sets Trends?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Let's talk about hyperskeiler companies not only in relation to the big three - Amazon, Microsoft and Google - but also to the largest players, in particular, the Chinese market - such as Huawei Cloud, which recently entered Russia.  Who is setting the trends in the Russian market now, whether new hyperskeilers from local players can appear and how global leaders see their presence in Russia will be discussed in the framework of the discussion. <br><br>  <i>Participants:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Dmitry Marchenko, Director of Marketing and Microsoft Operations in Russia </li><li>  Maxim Osorin, Head of SAP Cloud Platform in SAP CIS </li><li>  Vladimir Bobylev, Director of Oracle Technology Consulting Department </li></ul><br>  10:55 - <b>‚ÄúHow and why did Bitrix24 choose Multi-Cloud before it became mainstream‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Demidov, director of the direction of cloud services ‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù</i> <br><br>  For global projects focused on working with clients around the world, presence in key markets is crucial.  First, it is necessary to reduce network delays and be closer to service consumers: use European data centers for customers in Europe, American ones for the US, etc. Secondly, presence in local markets is necessary in terms of compliance with local laws .  For example, 152- ‚ÄúAbout personal data‚Äù in Russia, GDPR in Europe, CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the USA. <br><br>  Moreover, even the world's largest IaaS providers cannot build the necessary infrastructure around the world, at least in the near future. <br><br>  Using the example of Bitrix24, we will describe how we migrated data to Russia from AWS to comply with local laws, as well as how we provide redundancy and fault tolerance by working with several cloud providers even in the same region. <br><br>  11:20 - <b>‚ÄúHow MegaFon expands its business through a microservice platform‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Deulin, Head of the MegaFon Business Systems Research and Development Center</i> <br><br>  The speaker will tell about his experience in the development of a digital project with a four-level architecture and microservice ecosystem.  You will find out on which technology stack MegaFon built its own microservice development and how they help its business. <br><br>  11:45 - <b>Discussion ‚ÄúFrom monoliths to microservices‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Microservices is one of the hottest topics of recent times in IT.  And the time has come to discuss how productive the transition to the microservice architecture turned out to be for the largest client companies - who can share successful cases of getting rid of monoliths, and for whom such a transition does not justify itself at least in the near future. <br><br>  <i>Participants:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Sergey Sergeev, Chief Information Officer, M.Video-Eldorado Group </li><li>  Alexander Deulin, Head of the MegaFon Business Systems Research and Development Center </li><li>  Yuri Shekhovtsov, Chief Information Officer, Norilsk Nickel </li><li>  Dmitry Lazarenko, Head of PaaS-direction Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions </li></ul><br>  12:35 - <b>Lunch</b> <br><br>  13:15 - <b>Session ‚ÄúIT as a growth driver.</b>  <b>Technology at the service of business "</b> <br><br>  Business is always looking towards technologies that will accelerate the entry of new products into the market and optimize existing processes.  In this session of speeches, we will find out which technologies, including cloud technologies, are seen as the most promising, what happens to be implemented and with what effect for business, as well as what advice speakers can give to other companies. <br><br>  We will look at different ways of implementation and different sectors: both the digitalization of ‚Äúold industries‚Äù and born-digital companies and their specifics - which will give the most complete cut of the Russian business experience. <br><br>  <i>Participants:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Maxim Tsvetkov, Head of Information Technology Management, Burger King </li><li>  Alexander Sokolovsky, Technical Director of Leroy Merlin </li><li>  Alexander Pyatigorsky, Director of Digital Department at Otkrytie Bank </li><li>  Schneider electric </li></ul><br>  14:30 - <b>Discussion "Where is the Russian cloud market heading?"</b> <br><br>  <i>Participants:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Anton Zakharchenko, director of cloud provider strategy #CloudMTS </li><li>  Alexander Sorokoumov, CEO SberCloud </li><li>  Oleg Lyubimov, CEO of Selectel </li><li>  Ilya Letunov, Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions Platform Manager </li><li>  Vidiya Zheleznov, Director of Strategy and Marketing Communications, Rostelecom - Data Center </li><li>  Oleg Koverznev, Director of Business Development for Yandex.Oblaka </li></ul><br>  15:10 - <b>‚ÄúWhen data is too big: Data Platform aaS as a global trend‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Lazarenko, Head of PaaS-direction Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions</i> <br><br>  Big data and artificial intelligence are no longer a luxury, but a reality in which one has to live.  If earlier all services were launched in the Mobile First paradigm, now AI First. <br><br>  Based on these business needs, the infrastructure for fast processing of big data is changing, turning into a whole ecosystem of related services, which can significantly reduce Time to Market. <br><br>  Using the examples of the largest companies, we show why the maximum results from the use of Data Platforms are obtained when used in the cloud, and also describe the global trends in this direction. <br><br>  16:00 - <b>Coffee break</b> <br><br>  16:20 - <b>Discussion ‚ÄúTrend on SaaS: What will remain from IaaS by 2021?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The share of SaaS within the cloud market is growing, and here the logical question arises: if all high-tech solutions become available within the framework of SaaS - what will be left for infrastructure as a service, will this market segment expect stagnation?  And also, who will be the consumer of IaaS in a few years and which way will the IaaS change? <br><br>  <i>Participants:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Dmitry Martynov, Acronis Vice President, Product Management </li><li>  Timur Biyachuev, Head of Threat Research Department, Kaspersky Lab </li><li>  Anton Salov, Director MerliONCloud </li></ul><br>  16:45 - <b>Final Word</b> <br><br>  17:00 - <b>Networking</b> <br><br>  <b>Attention:</b> registration <a href="https://mcs.mail.ru/m2c/%3Futm_source%3Dreferral%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D2019_04_17_habr_mailru">by reference is</a> <b>required</b> .
