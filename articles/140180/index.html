At one time, the game became the progenitor of the post-apocalyptic RPG genre, first of all - the cult Fallout 1 and 2. However, finding a publisher to continue was not easy. <br><br>  A few days ago, Brian, on behalf of his company <b>InXile,</b> launched <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">a fundraising project</a> to create <b>Wasteland 2</b> using the <b>KickStarter</b> service. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPerhaps this is the last chance to create a sequel to Wasteland.  We tried to convince publishers more than once, but they refused.  They did not find anything interesting in the sturdy game of the old school. ‚Äù

      The required amount of <b>$ 900,000</b> was collected in a record <b>42</b> hours. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Wasteland 2 on KickStarter </h4><br>  For those who do not know, <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">KickStarter.com</a> is a site where any person can publish his project for fundraising, having described in detail what he wants to do by attaching drawings, information, renders or photos of prototypes.  Those who are interested in the project can donate a certain amount, the size of which determines what bonus it can receive if the project is completed. <br><br>  Brian for a long time unsuccessfully tried to find a publisher for Wasteland 2. Someone suggests strongly reworking the game, someone is interested in exceptionally large profits, someone is simply not interested. <br>  Then it was decided that Wasteland 2 will be 100% financed with funds donated by fans.  A game page appeared on KickStarter, with a target amount of $ 900,000.  Brian also noted that if he manages to collect even more, then the money will go to expanding the game world, a more thoughtful global story, characters, and porting to OS X and Linux. <br><br>  At Wasteland 2, <b>23,939</b> people donated <b>$ 1,280'431</b> at the moment.  Thus, this project ranks third in the amount of funds raised at KickStarter.  For the remaining 30 days, the amount may well double.  Anyone who donates more than $ 15 can get a digital copy of their future game for free.  The remaining awards include a user manual, a soundtrack, a character‚Äôs figure, an icon, references in the credits of the game, the ability to place a unique artifact with a personal background in the game, or a statue in its honor.  For $ 10'000, you can get an invitation to a private party of Brian Fargo, Alan Paulish and the rest of the development team (in the USA). <br><br>  One of the largest contributors was <b>Min-Liang Tan</b> , director of <b>Razer</b> , a company that manufactures equipment for gamers.  Another well-known rich sponsor was <b>Notch</b> , the creator of <b>Minecraft</b> , who proved that without publishing control games can collect millions of dollars.  The project was also supported by <b>Ray Muzika</b> (director of <b>BioWare</b> ), <b>Chris Avellown</b> (game designer, worked on Fallout 2), <b>Rob Pardo</b> (executive deputy director of game design, <b>Blizzard Entertainment</b> ). <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br>  For Wasteland 2, the old team was re-assembled.  It includes: Alan Paulish and Mike Stakpoul - leading designers of the first part, screenwriter Jason Anderson, who had a hand in Fallout, Mark Morgan - composer Fallout 1/2, artist Andrew Wallin and others. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will be true to the spirit of the original and begin to build on it.  No first-person shooters, just a top view that allows you to evaluate the tactical situation.  And we are not going to turn the team into a crazy bloody game.  The game will be turn-based, tactical, with a deep and extensive scenario.  We intend to keep a hard dark and satirical style of narration.  We are going to make you make ethically ambiguous decisions.  You will see the consequences of your actions.  We want both Wasteland fans and Fallout 1/2 to feel at ease, ‚Äùthe developers promise. <br><br>  After the $ 900,000,000 triumphant gathering, Brian on the official blog thanked all the fans for such incredible support and announced that the game would be released in October 2013.  In subsequent interviews, he spoke about the details of the new game and about the nearest plans. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland 2 on KickStarter</a> <br>  <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/forum/index.php">Wasteland 2 Official Forum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140180/</a></p>
