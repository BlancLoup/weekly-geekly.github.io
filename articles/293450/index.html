Create a startup. <br>  2. Order a logo. <br>  3. ??? <br>  4. PROFIT! <br>  This scheme does not take into account an important point: the logo is not a magic wand, which creates the illusion that you have a serious business with a tremendous attitude towards customers and bringing real benefits.  The logo can combine these elements in a single recognizable image, but will not collect them for you. <br><br>  <b>A logo is worth considering if:</b> <br><ul><li>  You present your business at conferences and to potential investors.  So you solve two problems at once - you will seem more serious and be remembered by useful people. </li><li>  you sell a product that is compared with the rest of the original packaging or site design - then the development of the complex will be a logical action. </li><li>  you plan several points at once within the same network - this will allow customers to recognize you even outside their usual environment. </li><li>  you have had a qualitative change in the company to which you want to draw attention. </li></ul><br>  If the need for a logo is still obvious, but you are not sure about the further development of marketing and design of the company, it is better to pay for a simple but good text version that can be easily supplemented with details, while maintaining recognition.  You can buy a suitable logo on the drains, as Twitter did in its time - no one can distinguish it from the one developed by the designer specifically for your project.

      <b>What is more important than the logo?</b> <br><ul><li>  Understand who you are.  Form a culture that will stand behind the logo.  The company's culture consists of the attitude towards employees and customers and a stable value system.  A logo can sell a bad product only once, you can sell a good product to several people, and a good product with a good logo can be sold forever.  Learn to communicate with your customers.  The logo has no value until you have it - but then it allows you to remember that it was you who were useful. </li><li>  Conduct market analysis and understand how many competitors you have.  A product that has no analogues does not need a logo - at least for the first time.  But he needs a bottle of Coke, so that the buyer can determine which brand gives his money.  Think over branding.  In fact, the logo is just a picture, and branding is the emotions that it will cause.  Understand how you are positioning yourself and what kind of audience you are counting on - or pay the person who will do it for you. </li><li>  Save money on integrated design.  If at the very beginning you only have enough funds for the logo, then you will have to adjust the design of the site and all printed products for it, which is especially sad in the case of the frankly bad logo ordered ‚Äújust to be‚Äù.  Another version of the situation is a redesign that will kill the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe logo as a tool for recognition. </li><li>  Stand up on feet.  Maybe in a couple of months you will have to make a pivot (full restart of a startup, with a radical change in the business model), and possibly not one.  Then you are guaranteed to order a new logo to stop being associated with a failed idea. </li></ul><br>  Take a realistic look at your business and its development plan and think: is there any point in trying to find the perfect logo at the very beginning of your journey or is it better to gradually come to an understanding of what it should be.  The logo draws attention to you and allows you to remember you among all the others, but it cannot force the client to come back time after time.  This is your job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293450/</a></p>
