Let me remind you that the rating is not made by the ‚Äúexpert jury‚Äù, but by the participants in the form of feedback - more than 400 people answered our questions and gave ratings to the reports they listened to. <br><br>  This time the top was selected interesting, diverse and almost completely English.  You'll find videos about (dev) tools and ServiceWorkers, about minimizing code and the role of UX in a cage of frontend developer skills, and much more, including WebVR. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/586/6ea/f9a/5866eaf9a4074eed833e451d737df462.jpg"></div>

      The variety of zoo tools in the JS world has not bypassed HolyJS - almost every report is to one degree or another devoted to some framework or tool - but the overview for each of them is given in depth and exhaustive, you will not get bored. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  10 best reports of HolyJS 2016 Moscow </h2><br><br>  Without long preludes, let's start.  At the 10th position we have Max Stoiber, an open source developer from ThinkMill, who has already created several projects in his 20 (react-boilerplate and Carte Blanche), with the report Offline is the new Black.  The report looks at one go - starting with explaining why offline mode is needed at all (using the example of an island in Cambodia), Max goes to work with ServceWorkers. <br><br>  The report examines living examples, so it will be useful both for web developers and those involved in the SPA. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjr6VJdDcHQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  The ninth line was taken by Denis Mishunov, who deals with the performance of the frontend at Digital Garden AS.  In the new light report, Denis talks about what makes the developer a professional.  And this is not reading tweets or coding 24/7. <br><br>  How to avoid the state of frustration, how to maintain purity of consciousness and concentration to solve your current problems and find simple answers.  About what traps the developer's brain prepares, ‚Äúlocking‚Äù on the tasks and not seeing alternative solutions. <br><br>  PS Denis in the report answers the question why at the technical conference keyout is dedicated to user and developer psychology.  It is recommended to watch everything, refreshing and allows you to take a fresh look at your workflow: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGoWhHhYpQU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  On the eighth line is the report of Slobodan Stojanovic, dedicated to <s>buzzwords for</s> creating serverless chatbots based on node.js and simple NLP (which is ‚Äúnatural language processing‚Äù, and not the effect on interlocutors' subconscious).  Slobodan in the report talks about serverless AWS Lambda architecture, about platforms on which bots can be written.  After that, with a live example, you and your presenter will build your bot, deploy it to AWS Lambda and see how it all works (sometimes even for free): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hRkK3xCYJ1g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Next we have a report by Mathias Buus Madsen, in which he talks about his experience of creating a fully p2p implementation of the modular ‚Äúdropbox‚Äù with no limit on the size of the files written in JS.  In his report, Mathias talks about the technical aspects of developing a service with live-coding examples, and then demonstrates how the service can be used in modern data science. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tf14VpeHlE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  In sixth place, one of the ‚Äúpearls‚Äù of the past HolyJS is the announcement of Logux, a new framework from Andrey Sitnik, the author of PostCSS and Autoprefixer.  Yes, the report begins with the words "JavaScript awesome", but then everything is true and to the point :) <br><br>  Logux is a new client-server protocol for SPA (this is Redux, but based on logs, therefore Logux), which develops ideas for Relay and Swarm.js, working with live updates and offline.  In the report, Andrew talks about the problems that are now in client-server interaction and tells how he will solve them in his framework, providing the opportunity to make an optimistic UI and error-free synchronization.  Before the decision still needs to work. <br><br>  Watch the video and at the end your cherry is waiting on the cake - a cool Q / A session.  In addition, the video did not hit the hour and a half QA section in the discussion area, so <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/">do</a> not miss the <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/">next HolyJS</a> ! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RMhUPsVw2M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  The top five opens with Roman Dvornov with the report "Remote (dev) tools do it yourself."  The report is devoted to cycling in the field of remote tools: what are the difficulties, how to get around them, how to stop being afraid and start making tools for your tasks and technological stack. <br><br>  The report begins with the architecture of building remote tools, the pattern (publisher-subscriber), which fits well with the chosen architecture, and how to implement it correctly.  Next, Roman stops on the pitfalls of the transport implementation, and demonstrates with a living example how <a href="https://github.com/rempl">rempl</a> allows <a href="https://github.com/rempl">you</a> to forget about the infrastructural difficulties and deal only with the publisher and subscriber, without thinking about the transport, the host, and the sandbox. <br><br>  After that - another 50 slides about what can be done using the remote platform: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb22qyVUqTs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  The fourth place was taken by Thomas Watson - practice shows that interest in the topic of performance is platform-independent (reports on performance fall into the top in Java, in .NET, and in mobile phones).  The report focuses on detecting and fixing Node.js performance problems, namely: <br><ul><li>  The reasons for the lack of performance node.js; </li><li>  Detection and operation with CPU load code (flamegraph and PERF); </li><li>  Finding problems in case of crash using Core dump and mdb; </li><li>  Search and fix memory leaks with heap dump or gcore &amp; mdb. </li></ul><br>  In the bloody world of server-based enterprise-Java, all these tools have long been known.  I am glad that in JavaScript, too, the correct and powerful optimization tools are gaining popularity. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/briH-bfleIM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  So we got to the top three, in third place - Martin Kleppe and his report with the intricate name "3L3M3NT5".  Everyone knows what the demoscene is?  The Martin report has something similar.  You will not find some great practical value here, it will be a question of excellent examples of code golfing - a competition in which developers try to minimize the source code that solves a specific task. <br><br>  Interesting examples in which the speaker shows how to get interesting effects, with only a few dozen bytes per code. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0X9UlqarCU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  The second place was fixed for Nikolaus Graf and the theme of working with Rich text format on Draft.js.  Draft.js is a framework designed by Facebook for working with rich text, and all the non-plain-text fields of the social network itself revolve on it. <br><br>  Nicolaus talks about how Draft.js works under the hood: how its data structures work, how to use decorators, style maps and block renderers allow you to do @ -turns, drag &amp; drop work with pictures, hashtags, etc.  in a single editor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHat0n1xBVc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Well, here we are and got to the leader of our chart - Martin Splitt and WebVR.  The report is built around the currently popular VR theme, namely: in what form of 3D exists on the web;  what is WebVR and what it is eaten with;  what difficulties does this direction now have and what to do next. <br><br>  A cool and really impressive flow with lots of real life examples.  Even if you do not plan in the near future to engage in webVR-development, it is worth a look. <br><br>  By the way, in June, Martin will arrive at HolyJS 2017 Piter, this time <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/rendering-performance-from-the-ground-up/"><b>with a report on the performance of JS</b></a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39MiUkGSEks" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  This is not all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8sJahqnzh8IDythQu3ZJPqnvuSXQF8MV">on the link</a> you will find all the other reports from HolyJS 2016 Moscow.  Share with friends, show colleagues.  More than 20 hours of video - there is something to watch! <br><br><h2>  HolyJS 2017 Piter: Call For Papers and the new program </h2><br>  Now let's look into the future.  On 2-3 June at HolyJS 2017 Piter, two exceptional speakers will come to us, and I want to take the opportunity to tell you about them: <br><br><img align="left" width="190" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef5/c5b/7e2/ef5c5b7e2b104a9eb58b1145f443a2a5.jpg">  <a href="https://twitter.com/crockfordfacts"><b>Douglas Crockford</b> ,</a> one of the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of JavaScript, the creator of JSON, the author of many tools (like JSLint and JSMin), as well as one of the rare people who <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">found good sides in JS</a> .  Douglas will give two presentations: <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/keynote-the-post-javascript-apocalypse/">The Post JavaScript Apocalypse</a> and <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/talks/typing-goto-there-and-back-again/">Typing, Goto There and Back Again</a> . <br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="190" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffe/6ce/e02/ffe6cee027d84d07b36dc01ba5c2fb15.jpg">  <a href="https://twitter.com/leaverou"><b>Lea Verou</b></a> , author of the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do">‚ÄúCSS Secrets‚Äù</a> and one of the few invited experts of the CSS Working Group.  In addition, Lia is the author of several open source projects: Prism, Dabblet and -prefix-free.  She will tell you how UX approaches in programming can make your code, your API better: after all, code is also a UI. <br><br><br><br><br><br>  If you want to perform on the same stage with Douglas and Leah, our <b><a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/callforpapers/">Call For Papers is</a></b> open and the program committee is accepting applications for reports!  The program committee looks with interest at topics about node.js, everything related to client-server synchronization (the constant sore subject of all projects), reports about JS performance and, of course, about efficient work with frameworks.  Therefore, if you have an idea for a report - write. <br><br>  PS All accepted reports and conditions for participation can, as usual, be viewed <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/"><b>on the conference website</b></a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324364/</a></p>
