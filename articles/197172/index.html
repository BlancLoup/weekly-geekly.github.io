  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the new Kindle Paperwhite (2013)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  I owe the opportunity to tell about the new Kindle Paperwhite to my almost seven-year-old son, who on the second day after he was presented with a Pocketbook 360 (the very first from preorders, who remembers), crushed his screen, accidentally sitting on it in the car.  After asking for repair options (3960 rubles per screen with delivery from Moscow to America, or $ 40 in Germany + $ 55 delivery), I realized that there seemed to be only one option - Kindle. <br><br>  Having read many times that someone crushed his Kindle for the third time and got a new replacement from Amazon, I decided to find out the current situation first-hand.  After talking with the Amazon support service (to be sure, I interrogated two different Indians), I found out that today, for the new Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon is replacing devices in the event of any problems other than physical breakdowns.  And in order to be able to replace the reader with a broken screen, you need to purchase an extended 2-year warranty for $ 30.  It includes 3 free replacements during these two years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, knowing now in my own skin how fragile screens are in the reading rooms, and how tidy (or not tidy) children can be, I decided to take this extended warranty, and at the same time a corporate cover.  By the way, who will order a cover of Persimmon color (persimmon) - do not believe the pictures on the site.  In life, it is not orange, but almost red. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a2/b76/b33/4a2b76b3377a9ad5c5d489614054f5e6.jpg">

But as in the last year‚Äôs device, at the bottom of the screen, near the LEDs, there are small dips in brightness, but, in my opinion, they are not so obvious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb1/95d/562/cb195d562d65c847857b92cf77c83226.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5f/9ef/9c7/b5f9ef9c7e8d3ee412a37e05108fed9a.jpg"><br><br>  Having run through the English-language reviews, people report that, compared with the first Paperwhite, the 25% increase in the speed of turning over was declared by Amazon to be felt like that.  I personally can only compare with the PocketBook 360 (and then in the memories), and I have to say that the Kindle flips through much faster, there is practically no delay, neither on plain text nor on PDF. <br><br>  When reading plain text, a full screen update occurs dynamically, depending on the speed of reading, the number of pages read and the device temperature ( <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-better-screen-same-k-1245621747">Gizmodo</a> ).  At the time of writing this review, I have a screen update every 13th page. <br><br>  PDF paging speed <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCd2_P1bNhk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiC63u6eyNq-7xsjHewFJzYhLpVNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãpaging text file <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aQO2nfHOn4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgog4tVIp9kCzbWThV245_x4ENyKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PDF, by the way, in my opinion, is really read only in landscape orientation.  But something can be tried in portraiture.  When reading a PDF, the text contrast setting becomes available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/1ce/558/b0a1ce558c43c7ccb05027a62da42ffa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/e6a/e52/0e9e6ae52bfc420ce660df2c888b4458.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/978/22f/91c/97822f91c23f55c299634bce4b5a74ee.jpg"><br><br>  Drawing the adjustment scale podglyuchivaet like this, although the adjustment itself is normal. <br><br>  What else to add on the use of the book ... <br>  1. Books can be combined into ‚Äúcollections‚Äù - well, folders, in general <br>  2. You can quite comfortably go to the Internet (video does not show, if that :)), but there is no Russian keyboard.  If anyone knows how to do - write in the comments? <br>  3. There is a "parental control" - you can protect your password using a browser, cloud storage and Amazon's book store.  Until the end of the year they promise to release a firmware update, in which there will be some more interesting pieces for children: you can create different profiles for different children, set goals and track the progress of reading (achivki!).  It also seemed to me that I had seen in TV advertising that it would be possible to limit the use of the device for each profile, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly, but I‚Äôve not seen this ad anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/cc8/6cb/d63/cc86cbd6390a801e6afbe7c1e7e60b25.jpg"><br><br>  As for the exact date of the firmware release, he was already questioning the third Indian support service.  More precisely than the end of the year, he could not say <br>  4. I also liked the ability to automatically build a dictionary for those words, the translation of which was looked at.  Then from this dictionary, you can go to the cards to study these words.  The word is written on the card, a fragment of the text where it is found, and the name of the book.  You can mark a word as learned, or see the definition <br>  5. In the lower left corner, you can touch to display the page display, the remaining time until the end of the chapter, the remaining time until the end of the book.  In the lower right corner displays the progress in percent. <br>  6. Touch-screen and paging: the screen is divided into 3 zones, something like this: on the left a vertical bar of 10%, on the top a horizontal bar of 10%, the remaining space is the 3rd zone.  Touch in the left zone - flipping back, touch in the right ‚Äúlarge‚Äù zone - flipping forward.  Touch in the upper zone - call the menu.  You can also make svaypy left and right, to scroll back and forth, respectively.  Swipe from the bottom edge of the screen up causes the book to be viewed: without leaving the current page, you can quickly view (in a slightly smaller page size) at least the entire book in any direction.  You can use two fingers to increase or decrease the font size. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  If you have any questions - ask. <br><br>  <b>Addition</b> <br><br>  Updated the firmware, appeared promised Freetime and achivki. <br>  Found that I can not add some books to the freetime library.  accidentally it turned out that they were in Russian. <br>  I decided that this is a bug that does not see Russian names. <br>  Signed up with support, here's a snippet: <br><br>  Varsha: Alexey, can you help me with the order number of the book? <br>  Me: Oh, there is no order number. <br>  Varsha: Yeah.  How did you get that book? <br>  Me: I think I sent it through my email <br>  Warsaw: Is it a personal book? <br>  Free Time Alexey :( <br>  Me: Errr <br>  Warsaw: Yes Alexey.  It is like this.  But let me re-check it once again. <br>  If you‚Äôre reading or not, you can‚Äôt find out what to do. <br>  Me: Oh ... ok, thanks. <br>  Warsaw: :) No problem Alexey. <br>  Is there anything else that I can help you with? <br><br>  <b>In short: in freetime, you can add only books purchased (at least for free) from amazon, no more.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197172/</a></p>
