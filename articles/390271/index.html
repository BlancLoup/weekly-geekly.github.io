  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Expansion of the car audio system. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another reader from Hicktimes refined his car stereo using our module to listen to music in the car from his smartphone and tablet, watch movies with sound output via Bluetooth on car speakers, and sent us the results of the upgrade.  A description of the process, test results, pros and cons, read his review: <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo begin with, I have: <br>  1. Car Subaru Impreza Wagon 2006 release.  The speakers are regular, but the noise-vibration isolation is made, which is why the sound quality has noticeably improved and I changed my mind about changing them. <br>  2. The radio KENWOOD KDC-W4044.  It has an AUX input, a USB connector on the front panel, which I brought the wire to the glove box, because  On the front panel, the USB flash drive and the connector itself have already been physically affected several times. <br>  3. The <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/bluetooth/1937978">MP3862BT</a> module is a built-in Bluetooth module for an amplifier, <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/bluetooth/1937978">powered</a> speakers or radio. <br><br>  The tape recorder looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/5cf/1a3/b085cf1a3e444fd1be5d86981794f920.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But the module itself:

Unfortunately, I do not have any, but the management works, which makes it possible to more fully use its functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77d/129/018/77d129018e334c2f954fc6727c12aca7.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  The module has a wide power range from 5 to 35 volts, which eliminates the need to install an additional stabilizer and filter.  Previously, when using the FM transmitter, I heard interference with engine revolutions.  With this module there is no such phenomenon, the sound is clear, without interference. <br><br>  The installation began by removing the CD drive, which had not worked for a long time and cleaning the lens did not help the situation.  At the same time he made a lot of space to install the module.  I decided to screw the module through the corner to the back wall, for which it has a special hole.  I soldered the audio cable to the AUX input (first I connected it with ordinary wires, but then I replaced them with a shielded audio cable), I connected the power and it all worked.  Next, adjust the volume and balance with special controls on the module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/39b/1fd/bd839b1fd76243648b032a4923d48f70.jpg"><br><br>  I assembled the radio tape recorder and installed it back in the car.  It would seem that everything is easy and simple, but those here it was.  The radio tape recorder refused to read flash drives and generally forgot that it has USB without a CD-ROM drive, but I wanted to compare the sound quality from USB and from the module.  I had to reassemble everything and install the drive in place and move the module to another place.  Photo unfortunately did not. <br><br>  Testing. <br><br>  When you turn on the radio, the phone finds a Bluetooth device "BT-speaker".  Connect to it, no password is required.  In the speakers there is a melody indicating the connection of the phone, which is very convenient.  We turn on the composition on the phone and listen to it through the car‚Äôs audio system.  I have a radio installed on my service car running Android OS and an integrated Bluetooth module.  When playing music from a phone via Bluetooth, the sound is for some reason mono.  I was afraid that there would be the same situation here, but on this device there is stereo sound, which is good news.  The connection with the phone is automatic and very fast.  When an outgoing or answering an incoming call, the sound is switched to the phone, at the end of the call, playback continues automatically.  The laptop on the bluetooth also easily connected, when playing a movie there were no suspensions of sound when transmitting through the bluetooth.  I tried to watch a movie from a smartphone, playing the sound through the BT module, also played without problems. <br><br>  The sound quality, of course, is not a high end and it also seemed to me that the top is a bit lacking.  But personally, this quality suits me, since I am not a music lover and I listen to music in the car as a background.  For an inexperienced listener of this quality will be quite enough, but if you like high-quality sound, you will have to compromise in favor of functionality. <br><br>  The radio tape recorder is well shielded, and even the CD drive is metal, and I positioned the module right behind it.  Therefore, if the sound is reproduced from the phone of the rear passenger, then stutters sometimes occur, but the connection is not lost.  This can be avoided by placing the module in a less shielded place or by soldering a segment of the installation wire parallel to the module antenna. <br><br>  Sometimes the connection is not automatically established and you have to manually connect.  But, it seems to me that this is a problem rather of a phone than a module. <br><br>  I shot a small video. <br>  As soon as the radio was turned on, there was a low signal about the connected device.  Then I disconnected the connection, there was another sound.  Well, after, re-connect and play music.  Connection is very fast.  If you display the buttons from the module, you can start playing them by simply pressing "Play". <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/otWxSMo9jtw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgehWhZYjz9uyithPM43Wj7Uby23g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Instead of a conclusion. <br><br>  <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/bluetooth/1937978">This module</a> allows you to significantly expand the capabilities of the old radio, especially if there are no USB, CD and even AUX, the Internet is full of ways to make a linear input instead of the AM range of a regular radio.  For my previous working machine, this would be exactly the solution I was looking for, since  there was an old radio cassette of non-standard dimensions and a 24-volt on-board network, but there could be no question of high-quality sound (it was an old Japanese truck). ‚Äù <br><br>  Author: Anton <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/gans85-5/" class="user_link">Gans85-5</a> , Ekaterinburg <br><br>  Ps  Another publication on this topic: the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/masterkit/blog/269938/">upgrade of the standard car radio Mercedes W203</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/masterkit/blog/266268/">we do wireless active speakers</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390271/</a></p>
