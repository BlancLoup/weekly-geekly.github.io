  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The employer will be responsible for technographers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If an employer issues laptops, handheld computers, mobile phones, or pagers to its employees, then it may have to be responsible for the occurrence of technical dependence on employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although such trials have not yet been, but they are quite possible.  At least, among American lawyers <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx%3Ftype%3DinternetNews%26amp%3Bstoryid%3D2006-08-25T003452Z_01_N24448872_RTRUKOC_0_US-ADDICTS-LAWSUITS.xml">this problem is</a> already being <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx%3Ftype%3DinternetNews%26amp%3Bstoryid%3D2006-08-25T003452Z_01_N24448872_RTRUKOC_0_US-ADDICTS-LAWSUITS.xml">seriously discussed</a> .  The fact is that courts in the United States very often take the side of hired workers in the event of such conflicts with the employer. <br><br>  Professor of Management Gayle Porter from the Rutger University School of Business in New Jersey and her colleagues prepared a scientific paper on this topic.  She believes that techno-tech employees can easily sue their employers, who put them on the tech-dependence needle.  For example, some employers require that an employee is always in touch and can call at any time by mobile phone.  Because of this, of course, the personal life of a person suffers, therefore a person is entitled to claim damages. <br><br>  According to Professor Porter, many people do not notice the decline in the quality of their lives until a certain point, when life becomes unbearable: continuous phone calls, communication on the Internet does not leave a person a moment's rest.  Then a person asks a question: how did I get to such a life, who is to blame for the emergence of technology dependence?  And they find the answer: this is a company-employer.

      Indeed, American companies very often give their employees personal laptops or pagers with BlackBerry feedback that they don‚Äôt part with.  Of course, this increases the efficiency of employees' work, but, as it turned out, it threatens lawsuits for the employer.  The scientific work of Professor Porter and his colleagues will be published in the academic press in the very near future.  It describes cases where technogolics lose control of their own lives and cannot break away from communication channels.  In some respects, technology can have a more devastating effect on a person than, for example, alcoholism. <br><br>  Until now, many employers have preferred not to notice that employees are dependent on technology, and also denied harm to the personal life of staff.  After the appearance of scientific papers that confirm the presence of such harm, the situation may change.  It is likely that the first claims will appear in the very near future.  Perhaps in the future, "technological" employers will be obliged to carry out special preventive procedures to prevent technological dependence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4326/</a></p>
