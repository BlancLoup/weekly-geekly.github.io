      So why do you need one hundred thousand five hundredth post about the same thing?  The question is natural.  I will try to describe life in Germany from a different point of view - a job search programmer, and also present a few numbers. <br><br>  Everything described here is a purely personal point of view and does not claim to be complete, accurate or objective information. <br><br><h4>  Why Germany </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84e/b8c/e0e/84eb8ce0e1977c30425c203ca309adb1.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.stern.de/news2/aktuell/deutschland-fehlen-informatiker-1795673.html">There are</a> <a href="http://www.weltexpress.info/cms/index.php%3Fid%3D6%26tx_ttnews%255Btt_news%255D%3D37237%26cHash%3D8042fc0bf719630e9b4c78d718f2330d">not enough</a> <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/statt-akademiker-deutschland-fehlen-die-facharbeiter/8170110.html">programmers</a> <a href="http://www.stern.de/news2/aktuell/deutschland-fehlen-informatiker-1795673.html">in Germany</a> . <br><br>  In principle, this says little, because programmers are not enough everywhere.  At Habr√©, it was also discussed many times how long this bubble will last and what to do when it bursts. <br><br>  You can endlessly list the positive factors of this particular country, but ultimately everyone decides for himself.  There are enough problems here too, they are just different. <br><br>  Despite the great demand for programmers, it took me almost a month to find a job after university, and I sent out about 20 resumes.  This is due to many factors: poorly compiled ads, from which it is not clear exactly who is looking for, excessive demands and my mistakes in the preparation of a resume.  Even if you are a high-class specialist with experience and knowledge of languages, it may take a long time before you are answered and invited to a telephone or immediately in-person interview. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin </h4><br>  So, you decided to look for a job in Germany.  Where to begin?  You need to decide what to look for, otherwise you can literally drown in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãinformation.  Then compile a resume and biography - Lebenslauf.  Required photo.  Good photo - half smile will be just right.  By the way, almost all of our countrymen are suffering too serious faces. <br><br>  It <a href="http://www.bluecard-eu.de/blaue-karte-eu-deutschland/">does</a> not hurt to look <a href="http://www.bluecard-eu.de/blaue-karte-eu-deutschland/">bluecard-eu.de</a> . <br><br>  Then register on profile sites.  The largest stock exchange in Germany is <a href="http://www.monster.de/">monster.de</a> .  You can also subscribe to the list of suitable offers.  Very famous <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/nhome/%3F_l%3Den_US">linkedin.com</a> is not in great demand here, but just in case you can also search it. <br><br>  Personally, I have the largest number of offers coming from <a href="https://www.xing.com/en">xing.com/en</a> . <br><br>  And now the tips in the style of Captain. <br><br><h4>  Telephone interview </h4><br>  English here is very good for everyone connected with informatics, so it‚Äôs possible to communicate in English, especially in 99% of ads.  Although knowledge of German, even at an average level will be a big plus and will expand the range of potential employers. <br><br><h4>  In-person interview </h4><br>  As they say, the first impression can be made only once.  Therefore, it is important not to be late, the Germans have everything planned out by the minute.  I haven‚Äôt met any tasks about hatches or tricky tests, they like to talk about particular experience in interviews.  A business suit, it seems to me, will be appropriate only in the bank or if it is intended to work with clients. <br><br><h4>  Numbers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae2/aa2/286/ae2aa2286f6c6e5ba3aefcc388845d8c.jpg"><br><br>  Great, where and how to search - more or less clear, but what about the salary?  What number can I specify?  After all, this is the most interesting, let's not be a hypocrite ... hypocrite ... hypocrite ... <br><br>  There is a small hitch.  The topic of wages for the Germans is almost taboo.  I exaggerate of course, but I have the impression that it is easier for a German to ask how often his wife has sex than what his salary is.  Moreover, no one has a thought to talk about it with colleagues. <br><br>  Despite this, the German forums are full of questions like ‚ÄúWhat salary to ask for an interview.‚Äù  And the answers to them differ depending on the land, work experience, basic technology and ... In general, depending on everything. <br><br>  To help us, we are statistics.  There are no secrets here, all information is available online.  I just present it in Russian and in compressed form.  Who knows German, can immediately download a <a href="http://www.stepstone.de/gehaltsreport/">report</a> . <br><br>  The essence of the report is as follows: the StepStone site conducts a survey every year among 40,000 workers, employees and managers of various industries, including IT and related areas. <br><br>  In short, the statistics are not too surprising: in general, salaries are higher in the western part of Germany.  Not the last role is played by education and, of course, work experience.  You can say the fork salaries of IT specialties on average - from 35.000 ‚Ç¨ to 60.000 ‚Ç¨ per year.  Of course, juniors who start working in a small firm as an admin can get ‚Ç¨ 29.000, and seniors with a wealth of experience somewhere in a bank or car industry can earn all ‚Ç¨ 80.000. <br><br><h5>  Taxes </h5><br>  I will not deal with issues of obtaining citizenship.  They are also quite described in the Habr√©. <br><br>  It must be said that in Germany it is customary to indicate the gross wage, that is, the amount from which taxes have not yet been deducted and the net salary after deduction is often much lower, it must be remembered. <br><br>  Income tax in Germany is calculated depending on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">class</a> .  It is often enough to estimate the deductions in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow much you will end up with or use one of the many calculators, <a href="http://www.brutto-netto-rechner.info/gehalt/lohnrechner.php">for example</a> . <br><br>  In addition to income tax, there are other obligatory contributions: to the pension fund, health insurance and so on.  In order to have a little idea what amount will remain after taxes, here are a couple of examples: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Junior Vasya, salary 32.000 ‚Ç¨ / year, 2.667 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  Single, no children, income tax on the first class.  After taxes - 1.725 ‚Ç¨ / month <br>  Married, without children, income tax for the third class.  After taxes - 1.964 ‚Ç¨ / month <br><br>  Programmer Peter, salary 40.000 ‚Ç¨ / year, 3.334 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  Single, no children, income tax on the first class.  After taxes - 2.067 ‚Ç¨ / month <br>  Married, without children, income tax for the third class.  After taxes - 2.335 ‚Ç¨ / month <br><br>  Leading programmer Immanuel, salary 68.000 ‚Ç¨ / year, 5.667 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  Single, no children, income tax on the first class.  After taxes - 3.204 ‚Ç¨ / month <br>  Married, without children, income tax for the third class.  After taxes - 3.708 ‚Ç¨ / month <br><br>  Having children slightly reduces the taxable amount and as a result, the money remains a little more.  By the way, for each child under 25, regardless of the income of the parents, 184 ‚Ç¨ / month is paid. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2e/b10/f43/f2eb10f4333ba13520a7f1a7c329e798.jpg"><br><br>  Of course you can not grasp the immensity.  I deliberately left a lot of information outside the article to focus on the main points.  In addition, I will gladly answer all questions. <br><br>  I hope it turned out not too messy and you can catch useful information from the text. <br>  Good luck to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285576/</a></p>
