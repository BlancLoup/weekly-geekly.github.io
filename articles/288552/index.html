      So he came!  As predicted by the calendar, exactly at midnight from December 31 to January 1, 2007 began its march across the planet.  Naturally, all over the world were summed up, our newspaper was no exception.  However, we summed up our results in the last issue, last year.  Let's read blogs now. <br><br>  <a href="http://a-xuili.livejournal.com/824256.html">The five-minute guide</a> to everything that did not become in 2006, paraphrasically lists all that we do not count in the new year.  For example: "Toponyms that we have lost: Serbia and Montenegro; Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Region; Highbury stadiums (London) and Kirov (St. Petersburg) stadium; Krasny Konoplevod state farm renamed to Preobrazhensky; Ryabkinsky Village was renamed Shapkino and Penkozavod settlement renamed Penkovo; Tbilisskaya street in the city of Tskhinvali (South Ossetia) was renamed Luzhkovskaya. " <br><br>  The sad outcome of the year continues the <a href="http://nicky-santoro.livejournal.com/786533.html">obituary 2006</a> .  Famous people who left us forever.  With photos and brief descriptions.  Slobodan Milosevic, Stanislav Lem, Konstantin Beskov, Aaron Spelling, Andrei Krasko, Syd Barret, Steve Irwin, Alexander Volsky, Andrei Kozlov, Anna Politkovskaya, Milton Friedman, Robert Altman, Philip Noiret, Alexander Litvinenko, Lyubov Polishchuk, Augusto Pinochet, Saparmurat Nzov , James Brown ... <br><br>  For those who like to observe the life of the royals, the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_royalty/158036.html">results of the year</a> will be interesting <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_royalty/158036.html">for the royal families of</a> Europe.  The main event is the celebration of the 80th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain.  Well, for each month of the event. <br><br>  <b>Penalty of the week</b> <br><br>  And you could also call this event "Hastiness of the Year."  I am not going to dispute that Saddam Hussein was a dictator and did many different nasty things in his life.  This person is unpleasant to me as much as, for example, Hitler.  That's just the trial of him and his execution leave some nasty sediment, as in childhood, when I stole money from their parents.  And also this is a video of the execution, which in a few days has already hit the Internet.  What for?  Who needed it?  I fully agree with the text " <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_lord_/755247.html">On the death of Saddam Hussein,</a> " which recalls other similar political processes.  ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs unlikely that a person who is at the center of contradictions in both the Arab and Western worlds could remain untainted. From the point of view of the currently fashionable Eurocentrism, Sadam Hussein was undoubtedly a dictator, tyrant and villain. It is strange that they condemned and executed its not for that. Strange and haste of execution. Everything is strange. And from this the most disgusting. " <br><br>  The video with the execution of Saddam has become megapopular.  I persuaded myself for a long time that it was immoral to be interested in the execution of a human being, but I still downloaded and looked.  And he reaffirmed the idea that the death penalty should be banned throughout the world.  Because in this video the tyrant, the dictator, the killer of many people looks like a hero, and his killers are cowards in masks.  But intimidation - one of the main arguments of the supporters of the death penalty, is not it, Max?  I can not get rid of the feeling that something wrong had happened.  I wonder if a martyr will come out of Hussein?  And I also thought that it was necessary not to expel the participants in the reality show, but to execute them.  For example, to announce in the ‚ÄúHouse-2‚Äù SMS-voting and the type of one who loses is to saw with a chainsaw live.  This is going to be a very high gear, isn't it?  Moreover, since everyone will want to save their favorite television clown via SMS, the channel will earn a lot of money on this vote.  Plus, it will be necessary until the last minutes to keep all participants in the dark - who is now slaughtered.  And close-up show faces.  In another week, the loser in the voting can be brutally raped in a particularly perverted form.  Or a cage with rats on the face, as in "1984".  It seems to me that this is in line with the modern trends of showcracy.  Yes, yes, the world has become completely heartless, and I along with it. <br><br>  <b>Testing week</b> <br><br>  And on Yandex, testing of a <a href="">new blog search has</a> begun.  Four major innovations: <br><br>  * see the full text of the post now on the search results page: by clicking on the plus sign or the ‚Äúall text‚Äù link; <br>  * now avatars (pictures of users) of bloggers can be seen next to each post found; <br>  * here you can see a small picture of the blog service where the blog is located - you can immediately see where you will get by clicking on the link; <br>  * The right side of the page displays blogs and streams, in the title or description of which the search query is found. <br><br>  If testing the search service does not tempt you, then let's test your observation.  In addition, you will learn many new things from the <a href="http://pintrader.livejournal.com/546306.html">gadgets</a> .  As you know, a thimble game develops imagination, observation, analytical skills, and also provides an invaluable experience of dealing with all kinds of scammers on the streets.  This is a test, by the results of which you will determine your level of professional training and knowledge of this old game. <br><br>  <b>Observations of the week</b> <br><br>  It turns out, as one Russian colleague expressed the essence of the European way of work, acquainting with the orders at the place of service: "When the work is done, the Germans barely move. When there is no work, you will find someone who is hell."  The way it is.  And half an hour is enough for a person to begin to understand the subtleties of the system and himself began to behave in exactly the same way, even if he is black without knowledge of German, and his own language is unknown to anyone, and it is not known whether there is any such thing at all.  <a href="http://morky.livejournal.com/155567.html">Colorful description of</a> time-based work in German. <br><br>  It turns out that the Strugatsky books <a href="http://asdm.livejournal.com/35421.html">can be described</a> using a total of three sentences for each book. <br><br>  <a href="http://neivid.livejournal.com/253419.html">It turns out</a> that being a psychologist is not at all difficult.  It can anyone, you too can.  First of all, determine what kind of psychologist you are.  Remember: there is no "just psychologists", a psychologist - he is definitely some kind.  Here is a teacher, he is either a physicist, or a primary school, or he'll fall apart, blinked out.  Everyone has their own subject.  Memorize three types of psychologist: "child", "adult" and "clinical."  Clinical is not one that has an extreme degree of problematic, but one that works to heal.  Childhood - this is understandable, which one, and an ‚Äúadult‚Äù is one that does not love children, but does not know how to heal.  Enough. <br><br>  <a href="http://ylucc.livejournal.com/116193.html">It turns out</a> that in certain circles it is traditionally considered that the destruction of Inca, Aztec and Mayan civilizations was almost a godly deed - for these civilizations made bloody human sacrifices.  At the same time, however, fans of conquistadors miss a number of important points.  If we call things by their proper names, then what happened in Latin America at the end of the 15th - 16th centuries should be characterized as follows: the garbage of one bloodthirsty civilization sailed in search of gold and destroyed another bloodthirsty civilization. <br><br>  <b>Optimism of the week</b> <br><br>  The year has just begun, and I terrorize you with death.  It is not good ... And meanwhile, the season of holidays has begun, of which I will try to occasionally emerge to review the next week of blogs.  Christmas, all Orthodox with the coming!  Ira has a birthday, then her dad, an old new year, a tambourine's birthday, an anniversary for her mother ... I will plunge into household chores, slush instead of winter and new songs.  By the way, will not help to choose a gift? <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007010602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ1, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288552/</a></p>
