      We know about very many startups, but we by definition cannot embrace the immense.  Therefore, we occasionally announce the search for startups on topics of interest to us and our partner investors.  Announcements about the thematic search for startups - RFS or Request For Startups - we publish on <a href="http://facebook.com/glavstart">our Facebook page</a> . <br><br>  So, what kind of startups and why are we looking for strategic investors? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strategic investors are looking for startups that, as a result of a purchase, investment or partnership, would create synergies with an existing investor business.  We work with strategic investors from different market segments. <br><ul><li>  Internet companies </li><li>  companies from related markets that have already begun to actively explore the Internet (mobile operators, telecommunications companies, television channels, media, etc.), </li><li>  offline companies that are only planning their development on the Internet. </li></ul><br>  We help companies formulate their Internet strategies, as well as help them find and find startups able to solve the tasks set by the Internet strategy.  Themes for such startups we publish on <a href="http://facebook.com/glavstart">our Facebook page</a> .  Sometimes we provide lists of similar foreign services for reference.  Understand us correctly, we are not interested in literal clones of these services ‚Äî we only give them as an illustration of our words, so that we understand more clearly what we mean.  We are more interested in the fact that the services you offer have new and unique properties, but they must nevertheless solve the tasks initially set for the projects. <br><br>  So, we will consider that you have realized the topic put in the request, and this topic really interests you and you are able to make it. <br><br>  What should a startup have to interest a strategic investor? <br><ul><li>  <b>This should be a startup.</b>  A startup is people who have gathered in order to make an interesting project for them.  And who are already doing it.  And who will do it, regardless of whether this particular investor gives them money or not. </li><li>  <b>The core of the team.</b>  The core of the team is the carrier of the idea and the people who are competent to implement the key components of this idea. </li><li>  <b>Developments on the project.</b>  The team should already have something ready that can be shown to the investor.  Firstly, to prove that you can not only speak beautifully, but also do it, and, secondly, to demonstrate the level of your competencies.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù does not necessarily mean a running service that brings in money.  This may be just a prototype. </li><li>  <b>The desire to continue working together with the investor.</b>  An investor does not invest in a ‚Äúbare‚Äù product ‚Äî an investor invests in a team that can make a product that already makes a product and that will continue to develop the product even after the investor buys the product.  And the team. </li></ul><br>  Once again I will focus on the important for the investor points: <br><ul><li>  <b>The investor is not looking for a team of outsourcers.</b>  The investor is not interested in people who, at the announced price, are ready to get together for a while, ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù the desired product and hand it over to the investor. </li><li>  <b>An investor needs an idea carrier.</b>  The team must have a person who ‚Äúburns‚Äù with an idea - who constantly thinks about how this idea can and should be developed.  The investor does not need a group, even if it is qualified developers / marketers / sellers, who are able to work only according to the detailed TOR written by the investor. </li><li>  <b>The investor is not interested in the ‚Äúbare‚Äù idea.</b>  If you have an idea, but you cannot program it, cannot promote it and cannot sell it, then the investor does not need you.  You either have to possess one of the key competencies for the project implementation, or you must come to the investor with a ready and motivated team.  The investor is invested not just in the idea, but in the team and the quality of implementation. </li></ul><br>  And the last point: our ads are not offers with ready-made conditions and price.  This is a designation of the fact that the investor is basically interested in projects on this topic, that he is ready to look in more detail at the specific project you presented, that he will carefully study the skill level and ‚Äúcharge‚Äù of the carrier of the team‚Äôs ideas and competencies, and that the decision is positive However, a negative one will take quite a long time (although we know from our history precedents when a positive decision took only a few days). <br><br>  Read the <a href="http://facebook.com/glavstart">tape of our ads</a> , send your projects to idea (at) glavstart.ru.  Who seeks will always find.  This applies equally to us and to you. <br><br>  With investor greetings, <br>  Arkady Moreynis </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111618/</a></p>
