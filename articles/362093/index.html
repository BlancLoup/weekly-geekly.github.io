  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian Steam - why?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It cost me sweat, in half with blood and sin in half, to restore access to the account on Steam [ <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/robotcheloveche/topics/">here is the post</a> ], as it turned out that soon I might not need it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rostelecom announced an ambitious tender for the development of a digital game store with the functionality of a social network: posts, comments, videos, chat rooms and further down the list.  As examples of the implementation is just Steam. <br>  They did not have time to make the All-Russian socially-communal search engine Sputnik (maybe he works in Moscow, but he has almost no information about my native Kazan), about which, it seems, everyone has already managed to forget, because he doesn‚Äôt know anything of the promise, how you set yourself another space purpose - to clone Steam.  The development of this miracle of technology, which will be located at games.rt.ru, allocated as much as 15 million rubles - it seems that a lot, but you will not write Steam on your knee overnight. <br><br>  Of course, the main question is why.  Spread the Russian games?  Then this place is definitely worth noting - I'm sorry, but normal players do not need such junk!  Although Ice Pick Lodge are good guys, and just next year they will release a reissue of the most beautiful Russian game Mor. Utopia - but this is an exception.  Most likely, they are driven by a simple and stupid idea to provide the country with entirely domestic products: they made the iotaphone, some tablets, and Sputnik.  "Your Steam" in this chain of failures looks like a reasonable link. <br><br>  I wonder if they were analyzing the experience of others at all, or were they just fired up with some kind of stupid idea?  because, in fact, many people tried to clone Steam, and almost nothing is known about these many now - they, of course, have their stable user and a half, but they cannot count on anything more.

      We will wait and see what comes of it.  Mobile communications from Rostelecom, for example, in the already mentioned Kazan, as if to say, not rough, very bad.  It would be better to put communication towers for this money more often, so that the phrase ‚ÄúI can hardly hear, I have Rostelecom!‚Äù Was not so generally accepted.  Why do any nonsense?
