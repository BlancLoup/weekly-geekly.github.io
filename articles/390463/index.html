So, what am I talking about?  Yes, everything is simple, there is one village in the depths of Siberia, on the border of the Kemerovo Region and the Altai Territory.  Frosts there are fierce, but people live good there.  In winter, there is not much to do, then snow is removed, but it is not a little snowy, then go to work in the city for 50 km to go. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And here in this village my friends live, sometimes you come to them on Friday, a bath, drifts and a bio-toilet on the street at -40 Celsius.  So I'm not talking about that, but about the fact that they have a coal boiler in the house with coal supply by buckets. <br><br>  Here we sit with Vadim and I ask the question: <br>  - Vadik, how many buckets of coal does your fire-breathing monster consume to heat your 200 square meters of pleasure? <br>  - Well ... somewhere before bedtime I will throw a bucket, in the morning I will throw a bucket in the morning, if necessary during the day, but this is at will or if someone is in the house.

      And it became interesting to me, but <b>how many</b> times <b>should I specifically</b> sink a house, and <b>how</b> specifically to sink, and <b>many different</b> other issues. <br><br>  I started thinking. <br><br><h4>  Creature </h4><br>  Soldering iron in hand, Arduino nano with W5100 on a plate, a few drawings and dependencies.  A beer box for a friend who knows how to write code, a bottle of whiskey for the PCP wizard, and now he has created something that will tell the answers to the questions asked. <br><br>  The future has come: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b3/f41/2ef/7b3f412ef7f54bce8176618ca74e0e45.jpg"><br>  <i>screwing DS18B20</i> <br><br>  Drain all in one, buying a 3G modem, router, and double-sided tape, I began to create the future. <br><br>  Of course, the router had to upgrade, otherwise he stupidly refused to work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e65/9fb/4c5/e659fb4c5210472d8b1fa750d876e5b7.jpg"><br><br>  Having hooked one sensor to the battery in the living room, the second one was there, but in the air and connecting all the wires in a pile, I closed my eyes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/dd0/103/197dd010320d4d97b504cc9d2ff894d2.jpg"><br><br>  Here they are the first words in the world, so say <b>hello world</b> .  This moment was unforgettable. <br><br>  Immediately taking a mobile phone in hand, I went to the cherished link and began to receive the first testimony. <br><br><h4>  Analytics </h4><br>  So, I started getting graphics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61c/886/df7/61c886df71cb4bd19d3d234973959686.jpg"><br><br>  The green line I have marked the temperature of the battery, which creates comfort in the room being watched. <br>  The red line I marked the temperature of the air in the room, the one on the basis of which I can say whether I am cold or not. <br><br>  <i>Mark in picture 1:</i> everything here was just cleaning the stove, and the sun was hot. <br><br>  <i>A mark on a picture 2: the</i> sensor got unstuck from the battery, it was necessary to remount. <br><br>  <i>A mark on a picture 3: an</i> interval of one day, it is visible that the furnace was heated exactly 3 times. <br><br>  <i>Mark in picture 4:</i> this is a dream.  The dream of the temperature that you want to achieve in the heat carrier.  the ideal to which one should strive, but alas, it is impossible to achieve a similar picture on a manual boiler. <br><br>  <i>About <b>4</b></i> <br><br>  A similar device was assembled by another comrade, in his house there is an automatic coal boiler on coal bracket. <br><br>  In this device, everything works stably and without much jumps, and the savings are significant.  Stability can be seen in the following graph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/9a6/a67/83f9a6a6767b4143b53378243ad40056.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  As an epilogue, I want to say that it is necessary to think about how to ensure stable, slow burning of coal in boilers with manual fuel supply. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390463/</a></p>
