This includes speed (transition from dial-up to broadband Internet), size (from huge computers to small wearable devices) and interoperability (through always-on-connectivity applications and social media). <br><br>  In fact, some of them are waiting for almost instant obsolescence - contracts for smartphones with a period of only 24 months seem to be dinosaurs.  Whether the issue is a trend or the impact of species on the future, but technologies are changing - not only in terms of power, but also in nature.

      In 2013, technology became not just a tool, but a standard and a matter of persuasiveness.  Although learning in itself does not require technology, however, developing a curriculum without using technology turns into a kind of exercise: to prove that you can do it, at the expense of losing a significant part of the possibilities.  And it's hard to lose sight of how new it is. <br><br>  Fifteen years ago, today's tenth-graders were born. <br><br>  And google. <br><br>  Today it is difficult to resurrect in the memory of what life was before Google.  Over these 15 years, Google has gone from a tool that helps to understand the jumble of web pages in the Netscape browser, to the ubiquitous digital brand that represents the power of Android smartphones;  stores on its servers not only video, but also entire educational channels;  keeps all your personal communication in the cloud;  Hopped up Skype with its Google+ Hangouts and helps complete search queries with a hell of a variety of collective intelligence.  Oh, Google Street View, virtual museum tours and the most effective way to find any information known to man. <br><br>  After 15 years. <br><br>  What happened to technology in the next 15 years, in its impact on learning, does not fit into the usual causal relationship.  Rather, it is a case when one absorbs the other, while access to information, the transition of ideas into the common heritage and joint creative activity can be natural and completely invisible. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  2014 </h4><br><br>  <b>Mass open online courses (MOOC)</b> are becoming more intelligent and are gradually making adjustments to raw and rough models (ever and somewhere in the past), starting to increase confidence in e-learning (eLearning). <br><br>  Improved <b>blended learning models</b> provide schools that struggle to justify their existence in the light of modern access to information, new tools ‚Äî and new goals. <br><br><h4>  2015 </h4><br><br>  <b>Adaptive computer testing is</b> gradually beginning to crowd out the "one-size-fit-all" assessment of academic excellence. <br><br>  <b>Learning modeling</b> begins to replace direct instructions. <br><br>  <b>Game learning</b> is still occasionally recognized, being used mainly in project training modules and meeting on mobile devices with their limited interactive input capabilities and screen space, which casts doubt on the game learning potential. <br><br>  Applications will continue to supplement textbooks in some districts, <b><a href="http://www.teachthought.com/learning/are-apps-the-new-textbook/">displacing them in others</a></b> . <br><br><h4>  2018 </h4><br><br>  <b>Venture entrepreneurs are launching technologies that promote the development of early literacy</b> .  Launching new government programs that transfer education and literacy development to start-ups, entrepreneurs, application developers, and other private innovators. <br><br>  <b>Digital literacy is</b> beginning to outperform academic in some schools that are on the frontier. <br><br>  Custom- <b>made multimedia content is available</b> , in the sense that private traders create custom-made courses on iTunesU, <a href="http://www.teachthought.com/technology/meet-the-future-of-mobile-learning-on-youtube/">channels on YouTube</a> and content on other platforms, in exact accordance with the needs of students. <br><br>  <b>Improved text measurement tools</b> are emerging that are available, among other features, as a function of a mobile device‚Äôs camera. <br><br>  <b>Open source learning models</b> will grow faster than closed ones, playing the role of a greenhouse for educational innovations. <br><br>  <b>Purely academic standards</b> , such as the Common Core Movement in the United States, will decline.  As educators advance in search of a curriculum based not on content, but on the ability to interact, choose their own direction and learn, the artifacts of the old scientific world focused on institutions will lose their persuasiveness. <br><br>  <b>Visual data will crowd out numerical data</b> , in line with the efforts of schools to bring learning results to disadvantaged families and members of society. <br><br><h4>  2020 </h4><br><br>  <b>Cloud education</b> will be the norm, not the exception.  It will start simply, with improved aggregation of student metrics, more efficient data sharing and greater visibility of the assessment results. <br><br>  <b>Direct collaboration</b> at the people and school level will begin to appear in some districts. <br><br>  Schools <b>act as think tanks</b> where local and global issues such as clean water, broadband access, human trafficking and religious intolerance should be addressed. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.teachthought.com/learning/inside-out-school-21st-century-learning-model/">Schools are beginning to replenish with a variety of forms of education</a></b> , both internal, including entrepreneurial learning, invisible learning, question learning, and open source learning. <br><br>  <b>Training studios with a choice of learning trajectory</b> and other alternative ways of formal education for the family. <br><br><h4>  2024 </h4><br><br>  <b>‚ÄúCulture‚Äù</b> will no longer be ‚Äúintegrated into modules‚Äù, but <b>will be built into social forms of education</b> ;  including themes of poverty, race, language, and other distinctive signs of human existence. <br><br>  The result of <b>online learning</b> through digital media will be students who communicate with partners, mentors, family members and specialists in a collaborative model encompassing society. <br><br>  Learning simulations begin to <b>replace teachers</b> in some eLearning-oriented learning environments. <br><br>  <b>Truly mobile learning</b> will support moving not just from one part of the classroom to another, but from the training studio to the community, both physically and through Google+ or Skype-like technology. <br><br>  <b>Personalized learning algorithms</b> will become the de facto standard in schools that continue to adhere to the traditional academic approach. <br><br>  <b>A daily transition between eLearning and personal presence will be more convenient</b> , but still a problem for many counties and states, especially those with significant budget deficits.  Among other changes, this will create minor ‚Äúmigration ripples‚Äù, as families will move in response to educational disparities. <br><br><h4>  2028 </h4><br><br>  <b><a href="http://hothardware.com/News/PlayStation-4-Dropping-DualShock-Controller-Design-in-Favor-of-Biometric-Sensors-and-Touch-Screen/">Biometrics</a></b> ‚Äî the response in the form of biological reactions such as sweat gland stimulation, pulse, eye position, and other data ‚Äî will provide real-time feedback not only for teachers, but also for commercial organizations for analytics, market research, and <b>consumer interest</b> . <br><br>  Training simulations are starting to <b>replace teachers</b> in some schools. <br><br>  <b>A variety of forms of education</b> are beginning to <b>replace schools</b> , while the old model of ‚Äúcontent-&gt; curriculum-&gt; data-&gt; personalized academic learning‚Äù is brought to perfection. <br><br>  <b>Schools as we know them</b> from now on will no longer be simply supplemented with eLearning technologies, blended learning and learning platforms with a choice of individual trajectories, but <b>bypassed in number by</b> stunning imagination training simulators and entire <b>virtual worlds</b> . <br><br>  The remaining schools, which refuse to adapt to new technologies and cultural trends, <b>will cause a split in some communities</b> , as significant costs of technological integration increase the socioeconomic gap. <br><br>  <b>Microdisplays for reading on the go will</b> provide students with information, response to actions taken and social data in real time. <br><br>  <b>New certificates of achievement and qualities</b> , social, based on the portfolio and chosen at will begin to crowd out certificates issued by institutions, including certificates of higher education. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174897/</a></p>
