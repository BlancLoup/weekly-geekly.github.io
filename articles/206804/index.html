  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Year Gift from PayPal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the eve of the New Year, many companies make gifts to their customers.  PayPal hasn‚Äôt stood aside either - I feel that I‚Äôll see my money only in the new year 2014. <br><br>  It began in early December.  As they say, nothing foreshadowed trouble.  My friend needed some way to transfer money to my wife from abroad, unfortunately she had a PayPal account.  And I, like a naive simpleton, thought: Well, PayPal is already in Russia, withdrawing funds to a bank account for 5-7 business days is fine, it suits you.  On December 6th, the money was transferred (I tied the account to PayPal in advance - checking the account for 3 days), and I initiated the withdrawal of funds to the Sberbank account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae0/e5e/a7f/ae0e5ea7f7ecf0c1c73a3cd07dfee5ef.png" alt="image">

      Well, today is 20, and after the last communication with support, it became clear that by December 27, 50/50 money would either come to the card, or roll back to the PayPal account, and I would have a chance to repeat this adventure again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During this time there were 3 conversations with support: <br><br>  1. The first time, when 7 working days expired and there was no money in the account, the girl said that the withdrawal dates for PayPal were changed, and now they are 7-10 working days (due to the fact that banks are slow in Russia .. .).  Strange, I thought, unilaterally, ugly.  Yes, and nothing has changed on the site (the screenshot above is today's).  Maybe joked ... <br><br>  We are waiting further, but at the end of 10 days the patience ran out.  So, the second call. <br><br>  2. A young man with a teenager hoarseness in his voice said that he sees absolutely the same thing (in the web interface you can only see that money of the 6th is withdrawn and everything is supposedly ‚Äúoperation completed‚Äù) and cannot help anything.  He will transfer the request to another department, he does not deal with this.  - Ok, when are the results?  Will they contact me?  - I do not know! <br><br>  Well, after a couple of hours, I decided to check how they were doing there.  After all, they must have some kind of CRM system, well, there, accounting of applications, etc. <br><br>  3. Another person.  No information about the application ... But a great new introductory.  It turns out on December 6, 7, and 8 there were some technical problems, and the payments were stalled.  Do not worry, many have it ... They promise to sort it out by December 27, and, as I said, the money will either come to the account, or return to hell ... <br><br>  - We apologize to you from Paypal <br>  - Yes, "Paypal" I am your rowing ... ny company!  - I really wanted to answer that ... <br><br>  Eh, they say, the nerve cells are not restored, and also, they say, how to celebrate the New Year, so spend it ... <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : in the comments they say that there are problems when withdrawing not only to Sber, but also to Alfa-Bank, Interkommerts, VTB, Russian Standard, Svyaznoy Bank and Bank of Moscow - so the problems clearly come from PayPal <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : I wrote a complaint about them to the Centabank - see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206804/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> : On the fourth day after the post was published, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/paypal/" class="user_link">PayPal</a> user registered on Habr√©, who sent me the following message: <br><blockquote>  Arthur, good afternoon!  They read your post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206804/">habrahabr.ru/post/206804/</a> on Habr√©.  Could you tell us your PayPal login so that our team can look at your case even more carefully and solve the problem if it is related to the work of PayPal? </blockquote><br>  I gave them my data and the next day at 00:00 Moscow time, the money came to the account, but it turned out to be a coincidence - a PayPal representative did not know the next day that I had already received the money - I promised to sort it out: <i>‚ÄúYour data was sent to the Service support, and the question, we hope, will find a quick solution. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Well, anyway, my question has been resolved, and that is good.  On the other hand, I never received a clear answer from a single person from PayPal to the question what it was, but I was misled several times. <br><br>  The general feeling of communicating with representatives of this company is negative, and I plan to take a closer look at alternative methods of transferring funds. <br><br>  It's sad, because some time ago, I even planned to use them as a payment gateway for an online store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206804/</a></p>
