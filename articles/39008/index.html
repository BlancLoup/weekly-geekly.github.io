  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recover barcode on OMS policy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Background: In our clinic, we installed terminals for self-appointment with all doctors.  Powered by reading the barcode from the Compulsory Medical Insurance policy card. <a name="habracut"></a>  You come to the polyclinic, you spend the OMS policy card on a standard reader - she recognizes you, says "Hello, Vladimir Mikhailovich! To which doctor do you want to enroll?" <br>  Very convenient system ... but as always in our country, not without flaws. <br>  About the fact that the reader does not work the first time and with a very neat and fast wire - I will not say anything. <br>  But I had a noticeably more global problem: My card, made about 10 years ago at the long-dead insurance company (it doesn‚Äôt matter, the new company inherits the obligations of the old one), was <strong>broken!</strong> <habracut>  Just the same in half, breakdown just by barcode.  When I noticed this - I sealed it with scotch tape so that the view was complete, and for a long time I used it in those places where the data from this card is copied manually.  And nobody cared. <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/ryazansky/pic/00002zgb/"><img height="284" width="450" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf4/bb6/0e1/cf4bb60e18721621f402745f22e2d1cb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Naturally, the card reader refused to fire. <br><habracut>  In the terminal, the function "Dial the card number yourself" is not. <br>  In the reception is a Soviet aunt.  Which is happy to stupidly, that she put the terminal, so that all sorts of idiots like me recorded without her participation.  You can‚Äôt register by phone now - you must come and register through the terminal. <br>  Aunt request to write manually performs so reluctantly that it is easier to abandon this idea, unless, of course, itch to stupor.  That is, she has a technical opportunity, of course, but I heard a lot about myself and about my mother. <br><br>  Aunt says "Change to a new one!"  and gives the address and phone number of the company Max-M. <br>  For reference, this address is: <br> <em><br></em>  <em>Moscow, Nizhny Kiselny Lane, 5/23 (10 minutes walk from the metro station Kuznetsky Most)</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Telephone (495) 324-35-21, we could not get through to it.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Mode of operation - daily from 10 to 18, Sunday - day off.</em> <em><br></em> <br><habracut>  All guessed what is happening in this company? <br>  You come, and the first thing you ask is "Where is the piece of paper from this card?" <br>  The correct answer is ‚Äú <strike>Pro ...</strike> Lost eight years ago‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúBad,‚Äù they say, and they are building all kinds of sour mines. <br>  Then rewrite the number of the policy and passport data, check the Moscow residence permit ... <br>  And issue a temporary ID.  Naturally, without a barcode. <br>  Thank God, even though the card is not taken away, "pass when you take a new one." <br>  "And how much time is the card done?" <br>  "Come in three months. It won't be faster. And who allowed you to break it? Now wait!"

      For clarity, we will clarify that the OMS card must be changed whenever there is a change in passport data (for example, a surname). <br>  We will also clarify that without a valid insurance policy - a card corresponding to the passport data, care in medical institutions takes place only on a paid basis.  Yes, except Ambulance. <br><br>  "And what do these three months do?"  I ask a reasonable question.  And I get a reasonable answer - to walk with this one, and you can carry a temporary one with you.  Let me remind you that the terminal only needs a barcode, without it they don‚Äôt write to the doctor. <br><br><habracut>  Well, I thought, things are not being done.  I need to get to the doctor - I need help. <br>  IT specialist or not, in the end?  What am I, stupid machine will not work? <br><br>  So.  To regenerate the barcode, I needed an editor in which you can enter text and clearly establish its position on the sheet. <br>  A little googling, I found a collection of barcode fonts (barcode) and a barcode qualifier, in which I determined by which standard the barcode is printed on the card.  It turned out to be the standard <strong>"Code 39"</strong> . <br>  Further it was required to guess the sizes.  It was experimentally found out that this barcode is typed in a font of 44 points, including numbers written under the barcode, enclosed from two sides in asterisks.  By the way, it does not include the first four digits of the policy number - this is the county code (77) and some other official digits (in my case 00) <br><br>  After that, the task is to print it on self-adhesive paper using a conventional laser printer.  This is the most convenient solution to use, but you can also print on plain paper, if you really want to.  Further excess paper is cut with scissors. <br>  The final result looks like this: <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/ryazansky/pic/00003yg5/"><img height="293" width="450" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e4/f2a/2f4/0e4f2a2f4c561ec944ea6c283b44395d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As a temporary solution for three months will fit perfectly.  Readers work with a bang, even better than the original code. <br><br>  By the way, for this solution it is not necessary to have the card itself - any plastic card is suitable, it just looks much more fake.  So basically, if you know the number of your insurance policy, but the card is broken or lost - this decision can help you.  So far this topic concerns only Muscovites. <br><br>  If you cannot do it yourself, then for a certain moral compensation I can help in this matter.  Just keep in mind right away that I am a law-abiding citizen and I don‚Äôt deal with fakes - for this purpose I need the original document on which the insurance policy number is written. </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39008/</a></p>
