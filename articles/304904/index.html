It was comfortable, cool and technologically.  The year was 2006-2007, maybe later.  Honestly, now I don‚Äôt remember whether it was immediately possible to buy online or after a while, but it was great.  I am sure that now many more people have begun to use online shopping, but the interface has not undergone significant changes since. <br><br>  Today I once again bought a ticket and was surprised at the non-obviousness of some points, especially regarding the price display on the site.  Initially I wanted to write somewhere to my blog, but I realized that I wanted a discussion, opinions of professionals and changes.  And for that you need an audience. <br><br>  Well, if you are interested in discussing Russian Railways, put forward proposals on functions and serve as a source for changes (and after discussion I want to send this article somewhere to Russian Railways), then welcome to the cat!

      NB!  Post discussion rather than informational.  So pretty short. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Short purchase history </h4><br>  Decided to buy a railway ticket in the direction Penza - Moscow.  It seems everything is as usual, the price is shown immediately.  At first glance, everything is fine and works like clockwork. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/830/911/32f/83091132f08748da98e41d9ef69ca90c.png"><br><br>  In the next step, it turns out that we were a little misinformed and the price of tickets may be higher than stated in the first step.  Appeared range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c2/1aa/6ba/2c21aa6bac324c58a19f5b4fb3b04907.png"><br><br>  I think you can not spend!  Well I can go on the top shelf.  There is probably a cheap ticket!  However, the top spot, including the side, stands as the bottom.  Maximum price limit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/02f/316/62002f31695646dc9bec5d1d4e31a394.png"><br><br>  After that, I began to experiment in order to determine the place with the highest discount.  Somehow it turned out to throw 300 rubles. However, up to 1787 rubles it was not possible to get there.  It's good that at least the call center is up to date, called them.  It turned out that the top toilet seat is cheaper by some percent.  Those same 1787 rubles!  Unexpected turn. <br><br>  I thought and thought and bought myself a compartment for a nearby train at a price slightly lower than this upper side shelf.  I will arrive at 5 am, but I will sleep well! <br><br><h4>  What's wrong?  Where could be improvements. </h4><br><ul><li>  In the first step, show at least "from 1787".  So, by the way, does Yandex.  Or even better to show the average price; </li><li>  In the second step, show exactly which places come with a discount.  I am sure that <a href="">this plate</a> could skillfully decorate properly; </li><li>  Make the option "buy the cheapest" or "buy the most comfortable"; </li><li>  Well, my main pain is not relevant to this case.  Why is there still no option to <b>save passengers data</b> ?  For example, the site of Belarusian Railways in Belarus is much worse in appearance, but there it is! </li></ul><br><br>  Have you encountered any difficulties?  How would you see the perfect solution?  What would you suggest to improve in this particular situation? <br><br>  In general, I would be happy for any comments / comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304904/</a></p>
