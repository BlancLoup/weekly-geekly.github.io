  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Symbian perseverance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Symbian Belle FP2 is the final stage of Symbian development for smartphones such as the Nokia 808 PureView, 603, 700 or 701, and Refresh for the E7, N8 and all first-generation smartphones released in 2010 (except Nokia 500).  However, for all Symbian ^ 3 smartphones, updates continue to come out that improve stability and add new features, it makes you wonder why everyone thinks Symbian is so dead, forgotten and abandoned? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/164/74f/d46/16474fd460febe1aed443fa5b208f4f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The active Symbian community is admirable.  Symbian OS began to bury two years ago, but still there are updates for both applications and for the system itself, new programs, new articles on Symbian, such as this one, and even games.  This all indicates that Symbian has not yet died, and this is unlikely to happen soon.  The author of the article, based on which this article is written, compares Symbian with The Rolling Stones, that is, with the classics, and relatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù systems, such as Android and iOS with Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.  They are incredibly popular and meet modern requirements, but did they stand the test of time?  Now Symbian is not quite in the trend and this is not something that is popular among young people, but it still means a lot to a lot of people, this is what they will always ‚Äúlisten to‚Äù, what they love and what they are used to, Symbian for a long time will not forget.  The analogy with the pub is also appropriate, all these new nightclubs are very attractive, but how nice it is to visit some familiar place where the bartender calls you by name, you know where everything is located, you know what is served here, you even have your favorite place here is very comfortable and cozy. <br><br>  So why do we use Symbian now, in June 2013?  Personally, I love the maturity and quality of the system.  Symbian is more than 15 years old and many ‚Äúchips‚Äù that still appear in Android and iOS appeared in Symbian many years ago, for example, such as rejecting an SMS call (announced in iOS 6) or multitasking (iOS 7), which is still has not reached the level of Symbian even with the many times improved iron, which is now available, but was not available during the heyday of Symbian.  Smartphones on this system have a lot of things that are really useful in everyday life, for example, FM transmitter, high-quality camera, real multitasking limited only by the resources of the system over which the user has full control, excellent battery life, file manager (stone in the garden) iOS and Windows Phone), excellent maps, and one of the main advantages - the quality of the assembly and materials, as well as a unique, unique design.

Even those who look at Symbian with disdain cannot but agree with this (although some carefully conceal this).  The quality and excellent work of Nokia can be seen to this day, in their Windows Phone smartphones, in Asha half-smartphones.  If the phone is cheap, it does not mean that it should look like a shapeless and poor-quality something, Nokia is working hard even on budget models. <br>  The specific features of the system itself and the smartphones on it are not the only thing that makes people stay with Symbian.  I can do the same on Symbian as on iOS or Android: receive mail, read and write on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc., upload my photos and videos to Flickr, Molome, Vkontakte, Youtube, I can watch movies and listen music, check in on Foursquare, read news using Pocket, download videos from Youtube and view your news feed, edit photos and apply filters, work out routes, Symbian can be my personal trainer or help stick to a diet, keep me updated on stock prices, lead my to-do list, be my address book, keep my passwords  This list could go on beskonechnosti.Rabochie tables kastomiziruyutsya no worse than on Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d61/6e4/6b8/d616e46b86b7b11d8f2f7010c5353e6e.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/016/2d4/8f2/0162d48f246b981efa4ff9ec41c8b0bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, Symbian will no longer be the most advanced and most popular system, and doing all the actions may be it does not stand the same speed, but a little slower, but I do not need this, I like that it can be a reliable companion in my life, without frills, but with excellent quality, work time and other pleasant things that I really need, unlike heaps of cores, gigabytes of RAM, which almost all is occupied by the system and the non-optimized shell, FullHD display resolution, the benefits of which I will never see, but which is required  t more memory, increased power and subsequently power consumption.  The lifespan of the smartphone has greatly decreased in our time, new models come out almost every day, and the flagships are already every six months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/708/da2/2ff/708da22ffa2073f15f72b09e63b39c85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This article has nothing to do with the fact that Nokia stops supplying smartphones to Symbian and is not ‚Äúnear-death‚Äù, everything is just the opposite, discard all bias and happily use your Symbian smartphone, no one takes it straight from you, don't look at others, those who scream death, like a madman in an alley assuring the soon end of the world or those who say that nothing comes out, this is nonsense.  The modern world is changing, popular performers replace each other, yesterday Spice Girls and Fatboy Slim, today Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, tomorrow Taylor Swift, but the time-tested classic remains. <br><br>  Thank you all for reading, I hope I took your time for nothing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183216/</a></p>
