  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much is the habraburger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When you have a need to write on Habr a post about a burgers recipe contest, an unkind chill runs down your back.  You write, erase, write, erase, leave to drink coffee, and comments flash before your eyes: ‚ÄúWhat does it do on Habr√©?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd what about hosting?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDudes, were you right?‚Äù.  A terrible thing.  But what a cool idea, how do you want to know the food habits of IT people and make a cool collaboration!  So, Friday, December 15, time - an hour before lunch.  Risk.  Click "Publish".  Rating +29 (+31 -2), 13.5 thousand views, 62 comments.  And all this was the beginning of a chain of steep events.  Almost half a year has passed - ready to tell. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/354868/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e9/acc/e04/1e9acce04359e15c98c98c797811be0c.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Well-fed totals</font> </h2><br>  In the post-announcement in the first line, we asked, ‚ÄúDoes the sauce made of milk chocolate and passion fruit suit marble beef?‚Äù.  And then they didn‚Äôt know how prophetic this careless joke would turn out - the chef of Burger Heroes, Peter Rabchevsky, chose bitter chocolate as a sauce for a Habraburger.  We told about the burger in a <a href="https://geektimes.com/article/298207/">special project on Geektimes</a> , in general, the anatomy looks appetizing.  This was exactly the kind of burger bomb weighing 617 kcal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f57/50d/1f0/f5750d1f0e330a28f2b7140872e3cdf7.png">

      The burger cost 330 rubles, 5,200 units were sold, which amounted to almost 2% of the burger burger sales.  1000 burgers coupons were distributed to the last.  The burger was ordered, basically, only those who came directly after him.  In most cases, they came purposefully behind him - obviously users and fans.  Even after the withdrawal from the menu, people wishing to try the Habraburger appear (take this opportunity to repeat once again - alas, it is no longer on the menu). <br><br>  By the way, burgers came to taste and guests of the seminar Geektimes.  More than 150 Habraburgers were presented to customers and partners of RuVDS, as well as to the participants of the Habraburger contest.  Burger Heroes, at the invitation of RuVDS, prepared fresh hot Habraburgers for the participants of the seminar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fb/182/1c3/3fb1821c3780a4112c38c1aa9f9c8e83.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Field kitchen Geek-of-seminar</font></i> <br><br>  Reviews of burgers were mostly positive - both in the special project and offline.  Most often they asked to exclude onions from the train, and some approached the stand and said that Habraburger brought the wildest taste resonance that causes ‚Äúmixed feelings‚Äù (and this we softened the wording as much as possible). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/363/c49/295/363c492950bff54ed988607e700b7c0b.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Those who were at the seminar and at the same time kept on a diet, too, was not offended</font></i> <br><br>  By the way, it's summer, summer cottage, holidays - if you get inspired, you can draw ideas for burgers and sandwiches to the whole company in the comments to the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/344746/">starting post</a> .  There are many tasty and simple. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Smart totals</font> </h2><br>  The guys from Habr often hold training seminars, there was one major conference.  However, the topic of Geektimes there was usually touched upon in passing, in fact, resources were equated.  Meanwhile, Geektimes is a cool original resource with an unusually lively audience, with whom it is pleasant to talk and to debate.  And here the mitap on work with Geektimes has destroyed this universal imbalance.  Of course, it‚Äôs a pity that there were quite a few people at the seminar - believe me, the experience broadcasted there can be useful not only for techno-bloggers, but also for any publishers, copywriters and anyone who tries to sell themselves and their products from the tip of a pen (from the keyboard). . <br><br>  If a seminar record is for sale, but as partners we still allow ourselves to merge a couple of insiders - we hope we will not be banned :) <br><br>  The first speaker was Anton Polyakov, the head of the TM content studio, that is, the very person whose hands and eyes pass a certain part of corporate publications.  He told about successful cases and frank fakapy.  The main conclusion that can be made from his speech: it is not always possible to predict the outcome of the publication - even a brilliant text in your opinion can be a proud bearer of the -50 rating, if you do not feel the audience and strive to sell stupidly.  We agree that there are no trifles in creating a publication in a corporate blog - keep this in mind when working on another article, learn best practices, look back at your competitors.  This will help to create the same content that will make you friends with the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/064/321/0c6/0643210c6bf89b4f78180f5aa9399e8e.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Anton Polyakov and the numbers that can not but inspire.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">4 million users per month on Hiktimes.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">4 million unique, Karl!</font></i> <br><br>  Ekaterina Alyanskaya from Loft PR told about how to choose a topic for publication.  More precisely, her report was declared that way, but in fact the story turned out to be deeper and wider - the listeners received secret knowledge about how to create a publication at the intersection of utility and interesting segments, not forgetting to add the ‚Äúsells‚Äù component - but not commercially, but fascinating sense.  Catherine showed in detail how to understand where the interest is, study the consumption model and determine the uniqueness, that is, actually understand the environment, understand the audience and get close to her.  The report was illustrated with amazing cases of Geltek-Medik and the Clinic of Dr. Shilova. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/88e/532/b5888e532b86b0cec92b9855d5332820.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Hall listened to Ekaterina Alyanskaya and her incredible cases</font></i> <br><br>  The third report was presented by Evgenia Solodkaya, who is responsible for media advertising in Habr√©.  She conducted a retrospective analysis of advertising (not content) on Habr√© and Hicktimes, opened her eyes to banner blindness (it turns out that this is not a phenomenon of recent years, it exists since the appearance of banner advertising), showed how and where the banner should be to be perceived.  Valuable information with a cool presentation, cool cases - the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/353764/">decoding of her speech was</a> already in our blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/693/bed/58c/693bed58ce849971f7e9a98ead28d114.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Evgenia Solodkaya commands the banners</font></i> <br><br>  The author of Habr Vladislav Zaitsev aka <a href="https://habr.com/users/vvzvlad/" class="user_link">vvzvlad</a> , who quite extensively spoke on the extensive topic ‚ÄúHow to write on Geektimes‚Äù, completed the session of reports.  It was the most valuable report, with a bunch of examples, secrets, insiders, tips and one hundred grams of narcissism on the case.  We chose the most proven advice that we have often experienced the hard way.  Write and then do not say that you have not read. <br><br><ul><li>  Show respect to the readers - speak with them in the same language, consider the peculiarity of the site and the interests of the audience.  Then you can count on mutual respect. </li><li>  Be alive - do not tell refined stories, do not use clip-art pictures, do not clean up publications to a state of sterility.  Around life, life and experience should be in your publications. </li><li>  Write often - often enough to be remembered about you, and rarely enough so as not to annoy the audience.  Optimally, write 1-2 regular posts per week and 1 cool post per month. </li><li>  Do not do post greetings a la ‚ÄúHi, Habr!  That we will be interesting.  Subscribe. ‚Äù  Such a start will lead to a fiasco, from which more will need to get out. </li><li>  Do not break the publication into pieces to score the frequency of articles.  It annoys the audience, it spoils the impression, it blurs the meaning of the article. </li><li>  Carefully, stylishly, beautifully arrange the publication - the design decides. </li></ul><br>  This is only a small fraction of the valuable pieces and secrets that Vladislav told. <br>  Well, the cherry on the cake (if you wish, an olive on a burger) was a round table with the participation of the already mentioned Vladislav Zaitsev and two popular figures of Habr: <br><br><ul><li>  Danila Dekhkanov - the founder of the FU2RE agency, an experienced editor and creator who helps blogging on Habr√© and Hiktimes to cool companies. <br></li><li>  Aleksey Shevelyov aka <a href="https://habr.com/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> - author, reviewer, techno-photographer, initiator of the glorious history of the TM content studio, at the moment - head of the user department. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b10/d9d/40a/b10d9d40acdbd390574324b39031ca44.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Alexey, Daniel, Vladislav</font></i> <br><br>  The participants discussed the trolls, which do not need to be fed, comments, pressing issues of blogging, working with the authors, their motivation, etc.  A little later, we will try to lay out the decoding of questions and answers with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e3/749/2ab/8e37492ab3822865edfb3f608936f9d7.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">And the atmosphere was warm, friendly and intellectual.</font></i> <br><br>  The seminar turned out to be useful not only for blogging at Geektimes, but also for maintaining the corporate RuVDS blog in Habr√©.  We learned a lot of new things, for example, we learned how to react to negative comments on articles, which in these cases can and cannot be done.  How to motivate people in the company to write articles, now we are implementing this system in RuVDS.  We hope soon there will be many new and interesting publications in our blog. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Different results</font> </h2><br>  We also distributed over 40 promotional codes for the services of RuVDS and presented the smartphone to a voting leader who was cunning and clever, putting a gadget into the recipe of the technoburger - well, we always knew that the tastes of IT people were sometimes specific and the most difficult iron in the teeth. <br><br>  It was a cool collaboration, wholesome and tasty.  Thanks to all participants and partners.  We hope not the last time! <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354868/</a></p>
