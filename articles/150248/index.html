His responsibility was to view offensive content on all Google sites, including Google Images, Picasa, Orkut, Google search, etc. <br><br>  According to the laws of the United States, the site is obliged within 24 hours to respond to the signal of the presence of child pornography and remove content, as well as send a report to government agencies.  Naturally, none of Google’s managers and programmers wanted to do this, so they decided to hire an employee from outside specifically to verify the complaints.  That is, in fact, specifically for watching child porn and other perversions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/reyhan/tech-confessional-the-googler-who-looks-at-the-wo">an interview with Buzzfeed, a</a> former employee says that he looked through the most unsightly content, such as bestiality, necrophilia, human injury (blood, decapitation, suicide), sheer fetishism (sex with baby diapers), child pornography, and so on.  Every day about 15,000 photos passed through it.

      The guy went to work at Google immediately after college and was happy at first: wonderful working conditions, free food.  He was immediately warned that he would have to deal with "sensitive content."  But he had no idea that he would have to work in strict isolation, without technical and emotional help from Google employees.  He could not even work from home because he was afraid that his girlfriend would see the photos. <br><br>  The story ended badly: in the end, the guy needed the help of a doctor.  A psychologist was sent to him, who showed the guy a series of innocuous photographs and asked him to tell him what he sees (like a modified Rorschach test).  In many ordinary photographs, for example, the father with the child, the employee immediately saw an unattractive meaning. <br><br>  In the end, the doctors advised the guy to leave work and prescribed a course of treatment.  After a year of this unfortunate work, they did not take over the company's staff, he remained on the contract without all the bonuses and privileges that give Google employees.  According to Google’s rules, employees on a contract have the right to work for no more than one year, after which they must leave or move to the company’s staff as regular staff. <br><br>  It is said that a similar story happened to some other employees of the “night shift”, who spent a whole year watching Youtube videos every night from 10:00 pm to 8:00 am, and then they had to quit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150248/</a></p>
