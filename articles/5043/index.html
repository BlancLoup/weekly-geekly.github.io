  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canadian placed an advertisement in the place of his name</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The man who sold his <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/02/02/name-change.html%3Fref%3Drss">name</a> at an online auction, helped out much more than those who sold their <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/24/ebay.life.ap/index.html%3Fsection%3Dcnn_latest">lives</a> .  The 24-year-old Canadian, Scott MacDonald, who until February 2, 2008 will be presented as Free-A-Store-Us-Rex, probably just realized a more tangible idea - the buyer immediately realized that the name of the person was quite suitable for marketing purposes.  As a result, the site Freebeestore.com laid out $ 37,000 for this amazing brand site, calling the Canadian in his own way. <br><br>  In the light of the above amount, it seems that the Australian Nikael Holt, also a 24-year-old, who recently traded his life on eBay, pretty much bargained since he closed the deal for only 7.5 thousand Australian dollars.  But for some reason, Holt tried to get rid of the lot as quickly as possible and even said that he would speed up the sale if someone was willing to pay in cash.  At the same time, his proposal included not only the right to use the name: the Australian promised the buyer acquaintance with his friends and ‚Äúpotential mistresses‚Äù - the girls with whom he had flirted.  In addition, the owner of the life of Holt could work at his work, becoming a driver of fruit.  But all these benefits cost them only about $ 5,900. <br><br>  There is a version according to which the success of Canadians MacDonald helped genes, because other members of his family are also prone to shocking and adventure.  Scott MacDonald is the brother of the famous Kyle MacDonald, who, in his blog, having passed through the chain of intermediate deals, <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/501/">managed to exchange a</a> red paper clip for a house in the Canadian city of Kipling.  It was Kyle who advised the younger Scott to continue the work begun by his acquaintances, Cody Baker, who initially thought to make money by selling the name.

      Baker himself was unable to finish the job, because his mother did not want his son, named after Cody, to suddenly become Oprah Winfrey or - much worse - Mr. Purity in honor of the detergent of the same name.  In addition to this, the leadership of the Marine Corps, in the service of which the guy is, did not allow him to change his personal data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5043/</a></p>
