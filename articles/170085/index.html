  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is who in the cloud IDE market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About two years have passed since the publication <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127567/">of the cloud IDE review</a> .  Did the developers of this time have enough to transfer the IDE online from the category of interesting toys to the category of tools and services actually used in the development?  An unequivocal answer is difficult to give.  The coup is not complete, but the IDE cloud offensive has become even more assertive.  The development of the cloud industry incites teams of innovators to non-standard moves.  By the way, one of the most common misconceptions - cloud IDE - is a regular editor in the browser, stuffed with all sorts of extras and ryushechkami.  Just such projects have no chance to become a full-fledged replacement for offline development environments.  But the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving all the development tools, as well as services for running, testing and deploying applications in the cloud, is very, very tempting.  And if it is also profitable in terms of finances and time?  Then it may be worth considering.  Below are small reviews of the most interesting, in my opinion, cloud IDE: <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Cloud9</b> </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d4/d1e/bed/9d4d1ebed1af35ec8a831bfe3798fa95.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Cloud9 is a bright representative of the cloud IDE.  The US-Dutch team regularly updates its service, adding new editor features, supported languages ‚Äã‚Äãand PaaS.  Cloud9 differs from Codenvy, and not only in design.  However, the design of Cloud9 deserves separate epithets - it is done unusually.  If the menu layout in Codenvy can be called classic, then for the first time having entered Cloud9 you need to get a little comfortable.  Plus it or minus - you decide.

      <b>Registration and creation of projects</b> <br><br>  To register with Cloud9, just enter the desired username (this will be the name of your domain), email (there will come a link to confirm registration) and select a password.  Quick access to a virtual workplace is the main feature of any cloud-based IDE, and Cloud9 is no exception.  Registration took about two minutes.  If you have accounts on GitHub or Bitbucket, then registration becomes even easier. <br><br>  By default, Cloud9 has one demo project with 5 simple apps in HTML, Node.js, PHP, Python and Ruby.  Of course, you can create new projects, download files from local disks, or use Git or Mercurial to work with remote repositories. <br><br>  <b>Supported languages, platforms and PaaS</b> <br><br>  As already mentioned, Cloud9 supports HTML, Node.js, PHP, Python and Ruby.  But the PaaS list is clearly lame.  Having registered with a free account, among the supported PaaSs, only Heroku, Windows Azure Cloud Services and Windows Azure Websites were able to be seen.  The site also claims CloudFoundry support, but this PaaS was available only from the command line.  OpenShift support was noticed, but it turned out that this PaaS is not used as a full-fledged platform for deploying applications, but only as one of the remote repositories. <br><br>  <b>Editor</b> <br><br>  Cloud9 supports basic features such as code autofilling, syntax highlighting, code navigation, code folding, formatting, etc.  The editor interface is also customizable (windows, tabs).  There is an opportunity to customize hot keys. <br><br>  <b>Running and debugging applications</b> <br><br>  Cloud9 would not be a cloud-based IDE if users could not run and ‚Äúdebug‚Äù applications in the cloud.  Just click on the icon with the running person, and the application runs on the local Cloud9 server.  The same goes for running in debug mode.  Thus, developers can ‚Äúbring to mind‚Äù applications before deploying them to PaaS. <br><br>  <b>Version Control System</b> <br><br>  Cloud9 supports Git and Mercurial.  Both version control systems are only available in console mode, however, this is hardly a disadvantage.  Work with remote repositories is supported, which means that you can easily backup the code on GitHub and pull projects into Cloud9. <br><br>  <b>Invitations to projects / joint programming</b> <br><br>  Cloud9 offers the following invitations and scrolls for projects: <br><br>  * invite by email <br>  * share on Twitter <br>  * share on Facebook <br><br>  Of the amenities - a full mode of joint editing projects.  Moreover, collaborators can chat in chat directly in their domains.  By default, guests can only work in read-only mode, however, the domain owner can grant extended rights, of course, if he considers it necessary. <br><br>  <b>Cost of</b> <br><br>  For $ 12 / month, Cloud9 offers 6 private workspaces, full access to the console and terminal, connection to its own virtual machine, unlimited ftp and public workspaces, and an unlimited number of invited users. <br><br>  <b>Overall impression</b> <br><br>  Cloud9 left a very good impression, and no doubt, the project will develop.  Convenient work with files, necessary and important functions of the editor, full co-editing mode ... However, for a second the feeling that Cloud9 is ideal for working with files, but not projects as a whole, did not leave.  However, perhaps this is just a feeling that has nothing to do with reality) <br><br><h4>  <b>Codenvy</b> </h4> <br><br>  Over the past 2 years, the team has changed not only the name (previously the project bore the name Exo IDE).  Having started as a component of the product of the eXo Platform, Codenvy set off on an independent voyage.  About ambitions Codenvy (envy - envy. Eng.) Say no.  The pace of product development speak for themselves - the guys intend to fight for the lion‚Äôs share of the market, which, by the way, is in the making phase.  As they say, who is the first - that and sneakers. <br><br>  By the way, collecting information about Codenvy, managed to find the resource <a href="http://www.codenvy.ru/">codenvy.ru</a> - a simple non-commercial blog of informational and educational orientation.  There is not much content due to the age of the blog, but it is updated with enviable regularity.  So, the interest of the Russian-speaking community is present, and, it is hoped, it will only grow. <br><br>  The developers at Codenvy have provided their IDE brainchild with a dozen new chips covering all sorts of aspects of development: from new PaaSs and code refactoring to multi-user mode and invitations to projects.  Let us dwell on the main ones: <br><br>  <b>Registration and creation of projects</b> <br><br>  If you have a Google account, then registration of a new domain will take no more than 2-3 minutes.  The domain name will be taken with the Google Mail ID.  In case you don‚Äôt want to use a Google account, a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù registration is also available with a choice of the desired domain name.  No downloads, plugins, configurations.  This is all on clean Linux, Windows or Mac OS, under Chrome, Firefox or Safari (IE not supported). <br><br>  The creation of projects takes place under the guidance of a special wizard.  You will not have a chance to choose an unsupported PaaS or enter an invalid project name.  Codenvy offers to use its templates by default, however, nobody canceled the import of own applications.  Cloning repositories with GitHub or BitBucket via a graphical interface is intuitive and does not take much time.  There is also a download of local files and archives with projects. <br><br>  <b>Supported languages ‚Äã‚Äãand PaaS</b> <br><br>  Codenvy currently supports Java, Java Script, PHP, Python, Ruby, HTML, and CSS.  Applications written in these languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AppFog, Cloud Foundry, CloudBees, Google App Engine, Heroku, and OpenShift.  Such a set of technologies and PaaS does not mean that any application can be deployed on any PaaS.  For example, a PHP application can be ‚Äúplugged‚Äù only on OpenShift or AppFog.  Needless to say, the list of available programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand PaaSs is constantly increasing.  By the way, users themselves vote for the <a href="https://cloudide.uservoice.com/forums/183121-general/filters/top">chips</a> that they would like to see. <br><br>  <b>Editor</b> <br><br>  Codenvy was originally honed under Java.  But this does not mean that other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare deprived of the functionality of the editor.  Nevertheless, Java programmers will find a greater number of chips for themselves - code auto-completion, syntax highlighting, error editor with hints for eliminating them, code scheme and code refactoring (currently renaming classes, fields and variables is supported; <i>see the video</i> ). <br><br>  The toolbar and hotkeys are easy to customize, so in just a few minutes it is possible to customize the Codenvy domain for yourself, for example, by placing the most frequently used commands on the main panel. <br><br>  <b>Builds, running and debugging applications</b> <br><br>  Before deploying an application on a selected PaaS, users have the opportunity to build and publish a project, run it on the local Codenvy server, or launch the application in debug mode.  And it's all in the cloud!  Maven is used as a project collector.  For Java applications, a JRebel plugin is available that can update the application right in runtime. <br><br>  <b>Version Control System</b> <br><br>  Codenvy uses Git as a version control system.  Git operations are available from both the GUI and Shell.  Of course, work with remote repositories is provided.  Whether support for SVN or Mercurial is planned is an open question.  Perhaps such support will appear in the future.  However, Git Native is a completely usable option. <br><br>  <b>Invitations to projects / joint programming</b> <br><br>  Codenvy is already working on a full-fledged collaboration mode, which will in some ways resemble co-editing documents in Google Docs.  Users currently working on the file will be indicated by multi-colored cursors, and their edits will also have color differences.  The beta project is already in the testing phase, and its appearance is expected in the near future. <br><br>  From what is already available - inviting users to your virtual workplace (importing Google contacts or an addressing invitation), as well as inviting GitHub collaborators. <br><br>  <b>Cost of</b> <br><br>  At the moment, you can use Codenvy absolutely free.  In the near future, the transition to the GitHub model is planned: public projects - free of charge, private ones - for money.  Tariff packages start at $ 9 / month, but have not yet entered into force. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  We will not argue and reflect on the feasibility of the development of cloud IDE.  Critics and supporters of ‚Äúfly in the cloud‚Äù are enough.  On the other hand, hiding your head in the sand is at least stupid - the online IDE market is developing, and is developing dynamically.  And the fact that there is competition in the market indicates that the usual IDE will continue to progress.  According to experts, by 2015, the cloud industry will bring companies revenues of $ 1.1 trillion and create 14 million jobs worldwide.  Certainly, some part of this market will be occupied by cloud IDE projects.  Well, to everything else, now in the world more and more applications are being created, while the number of people involved in software development is not keeping pace with the growth in the number of applications and web services.  This means that programmers just need to become more productive.  This is what the online IDE projects are aimed at.  The goal of any cloud-based IDE project is to make life easier for a developer or a development team. <br><br>  As a summary, I will give a summary table-comparison Cloud9 and Codenvy.  Sign up, try and speak out! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab0/972/d41/ab0972d411d7a9c75c13061d932bd822.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170085/</a></p>
