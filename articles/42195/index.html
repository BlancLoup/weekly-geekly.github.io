  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently thought about what the future historians will have difficulty writing biographies of our contemporaries.  That storehouse of information that used to be contained in paper letters is now completely dissolved in ICQ.  Therefore, I don‚Äôt say to those who are concerned about their own ‚Äúimage of morality‚Äù in the writings of future biographers (those miserable, insignificant people who are not even sure that their lives will be interesting for biographers and will be the subject of hundreds of studies) in a special folder on the desktop "open after my death." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In this sense, bloggers are easier - there is a search engine cache.  I think that in twenty years access to the data of the beginning of this century will be paid, free access will remain only for the police and scientists.  Fifty years later, when the industrial activity of mankind finally rolls into the asphalt and drown all the traces of past civilizations in concrete, the profession of an archeologist will finally move to the web.  The story will move to the web, and so it will remain there. <br><br>  And when one day a flash in the sun erases data from all the magnetic carriers of the earth, and global electricity outages caused by the overpotential of all the resources of the planet to maintain the Web, destroy the contents of the planet‚Äôs memory, people will instantly be left without computer memory - and suddenly realize that lost everything.  Blown contacts and fuses will stop all the cars in the world (such anachronisms as internal combustion engines will not remain in the happy future), and the ruined contents of the web will deprive humanity of any hope of restoring them.

      Having lost their memory, people will begin to roam the fragments of their civilization.  The entire social add-on - education, culture, social stereotypes that have long and firmly moved from the brain to online - will go along with the network into oblivion.  People will be left alone with each other, armed only with teeth and basic instincts that could not be taken away by any web, because they were registered in a person practically at the DNA level. <br><br>  Only certain sages will keep fragmentary information about their past, which will be told to grandchildren by the light of fires.  And they will find out that people in the past fought with dragons and flew on starships, talked to each other without opening their mouth for thousands of kilometers and saw each other in magical mirrors that they had many lives and lived among us orcs and elves, protoss and zerg. <br><br>  Children will laugh and not believe these tales, but while walking, they will find covered with earth and grass-covered giant structures of a bizarre form - and understand that no one, no winds and lightning, tremors and floods could create this - except for wonderful and powerful creatures from past.  And the old men will condescendingly smile and continue their stories: about a powerful race that lived under the sun and controlled metals, flew under the sky and plunged under the water.  Everything they had, except for obedience - and once the gods were angry with them and unleashed their anger on them, destroying their beautiful world.  On the account of how exactly that world disappeared, the opinions of the elders will diverge - but in the end, they will agree on the fact that he went under the water.  Anyone who has seen a heavy stone sink to the bottom will agree that it was only in this way that a powerful force could disappear - having gone to the bottom under the weight of his own pride. <br><br>  And after several centuries, or even thousands of years, the scientists of the whole world will converge at the seminars for discussion - what is the truth in ancient myths?  Should we look for the land, which, according to some information, was ahead of the existing civilization in development - but suddenly went under the water?  Materials of those conferences will be read all over the world.  Particularly stormy will be the discussion on the Internet ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42195/</a></p>
