I am glad to announce, albeit with some delay, the <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/nomination/">beginning of accepting applications</a> for the technological excellence of <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/">WebHiTech</a> sites, which is being held this year, just to think for the third time. <br><br>  Let me remind you that our competition is aimed at promoting the spread of development practices in the RuNet in a spirit of respect for modern web standards.  Since the moment the competition was organized for the first time, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge.  Web technology has changed markedly.  Today, few people from the web-standardist community will be surprised by the quality layout in accordance with the XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS2.1 specifications - for us it is already in the order of things, although, unfortunately, for the vast majority of sites operating in RuNet even this level is an unreachable bar.  But time is swift, inexorable, and does not wait for those who lag behind.  Web developers, accustomed to create at the forefront of progress, are already experimenting with HTML 5, creating quite viable and self-sufficient projects based on it.  You can already use such "wonders" as web fonts, SVG and Canvas, geolocation, and more.  others <br><br>  Last year, not a single project was submitted for our competition, created using the new structural elements of HTML 5. This year we received such an application in one of the first days of the nomination of works, and we hope that it is not last one.  I am sure that the <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/jury/">jury of the competition</a> will somehow somehow support projects based on ‚Äútechnologies of the future‚Äù.  Of course, the sites that correctly use just modern technologies, the ‚Äútechnologies of the present‚Äù will be appreciated.  So, we are <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/nomination/"><strong>waiting for your applications</strong></a> for the WebHiTech competition according to the 2010 version.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Under Habrakat - a few details for those interested. <br><br>  This year some important changes were made to <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/rules/">the contest rules</a> .  In particular, the principle of evaluation of nominated projects by the jury members has significantly changed.  First, the overly over 100-point system was replaced by a 10-point system.  Secondly, for a number of reasons, we abandoned the calculation of the average score - now the decisive indicator when ranking the nominees in the first round of judging the jury is a simple sum of the scores obtained by a particular project. <br><br>  In order to more clearly understand which level you should focus on when submitting works for the competition, here are the winners of <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/winners/">2008</a> and <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/winners/">2009</a> . <br><br>  Participation in the competition has always been and will be strictly free. <br><br>  Regardless of which decision the selection committee makes - to approve or reject the application submitted - the author of the application will receive an e-mail with a brief review of the announced project, written by one or several participants of the selection committee.  Authors of approved applications such reviews will help make your site better and increase its chances of winning the competition.  Authors of rejected applications review will clearly understand the reasons for the selection committee "wrapped up" the project.  By the way, there are cases when the participation of some projects in the competition was approved by the selection committee from the second or third time, after the site developers have eliminated the gross flaws noted by us. <br><br>  <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/winners/">The awards ceremony for the</a> winners, prize winners and finalists of the WebHiTech competition in 2008 was held in a rather interesting place - a declassified military bunker. <br><br>  The venue for the award ceremony in 2009 was not so original, but we combined the pleasant with the useful - in addition to the award itself, <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/party/">we also had a mini-conference on web standards</a> . <br><br>  I think that in 2010 it will be boring.  The main thing is that we have someone to reward.  And it depends solely on you.  Please do not hesitate and <a href="http://2010.webhitech.ru/nomination/">put forward good technological projects for our competition</a> .  Good luck to you and your projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103702/</a></p>
