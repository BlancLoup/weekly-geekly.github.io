It turned out that we did not know anything at all about women's perfidy and the ability to find at times non-standard use of seemingly familiar gadgets.  Girls clearly know a lot about fashionable devices.  Especially for the pre-holiday Friday, we have selected for you the 10 most interesting love triangles: he, she and the gadget.  Just for fun. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e1/dc4/d49/4e1dc4d49adc4da8ac40e46ad1431865.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">What do women desire?</font> </h2><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúWaking up together.</b></font>  Arrange a sunset or sunrise on demand and near the bed.  This light alarm will help you wake up gently and naturally, start the morning together to the quiet sounds of nature.  It can be fully customized to your tastes, and at a given time the alarm clock will start to become brighter and brighter, gradually changing the light from the muted warm dawn to bright daylight.  The body reacts to a smooth change in illumination, as if the sun was rising behind an open window, and gradually preparing for awakening.  Thanks to this, waking up is much easier and more pleasant. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/svetovoi-pribor-dlya-krasoty-i-zdorovya-philips-svetovoi-budilnik-hf3510-70-20030481">Light alarm clock in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afb/b05/6f2/afbb056f2e034820ad2f474cd59bdcf8.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúListen to music together.</b></font>  It is not convenient to share one pair of headphones for two, so that you can listen to your favorite music together, and with this trick you can connect two pairs of headphones to the same phone and simultaneously listen to the same thing, share not only music, but also emotions.  And you can, leaning towards each other, watch a movie together, for example, from a tablet!  The adapter is pretty cute, and can also be used as a key chain. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/perehodnik-dlya-ipod-iphone-ipad-qumo-razvetvitel-dlya-naushnikov-v-forme-bukvy-y-50042715">Adapter in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/805/e06/43e/805e0643eb8449fabc2682aa2591a633.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>"To look at the stars.</b></font>  It seems to me that all IT professionals dream of distant worlds and space flights.  Observation of the stars is an excellent reason to go at night to the field (outside the city does not interfere with artificial lighting of megacities) and, clinging to the eyepiece of the telescope, observe distant worlds.  Let him show me a star that he will name in honor of me.  They say that even with the most simple and inexpensive telescope, you can see the Moon in detail, Mercury, some parts of Mars, the bands on Jupiter and the Great Red Spot, as well as the rings of Saturn.  Cosmos is literally luring! <br>  And also, if you put a telescope at the window, you can see if someone does not attempt a loved one when he went on an expedition to take out the garbage.  Well, not for nothing that men do not like it so much! ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/teleskop-celestron-powerseeker-50-az-10004680">Telescope in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d6/26a/838/2d626a838c424362aa8623cf214ba336.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúSpoil each other goodies.</b></font>  Under the strict guidance, even the most savage geek will cope with the preparation of homemade ice cream - all you have to do is mix the ingredients together and freeze them in the ice cream maker.  And then you can sprinkle delicacy with fresh fruit or chocolate chips and feed each other with a spoon :) ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/morozhenica-supra-ics-1207-20031537">Ice cream maker in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/b50/b12/988b50b1218e4fcd8c1434399c0d129f.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúSave emotions.</b></font>  Fooling around and wriggling together in front of a camera lens is much more fun than just that.  Especially if you can immediately print a photo and evaluate the result.  Or attach a card to the fridge where it will delight and remind you of happy moments, and after many, many years put it on an album and pass it on to your grandchildren.  Well, the truth is not all stored in Instagram.  At home I have an album with the best photos, this is the connection of generations.  You can also send a photo card to your friends in another city or family during the trip. <br>  The camera is small, works from two finger-size batteries, fits into a pocket and allows you to get warm, lamp-shaped photographs on real photo paper of 62 x 46 mm.  What you need for cute cards! ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-momentalnoi-pechati-fujifilm-instax-mini-8-grape-10007614">Camera instant printing in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85d/f6f/36f/85df6f36f01945f880c969c604afb297.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúTo create coziness.</b></font>  The most banal that you can think of to create a romantic atmosphere - candles.  But they create the right mood flawlessly.  These are the real high-tech candles.  And they are not trivial!  They do not smell, do not melt, do not leave marks, do not smoke, are turned off by timer, even if you forget about them.  And during a romantic dinner you can forget about them. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/elektronnaya-svecha-led-supra-lcn-01-50038030">Candles in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/383/795/7d9/3837957d9ae54875ababd6736b80288d.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúFind the road.</b></font>  I‚Äôll save my address and the place of our first date to the navigator, then he will not get lost on the road and will not turn off the right path, and maybe he will stop explaining his eternal late traffic jams!  And thanks to the pre-installed maps of Europe and Russian cities, you can safely go on a journey wherever your eyes look without fear of getting lost.  Let it be a hint of the upcoming summer journey. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/portativnyi-gps-navigator-prestigio-geovision-5566-10006593">Navigator in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f2/f4c/9a8/2f2f4c9a82844b049e19b3b6907b5e72.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>"Surprise.</b></font>  This is an amazing thing!  I think this gift will be able to surprise and please the most advanced guy.  Turn off the light without getting out of bed and not removing the laptop from the abdomen?  Oh, this is what he needs!  Change the light from spectacular purple to romantic pink?  To make the lighting in the room change with the beat of the playing music or gradually fade away?  The light bulb connects to the phone or tablet and with the help of a special application, you can turn it on or off, adjust its color and program the operation mode.  He will definitely like it.  And if there are several of these, then it is not far to the smart home. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/smart-home-beewi-smart-led-color-bulb-e27-7w-bbl227-bbl227a1-50043807">Smart lamp in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdf/634/658/fdf634658c5f47669be6b270556d9d1b.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>"Be in touch.</b></font>  He always complains that the phone has sat down, that 2% of the battery is left, so he cannot talk with me for a long time and cannot reply to messages, because he is waiting for an important call.  And I'm worried, waiting for him.  Now I‚Äôll be able to charge my phone even if there is no power outlet nearby, so no more excuses can be done. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/vneshnii-akkumulyator-harper-pb-2602-orange-2200-mah-50043071">External battery in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c31/610/d57/c31610d574c342ec86f3f399c90a89af.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#ec2028"><b>‚ÄúTo arrange a race.</b></font>  Remember how men quarrel at Quartet And?  They are all grown children.  And for sure, all the guys like kids love radio-controlled cars.  Let him teach me how to drive a car and we will arrange a race!  Let's make a route in the courtyard on the playground, and let the fans be just random passers-by, but then we can celebrate the victory together! ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemaya-mashina-pilotage-rc16204-tini-monstr-40062535">Truck monster in M.Video</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0aa/c16/576/0aac16576492458ea6018e993ff41a9e.jpg"></div><br>  Our customers obviously coped with the task: they were able to choose excellent gifts, on the one hand they were necessary and useful in life and household, and on the other, they were able to please and give positive emotions.  But girls are girls: even choosing a gift for their second half, they did not forget about their interests and did not cease to plan joint leisure.  Because the best gift is to be together, share hobbies, correspond in the messenger, sitting in the next rooms, fight for the control panel of the machine and busily examine the constellations.  She is the kind of 21st century digital love. </div>
