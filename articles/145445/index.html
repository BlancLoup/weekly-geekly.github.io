      <b>What I need?</b>  Compact and universal device with built-in USB connector, with which I can easily charge my phone, tablet, etc. <br><br>  Consider the model of external batteries, which, in my opinion, deserve attention. <br><br>  Model called " <b>Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation</b> " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/057/b28/634/057b286340822ba73374f31041e3ae1c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This is a development company Mophie, which can charge almost any existing USB-devices, including all versions of the iPhone, iPad and iPod. <br><br>  Apple-certified universal battery is designed using innovative technology that provides ultra-fast charging of all iPhone, iPad and iPod modifications. <br><br>  Powerstation has a 4000 mAh lithium-ion battery, which provides a very high charging speed, can change the current level from 1A to 2.1A, depending on which gadget you charge, provides reliable protection against short circuit, overload and overheating. <br><br>  It has a stylish appearance, ultra-compact design, six LED status indicators. <br><br>  Dimensions: 7.3 x 10.9 x 1.65 cm. <br>  Weight: 289 g <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 80</b> <br><br>  The next model is called " <b>Philips Power2Go</b> " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abe/176/69d/abe17669d132bdd6407f1e01539015da.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The Philips battery pack is a portable power station for recharging all portable electronic devices.

Battery Type: Lithium Polymer <br><br>  Dimensions: 8.1 x 12 x 2.5 cm <br>  Weight: 282 g <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 80</b> <br><br>  The next model in the line of batteries - " <b>Energizer XP4001A</b> " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e08/14d/02d/e0814d02d2a8e506936dd2b20dab6d00.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A new solution for iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab and other tablets, smartphones and digital video cameras. <br>  The key advantage of the Energizer external battery is that it makes mobile device use even more mobile. <br><br>  Patented Powersafe ‚Ñ¢ technology, no disruption concern - charge 2 USD devices at the same time! <br>  Two 5V USB outputs Recharge - up to 500 cycles <br>  Intelligent LED indicator Rubber pads - the device does not slip in your hand <br>  Auto power off when fully charged Compactness - fits in your hand <br>  Certified Data cable for iPad / iPhone, adapter for charging tablets Samsung Galaxy Tab <br><br>  Battery cell: Lithium Polymer, Capacity: 4000 mAh @ 5V <br>  Input voltage: 5V, Max 1500 mA, Output voltage: For tablets - 5V, Max 1500 mA, <br>  For phones - 5V, Max 500 mA, charge time: ~ 4 hours <br><br>  Dimensions: 11.4 x 7.4 x 1.6 cm <br>  Weight: 139 g <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 90</b> <br><br>  The next model in the battery line is ‚Äú <b>Power Bank</b> ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/224/8f3/7ea/2248f37ea60eecbd01c779b8ba9fc94e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On this model there are two standard USB outputs, and one input for Mini-USB / DC-3,5.  The main advantage of two USB-outputs is the ability to simultaneously charge two mobile phones!  That is, for example, you can charge not only your phone, but also help out a friend who can also charge your mobile phone from Power Bank iPad / iPhone along with you. <br><br>  Power Bank is powered by a Li-pol battery.  Included with the UMB are the following adapters: Apple, Sony Ericsson, LG, Samsung-2 pcs., Nokia, Mini-USB, Micro-USB, as well as cable extenders Mini-USB / USB and Mini-USB / DC-3,5 . <br><br>  There is no power supply for recharging the device itself.  UMB can be recharged using a standard USB / Mini-USB cable from a computer or laptop.  Capacity is 5000 mAh. <br><br>  Dimensions: - 11 x 7 x 1.6 cm <br>  Weight: 145 g <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 70</b> <br><br>  The next model in the line of external batteries - " <b>Yoobao YB-642</b> " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/254/4c2/f66/2544c2f66b0283ef932b6cff8689d3b5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Yoobao YB-642 has a stylish design, and the device comes with many interchangeable plugs that you can use as a charger for other mobile devices. <br>  The YB-642 mobile battery connects to a standard power outlet and is equipped with two USB ports for charging mobile devices.  This ultra-portable case contains one of the most powerful portable chargers in its class.  The 11200 mAh Lithium-polymer battery will provide you with uninterrupted battery life for making calls, typing and playing games.  Ideal for everyone: from mobile phones to handheld game consoles. <br><br>  Size: 120 x 75 x 25mm <br>  Weight: 250 g <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 95</b> <br><br>  And, the final model of my review today is " <b>Capdase Power Cruiser Battery Pack</b> " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae6/082/592/ae6082592b09c838affeba8950f1f772.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The huge capacity of 18000 mAh rechargeable battery, which charges and powers up to 3 devices simultaneously (maximum 60W) designed to increase the operating time of your mobile device.  The battery can be used with laptops, tablets, smartphones, multi-media players, game consoles. <br>  The front panel of the battery has an LCD display that displays information about the operation and condition of the device. <br><br>  Automatically changes and controls the output voltage and voltage while charging the laptop <br>  Includes replaceable nozzles for connecting to laptops with voltages of 15-20 V <br>  For use with most laptops, tablets, smartphones, Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod <br><br>  An interesting device in my opinion, but an obvious disadvantage in comparison with previous models is the weight and dimensions and price. <br><br>  USB: 15W, USB 1: DC 5V, 2000 mA, USB 2: DC 5V, 1000 mA, DC 15-20V, 3000 mA (max) <br><br>  Size: 19.3 x 11.5 x 2.8 cm. <br>  Weight: 590 g. <br>  Estimated cost: <b>$ 300</b> <br><br>  Which of the devices is more convenient for you - decide for yourself.  The main thing is that you would not be left without energy at the right moment. <br><br>  This review does not claim to be complete, I just want to help colleagues a little in choosing.  I hope that this information will be useful. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145445/</a></p>
