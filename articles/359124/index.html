  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TOTAL 3 months: Alternative to paid shutdown of advertising in the free Android application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Dear HabraHabra reader!  In this mini-article, I want to tell / show the result of my alternative to a paid outage of advertising in a free Android application.  Anyone who is interested welcome under the cat! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The previous article is available under the link ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/post/349832/">Alternative to paid advertising disconnection in the free Android application</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Small excursion </h3><br>  In my free Arduino 2 Reference, from the very beginning, there was an ad in the form of an AdMob banner below.  Naturally, with a paid option to turn it off forever.  The usual implementation of monetization.  Users reacted differently to this: some responded normally (treated with understanding), some even admitted in reviews that they had already turned off advertising for a fee or turned it off purely to support the project.  And, of course, there were ardent haters!  Oh, these guys just bombed because of the ads.  Therefore, I decided to meet all dissatisfied, and added to the application the ability to turn off advertising for free: watch AdMob video ads, and get as a reward the period of using the application without a banner below.  By the way, I use the voice recorder application, which recently acquired a similar opportunity!  Cool!  Glad someone found my idea helpful! <br><br>  Previous article was written: February 24, 2018. <br>  The function was integrated on February 08, 2018. <br>  Today is May 22, 2018. Below is a screen from the AdMob control panel with a filter by Rewarded Video Ads in my application.

    <h3>  3-month statistics + some color refinements </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/o0/di/muo0dipvvolm17dulgdflshgegu.png"><br>  <b>Statistics for 3 months of using Rewarded Video Ads in the app directory (period: 02/08/2018 - 05.22.2018)</b> <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  The promise fulfilled, the article-report was written.  Now about the statistics and the period of use of this solution. <br><br>  <b><i>I'll start with the period</i></b> .  Yes, this solution was not the most universal.  xD I'm shocked, to be honest !!!  There were people who began to heyt and this.  Retelling one of the comments: ‚ÄúWatch your own video ad!  Decided to cash in, insolent!  1 viewing - 1 hour, 5 views - 1 day.  You want a lot! ‚ÄùAnd the assessment was low.  For such a life I did not prepare!  0_0 <br><br>  Most of the free trip reviews were positive, and it is very nice!  Thanks to everyone who writes reviews!  Especially if these comments to the application are justified and / or have positive words, words of gratitude for the work done! <br><br>  <b>Guys, you're the best!</b> <br><br>  I myself also try to write detailed reviews for applications, and justify my assessment. <br><br>  <b><i>Statistics</i></b>  Yes, statistics for 3 months came not a fountain!  There is nothing to brag about.  Earnings microscopic - ~ $ 16.  But still it is earnings.  I cannot recommend as a new way of monetization, since  especially not earned.  But to recommend as an alternative to paid off advertising in a free application - <b>YES!</b>  <b>This is what you need!</b>  First, it is easy to integrate, plus I described in the previous article everything inside and out.  Look for the link at the beginning.  Secondly, users actually reduce their negativity in the comments.  Those who can not buy advertising off, who do not see the point, because  He will need the application in the next 1-3 days, and then he will delete it, who is just buying a hit.  All these people will receive from you yet a unique opportunity to realize their desire - to get rid of the banner.  Haters simply reduce their speed, because  a template negative to the address of paid disconnection will not apply already - there is a free alternative.  :) <br><br>  It will be great if someone implements my idea in his project, and then he will also describe all the results for us here.  As a result, we all will receive invaluable experience that will allow you to get closer to something more beneficial for users and our applications in our stores. <br><br>  Thank you for taking time for my article!  I wish you all good luck in developing for Arduino and Android.  Use the official applications, treat with understanding the advertising and try not to heyt everything in a row on the network!  The day will come when you have to stand on the other side. <br><br>  Write your questions, comments, suggestions and recommendations.  I will try to give all the answers as soon as possible. <br><br>  All good! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/359124/</a></p>
