We did the second single also on <i>Ubuntu Studio 13.10</i> , so we didn‚Äôt want new adventures.  And they ripened to them only in the fall.  Repent, but <i>KXStudio</i> did not try.  By <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">objective reasons.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  laziness </div></div>  So we are waiting for articles about this distribution from other habouriors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Immediately conclusions </h4><br>  Xubuntu has become more raw and more defaulting, and <i>Ubuntu Studio has</i> become more raw and raw than <i>Xubuntu</i> .  I noticed since I'm sitting on <i>Xubuntu</i> + <i>LXDE</i> .  On my laptop I will put <i>Xubuntu</i> and in it a <i>low-latensy</i> version of the kernel with software and plug-ins. <br><br>  I deliberately catch up with drama in an article for those who are still just going to take this path.  Free software is free software, no one is obliged to you.  Sometimes you have to dig or inconvenience for some time.  For me, however, as it was true, the following remained: "There is no OS for creativity other than <i>Linux</i> , and its prophets are developed by <i>Ardour</i> ."

    <h4>  How it was </h4><br>  Raising the penguins and mixing was done by the person who is on the picture above.  He's a guitar player.  And I write, because the writer and praiser of his exploits.  Therefore, flaws and inaccuracies are not excluded.  Write in lichku. <br><br>  Iron was the same as in the previous article. <br><br>  I am glad that the software, in particular, <i>Ardour is</i> developing.  But there are problems, where do without them? <br><br>  <b>With this we have already met</b> <br>  Bought fresh <i>Ardour 3</i> did not open old projects.  They found a solution using the scientific method: they opened it in <i>Ardour 3</i> from the <i>Ubuntu</i> repository.  He deleted, as he likes, several sound files from the project.  He sometimes does it without such an elegant reason, by the way.  The project broke only once.  From time to time falls, so save more often. <br><br>  <b>Detective Story: Gray Cardinal Plugin</b> <br>  <i>Calf</i> plugins have created a union.  They did not want to work when they were used more than 5 pieces at a time.  And this was the backbone of our proletariat.  But the skeleton did not care, they had humanism and <pre><code class="bash hljs">Error <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">in</span></span> `/opt/Ardour-3.5.380-dbg/bin/ardour-3.5.380<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">': corrupted double-linked list: 0x00007f570800e590</span></span></code> </pre>  So the process got up. <br><br>  They began to look for a secret plug-in leader and mastermind.  The first suspicion fell on the <i>FFT</i> library ( <a href="https://community.ardour.org/node/8271">discussion on the <i>Ardour</i> forum</a> , <a href="https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3/issues/16">discussion on <i>GitHub</i></a> ).  It was caused by a bunch of plugins, there were obviously bugs in it and the authors were not going to do anything.  They waited for the update Ardor with a crutch, which solves the problem with <i>FFT</i> .  But <i>Calf</i> continued to strike. <br><br>  The method of scientific spear and tambourine did not help.  It remains only two means - put back Ubuntu Studio 13.10 and prayer.  We started with the second one, and the main developer, <i>Ardour</i> <i>Paul,</i> <a href="https://community.ardour.org/node/8468">heard it</a> .  He wrote that the problem is in <i>Calf</i> from the repository in <i>Ubuntu</i> .  And if you install a fresh version, the trade union will no longer be disgraceful.  We installed the branch <i>Calf experimental</i> , at the same time <i>TAP-</i> plugin updated just in case.  True, in fact, this was not enough, and I had to <s>shoot to</s> remove the old set of these plug-ins.  Then move the new <i>Calf</i> to the correct folder. <br><br>  <b>I'm too good to export your pathetic pseudo-music attempts!</b> <br>  Yes, one of the <i>Ardour</i> projects refused to export to an audio file.  Like, <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">Exported ended unexpectedly: Exception thrown by AudioGrapher::SilenceTrimmer: process() after reaching end of input 28.10.14 Export ended unexpectedly: Exception thrown by AudioGrapher::SilenceTrimmer&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">float</span></span>&gt;: process() after reacing end of input</code> </pre><br>  <i>Debug</i> pointed to the server <i>Jack</i> .  Before my eyes there were thousands of mistakes and grasping for the head / heart / tambourine.  "Let's put the 13.10 back."  And the solution was simple - do not put the playback and rewind exactly at the beginning.  Apparently, somewhere a division by zero arose. <br><br>  <b>Developed know better</b> <br>  One of the <i>ladspa plug-</i> ins has changed the logic of work and now our bass sounds different.  So presets are good, but not forever.  Play the old sound to a tee and could not.  I myself have heard about this before, but I personally encountered it for the first time. <br><br>  <b>Cover in <i>gimp</i></b> <br>  Professional designer turned out to attract only the first cover, so they did it themselves.  But the feeling that not enough tools, and did not appear.  Not enough skill. <br><br>  <b>In parallel with this</b> <br>  We performed on the Novosibirsk <i>SFD-afterparty</i> with <i>Ardour</i> on a laptop.  Through it went a project with a rhythm section, as well as a synthesizer.  One time, <i>Ardour</i> fell when trying to start a project.  I had to talk to the audience while it was restarted.  We decided not to act like that again. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The third single we made.  I don‚Äôt see a link to it.  Unless if strongly will demand.  It sounds better, but not drastically compared to the past.  I didn‚Äôt finish singing, the microphone is still the same Behringer for 500 rubles, and <i>Rinon</i> got me monitors only a few days after the release. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">by the way</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  he immediately listened to our notes on them and was sad.  Said it will be better next time <br></div></div><br>  Instead, add <i>just for lulz</i> video content: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">he is here</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here is the first part of the <i>Ardor</i> Guitar <i>Guide</i> from the sound engineer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GhP8OX3uw3k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhisXq1TODT1uTKWV9MKjRX98QO_NQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A bit of chronicle records and information.

We are also preparing screencasts on <i>Ardour</i> and <i>Hydrogen</i> .
