How is the transfer of contacts in the modern world? <br>  The most common way is to read the numbers of your number to your interlocutor.  The latter enters the information in a paper archive or in the phone.  In pieces of paper there is a big minus - weak cataloging and inconveniently implemented search.  With the phone is easier, but still this time.  It is necessary to get the phone out of your pocket, purse, backpack (or where do you still have mobile phones?), Unlock and only then panic dial tsiferki.  And in a hurry fingers do not obey and poke anywhere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine the situation: you are a cool employee in a reputable company.  From the morning you go to work in a minibus (you work only half a year and have not earned a car yet) and in the crowd recognize a classmate with whom you sat at the same desk.  By the way, you have not seen each other for a long time, and you haven‚Äôt seen each other better since prom.  You learn from each other how are you, everything turns out to be cool, you start talking about your cool work.  You start talking so much that you almost miss your stop.  You need to run out, but you don‚Äôt want to leave for several years again, you need to take at least a number ... You panickedly touch your palms in your pockets to find a mobile phone and so on.  Familiar? <br>  Exit - business cards.  With us (the inhabitants of the post-Soviet space) they are just beginning to gain popularity in everyday life.  I do not mean corporate business cards, but ordinary ones, with the full name of the contact number and email.  True, in the previous story you would have dreamed of a personal business card that you can just get and give away? <br><br> <a href=""><img title="02" src="http://lyapota.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/vizitki_old.gif" width="479" height="206"></a> <br>  While the culture of business cards gets to us (in a couple of years), I will tell you about minus business cards.  In fact, a business card is an ordinary part of a paper archive.  As in the first example.  It is inconvenient to store business cards, these are not bytes of information, but kilograms of muculature in perspective.  Exit - business cards must be digitized.  You can scan, for example.  So they will not occupy a place, but there will be problems with searching for information.  There are special utilities with which you can read the text of a business card, simultaneously converting it into digital format.  For a computer, such programs are sufficient, and they recognize both English and Russian text.  But the procedure is not easy: save the business card itself, scan, recognize and save information.  For mobile devices, text recognition utilities are also sufficient, but the support of the Russian alphabet is still a shortage.  And again there is a solution! <br>  Attention, visit the future!  In 1994, the Japanese company ‚ÄúDenso-Wave‚Äù invented and developed a matrix code (two-dimensional barcode) - a QR code. <br><br><img title="03" src="http://lyapota.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/11.png" width="491" height="445"><br>  QR abbreviation derived from English.  ‚ÄúQuick response‚Äù, which translates as ‚Äúquick response‚Äù.  And the explanation ‚Äúfor people‚Äù: a QR code is a square, inside which there are many small squares, located, at first glance, in an arbitrary sequence.  Such a blot of the future can contain a lot of information, including all contact information about your person.  Warmer?  Placing such a box on your business card will make it much easier to save information for anyone who receives a business card.  The recipient just needs to point the mobile camera on a two-dimensional code and all the information will be in his phone and you can immediately save it to your contacts. <br>  It is hard for me to imagine a mobile operating system on which an application for reading two-dimensional barakods has not been released.  Hard - because there is no such platform.  Even dialers can do it.  The only limitation is the camera.  She must be.  Just to be, even an afto-focus is not obligatory, although it is welcomed. <br>  There are enough services for creating QR codes too.  Here is one of them - <a href="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/">http://qrcode.kaywa.com/</a> .  Simply enter the necessary information in the field and click "Generate!". <br><img title="04" src="http://lyapota.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/1.png" width="536" height="263"><br>  The resulting code can be saved as an image, and then placed on the layout of business cards.  There is also a mobile device application available for download.  Everything, life has become a little easier! <br><img title="qr" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84e/1fd/179/84e1fd179760b317d8c6d8b7b57af363.png" width="540" height="288">

      <em>Currently, the QR code is widely distributed in Asian countries (especially in Japan), gradually developing in Europe and North America.</em>  <em>He received the greatest recognition among mobile users - having installed a recognizer program, a subscriber can instantly enter text information into his phone, add contacts to his address book, follow web links, send SMS messages, etc.</em> <br><br><br><br>  <em>In Japan, such codes are applied to almost all products sold in stores, they are placed in advertising booklets and reference books.</em>  <em>With the help of a QR code they even organize various contests and role-playing games.</em>  ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">from wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  Believe me, it would be easier for us to live if everyone enjoyed the benefits of modern technology. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109757/</a></p>
