  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High-tech office clothes made of nanomaterials</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Space technology comes to the office and everyday life.  Soon no one will be surprised by waterproof shirts and trousers made from nanomaterials.  For example, Coca-Cola can be safely poured directly into a breast pocket, and drink it from a straw tube during the day (see video). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fashion designers are ready for a new fashion for high-tech materials.  Shirts, ties and trousers created using nanotechnology may at first become popular among geeks, and then completely seize the office clothing market, which in the US alone is $ 10 billion a year.  New models have already gone into production at leading brands, including Hugo Boss, Ren√© Lezard, Brooks Brothers, LL Bean and Marks &amp; Spencer.  High fashion and high technology have never been so close to each other as they are now, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/innovate/content/feb2007/id20070205_680191.htm">BusinessWeek writes</a> . <br><br>  The designers of LL Bean or Marks &amp; Spencer create only a style of clothing, and they buy a specially crafted fabric for sewing from <a href="http://www.nano-tex.com/">Nano-Tex</a> .  This Californian startup specializes in the manufacture of materials on nanotechnology.  Previously, their materials are mainly used in sports equipment, work clothes and military clothes.  Now nanotechnology come to the office. <br><br>  Shirts created from Nano-Tex fabric look and feel on the body as usual cotton or silk (depending on the material), but they are completely waterproof, that is, water flows down over them, like an umbrella ( <a href="">video</a> ).  Unlike conventional materials, it does not magnetize ( <a href="">video</a> ) and does not attract small specks to itself, so it always remains completely clean.  Other videos can be viewed in <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/02/0206_techfashion/index_01.htm">the BusinessWeek Gallery</a> .  For example, a journalist pours cola into his pocket and drinks from a straw ( <a href="">video</a> ), and here coffee quietly flows down his trousers, leaving no traces ( <a href="">video</a> ).  These pants model Hugo Boss Orange Label cost only $ 125.

For example, Brooks Brothers models are priced from $ 60 to $ 70.  Eddie Bauer shirts captured on video cost about the same. <br><br>  Opinion polls show that modern buyers are happy to buy clothes from high tech materials.  For example, according to the research firm NPD Group, last year 58% of Americans and 33% of Americans bought clothes using dust-proof materials.  Approximately one in four bought models with waterproof fabric, and 37% - with protection from dirt.  Previously used special coatings for fabrics that have worn out over time.  Nanotechnology allows you to change the properties of the entire fabric as a whole, so that these properties remain forever. <br><br>  In the United States last year, men's clothing was sold for $ 55 billion, of which $ 8.8 billion is clothing with certain technological improvements, that is, 16%.  This percentage is twice as large as in 2000. Among women's clothing (market $ 105 billion), the technological share is much less - only 2%.  According to analysts, this figure could dramatically increase over five years.  By 2010, high tech will capture approximately 50% of the men's clothing market, and by 2012-2013, half of the female market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/2996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/2996/</a></p>
