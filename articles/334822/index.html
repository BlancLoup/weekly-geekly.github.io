In this article we will talk about the organization of a multi-level multi-channel support system using <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabranabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_6%26utm_content%3D1">Deskun</a> .  As an example, consider the support service of one of our clients.  The client‚Äôs company name has been changed so that it is not considered as an advertisement. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/14f/ada/db0/14fadadb05954f7aac8af6cf6c91fc27.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Description of the problem <br><br></h3>  Hosting provider CoolXost is a service that provides services to Russian and foreign companies.  Calls to technical support are received via the feedback form on the website or by sending a letter to the support box (support@coolxost.com), after which they are sent to the general corporate mail of the company.  The main problem is a large flow of letters that is not structured in any way.  All messages are accumulated in the main mail account of the company in G Suite, where there is no possibility to appoint a person responsible for solving the problem, set a priority and track the progress of its solution.  All service questions are answered from a common box by service developers, which, firstly, negatively affects their productivity, and, secondly, it strongly influences customer satisfaction. <br>  The secondary problem is that no one keeps a separate record of the wishes and requests of users for improving the functionality of the service. <br><br><h3>  Deskun implementation

    </h3>  The CoolXost management has set the task: to implement the application processing system and expand the support staff.  As a helpdesk-solution Deskun service was chosen.  The main reasons for the choice are integration with Gmail, a very low price compared to peers and the ability to connect several communication channels at once, processing all applications in a single place. <br>  The following channels were connected to support CoolXost users: <br><br><ul><li>  Email </li><li>  Online chat on site </li><li>  Facebook, Vk.com and Telegram (Telegram bot was separately created for the last channel) </li></ul><br>  Two channels of tasks were also created: to take into account proposals for improving the service and to set tasks for developers.  These channels are not directly related to customer support, but play an important role in improving customer service. <br>  The resulting support structure is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e11/063/b3a/e11063b3aa42429c9819d57338e1afae.png"><br><br>  <b>On the 1st support line, the</b> specialists process applications that go to the online chat, connected instant messengers or mail, and also manually create tickets in the channel to account for the offers.  On the first line CoolXost hired and trained special staff.  Christina and Lisa are sociable girls with the skills of touch typing, knowledge of Russian and English languages, as well as impeccable literacy;  know the basics of the functioning of the hosting provider. <br>  <b>On the 2nd line of support</b> are working technicians who also have access to general mail.  These employees have already worked for CoolXost applications and have a high level of technical literacy.  Staff of the second line is processing the tasks that Christine and Lisa could not cope with. <br><br><h3>  The scheme of the support service <br><br></h3>  <b>Mail handling.</b>  When a new appeal arrives at the post office, first-line support specialists carefully study it, and if the answer to the question is within their competence, then they answer the client independently and close the application.  The maximum allowed response time set by the CoolXost manual is 1 hour.  If the question requires the intervention of technical specialists from the second line, then the agents of the first line give them a ticket, if necessary, change the priority and leave a note.  The second line agent sees the notification, solves the problem, and sends a ticket back to one of the agents on the first line, which sends the response to the client. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/871/0ac/27f/8710ac27f939490d8f36836a12275dea.png"><br><br>  <b>Dialogues in chat and messengers.</b>  The chat chat script is in many ways similar to mail order processing.  The girls from the first line of support immediately react to new dialogues, and if the problem can be solved right now without the intervention of the second line, the dialogue closes successfully.  The maximum allowed reaction time to a new dialogue is 2 minutes.  If the problem was not solved immediately, or it takes more time to solve it, the agents of the first line create a ticket from the selected dialogue messages in the email channel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f4d/024/5fd/f4d0245fd64146b28c0fa51148caf2bc.png"><br><br>  Also, the created task channel ‚Äú <b>Wishes and Suggestions</b> ‚Äù is being actively used.  CoolXost customers often ask about missing features and share their ideas on improving the service.  Based on reasonable and adequate offers, tickets are created in this channel.  As a rule, these tickets are created by agents of the first support line, and then, if there is free time, the developers take on their implementation.  To do this, they transfer the ticket to their task channel, set the deadline and priority.  After the successful implementation of the new function, the developer transfers the ticket back to the ‚ÄúWishes and Suggestions‚Äù channel, and one of the agents of the first line sends a letter to the client that his request has been completed. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion <br><br></h3>  We have shown only one of the possible scenarios of multi-channel customer support. <br>  So, in order to organize high-quality customer support, it is not enough to introduce new software.  A thoughtful support structure with competent and qualified specialists is needed.  In this case, a big advantage was that the leadership of CoolXost realized the need for such specialists, did not spare funds for their involvement and training. <br>  Thanks to the implementation of the <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabranabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_6%26utm_content%3D2">Deskun</a> service, CoolXost solved the primary problem - a large flow of incoming calls was structured.  In connection with the creation of the first line of support, it was possible to improve the quality of customer service.  Moreover, it freed the second-line specialists from unnecessary actions, allowing them to devote more time to developing and improving the service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334822/</a></p>
