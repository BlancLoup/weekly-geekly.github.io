  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three laws on data protection in Evernote [update]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our work there are several basic principles that are especially important for us, which we uphold and which play a decisive role in almost all decisions we make.  In 2011, we outlined them in the form of three data protection laws. <br><br><ol><li>  Your data <em>belong only to you</em> </li><li>  Your data is <em>private</em> </li><li>  Your data is <em>portable</em> </li></ol><br>  Over the past years, we have noticed positive developments in our industry towards greater transparency in the use of data, intentions and business models.  We want to stand in the forefront of this movement, so we decided that the time had come to update our three laws. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Your data belong only to you </h3><br>  We do not own your data.  Placing notes or other content in Evernote does not change their owner or legal status.  If the data originally belonged to you, they remain yours and after downloading to Evernote.  Of course, if the data did not belong to you from the very beginning, adding them to Evernote will not make them yours.  This applies to all our products and services. <br><br>  Using our products, you give Evernote permission to perform certain actions with the data you downloaded, for which you use our service.  For example, you give us permission to back them up, send them over the network, index them for searching, show them on your devices, etc. Some of these operations may require that your data be transferred to our partners, such as a telecom operator, so that we can service work.  Before we do this, we always make sure that our contracts with partners protect your property rights. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      You retain all rights to your data, except for the cases described above, when you give us permission to perform certain operations to ensure the operation of the Evernote service. <br><br><h3>  2. Your data is private </h3><br>  <strong>All information you post to Evernote is private by default.</strong>  We do not specialize in ‚Äúbig data‚Äù and are not trying to make money from your information.  Our systems automatically analyze your data to ensure that Evernote functions work, such as searching and displaying similar notes, as well as to bring you information about important features and products that we think can make your work better with Evernote.  We never share or sell your data to third parties for promotional purposes. <br><br>  Our business model is old-fashioned: we only make money if you decide to pay for our great product.  This means that trust is our main asset, and maintaining the confidentiality of your data is a fundamental principle of our work. <br><br>  Evernote has features that allow you to post some notes and share them with others, but this is a custom option and only you decide whether to use it or not.  If you decide to link your Evernote account with one of our multiple partner applications, then you may need to share your data with the partner.  We will explicitly notify you of what access rights your partner‚Äôs application receives from your partner‚Äôs application, and you can stop this access at any time. <br><br>  In addition, we take numerous precautions to protect your data from accidental loss or theft.  Everything you place on Evernote is synchronized and stored in our secure data center with many backup servers, storage devices and off-site backup systems.  The data transferred between Evernote clients and our servers (and various data centers) is encrypted.  We offer industry-leading security technologies, such as two-factor authentication for all users, and are constantly looking for ways to improve data protection.  We take all measures to protect your password, and no one in Evernote will ever ask you for it. <br><br>  We support the industry‚Äôs efforts to promote full transparency with regard to data requests from government agencies, and organized a comprehensive legal processing of such requests.  You will find more detailed information in our <a href="https://evernote.com/intl/ru/legal/transparency/">‚ÄúInformation Transparency Report‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h3>  3. Your data is portable </h3><br>  Despite the fact that millions of people store important information for them in Evernote, we still strive to ensure that data can be easily and quickly retrieved from the service.  <strong>Evernote does not block hosted data.</strong>  We give you the opportunity at any time to retrieve data from Evernote as easily and conveniently as you would put it there.  Our computer applications allow you to export all your notes and their contents in human-readable HTML format, as well as in a fully documented machine-readable XML format.  We also have a fully open API that gives you access to all your data. <br><br>  Our approach is based on the statement that if you are sure that you can leave Evernote, then we will always try and create great products so that you stay.  And we hope that you will stay for years and decades.  To achieve this, we aim to invest in technologies that can make your data more accessible in the distant future. <br><br>  This post is not a legal document, with its help we wanted to describe in simple language the main values ‚Äã‚Äãof our business and our approach to your data.  To keep up with the times, we will periodically update this document, but the basic principles will remain the same: your data belongs only to you, your data is private and your data is portable.  Following these principles, we want to create a startup for a hundred years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225343/</a></p>
