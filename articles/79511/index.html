Consider that this is a curtsey in the direction of the famous phrase "all the nonsense in the world happens with a serious facial expression" <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be too serious at work,‚Äù advises <a href="http://blog.startupprofessionals.com/2009/12/dont-take-yourself-too-seriously-at.html%3F0.5846782764419913">Martin Zvilling</a> , an entrepreneur and consultant to a number of start-up projects. <br><br>  If you are joking at work and have a good time, then, as noted, you generate more original ideas.  British scientists have not yet proved this, but you are unlikely to find successful projects made by pessimists or gloomy people.  And in general, the decadent mood is absolutely not combined with innovations and bold decisions in business.  Can you imagine a start-up pessimist?

      Even not the most self-confident leaders, if they have a sense of self-irony, can create an environment around themselves where they will not be taken too formally and seriously, but, on the contrary, will try to take risks, create and maintain many ideas. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And here are a few reasons why laughter and fun at work lead to creative success and fresh ideas. <br><br>  1. You avoid formalism.  Laughter removes any formality, standards, prohibitions.  Under the pressure of prohibitions and standards, people subconsciously feel constrained and squeezed.  That is what they mean, urging them to think outside the box, that is, without external squeezing and frames.  And original ideas are more about our psychology than intelligence. <br><br>  2. You are ready to make mistakes.  Serious people are very afraid to make a mistake, and, accordingly, they try not to risk it.  And if you are ready to laugh at any slip you make, and even share this joke with the others, it means that you are more open to innovations.  So instead of treating mistakes as failures, take them as an experience ‚Äî useful and fun. <br><br>  3. You are always in a positive mood.  If you are overwhelmed with a bunch of problems, you are stuck on some business and everything around is annoying, then any new idea will pass unnoticed.  Have fun to cheer yourself up.  Then you can return to work in a different mood, with a willingness to apply some new approach to solving the problem. <br><br>  4. You raise the mood of the whole team.  In the team, participants are fed from each other.  And a person who constantly complains or complains about something can pull the whole team down with him.  But the merry fellow can easily set up his colleagues for more productive and vigorous activity.  This, in turn, will help reject all pessimism and explore the possibilities and prospects of new proposals. <br><br>  5. You will be welcome!  Successful people surround themselves with those whom they respect and with whom they are interested to communicate.  And they do not have the time and desire to be wasted on whiners and pessimists.  So gloomy people are simply less likely to interest anyone with their ideas.  While with a cheerful, sociable and open person it is more pleasant to communicate, interact, conduct business.  A person with a good sense of humor can give everything positively and captivatingly, so they will listen more attentively.  In general, the chances, as you understand, of such people in all respects are greater. <br><br>  Do you know those who do not like to joke and consider laughter a hindrance to business?  Well, we wish them good luck in their dull pastime ... After all, in fact, work should bring joy and positive, otherwise you will not want to spend a third of your life on it, or even more.  The enthusiasm and fun are directly related to creativity, innovation, play, experimentation, progress ... and how all these things are embodied in real life.  And the most advanced and original personalities do not consider laughter a hindrance to work. <br><br>  So learn (or continue) to laugh at work and feel free to do so!  After all, if something caused laughter, it means it caused someone's focused attention and a regular reaction. <br><br>  If you do not behave too seriously and learn to treat yourself with irony, then the work will bring more pleasure, and your innovative vein will appear more clearly. <br><br>  In fact, this article translated more for itself, since I was once again convinced one of these days: without the principle of just for fun and normal human relations, no business will succeed and you can simply turn into a robot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79511/</a></p>
