  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Than the startup is terrible</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An excessive passion for startups in our country is, in my opinion, a rather unhealthy thing, but this can only be understood once having survived this passion.  The problem here is not in the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa fast-growing business, which seems to me to be very interesting, but in its hopeless perversity in the mass consciousness. <br><br>  Now the word ‚Äústartup‚Äù for most people has become to designate something completely different from what it was earlier, and it gave an incredible scope for speculation, ordinary illiteracy and, what is most unpleasant, gave rise to a strange dream that you can create something absolutely incredible, scalable and multiply growing - on the knee for a couple of months, without having the necessary knowledge and experience.  If you think about it, this dream, in itself, is rather idiotic.  After all, no one has a desire to arrange a concert in the large hall of the conservatory without knowing how to play a single musical instrument.  And at the same time it is even more stupid to think that you will learn this in the process of a concert.  Of course, nothing is impossible, but at least you can imagine how much you will have to torment your viewers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8f/533/215/d8f5332157db443bb38a72422bdead8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone who wants to create their own ‚Äústartup‚Äù should remember that this is a business that is developing in conditions of maximum uncertainty, and this will require a lot of knowledge from you, innovative thinking and a very strong nervous system.  By the way, if this is your first experience, I can assume with a 95% chance that you will fail.  Only a very enthusiastic person who is ready for financial, moral, and sometimes physical deprivation in order to make the world a better person can do this kind of work.

      And now I will allow myself to list three things for the sake of which you shouldn‚Äôt go into the startup industry - unfortunately, they are the main incentives for the absolute majority of startups. <br><br><h4>  To change your life </h4><br>  You must have seen this endless advertisement calling for a change in your life - ‚Äúget out of your comfort zone‚Äù and create your own fast-growing business. <br><br>  Whatever bulshit was not such an advertisement, however, it gave rise to a steady myth - <i>to create something worthwhile you need to ‚ÄúGet out of your comfort zone‚Äù.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f7/c0d/a4a/6f7c0da4ae544a168c1e1cd5c50a69d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Are you guys serious?  I saw in our country only a couple of people who were at least close to this concept, and believe me, none of them would ever leave this ‚Äúzone‚Äù.  I am surprised that this bourgeois slogan works in our country, but it works, perhaps because many of us do not fully understand what comfort is. <br><br>  <i>Comfort - comfort, convenience.</i> <br><br>  You are in the comfort zone if you are comfortable and comfortable in your work, everyone respects and loves you because you are a good professional, if you are comfortable and comfortable in your apartment which you enjoy returning after a working day, you are comfortable and comfortable with your girlfriend or wife that loves you, cozy and comfortable in the store because you can buy what you need, comfortable and comfortable mentally and physically and now and then ... ... If it is about you, then I doubt that you will want to leave this wonderful world.  And if something is not comfortable for you, then you need to think about how to change this particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife, and with minimal loss. <br><br>  A couple of months ago I wrote an article on GeekTimes about the so-called ‚ÄúDream Marketing‚Äù, which dealt with a fairly simple technique - how to use the substitution of concepts for advertising purposes.  The concept of ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù is the same.  This is a non-existent, artificially contrived concept that loses its entire advertising meaning, if you remove the word ‚Äúexit‚Äù in front of it.  This abstract concept, invented for the purposes of science, is used today to sell training courses and in this case it means literally the following: <i>you feel bad, give us money and we will tell you how to become the very cool guy that we have painted on Lendose</i> .  By the way, I have nothing against training courses when the game goes according to certain rules.  As an honest marketer, I vybesivaet when they begin to use the technology of religious sects. <br><br>  <i>You quit a girl, pay little at work, the dog died ... you know what you guys need to do?</i>  <i>‚ÄúGet out of your comfort zone‚Äù, quit your job, sell an apartment, a car or a kidney, and finally stop living this fucking dull life - everything is in your hands, dude, give us money and we will show you how to create super start-ups and multiply them in jar of cucumbers.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  So, if you ever want to ‚Äúget out of your comfort zone‚Äù - just change your job, girl or hand, and continue to live on. <br><br><h4>  To become successful </h4><br>  Myth number two - you must do business to be successful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/f80/0ef/971f800efa064c1898c72f4d5d2ced5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The word ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù does not exist in Russian! <br>  It exists in English and looks like this - ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and means it is translated into Russian ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù, and not what we used to understand by this word: <i>‚Äúmy name is Petya, I‚Äôm a digger, and digging the ground is my business. "</i> <br><br>  If you substitute an English concept for the Russian word business, then everything falls into place and loses its sacred meaning - you have to do business to be successful.  And everyone has their own case - and this does not mean at all that you need to bang with something to be successful.  More precisely, even not so - you still have to sell, of course, you have to do something - for example, your knowledge or ability to handle a shovel, but you can sell what you know and can do, what you can safely call your business. <br><br>  Here on this site, half of the readers mentally said, ‚ÄúThank you cap, this is so obvious.‚Äù  Yes, but think about a simple logical thought - at least 70% of you have ever wanted or were engaged in ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and this is despite the fact that 80% of you have been studying at the institute and have a profession that is not related to the sale of goods or services of others people.  So why should you do something completely unknown to you, in which you have neither knowledge nor experience, if in your area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuccess it is easier for you to achieve?  This is my personal problem, I am a theater director by education and at one time I started doing ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù - in the end, I spent several years and an indecently large amount of money in order to get the necessary knowledge through trial and error, after all this, having passed fire, water and copper pipes, I can not say that I would have achieved less if I had been engaged in my profession with the same enthusiasm. <br><br>  So, dear future or real startups, I recommend with the full right to it - stand up in the evening somehow in front of the mirror, look at your physiognomy and ask yourself - is that what I'm doing ‚Äúwork‚Äù and have I just become a victim of fashion? <br><br>
<h4>  To create something new </h4><br>  Myth number three - I need to do something innovative, which has no analogues in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/bb8/d84/6b9bb8d84c3748e2a11b03458065b535.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My dear readers, this myth is born of a vice, which is described in the Bible and is called this vice - Pride.  Ask every second start-up starter why he needs that crap that he does - and he will not be able to answer you intelligibly. <br><br>  Most startups do not fly precisely because they do not solve any particular problem.  In fact, striving for something new and not known is great, but not a single business will give you income if it does not bring enough benefit to pay for it.  How do you think, how good is it to live in a city where everyone is engaged in high technology and there is not a single store or, for example, a pharmacy. <br>  Believe me, creating something simple and urgent is not a shame, it is great! <br><br>  And again you thought ‚Äúthank you cap‚Äù but ... <br><br>  At least someone can explain to me why in a country where start-up industry is developing at full speed, Russian tomatoes in the store are twice as expensive as Moroccan oranges and no one has yet solved this problem? <br><br>  <i>Best regards, <a href="http://generate.club/">Generate.club</a> project team.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376413/</a></p>
