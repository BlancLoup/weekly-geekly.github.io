  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Epson SureColor SC-F2000: Epson's first textile printer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As it was promised in the post about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/232119/">sublimation printing</a> , in this post we will tell about <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/epson-surecolor-sc-f2000/">Epson SureColor SC-F2000</a> - a device of a new class for our company - an inkjet printer for direct printing on textiles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f6/49c/eef/9f649ceefc3248548712cd605e4c1152.jpg"></div><br>  Printers for direct printing on fabric (often referred to as "printers for printing on T-shirts and cut"), have been produced for more than 8 years, but all of them in varying degrees are modifications of standard models for printing on paper.  In most of these alterations, Epson technologies are used - from printheads to nodes and parts from inkjet printers.  Some alterations are more or less successful, but most are no good.  In any case, the situation when a print unit from one manufacturer is installed in the product, the second mechanic, software from the third and consumables from the fourth, raises questions about the quality and speed of printing, reliability of the device, availability and availability of service support. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Direct textile printing </h3><br>  Epson SureColor SC-F2000 is a complete solution that can work out of the box and is supported by Epson in full: from the Russification of the interface and documentation to warranty and post-warranty service.  The model has two modifications that differ in a colorful scheme: either it is CMYK or - CMYK + W. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6d/7e1/d87/d6d7e1d87d494f1e8c59a69e7cd69c99.jpg"></div><br>  Accordingly, the first model is focused on white (light) material, the second - on fabrics of any color due to the presence of white ink, which works as a substrate, ‚Äúsealing‚Äù the material with the first pass.  <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/ink/1090560/">Epson UltraChrome DG</a> brand pigment inks are used for printing on textiles: <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/ink/1090560/">durable</a> , bright and completely safe and non-toxic.  Cartridges of two different volumes are provided: standard (250 ml) and increased (600 ml).

      Inkjet printing on fabric is more demanding of the mechanical part of the device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/910/63e/5b1/91063e5b147b4354b93ff102e082b077.jpg"></div><br>  The printing path requires reliable, eliminating backlash and vibration, constructive, protecting the print head from the inevitable pile and dust, while remaining extremely accurate to implement printing in several passes.  In the case of the SureColor SC-F2000, this node has received special attention. <br><br>  The material is fed using a table drive, on which the T-shirt itself (or a piece of clothing) is laid out.  Tables are interchangeable, the design uses a mechanism for fast fixing the product, which allows you to securely hold the product during printing.  A total of 4 table sizes (from 101 √ó 101 mm to 406 √ó 508 mm) are available, which cover all possible requirements for printing on fabric.  The height of the table is also adjustable, so that the maximum thickness of the printed material is 25 mm. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/035/dfe/bbc035dfe7ed4bbbaac4e570fa9760b2.jpg"></div><br>  Despite the fact that it is an industrial printer, the device remains compact and works almost silently.  The combination of quiet operation and environmentally friendly ink allows you to install Epson SureColor SC-F2000 in any room, including shops and printing shops with production at the client. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/520/556/31f52055640246839db3a586167be0e6.jpg"></div><br>  As in the case of ‚Äúpaper‚Äù inkjet models, the most ‚Äúgentle‚Äù and expensive part of the device is the print head.  Here it works in a much more aggressive environment: there is always more cloth on the fabric, dust and other debris that inevitably penetrates everywhere, which inevitably leads to service.  In the device, this is taken into account: the printer is equipped with the technology of automated cleaning of printheads from dust, virtually eliminating nozzles clogging and saving the ink required for washing.  A distinctive feature of the printer is the white ink recycling system, which protects the printheads from drying out when there is no printing for a long time. <br><br>  The printer is supplied with the Russified Garment Creator software, which allows you to upload files for printing as quickly and easily as possible, make adjustments to the image, and even calculate the estimated cost of printing for each print.  Professionals who are accustomed to control every little thing in the printing process can benefit from third-party raster processor (RIP) vendor solutions - Ergosoft and Wasatch have already announced support for the new printer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cb/1b6/0f1/3cb1b60f1cd64d69a2f490dea382575d.jpg"></div><br>  You can learn about the Epson SureColor SC-F2000 printer <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/epson-surecolor-sc-f2000/">in this section of our site</a> . <br><br>  <i>We thank the official dealer of Epson - the company <a href="http://www.stensart.ru/digital-print-to-garment/printers/Epson-SureColor.html">Nissa Distribution</a> - for their help in preparing the post.</i> <br><br><hr>  <b>Dear Habravchane,</b> <br>  Due to the fact that Habrahabr.ru was divided into three resources (HabraHabr, GeekTimes and MegaMozg), Epson's blog <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/epson/">moved to Geektimes.ru</a> . <br>  Looking forward to seeing you on our GT blog! <br>  Epson team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235619/</a></p>
