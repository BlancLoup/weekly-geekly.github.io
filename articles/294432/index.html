  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From October 22, the operator Tele2 launches communication services for residents of Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In addition to the "big three" of operators in Moscow on October 22 will be the fourth mobile operator <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele2">Tele2</a> . <br>  The Federal Communications Agency ( <a href="http://www.rossvyaz.ru/">Rossvyaz</a> ) allocated Tele2 7.5 million numbers in the 977 code (in the range from 250-00-00 to 999-99-99). <br><br>  A month before the start of sales, the certification program starts: special paper cards that the operator will hand out give the right to connect to Tele2 on preferential terms.  Each month for a certain time, the subscriber will be charged the amount that he can spend on the payment of communication services. <br><br>  In the second quarter of 2015, the revenue of T2 RTK Holding increased by 7.1% year-on-year and amounted to 23.6 billion rubles.  EBITDA reached 7.3 billion rubles.  A year earlier, this figure was 6.7 billion rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>

      To enter the Moscow market, Tele2 in February 2015 received from one of its shareholders, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D0%2592%25D0%25A2%25D0%2591">VTB</a> , a preferential loan of 16 billion rubles.  In the development of 3G / 4G networks in Moscow, the operator invests its own funds.  The budget consists of the cost of building infrastructure, opening monobrand salons, advertising campaigns and more. <br><br>  The operator announced its entry into the Moscow market in July.  But the company abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaunching the network in the summer in order to have time to build more base stations and improve the quality of communication, said Dmitry Lopatukhin, director of operations for T2 RTK Holding.  He also reported that the company will launch only 3G and 4G networks in Moscow. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe majority of smartphones, the penetration of which is large in Moscow, do not need a GSM substrate and work in 3G networks (voice and data) and 4G (data).  Being in the coverage area, our subscribers will always use high-speed Internet and will never fall into a slow EDGE, ‚Äù <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/11/09/2015/55f15bd09a7947f6eb06aa75">said</a> RBC representative of the operator Konstantin Prokshin. <br><br>  Tele2 competitors from the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù believe that the operator is not ready for launch, as it does not have a sufficient number of base stations.  ‚ÄúIt is possible to launch the network at 100 base stations; it‚Äôs not possible to talk about the quality of such a network,‚Äù said Tatiana Zvereva, a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> spokeswoman.  ‚ÄúGetting to the capital is an extremely difficult task for the new operator.  Companies that currently work in Moscow have spent more than one year to ensure a decent level of network coverage and quality of communication, ‚Äùsaid VympelCom spokeswoman Anna Aybasheva.  According to the source of RBC, close to the shareholders, and the interlocutor in a large infrastructure company, by the time of launch, Tele2 will have more than 3‚Äì3.5 thousand base stations. <br><br>  Tele2 positions itself as a discounter operator.  Prokshin notes that the tariff structure will be "the same as in other regions: three package tariffs and two tariffs for those who do not particularly need the Internet, the main thing is no footnotes and hidden conditions." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/177/3ad/962/1773ad96269747a7ac2023b19b2b32aa.png" width="550"><br>  <i>Source: Tele2</i> <br><br>  The operator will sell SIM cards at about 10‚Äì11 thousand retail outlets.  The company plans that about 45-50% of all connections will fall on a mono-brand network. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThanks to the new program of accelerated development of this sales channel and as a result of launching the brand in the regions where Rostelecom‚Äôs cellular assets were operating, the number of mono-brand stores and modules exceeded 2,200. By the end of the year, the retail network Tele2 will have 2,900 stores and modules, including 350 we will build in Moscow, ‚Äùsays Prokshin. <br><br>  In Moscow, the operator will continue cooperation with <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/">Mail of Russia</a> , with retail chains <a href="http://www.aria-aif.ru/">ARIA-AiF</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2)">Eldorado</a> .  The company has also entered into agreements with local Moscow network telecom retailers.  T2 RTK Holding this year renegotiated contracts with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Svyaznoy,</a> taking into account the release to Moscow, and resumed cooperation with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Euroset</a> .  Moreover, by the end of this year, 50 Tele2 brand zones in the Svyaznoy stores in the cities of the Moscow region will work in a pilot mode, said Maria Zaikina, a representative of Svyaznoy, told Prokshin. <br><br>  According to the RBC source in the federal cellular retailer, the company assumes that within a year from the start of sales, the share of Tele2 will reach 15% of the total number of contracts sold.  According to the calculations of UBS Bank, a year after the launch in Moscow, Tele2 can count on 10% of the market in terms of the number of active SIM cards. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe company can safely count on 20% of the capital market in a three-year term,‚Äù said Denis Kuskov, CEO of <a href="http://www.tdaily.ru/">Telecom Daily</a> .  According to the expert, there is an audience that will be interested in the Tele2 proposal: prices will not be excessively discount, but will be more attractive than offers from the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294432/</a></p>
