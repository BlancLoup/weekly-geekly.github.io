I decided to share some impressions. <br>  When choosing a smartphone, the decisive criteria were: <br><ul><li>  excellent body; </li><li>  full mechanical keyboard; </li><li>  powerful iron; </li><li>  sufficient autonomy. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  These parameters are basic for me, but I also considered the Samsung Galaxy S (i9000) and HTC Desire.  In favor of the first played the characteristics of components, in favor of the second - the price and body.  I was already inclined towards the Galaxy, but at the last moment my hand did not rise to lay out $ 700-750 for too glossy plastic case. <br><br>  Motorola cost me $ 500.  HTC Desire cost exactly $ 100 more, it does not have a hard keyboard, there is Sense, which I didn‚Äôt like since using Hero, it has a slightly simpler screen, despite the Amoled-performance ( <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Smartphone_ShootOut_1.htm">there</a> is a good comparison of top-end smartphones).  Of course, this is all personal discretion and views.  But back to the milestone.

      The Milestone is not installed GHz Snapdragon, and less powerful OMAP 3430 with a clock frequency of 550 MHz.  It works in tandem with a good PowerVR SGX530 video accelerator, which not only allows Milestone to stay afloat among the most powerful devices, but also to perform some tasks more smoothly than the same Desire. <br><br>  By the way, the processor can be overclocked, I brought my own up to 1200 MHz.  The interface worked faster, but with a factory frequency it is quieter. <br><br>  RAM is not impressive indicator of 256 MB, but in practice there were no memory problems. <br><br>  With the internal memory of the device, things are a little worse.  A total of 512 MB, but everyone knows that only about 200 MB is available.  It remains only to wait for the promised update of the Android version to 2.2, which implies the ability to install software on a memory card. <br><br>  The screen continues to delight.  If you look from the point of view of the correctness of the display of all colors (photo, for example) - it has no equal.  The resolution of 480x854 fits into the display size, a diagonal of 3.7 ". It is almost impossible to look at a single pixel, the picture is very smooth. There is no mirror substrate, the display fades noticeably in the sun, but remains usable. <br><br><img title="milestone 2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daf/f13/f85/daff13f8559f98ec21abc6b858a50f82.jpg" width="600" height="444"><br><br>  The battery capacity of 1400 mAh makes the device "tenacious" against the background of many powerful Android devices.  I use EDGE-connection around the clock, at work Wi-Fi is picked up by the machine automatically.  I read a lot, type, play, generally always do something with Motorola, but until the night the device stays down consistently. <br><br>  After the Nokia E72, we had to get used to the mechanical keyboard.  She is not perfect and even not nearly perfect.  It is simply better than virtual.  In order to post to Twitter or type SMS favorite I most often use the on-screen keyboard.  I installed Swype, it turned out to be convenient.  But for typing (bulk emails, documents and articles) mechanical is much more convenient.  Moreover, there is a joystick with which you can conveniently navigate through the text or select it. <br><br><img title="Milestone 3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b0/af6/133/5b0af61330d8f57b1ad1a87aef33d53e.jpg" width="600" height="323"><br><br>  The case is assembled perfectly.  Without the slightest doubt - this is the best build that I just saw among all smartphones.  Moreover, this is a side slider, the absence of even the slightest play makes me very happy.  Over time, the course remained the same, the solidity was preserved.  Materials are also encouraging, especially the abundance of metal.  The device is weighty - 168 gr., But I like the feeling of ‚Äúthings‚Äù in my hand. <br>  In the closed state, only 4 control buttons are available, they are touch-sensitive.  It is a pleasure to use them, we have not misunderstood.  On the Hero, when pressing the mechanical buttons, the case crunched a little, it strained a little.  Here you just touch and the device will understand.  Some mechanical control buttons like more, because they always work and there are no false clicks.  In Milestone, the buttons always work, but accidentally tapping is very real. <br><br><img title="Milestone" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f1/da4/a16/6f1da4a1689736b0261e1923be26e140.jpg" width="600" height="338"><br><br>  The 5 MP camera was pretty bad.  It works quickly, but is suitable either for shooting under ideal conditions, or for documents.  The presence of an LED flash is good, having installed the LED Light application, I got a flashlight. <br><br>  On the first day after the purchase, I changed the standard desktop to LauncherPro.  You can download the application from the Market, I use the free version.  The fact is that the standard desktop on Milestone slowed down, LaucherPro works smoothly. <br><br>  Task managers, I stopped using, without them the software really works more stable.  As a file manager left ES Explorer. <br><br>  As expected when buying, I am pleased with the smartphone.  There was no alternative on the Russian-language market for a long time, now HTC Desire Z has appeared. But it is expensive, and the mechanism is not so reliable.  The next device so far I see the second Droid / Droid Pro. <br><br>  Also attached is a video of my Motorola, which we shot for Keddr.com.  This is one of our first videos, there are a lot of mistakes.
