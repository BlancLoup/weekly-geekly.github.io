  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bagotron</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The world of software is the world of bugs.  Soft is born to overcome the bugs that came before it.  Software lives and develops in the fight against the bugs that are in it.  The software dies from bugs that the software going to replace it will fight with. <br><br>  Software and bugs are inseparable, like Yin and Yang, like light and dark, like life and death.  Creating software, you create bugs.  While bugs are found in the software, he lives.  If there are no bugs in the software, then no one is looking for them anymore.  So, software is dead. <br><br>  Starting a project, you open a new world for bugs. <br>  Writing down the requirement, you create food for the bug. <br>  By developing an algorithm, you build a dwelling for the bug. <br>  By writing an operator, you breathe life into a bug. <br>  By killing a bug, you clear a place for new bugs.

Nothing.  For all his science is created only to overcome the bugs.  The stupid manager boasts of his imaginary power and believes that the project can be completed by releasing software without bugs.  The first project will bring down his arrogance and add mind.  If the manager proceeds with this faith to the second project, then he becomes the last one.  Such a manager loses power forever. <br><br>  What would a coder in a world without bugs be?  Nothing.  For if software is possible without bugs, then coding would be entrusted to machines. <br><br>  Coder creates bugs.  Coder kills bugs, giving rise to a host of new bugs.  Coder thinks he has been given authority over the bugs, but this authority is illusive.  Ensuring the eternal circulation of bugs, the coder only fulfills its purpose, not realizing it. <br><br>  The coder who realizes his purpose becomes a Hacker, or enlightened. <br>  The hacker breaks the vicious circle, stopping to kill the bugs.  From now on he is not a flock, but a shepherd. <br>  Like a tester, Hacker constantly searches for bugs, but searches for them in such depths that the tester does not reach. <br><br>  Having found the bug, Hacker begins to magnify it.  First of all, Hacker gives the name of the bug, but does not communicate it to the world, because the time has not yet come.  The hacker surrounds the bug with care and love, nurtured around him a special software, called an exploit, and a thousand times strengthened the power of the bug.  Only after that Hacker reveals the name of the bug, but not to everyone, but only to other Hackers.  United by a common goal, Hackers are looking for incarnations of the bug in all corners of the world and exploit to give them new power.  And then, finally, the bug appears before the world in all its formidable glory and greatness, and its name strikes terror in users. <br><br>  What would a tester be in a world without bugs?  Nothing.  For if there are no bugs, where does the tester come from? <br>  Testers, more than anyone else, owe their existence to the bugs.  Grateful, they became ministers in the Temple of the Bag.  Testers are looking for bugs.  Testers give bugs names.  Testers look after bugs, accompanying them all the way from status to status.  Testers mourn bugs, escorting them to the status of eternal rest. <br><br>  What would be a user in the world without bugs?  The same as it is in this world is an empty place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/050/0ec/e45/0500ece45cc339dd49aa8870d8f9cfd6.jpg"><br><br><br>  So, what is a bug for a manager?  Humility of pride and a storehouse of wisdom. <br><br>  What is a bug for the coder?  The fate and the path to enlightenment. <br><br>  What is a bug for a hacker?  Revelation and source of vitality. <br><br>  What is a bug for the tester?  Deity and meaning of existence. <br><br>  Finally, what is a bug for the user?  The reality of the world in which he stagnates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/130/a3c/68f/130a3c68f4533a8f5db52a7f9bb84dd7.jpg"><br><br><br><hr><br>  Cross-topic from a personal blog <a href="http://www.greesha.ru/index.php%3Flivejournal_page%26id%3D1220010180%26none%26%26none">greesha.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39081/</a></p>
