      So, let me begin with a banal truth that everyone knows, but no one takes it seriously - to be awake at night is often harmful.  Rather, it is not so much harmful, as it is an irresponsible waste of the most valuable health resource of the body, often irreplaceable or very difficult to recover. <br><br>  I will quote a small piece of the Wikipedia article about Melatonin: <br><br>  <i>Side effects</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Experiments on laboratory animals showed that with a lack of melatonin caused by receptor removal, animals began to age faster: menopause began earlier, free radical cell damage accumulated, insulin sensitivity decreased, and obesity and cancer developed.</i> <br><br>  According to rumors, melatonin is produced not just in the dark, but in the complete absence of lighting.  In other words, it does not matter what time of day it is now - the amount of lighting is important.  There is light - melatonin will not.  Even the slightest light (to the question of whether it is desirable to sleep in pitch darkness) prevents the full production of melatonin. <br><br>  But that's not all.  The fact is that the dark time of day is not only the absence of solar light, it is also the absence of other solar radiation, ‚Äúwhich number is a thousand,‚Äù since  they are shielded by the whole body of the Earth and the terrestrial EM field.  The surface of the Earth from the night side is the most peaceful place in terms of EM oscillations.  In other words, the night - the best time to relax from the day.  The only way to get a short respite from exposure, from which you cannot hide, from which you cannot leave. <br><br>  A well-known fact: the average diameter of the Sun is equal to 1.392 √ó 109 m (109 diameters of the Earth). <br>  Well, the picture, for clarity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/258/d32/4cb/258d324cbf7fede6e1ba9f83b331e111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It would seem, well, think, because it is far away.  Far, it turns out, the concept is relative.  The distance from the Sun to the Earth EM radiation passes in some 8.5 minutes (rounded the number for convenience and red word). <br><br>  The picture clearly shows how the size of the solar prominence correlates with the size of the Earth.  Impressive, isn't it? <br><br>  And this is also not all.  With sufficiently powerful flashes (the number of which will only increase in the next 2 years, up to several pieces per day), concentric waves diverge over the surface of the star, akin to a tsunami.  I think it is obvious what a colossal scale of action there is to be in such situations.  According to some sources, the height of these waves more than overlaps the diameter of the Earth. <br><br>  And everything would be fine, but there are also powerful oscillations of the most powerful electromagnetic fields in the solar system (the plasma of the sun is electrically conductive, where currents flow - there are electromagnetic fields), and this is no longer a joke. <br><br>  To the heap, let us remember, purely according to the theory of probability, that one of several such solar ‚Äúshots‚Äù falls straight into our Mother Earth.  In such cases, the Earth flies through a cloud of plasma for several days.  These cases are recorded by ground equipment, and are designated as magnetic storms of different forces. <br><br>  But you need to understand that in general any flash in the sun generates some fluctuations of the Earth's EM field, and everything that is within it, and that can interact with the EM fields.  No exception to the central nervous system of a person, as well as his cardiovascular system. <br><br>  People leading a healthy, vibrant lifestyle, as a rule, almost do not notice anything.  Another thing we are IT professionals whose lifestyle can hardly be called healthy and active.  Hypodynamia is the least that threatens the average IT person. <br><br>  I do not consider it appropriate to delve into pathological conditions and diagnoses within the framework of this article, I will only say that according to my personal, empirical research, a very large percentage of people feel when Sunny "banged", although they do not suspect what they feel, perceiving their condition just as a given, a coincidence.  Observations show that in a serious number of cases, all the same, people feel the effects of solar activity. <br><br>  This is manifested in people in different ways.  Someone out of the blue suddenly loses the ability to concentrate, someone tends to sleep, someone, on the contrary, overexcites the NA, and he does not know where to put himself, his heart is naughty, his thoughts run away.  It is clear that in such cases it is not a question of a healthy dream, which only aggravates the situation. <br><br>  What to do? <br><br>  Everything is quite simple and not just at the same time.  However, the "treatment" is available to everyone. <br><br>  1) Healthy sleep, as far as possible coinciding with the sunset, especially in the days of increased solar activity (we remember the saving thin strip of relative EM-calm in the nighttime terrestrial zone); <br>  2) Active lifestyle, bathhouse, swimming pool, walking-jogging-bike-skiing, etc., regular sex life, healthy food; <br>  3) Massage-yoga-manual and other therapies; <br>  4) If it is very tight - melatonin in capsule tablets according to the instructions, and other useful, restorative procedures. <br><br>  Glossary: <br>  NS - the nervous system; <br>  EM - Electromagnetic; <br>  IT specialist - a person working in the information technology industry; <br>  melatonin - a hormone produced in the body in the absence of light, promotes quality sleep, the hormone gerontoprotector; <br>  gerontoprotector - protecting against old age. <br><br>  PS: In November 2010, I was very seriously pressed, almost reached a nervous breakdown.  It was then that I seriously attended to the situation and began to conduct research, which I summarized in this topic.  It was then that I decided to abandon the nocturnal lifestyle. <br><br>  PPS: In my profile, for those interested, a simple page (I hope the cloud hosting provider will withstand the habra effect), with real-time charts of solar activity.  Also, with the help of the simplest googling, there is a lot of relevant information. <br><br>  PPPS: Grandfather Chizhevsky, at the beginning of the 20th century, wrote a whole book about the influence of the Sun on the Earth and earthlings.  The book is also present on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127310/</a></p>
