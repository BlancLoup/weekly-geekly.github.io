      <b>Mosaic creates a single screen from multiple iPhones and iPads.</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/175409/">Rus</a> <br>  At PennApps Hackathon, a group of MIT students has created an application that can do amazing things by connecting multiple iOS devices into a single interactive screen.  An application that does not require any jailbreak available for free on the App Store, but Mosaic plans go even further: they created an SDK that allows other developers to embed similar functionality into their own applications. <br><br>  <b>box-, cocos- and pizza- 2d</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175339/">Rus</a> <br>  In this article I want to share with you the story of the creation of the first iOS game in our company and tell you about the experience of using 2d graphics engine - cocos2d.  In the story we will go through some technical problems that we had to face during the development of the game, and tell you about the evolution of the gameplay from beginning to end. <br><br>  <b>Cyto: creating a level editor, adapting to the iPhone and other utilities</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/room_8_studio/blog/174301/">Rus</a> <br>  We continue to share our practical experience in developing games for iOS from scratch.  In this case, there were a lot more pitfalls than we could have imagined when we began development.  Disrupting the deadlines, unnatural (at first glance) requirements of publishers and Apple, crooked free engines ... This is only part of what we had to spend our time and energy on. <br><br>  <b>iTunes has failed Google's search results.</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/02/itunes-urls-appear-to-be-losing-rank-in-google-search/">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/itunes-provalilsya-v-poiske-google.html">Rus</a> <br>  Position iTunes in search results Google strongly shaken in the last week, writes TechCrunch.  For example, a typical search query ‚ÄúWhatsapp iTunes‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhatsapp iPhone‚Äù, which previously displayed a link to the Apple store on the first page, now shows it far in depth in the USA, for example, on page 3. <br><br>  <b>Objective-C Blocks</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/e-Legion/blog/175365/">Rus</a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKot4tfsV24%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhynkfOhIPD9XoqZEN9Q2-jAzFuqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In this small 15-minute video, Jura Digal Buyanov (the leading iOS developer of e-Legion) will talk about the intricacies of working with blocks in Objective-C. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>AAML: The Simplest Markup Language for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175193/">Rus</a> <br>  When I write something for android - I often correct XML (markup, styles, strings, ...).  So in a text editor to do it is not very convenient.  And I decided to spend a couple of hours and write an XML generator based on a simplified markup language (like lesscss or stylus for CSS). <br><br>  <b>BYOD in a container: we virtualize Android.</b>  <b>Part one</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174211/">Rus</a> <br>  In this post there will be a short overview of the existing solutions for virtualization on Android, clear diagrams of the architecture of our solution, a short video of how everything works. <br><br>  <b>New statistics on the use of different versions of Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175513/">Rus</a> <br>  Yes, yes, before you again statistics on the prevalence of Android versions.  But!  There is one difference, if before Google counted the phones only at the time of registration (respectively, if you flashed to another version of the axis, then you were counted twice, three times, and so on), now, starting from April, only calls to Google are considered Play <br><br>  <b>Facebook Home destroys the last hint of privacy</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.xakep.ru/post/60400/default.asp">Rus</a> <br>  Facebook Home can be installed on the phone as an application, but it is just a shell for the operating system.  After its installation, the user activates his permanent presence in the social network.  Facebook will receive comprehensive information about the movements and actions of the user for as long as the phone is turned on. <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br><br>  <b>The fourth round of the voting contest Windows Phone Next App Star</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/174941/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bd/ede/306/9bdede306f2465d8ff0aa158df0cc058.png" alt="image"><br>  Now there is a stage of online voting, which consists of several rounds, where the winner is selected from the proposed pair. <br><br><h4>  S40 </h4><br><br>  <b>Premium Developer Program for Asha - Nokia Limited Bounty Ride</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175333/">Rus</a> <br>  Developers can participate in the program, which have two applications published in any store (Nokia Store, Windows Phone Store, Google Play, BlackBerry World, Apple App Store, others). <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>V-Play: a new 2D game engine</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/v-play.html">Rus</a> <br>  V-Play - a new engine for the rapid development of 2D games from Austria.

This means that meeting user expectations should come first. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br><br>  <b>5 reasons why freemium games ‚Äúsuck‚Äù</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174883/">Rus</a> <br>  Designer Bennett Foddy, known for his QWOP and GIRP games, spoke at the last GDC with a report that listed 5 reasons why the free to play model does not work very well in the current incarnation, he suggests that with a creative approach to microtransactions, designers could do their job better. <br><br>  <b>How much is the active user?</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mbt/blog/175081/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c23/9a9/612/c239a96123ea958f05e1e4ae5697907c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  According to AppAnnie, almost all of the growth in application revenue over the past year was in-app purchases.
