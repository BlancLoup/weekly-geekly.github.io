  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Case: Sisterhood Six Blog. Real moms. Real life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Situation</b> <br><br>  More than 15.5 million American women between the ages of 25 and 44, who have children, constantly use the Internet at home, and their most favorite sites, of course, are the ones on which they can find their kind moms to share tips and comments.  So says the leading global market research provider and Internet consultant, comScore.  The results of other studies in this industry confirm this trend.  For example, in 2005, the blogosphere more than doubled, and Intelliseek found that mothers are 50 percent more likely to be conducted on online word-of-mouth recommendations than on advertising. <br><br>  And so, in the very center of the whirlwind of events, the company Avent, which manufactures products for feeding babies, has already released a revolutionary system that includes a pacifier in the form of a mother's breast, was preparing to present her new electric tits.  After online research conversations, during which it was revealed that young mothers eagerly demand information about breast and bottle feeding, Edelman launched the blog Sisterhood Six (sisterhoodsix.com), which became the first platform of its kind to talk about infant feeding and related mamashinsky topics.  The hype in the blogosphere went fast and well, and as early as May 2006, visitors spent an average of 656 seconds on the site ‚Äî almost 7 times longer than the average blog blogs of 96 seconds (ProBlogger) ‚Äîand at the same time they read many posts and participated in discussions.

      <b>Program objectives</b> <br><br>  1) Using the power of the Internet to overcome physical barriers and provide young mothers, regardless of their social environment, with valuable information about breastfeeding and bottle feeding. <br><br>  2) Create a mechanism that would allow to develop and strengthen a strong relationship between moms and the company Avent, as well as between the moms themselves. <br><br>  3) Increase the popularity of the Avent brand by setting the stage for the launch of a new electro-tits. <br><br>  <b>Solution and strategy</b> <br><br>  According to Edelman's 2006 Trust Barometer Survey, a tool for research in the field of trust, quoted by the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and CNN, the most trustworthy source of information is ‚Äúa person like me‚Äù and he significantly exceeds the level of trust that enjoy all kinds of doctors and experts.  In the US, the level of trust in ‚Äúthe same person as me‚Äù has grown from 20% in 2003 to 68% today.  Where mothers can find such a "man"?  Of course, online.  In fact, a Harris survey in 2005 found that 95% of Internet users in the United States found blogs useful for making purchasing decisions, and the BlogLines search engine counted more than 2,000 mamma-oriented blogs.  In addition, preliminary interviews show that young mothers usually have more questions related to infant feeding (and maternity in general) than they can afford to ask the doctor - there is simply not enough time for this! <br><br>  Considering the data from this study, it was decided that the most effective way for Avent to satisfy the needs of young mothers in the country would be to create an online community that would tie together and represent the embodied experience of motherhood.  The Sisterhood Six blog, which is run by moms and for moms, allowed Avent to develop strong relationships with the target audience, which resulted in high brand awareness and familiarity with the brand, on the verge of launching a new product.  The six authors of the blog were chosen to personify the ethnic and age (life stage) diversity of the Avent audience.  These voices were unique and useful, demonstrating a wide range of perspectives and points of view.  Sisterhood Six consisted of a professional physician, a feeding consultant, simply an author, a future mother, a young mother and a mother who has more than one child.  Each of these weekly shared their real feelings, stories from their lives and advice.  Since credibility is an important part of a successful blog, mention of the Avent brand has been kept to a minimum. <br><br>  <b>Solution: Tactical maneuver</b> <br><br>  The sisterhoodsix.com homepage welcomes young moms with a great headline ‚ÄúSisterhood Six.  Real moms.  Real life".  A running tape depicting mum with her children broadcasts an image of a comfortable environment where you can share personal tips related to your experience of maternal happiness.  The most recent posts are presented at the top of the page along with author biographies, archives and the search string on the left.  The blog includes the following: <br><br>  - Invisible, but transparent branding: because marketers attacked the blogosphere, like hungry Yankees at McDonalds and have already managed to discredit their profession here, Internet users are suspicious of sites that reveal hidden intentions.  To prevent negative reviews, Avent clearly indicated ‚Äúwho pays for the ladies here‚Äù by placing their logo on all pages and a link to AventAmerica.com. <br><br>  - Active community: the authors were instructed to communicate regularly with each other, so that visitors could join the discussions.  Communication was also ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù with all sorts of calls to leave comments on posts for visitors. <br><br>  - Useful content: discussions included everything from lack of milk, pediatric advice and warnings to teeth being cut. <br><br>  - Visibility from the blogosphere: Edelman developed a special selection of blogs, which indicated the most visited resources on mom-topics, thus inviting these sites to also put links to Sisterhood Six and opening up the possibility for our authors to become active participants in other online communities. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  - In May 2006, visitors spent an average of 656 seconds on the site - almost 7 times longer than the average blog average of 96 seconds, (ProBlogger) - and at the same time they read many posts and participated in discussions (Goal 2). <br><br>  - Increasing the number of posts and active discussions, without any costs for marketing or advertising, due to the fact that blog traffic has grown from 400 visitors in the first month to about 5,700 visitors per month by the end of May (Goals 1 and 2). <br><br>  - Sisterhood Six was the highlight of the media campaign accompanying the launch of electric tits, which resulted in more than 15 million impressions (Goal 3). <br><br>  - Sisterhood Six has gained worldwide fame!  In January, the resource was awarded for winning the competition from the Madrid site bebesymas.com (Goal 1). <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30919/</a></p>
