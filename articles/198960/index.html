In this post I will talk about what experience I have gained and what I have learned for myself.  Under the cut there will be no reviews of financial management programs - I have not seen them for several years (and I also cannot reclaim my program, because in many ways it hasn‚Äôt satisfied me for a long time, but the accumulated data archive makes software changes difficult).  Also, although I read Kiyosaki in my time - but I am very critical and skeptical about what I read, although I had the opportunity to try many things in my own skin.  The cycle of articles will not be, I will try to keep within one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, a long time ago, in a far-away galaxy, I decided to take into account personal finances.  It seemed to me a very interesting thing, the plans were enormous - and I plunged into the subject area. <br><br>  <b>PC software</b>

      I revised quite a lot of programs (install programs, and then demolish and install new ones - nobody recognizes themselves in this?) And the selection process was very long and painful.  I reviewed and online programs that required the Internet and stored everything on a shared server (the term "cloud" was not there yet) and small programs and heavy monsters and somehow I did not like it. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like the online programs because someone else‚Äôs uncle had access to my personal information, smartphones were not so massive at the time that I didn‚Äôt even think that in five to seven years, having an android version would be very desirable for me, some programs were frankly raw, they pulled a long tail of dependencies behind them (for example, in the form of sql servers of different types).  I really liked cross-platform programs, but I had my own problems with them: someone suffered from the interface, some were abandoned by the author, some were not trivial. <br><br>  Especially far I went around the program, which had so sophisticated accounting methodology, that the threshold of entry was incredibly large. <br><br>  One of the options that I considered (and it was included in the final shortlist of applicants) was the usual OpenOffice.org spreadsheet.  I came across quite a lot on the banking forum, where I managed to settle by that time, the references that this is a convenient and working way.  And working for people whom I knew almost personally and these people were very authoritative for me. <br><br>  In general, what do I want to tell about programs?  All this can fit into the following tips: <br>  1. Do not delay with the choice of software - there is a risk to burn out or change the program to even better every month.  I‚Äôm a bit of a geek myself, so I know that it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to get out of this process.  And then the fuse just disappears. <br>  2. Choose a fairly simple program.  Most of the functionality is unlikely to be demanded by you, especially (oddly enough) in terms of reports. <br>  3. The program is not so important (you can keep a simple record even in Excel), more important will be another (more on this below) <br><br>  <b>About routine</b> <br><br>  There is nothing more boring than day by day methodically and regularly meticulously record your expenses.  This is the thing on which most dreamers like me break down who got an idea and, when faced with a boring routine, jumped off after two months.  I consulted a lot of people who planned to take into account household finances - and of those few who did not just speak the language, but set up the program and started keeping records, I know very few people who managed to hold out for at least three months, and who crossed the threshold to six months, I generally remember by name. <br><br>  I read similar observations from many bookkeepers, writing accounting software, writing articles and reviews - so I believe that the issue of perseverance and methodicalness is the cornerstone in the conduct of home accounting.  Do you count personal / home finances a year?  This is a very good result, to which very few people have reached, however, let us see if you can manage to overtake the milestone at least in three years, especially in five years. <br><br>  Personally, I am very much surprised at how I managed not to quit in the initial stages, or after a year or two after being carried away with my character (and just as quickly bursting through).  However, when I see a challenge, it motivates me greatly: I studied Solo on the keyboard this way, everything was not smooth there either, but the difficulties gave me strength.  And even more, I don‚Äôt know how it will be for you personally, if you decide to repeat my path, how well you know yourself, and how motivated you are to run long distances.  Ideally, accounting for finances is like a healthy lifestyle: once you start - and don't slow down until the end of your life. <br><br>  What can help cope with the routine?  (I want to answer this question separately, because this is one of the most important questions related to accounting for household finances) <br><br>  First, it helps a lot to cope with the fact that after a month or two, depositing money starts to take five minutes a day.  Well, not two months, well, half a year - it's really hard for me to remember, since it was a long time ago.  The first time is very difficult to remember, WHERE and WHERE I spent the money, I constantly have to write off expenses for "other" and "unquestioned", this breaking is the second of the most difficult pitfalls in keeping records.  You start writing on the sheets, making it almost immediately into the program - it looks very funny from the side, but believe me: it is not funny to the one who spends and makes it.  But if we overcome a certain barrier, we can, in a year, say, come to a state where expenses are paid once at the end of the day, expenses are remembered at the expense of ‚Äútime‚Äù, data is spent for five to ten minutes maximum - and most importantly: all this is done on autopilot mechanically <br><br>  Secondly, sometimes I allow myself to relax and not enter the data into the program for five days, or even a whole week.  Oddly enough, you still remember almost everything (most of the expenses are of a regular, periodic nature), and if you don‚Äôt converge somewhere, you can always write off the ‚Äúundisputed‚Äù column.  If your ‚Äúunquestionable‚Äù is up to 1-2% of the total expenses - yes, and a jester with him (I'll talk about it later).  If you can't remember the cost of half the salary ... yes, this is probably too much. <br><br>  Thirdly, plastic cards are very convenient.  If you are accustomed to reduce the cost of the cache to a minimum - then enter the data for the whole week, focusing on an extract from the banking will be very simple.  Suppose I had a period in my life when I only spent cash on a minibus in the morning - and I had this figure every day, I paid the rest from the card.  Believe - keeping records helped a lot. <br><br>  And of course, the most important thing - without motivation (especially long-term) in this regard is nowhere. <br><br>  <b>Motivation</b> <br><br>  I will not talk about motivation for a long time, the topic is too slippery and how many I have seen on the Habr√© articles on this topic are very few explanatory, and I‚Äôd better tell you separately if I have to go to the word. <br>  But motivation is the very thing that moves mountains and erases them into fine dust. <br><br>  There is a motivation - financial accounting will become a habit and will grow into financial literacy and financial culture over time, which then will be passed on to your children.  No motivation - throw in a couple of months at best. <br><br>  How to find motivation - there are no universal recipes, you need to know yourself well and sharpen for yourself, and not uselessly use other people's schemes.  I will tell you a little about how others can kill motivation. <br>  The hardest moment, perhaps, is when your personal finances become your family finances and you start taking into account not your personal expenses - but family expenses.  If you have reached the level when it is easy to remember where and how much you spent, it‚Äôs not a fact that your half will remember well what her daily expenses were.  Yes, it‚Äôs just banal that your assiduity is not enough - and she will abandon her spending, or she will shift this responsibility to you (‚Äúhere you are and lead‚Äù), while forgetting what is being spent. <br><br>  The second point is that the return from the management of finance is not immediately visible at short distances; it manifests itself on fairly long sections.  Then you will look back and see how small steps have gone a long way - and at first you want to spit and quit a hundred times, because there is no exhaust, the goals are not achieved (and if you start with different ‚Äúplans of financial independence‚Äù, then this is generally a pipe. Such plans are made for the long term, it is difficult to comply with them in short areas - and constantly think about it, but what for it in general to do it. <br><br>  <b>Level one</b> <br><br>  What a person gets, taking into account his finances. The whole first year usually takes to be able to realize where the money and money is spent.  Can you tell me how much your salary is?  Surely you can.  How much did you spend on food?  On clothes? <br><br>  The most realistic goal for the first year is to understand exactly where and how much you spend.  Just write down your expenses - and as you do this operation you will understand how many things you know very inaccurately, how much everything is forgotten on the machine, how accurately you realize how much you spend on entertainment (usually these expenditure graphs are unknowingly underestimated - even in "honest" self-esteem) <br><br>  There are two eternal questions: where does the dust come from and where does the money go and if the first question does not help you to manage household finances, then the second goal will be achieved automatically. <br>  I can not even list all that, how many things are forgotten on the machine.  Spent on a taxi - like a penny, and at the end of the month you are horrified how much it happened.  Suddenly, a friend came out at a glance - and what was the cost of drinking.  Impulsive purchases ... there are so many of them that no salary is enough.  I want to feel the new gadget - and here's another hole in my pocket.  Game currency is so similar to candy wrappers - and the hole in the budget is very solid. <br><br>  Not everyone will be able to set goals right away (‚Äúpostpone a monthly amount of xxx rubles‚Äù), many may not be able to do this.  During the year, something seasonal will surely happen that you will consider badly.  In the second or third year, you can already plan a budget, say, how much and what kind of clothes you need to buy by the fall, how much will go to the dentist - and in the first year your numbers will probably get more into the ‚Äúmilk‚Äù than the apple.  It does not work - leave, even if you firmly master the first level - it is much better than to go to the next level with two penalty points and two lives. <br><br>  <b>Level two</b> <br><br>  Budgeting is the key word of the second stage.  After you went through the zero circle of hell and didn‚Äôt give up these damn home finances (and your unquestioned share is less than 5-10% of salary), after you diligently recorded expenses and watched monthly money flow reports from month to month - there comes a time when unconsciously or consciously move from passive monitoring WHERE I spent to active management of expenses I WANT TO LOSE THERE.  And this almost always means BUDGETING. <br><br>  I do not urge to go consistently - and spend exactly one year on recording expenses, then a year on a budget - these processes somehow quite naturally go one parallel to another, your level of financial literacy, knowledge and skills gradually increases.  So, to say that the second stage will begin exactly one year from the start of accounting - this is very conditional, surely some attempts to try to manage expenses (even if only in a simple way so that expenses do not exceed income) will necessarily, just may not always be successful. <br><br>  What you need to know about budgeting?  Oh, this is one of my favorite topics that I can talk to for hours.  Now I will try to give only the most important things that I came to myself through personal experience - and which will probably be useful to the majority, and not to me personally. <br><br>  1. Remember the most important thing: your first forecast will probably be extremely inaccurate and the execution of the budget will be VERY much different from the planned one.  Do not be afraid!  There are literally three or four monthly plans - and you will notice that each subsequent plan is executed much better.  These are realities that ANY people know who have come up with budgeting (whether personal or corporate), the first budget is extremely bad, the second is more accurate and after six months the forecast is extremely accurate.  After two years, you will have already planned not only the purchase of seasonal shoes, but also large household appliances (without getting into the minus), you will understand where, how - and most importantly - how much - temporarily save on other articles, say, on food .  The basis of this is in a clear understanding of where the money goes (see the previous paragraph). <br><br>  2. Do not try to keep track of your expenses in the same program and in it the budget.  Keep your budget in Excel, for a calendar month.  I did not see any good programs that could do both.  Heard the bike that cool top managers do not make up a program in cool programs like SAP, but do everything on a piece of paper?  Bike with a bike - and believe me: Excel is a very flexible thing, well suited for budgeting.  You with the program again and again. <br>  In general, this is probably all that I can say about budgeting - for the first time these tips will be enough for you.  I don‚Äôt give any methods - it‚Äôs better to choose for yourself, although if I want to listen to my own experience, I use rolling budgeting.  This is such a wonderful thing when you paint a plan for the year in the most general parameters, without details - and make a detailed plan for three months.  A month has passed - you shift the plan and again plan in detail for the next three months and in general terms - again for a year.  But I recommend to start with the simplest: periodic budget.  We planned for the month - at the end of the month we looked at the results, we squealed with broken language - and we started planning the next month.  Master - you can try something different. <br><br>  <b>So what is next?</b> <br><br>  What will happen when you get another thousand experience points and proceed to the next level? <br><br>  You know, further on, different people have everything individually.  Life is such a thing that constantly makes its own adjustments.  When you buy stocks - you will be shown how your money will grow all twenty years in a row - but in fact, every five years there will be some financial crisis or a bad year in your fund.  It is the same here: you can move to another city (country), your marital status may change, children will be born - so you never know what can happen.  Want to make God laugh?  Tell him about your plans.  Therefore, what will happen in two or three years after you start keeping household finances is very difficult to tell: people are different (they started from different points, they set different goals) and life will make its own corrections. <br><br>  I would recommend the following thing: try for yourself such a thing as bank deposits.  Some people manage to make savings without taking into account finances - but most usually don‚Äôt add up somehow.  Even in the early stages of keeping records, it turns out difficult: I opened it for six months - and then - bang!  - in a month - and close, because the money was needed. <br><br>  Get used to keep a deposit for a month at hand on a short deposit, and the amount of three to six salaries - a little further away, so as not to be tempted to spend.  Suddenly you get sick or lose your job (pah-pah-pah!) - it can be very useful.  Let's say you won‚Äôt rush to the first job advertisement that came up - you want to see something better and more interesting. <br><br>  Play with credit cards (but do not play around).  At one time, many people indulged in the fact that with a received credit card for three hundred thousand rubles they removed in a tricky way all the money without getting a commission for withdrawing cash (before that, the telebank was amazing, and now there are at least two or three ways) and the term of the grace period did not fit - they turned off the money on a short-term deposit.  (Grace extinguished - and again in the next round).  When you have free money and you live long periods - you will get used to open deposits for reserve (now, let's say, there are no deposits at 15% per annum - but three years ago you could open a small deposit for future use - and now it will be useful). <br><br>  I do not particularly share the enthusiasm for Kiyosaki, but some things can be used quite reasonably.  After low-risk tools, you can move on to more risky ones - however, I personally was not interested in this, and I have nothing to recommend.  Do not play for last money - too trivial (although the wisest things are banal, like five kopecks), remember that behind the black stripe there will always be white (buy assets during periods when they are getting cheaper - and in obese years prepare stock to ride the next wave ) also somehow sounds vague. <br><br>  <b>From personal</b> <br><br>  For me, it was natural to give the child pocket money from the age of six - to gradually train.  When he went to school, he received 50 rubles a day for going to classes and working there.  Later - wage differentiation depending on academic performance (I do not recommend doing it in the first two academic years).  The child gradually gets used to the money, learns to "half put aside, and spend the second."  The kind of dad who makes checks is imprinted since childhood. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I always kept the cash accounting accurate to the ruble - I'm not so pedant, it's easier to round a penny and not to steam. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt have so many budget items, and I don‚Äôt recommend doing much. Let's say there is no need to detail how much is spent on cucumbers, and how much on potatoes - just write ‚Äúfood‚Äù. (At one time I considered alcohol out of curiosity - in order to know for myself purely, then I abandoned it). The biggest evil - do not try to take into account the "warehouse" - keep records of finances. (Many programs allow you to keep records of pieces and there is a temptation to transfer rubles from one account to an account in pieces). In general, the understanding will come later that the lack of stocks in production (and at home;)) is one of the wisest economic innovations. With food, it is enough to share purchases with food bought in a shop and cafes / restaurants / canteens.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About three years ago I recalled voucher privatization, I took my shares from my parents. Tokur-gold went bankrupt, Avva depreciated, and the share in alpha-capital is worth about four hundred rubles (it was especially curious to see the dynamics of value over the past years). Perhaps my children will be more successful, at least I hope that the level of financial literacy will not be as low as those of my parents - and even more I wish not to become too greedy for money and not be stale miser, everything is good in moderation. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From interesting</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Somewhere I read in my time that the most accurate sign of poverty is when more than 25% of income is spent on food. I periodically check for myself. I take a maximum of 12-17% of my salary for food, so in theory I am not poor)) (I wish you the same.)</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not remember where I unearthed this info, if you share information (even if it is disproving) - write to me, I will be grateful. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And finally.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If someone has questions (perhaps someone has already passed the first stages of financial accounting, it is possible that someone is interested in hearing more about the initial stages) - I will answer as much as possible in the comments.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am not very interested to talk about Kiyosaki and other financial advisors: the most important lesson Kiyosaki could give was not that ‚Äúthe number one way to make a lot of money is to write a book how to make a lot of money‚Äù, but that a lot of money only the one who likes his work, everything else is very individual. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6% of the population has found the entrepreneurial spirit, but now wherever they spit, they want to open their business. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs silly to ask me about specific programs - I‚Äôm fine if I remember a couple of names, except for the one in which I keep records. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS I myself would read others on the topic of home finances, is it not interesting to anyone to share my experience?</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198960/</a></p>
