  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acer at Computex 2015 Main Computer Show: Not Single Laptops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Taiwanese company Acer was founded in 1976 - five years before Taipei hosted the first exhibition of the achievements of the local IT-economy, Computex.  It is not known for certain - what Acer showed there, but, most likely, the 8-bit PC MicroProfessor-II on the MOS Technology 6502 processor (by the way, this processor was used in Apple 1 and the Dendy prefix).  Over three and a half decades many things have changed, and the exhibition itself now occupies not one hall, but three buildings in different parts of Taipei.  But Acer always takes part in it, because if the majority of participants have to fly from afar (at least cross the Taiwan Strait), then from Acer headquarters to any Computex pavilion - on the strength of an hour's drive. <br><br>  Changed and the business itself Acer.  The times when all the new products showed exactly on Computex are long gone.  Now the announcements are neatly distributed between this home exhibition, the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, the IFA in Berlin, and the recently traditional spring event in New York. <br><br>  The whole history of Acer - this is, by and large, the search for a golden mean, the optimal ratio of price and product features.  Yes, of course, there were many ‚Äúfirst in the world‚Äù devices with unique capabilities (or, at least, made of unusual materials), but the main consumer of Acer products always counts money well.  And when the company suddenly decides to release something unusual and expensive, it votes against it with the dollar, ruble, MN, shekel and other respected currencies.  On the one hand, it is a little insulting.  But on the other hand, when some time ago the buyer stopped rushing to unusual novelties, like a pigeon on a handful of seeds, many companies had a hard time.  And in Acer just continued to do what they can best - to look for a middle ground.

     <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/acer/blog/251644/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/eed/f9e/745eedf9e1924a0e98ce333c9545be16.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2015, at the entrance to the Acer booth, we were greeted by a small computer Revo, decorated with the famous kitty Hello, Kitty.  With this computer, the company has been teasing us for a long time: the first time it was shown at IFA 2014 as a non-working layout, then they were allowed to touch at CES 2015 (touch, but not include), and now production samples of different colors, and even co-branded, went.  Revo differs from all ultra-compact systems by the ability to install three 2.5-inch hard drives, which together can mean up to 6 TB.  In combination with the Intel Core i3 / i5 family of processors, we get not only a fairly productive machine, but also an almost bottomless media server.  At the same time, the computer doesn‚Äôt make noise and fits in the palm of your hand, which, however, at full load noticeably delays.  For several years, puzzled by the acquisition of a compact system with the ability to accommodate multiple drives, I spat and assembled it myself.  Now there is an Acer Revo.  More precisely, it will be - in Russia, he should get to the middle of summer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/137/e60/3e6/137e603e615f443288e8f0a26a390921.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58d/e22/6e2/58de226e2bba4d00900128926712d621.jpg"><br><br>  Another guard of the entrance to the stand is the Acer Liquid X2 smartphone.  He was shown at the spring presentation in New York, and in the photographs I did not make out the similarities with something painfully familiar ... But, taking Liquid X2 in my hands, it became noticeable - what exactly inspired the designers.  By all indications, it was the Sony Xperia Z2.  An excellent choice, by the way.  I always wanted this device with three SIM cards and a 13 megapixel front camera.  Unfortunately, this model will not be sold in Russia, and it can be ordered as a souvenir in a number of Asian countries.  It's a pity!  Very nice to the look and feel.  In the comments to the post, you can leave comments about the desire to purchase the Liquid X2, suddenly their number will touch the heart of Acer?  Tea is not silicon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c92/21a/2e0/c9221a2e09c14e0f8b839ff17b026cde.jpg"><br><br>  The next exhibit is quite possible to take for a laptop, but in fact it is a Switch 10 E transformer tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/341/457/d99/341457d99730424facd574322e5c0b14.jpg"><br><br>  You can use it with a keyboard, or you can unfasten the screen and get a tablet on Windows 8.1.  The keyboard can accommodate a hard disk up to 1 TB, which, of course, is pretty decent for a lightweight machine on a quad-core Intel Atom.  A really serious computer from Switch 10 E is unlikely to work, because there is only 2 GB of RAM, but it is fine for running.  Especially because we are promised up to 12 hours without the need to cling to the outlet.  Fully curb weight is 1.28 kg, and the price is about 300 euros.  And the transformer has a very pleasant to the touch coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/070/8ea/8270708ea18f4312abcd415159a60fe2.jpg"><br><br>  If someone needs a more powerful transformer, Acer has a Switch 11 V on the new-fashioned Intel Core M, which is comparable in performance to the fourth-generation Core i5 (in the ultra-mobile version, of course), but does not require active cooling.  Same used in the 12-inch MacBook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/266/7a4/14e/2667a414eb404024af790f409800f493.jpg"><br><br>  In terms of functionality, it is already close to ultrabooks, but the screen is also detachable in the same way, and the dimensions are more than compact.  Plus metal body, plus high-quality sound.  If Acer really can meet the $ 500 for the basic configuration, it will be a good option for the release of Windows 10. On it, and you can draw, by the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/156/23a/f2c15623a9af43cb903e8fd6b26ef69d.jpg"><br><br>  One of the main advantages of the budget tablet Iconia One B1-760HD, in my opinion, is that it does not look budget.  The screen is a pretty 7-inch IPS-matrix.  The resolution is 1280x720, but the pixels do not rush into the eyes, they behave decently.  The chipset is a quad-core MediaTek MT8127, a relatively small amount of onboard memory (16 GB) can be expanded with a microSD flash drive up to and including 128 GB.  There will be a lot of films and photos.  Plus, fresh Android 5.0 and a lot of funny back cover colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f29/607/53d/f2960753d1d04acbbbb9b1b4f6def0b4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/777/522/0b4/7775220b40b540a489be1b5430cf7fa9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/504/884/3b4/5048843b4d1a4bb29cc01e4040e83dc0.jpg"><br><br>  The adjacent Iconia One 8 B1-830 differs, in fact, only by a slightly increased diagonal.  And in One 8 B1-820, announced in April, there is an Intel Atom Z3735G processor, which theoretically promises greater performance, since the frequency is higher (1.83 GHz instead of 1.3) and the core is faster.  The colors are still fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da4/86e/4f8/da486e4f8aed41fdb02d2b8c1eb0bdb7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac9/429/8c9/ac94298c93464badad8a351e4e6ff47e.jpg"><br><br>  Acer periodically reminds us that it is famous not only laptops and tablets.  So, at the stand you could try in action abTouchPhone - an office phone on Android, significantly expanding the functionality of dull office devices.  Here and cloud address book, and the status of all employees, and sending text messages - in general, like a smartphone, but with reference to the table.  Add here another simplified integration of VoIP services, and the thing will become a very welcome purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/184/0db/0f2/1840db0f2227401d9adf1d6b90ba6abd.jpg"><br><br>  But back to the more familiar products.  It‚Äôs difficult to talk about laptops on the run, too many points to take into account.  We postpone the details to thoughtful reviews.  But look - what a handsome man! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/718/4be/a88/7184bea884d548619ac51594fbdbf73c.jpg"><br><br>  Acer continues to experiment with Chromebooks.  Yes, they are far from all unambiguous, but the functionality is already sufficient for many categories of users, Google with the zeal of a rhino finishes Chrome OS, and the price tag makes buyers forget about some rough edges.  And Acer shows the Chromebook 15 - with a fifth-generation Core i3 processor, Full HD screen, 802.11ac support and battery life, like a decent tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f9/6bf/f0f/7f96bff0f2014baaae81a5cb0021da4f.jpg"><br><br>  Plus, just huge stereo speakers, for which this model was affectionately called Cheburashka. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43d/eb7/6d7/43deb76d76e842f78aae9cf4dad882a8.jpg"><br><br>  For those who are already ready to dive into the world of Chrome OS, Acer offers a monoblock Chromebase and a minicomputer Chromebox. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/507/11e/a16/50711ea161f146148f6363a4fbf08c39.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/286/f20/c74286f204354cb2ad382a170d24af83.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go past the monitors of the S7 line and once again admire the Acer Revo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc9/8ab/8c5/bc98ab8c51aa4855b46625ad66dc9516.jpg"><br><br>  In our difficult time one of the few categories of users who are ready to invest in hardware, and regularly, are gamers.  Whether they earn their own money on upgrades, or whether moms and dads contribute, it‚Äôs not so important.  The main thing is that they are not greedy, because they always want faster, louder and just more beautiful.  Especially for them, Acer has been releasing PCs under the Predator brand for several years, but now it‚Äôs time to expand the range of gaming equipment.  So, Computex showed a working prototype of the Predator 8 gaming tablet. Inside it has an Intel Atom x7 SoC with a quad-core processor that accelerates to 1.6 GHz (and in Burst mode to 2.3 GHz), and Intel HD graphics of the eighth generation 16 cores.  And everything works on Android.  Of course, such power is not yet given into the hands, so they had to take pictures through glass.  But by the end of the year, they say, it will be possible not only to touch, but also to buy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/402/869/b0d4028693b04fd69934ebcaf67dbcc6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/3fa/35a/ad53fa35a8614500ac9ac790b248207e.jpg"><br><br>  There will be a gaming laptop, a gaming projector (!) And, for sure, gaming accessories.  And also - a concave panoramic gaming monitor.  That's when the ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù will go as it should and where it should be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d4/700/734/3d4700734cf74a3daff9c12e18368648.jpg"><br><br>  As befits a reputable company, Acer has its own cloud service.  The company has opened the SDK to it, and third-party developers are invented with might and main - how it can be used.  It is important to note that the cloud at Acer is not quite simple: its center is a personal computer, to which the strings from all other devices pull.  But the interaction of devices is provided by the company's servers, and this can be used for very different needs.  So, on the stand Acer showed a surveillance camera, a recorder of movements in space for the car, a monitor of vital signs and even a prototype of the rover.  Things are easy - to provide mobile communications, and better Wi-Fi on Mars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/7d0/05b/b117d005b0e1421eb7c7a74d899d277b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6b/53a/ed8/c6b53aed864e48009e5bc81d0eee0f78.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/7be/e9e/0917bee9e203413d9bdb27043e2f50ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/e27/fdb/106e27fdbca94f3195b637a619df9f15.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b7/26a/7b5/8b726a7b5294413c98f138876fdec74f.jpg"><br><br>  And Acer continues to hint: not just laptops, guys ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/a10/2e0/a81a102e01ef4857b0583dd0719b2abb.jpg"><br><br>  Indeed, here you will find both projectors, and complexes for 3D printing, and various corporate gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f83/167/30a/f8316730a7ce43b2ad6d546b44d5728b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/829/42d/dfc/82942ddfc94443b48aedf07acf699b3d.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, no one has canceled laptops.  They are Acer many different, and they, among other things, very beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/232/6aa/dbe/2326aadbe77a4ce1a6cfde0fd6773fb4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/e73/d47/2fae73d47dad4634a16b9bb7410c1dbd.jpg"><br><br>  Ended Computex 2015 clearly showed that buyers are a bit tired of being surprised for their own money.  They just want to work and relax.  Therefore, there were no strange delights on Computex at all, except for the USB 3.1 keyboard.  The Acer stand also did not want to surprise anyone (unless, of course, forget about the computer Hello, Kitty).  They just showed dozens of new solutions for work and leisure. <br><br>  But if Acer starts making wonderful transformers again, like the Aspire R7, then the hard times are over, and the industry can once again entertain itself and its users. <br><br>  We are waiting and hoping. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365633/</a></p>
