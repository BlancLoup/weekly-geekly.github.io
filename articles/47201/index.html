Arguing about how to do successful startups, they jokingly said a similar idea (you can start a startup all week long, you can even broadcast it through a webcam).  After 2 and a half hours of self-motivation they made a decision.  An hour later, this topic was already written by 15%. <br>  By the way, what kind of startup we will realize is not yet known.  But we are start-ups, we have several brilliant ideas of revolutionary projects, only there was no time for their implementation.  Yes, yes, everything is standard, it was a pity to leave the unloved work, did not want to limit myself in a dream and food, I wanted to have a good rest with friends, etc., well, you understand me ?! <br><br>  <b>Objective:</b> Creating a successful startup in the best traditions of start-up businesses in the garage. <br>  <b>The task:</b> to limit yourself as much as possible, to get out of the ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù, so that you are most likely to achieve your goal. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da7/0d6/4d5/da70d64d56fecd8cd8c006a9931ecf7a.jpg" alt="image">

      <b>Action plan:</b> <br>  First, to check the purity and certainty of our intentions, we close for a day (from 11:00 am December 18th to 11:00 am 19th December) and do all the organizational work: think over the concept of our reality show, define the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup, plan work, we make a blog, think over organizational issues (cameras, broadcast, products, sleep modes, duty, room), etc. <br>  Immediately after that, we carry out the planned organizational matters.  And at noon (12:00) on Saturday, December 20, we close <b>for a week</b> .  In a week we plan to get a working site and all the necessary plans for its further development, and if any agreements with third parties are required.  For example, if a startup is tied to online stores, we will conclude offer agreements with 3-5 stores. <br><br>  + Some of the org.  moments: <br>  * Gather food for a week so you don‚Äôt have to go out.  In addition to food, we will only need the Internet. <br>  * In order not to fail to complete due to laziness and / or the fact that someone changes his mind, we decided to tell everyone about our idea in order to cut off the ways of retreat. <br>  * To focus on work, we set ourselves a maximum of restrictions.  Stay all week in the apartment, no exits.  We are all non-smokers, do not suffocate in the same room. <br><br>  We really hope for moral support / feedback from fellow Internet users.  Therefore, we will describe each step: <br>  * planning a startup, determining the main business stages <br>  * stages of creating a site and the development of an offline component (if you need it) <br>  * financial expenses (we will write out every penny) <br>  * marketing moves (this is probably a bit late to feel the effect) <br><br>  If the idea is interesting to you and someone even wants to participate with us.  Ready to take on a team of a maximum of 2 more people.  Programmers and designers in priority. <br>  Those who want to make history with us please contact, you can in a personal. <br>  Please only knock the pros and those who are willing to work hard all week.  Freelance is quite possible. <br><br>  Bloggers - Wellcome.  Sure news worthy of your dear readers.  For our part, we can offer a small mutual benefit - the first 10 thousand dollars, posting information about our undertaking will be immortalized on the main page of the project site.  We will gratefully place the first 10th non-thousanders at the very top of the "Bloggers about Us" page, and everyone who is less agile or does not see potential in the idea, but still post info about us, will also be thanked on this page, but below. <br>  All supported, post here.  Thank. <br><br>  PS This post we want to burn all the bridges.  Promises are given.  Now there is no turning back. <br><br>  UPD.  It will be possible to follow: <br>  <a href="http://vitakimov.livejournal.com/">vitakimov.livejournal.com</a> <br>  Stand-alone blog - coming soon <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> .  10:45 12/18/08 <br>  After 15 minutes.  We start the first (zero) day.  We will brainstorm the concept of this event, choose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup, etc. <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> .  21:00 12/18/08 <br>  The process is in full swing.  I was carried away by the generation of ideas, so they did not write anything on blogs.  The report for the first half of the ‚Äú24-hour rehearsal‚Äù will be posted by 23:00, where we will tell you about the plans.  We are full of enthusiasm, the ideas seem super cool to us.  Thank you all for your support, it is very motivating. <br><br>  <b>UPD4</b> .  23:40 12/18/08 <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/47284/">The first report on the floor of the day</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47201/</a></p>
