To begin with, the rush around chat bots is gaining momentum in the world, so much is being said and written about them that one already wants to install an information filter, and it‚Äôs understandable why.  There is a lot of noise, but more and more questions from the series: ‚ÄúWhere is the result?  Where are the cases? ‚ÄùWe agree with these questions, so let's add some answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a4/cb8/aa3/8a4cb8aa30168bacc0f686a464a1b110.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We use chat bots in our activity for about 7 months.  First, we used them for internal work with partner stores. <br>  For example, when an order arrives, the message that ‚Äúthe order has arrived‚Äù falls in the telegram to the store, the store can change the order status, find out the details of the order, etc., directly in the messenger.  Further, with the help of the Telegram, we have automated the order transfer process.  For example, a store cannot complete an order (not available colors, couriers, etc.) we can send an order in one click to all Moscow stores that are connected to our channel.  There is a kind of tender.  Shops bargain for an order within 7 minutes.  A prerequisite is price reduction.  Bidding takes place directly in the messenger.  After completion of the bidding, the order is automatically assigned to the winner. <br>  Now we have opened the opportunity to create trades for the order for customers.  Anyone can upload a photo of the bouquet or just a text description of the composition and send it to the shops for sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/328/2cc/1cd/3282cc1cdf477ccd9290ef064918349b.jpg" width="300" alt="image">

      Soon the multilanguage and knowledge system will be introduced in the bot.  There are many shops on our site, they often ask questions, and we are simply obliged to automate this process. <br><br>  Just recently, we implemented a bot transfer for stores from Telegram to Facebook. <br>  Still, more people know about Facebook than about Telegrams.  Many already have an instant messenger on their phone and no need to download a new application.  We are sure that in the future it will be possible to create entire admin panels or web sites inside the messenger.  Why ‚Äúcut‚Äù your application if you can implement everything on the basis of the popular?  Fast + convenient + cheap = profit! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dc/bbe/01f/1dcbbe01f8bcff90d3692725517b87c7.jpg" width="300" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A little bit about Facebook chatbot.</b> <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  - it is more ‚Äúusable‚Äù than telegrams, as for me. <br><br>  - the audience is a very big plus.  800 million people is a lot. <br><br>  - the functionality even in the first ‚Äúraw‚Äù version is much more developed in its makings than in the telegrams.  I wonder what will be in the new version. <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - the lack of "sharpened" bots advertising right on Facebook.  But why not give this opportunity at the start of work? <br><br>  - Difficult moderation of chat bots on Facebook.  So, to understand, to create a chat bot in Telegrams you need to write a couple of lines, and, voila, everything is ready, there is no moderation.  And here you need to go almost the way the calculations of the application for iOS.  Hmm, strange, but it may be justified in the future.  Perhaps over time, something will change and moderation will be faster.  It took us 2 days.  And it was tested by real people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ba/6ae/521/6ba6ae5212ec51b22fc568f1ca2f2599.jpg" width="450" alt="image"><br><br>  If we talk about purchases directly in the messenger, then I can say that people are still very inactive buying there and in this I see several reasons: <br><br>  Firstly, the extremely poor development of chatbots for humans.  Developers are trying to "shove" everything from the site into the bot.  And porridge comes out of it.  You need to understand that a chat bot, like an application, like a UX on a smartphone screen, is a special thing and should be approached with special knowledge and understanding of the cases of people's behavior in a given situation.  But now there are simply no good specialists who understand this, so the products in this area are made raw and not finished. <br><br>  Since we are fans of UX and interface design in Flowwow, we immediately decided to approach this with a certain simplicity approach and were not tied to the marketplace site.  The chat bot does not need 80 thousand products.  It is necessary to order easily, quickly and conveniently with the most interesting content for a particular person.  The data collection system will be further refined and due to this it will be possible to personally show the delivery of goods to each individual person.  In the instant messenger you can already embed voice control for busy people. <br>  In a year or two, voice controls will gain momentum and become new ‚Äúinterface-free interfaces,‚Äù about which a lot of things are being written in Western English-language resources for designers and UX specialists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/674/243/3ff/6742433ff8d3462a67004df97fd243f2.jpg" width="300" alt="image"><br><br>  So the conclusion is that yes, chat bots will exist, but not in all areas, will be refined and improved by the user.  It is imperative and as early as possible to establish the integration of your company and business processes with chat bots, both with partners and with employees.  For our own team, we prefer Slack, it is more adapted for us, integration for development and for the client department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b52/d3d/2f8/b52d3d2f8fda90a84d149522a512461e.jpg" width="300" alt="image"><br><br>  PS Automate your processes - it reduces costa and simplifies your life in order to direct your thoughts and time to more global things than to explain to a person for the hundredth time that we are a ‚Äúmanagement system‚Äù or another unclear service for a client. <br><br>  Think like your user to make a truly understandable tool for interacting with your company and simplify the life of your client, partner or employee. <br><br>  Do not copy someone else's experience, think about your field, do something unique and tailored to your sphere and to solve your client's problem. <br><br>  PS If you want to order flowers through a bot or just to protest our bot for customers, you can follow this link: <a href="http://m.me/theflowwow">Go to Facebook messenger</a> and write: hi <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  If you have objections or have experience with bots, then write comments, it is interesting to learn different opinions in this direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/722/e40/9f3/722e409f3680618699e00d7a36956023.jpg" width="650" alt="image"><br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301996/</a></p>
