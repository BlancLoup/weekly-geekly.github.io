Banal blog review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/189322.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/189322.html</a> <br><h4>  Now with a taste of noir </h4><br>  How fed up with these reviews!  Some fools are straining to give birth to some semblance of meaningful text, others are still surveyed.  Banality creates banality?  The circle closes - and we, like hamsters in a wheel, move from one blog to another, until the shoulder gets tired of holding our tongue.  The feeling of satiety and disgust was so unexpected that the medicine was never found.  What is it?  Avitaminosis, is this normal seasonal blues or is it the very thing - enlightenment and the acquisition of the meaning of life?  Chapters.  ed.  says that salvation is in diversity.  He says that all long-lived "KV" someday die.  You understand?  We all will die!  In fact, it comforts.  He says you have to do what is interesting.  Tell me, answer me, are you interested in dying?  And I am about the same, and me too. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Surprisingly, on the Internet there are still people who are engaged in the same masturbation, as I - seek out intelligent life among the stillborn lines.  Browse the blogs.  Firstly, it‚Äôs a trick. <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/by_review">By Blogal Review</a> .  No, I do not know why the name is in English.  Yes, they write only about LJ.  Yes, just about Belarusian LiveJournal.  No, not in Belarusian.  Yes, only the best.  No, I do not know how they define it.  No, not once a week, but every 2-3 days.  Yes, links are sent to them by grateful readers.  Yes, all this is also absolutely pointless.  They too all will ever die.  In addition, it is alarming to me when they directly declare to me that " <em>It is very pleasant to be friends with us, you will like it!</em> ". <br><br>  Secondly, the <a href="http://musiclook.ru/">Music Look</a> website has become for me a real discovery in every sense.  This is really a normal, professional blog review, and not my amateur attempts.  Here is what the creators themselves say about their project: " <em>A look at the Russian LJ segment through the prism of musical interest. We look at and select the most interesting news, events, reviews, opinions and give them to you as one post</em> ."  All recordings are conveniently divided into regular headings like ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù, ‚ÄúLJ Musicians‚Äù, ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù and so on.  I promise that I will definitely communicate with the leaders of this site, which will be immediately reported to you.  If I don't die, of course. <br><br>  Thirdly, an old acquaintance, the community <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ulov">Catch</a> .  At first, it was conceived as a friend tape, but only for posts that were entered by friends in memoriz (nothing, that I am not in Russian?).  As a result, it has become an ordinary trash of links to various, probably interesting messages.  In general, there are no descriptions, except for the number of words.  But then, God forbid, a weary reader will not master a large number of letters.  A wonderful mirror of the modern world - we read not what is interesting, but what is less.

      Fourth, Denis again resumed his regular <a href="http://inforedesign.com/category/novyie-blogi">publication of new blogs</a> .  I look at these placers and again melancholy rolls a three-meter wave.  I remember a joke about my wife, who constantly bakes pies, and her husband thoughtfully says: ‚ÄúBut someone eats them ...‚Äù I constantly receive letters asking: ‚Äú <em>How to get into the review?</em> ‚Äù.  I follow the links in these letters and cry, I go and cry.  You, unlike me, see only high-quality blogs, interesting.  I have to read them all.  Imagine that, along with your favorite K. Vesti, you bought all the publications in the booth of BelSoyuzPechati.  All these "Hunter and Beaver", "Entertainment and Hormones" and "Wow!  Schoolgirl!".  And then everyone read them.  How are you feeling? <br><br>  And yet I insist on the topic of death.  Yes, Ilya Kormiltsev died.  If you do not know who this is, then I sincerely wonder how you can read.  Naturally, the blogosphere was filled with informative RIP entries. No, I again do not know why in English.  And why the abbreviation, I do not know either.  Nevertheless, there were some really soulful records, the authors of which are really experiencing a loss.  Here is one of these <a href="http://bostontea.livejournal.com/67786.html">entries</a> .  I will add another message from Alexander Zhitinsky (writer, screenwriter, deputy chief editor of the magazine "Midday, XXI Century"), who recalls <a href="http://maccolit.livejournal.com/631335.html">how he first heard</a> "Chained together."  Well, the Internet epitaph for the main rock poet of the last years of the USSR was <a href="http://karmakom.livejournal.com/35204.html%3Fthread%3D1786244">32 pages of</a> comments to the last entry in his diary. <br><br>  How do you feel about homosexuals?  And the Nazis?  And to the Nazis, homosexuals?  Although the glory of a clown is firmly entrenched in the KV forums, I am absolutely serious now.  Please read the " <a href="http://dead-voice.livejournal.com/216190.html">Conservative Manifesto of Russian Gays</a> ."  In absentia I foresee mass hysteria about Khaletskoy, which is engaged in the propaganda of fascism and same-sex love.  Just give, at least this time, you first click on the link and read everything there.  And then you will rejoice, for enlightenment will descend on you, and you will understand that I‚Äôm only promoting idiocy in the most neglected forms.  And you will rejoice at the fact that you have brains in your skull box, but not worms, and buy me a kilo of toffee as a gift.  No, I still can not resist and quote one: " <em>We oppose the comparison of homosexuality with all existing perversions and mental diseases, recognized as such by modern medicine, we have nothing to do with them. Perversions, not counting sadomasochism, are not human nature and distort its very essence</em> . " <br><br>  After this, the news that Yandex.Lenta shows LJ user passwords, or rather, showed, because the bug has already been fixed, it seems something sweet and almost familiar.  Although funny sailors <a href="http://netlux.livejournal.com/1320.html">have managed to tamper</a> with those accounts to which they managed to get.  Well, you know, we all die, so we smile and wave. <br><br>  We continue the theme of idiots.  On the first channel, there is a comfortable ‚ÄúLet the Speak‚Äù program with a talking head, Andrei Malakhov, as the presenter.  I never would have thought that reading the program description (a lot of letters!) Would be much more interesting to me than watching it.  Recommended to all people with a clean, shampooed head and sense of humor.  Oh, yes, and fans of the Moral Code group, in general, and Sergey Mazaev, in particular.  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_satanism/18619.html">The silence of the lambs and moron hysteria</a> . <br><br>  Creativity is such a garbage, which is, and then immediately there is no.  And then you walk, boiling over, rhyming sawing, some kind of brew from love and nightingales.  The street writhes without a tongue - it has nothing to shout and talk.  Mayakovsky, by the way, sorry for the intellect.  Apparently, the anonymous Bobruisk poetess decided - that's enough!  And it became the language of the streets, more precisely, the <a href="http://flasherrr.livejournal.com/10051.html">interdistrict</a> .  The mood of the book is set already in the section "about the author".  I quote: ‚Äú <em>After reading the poems [the name of the poetess] I want to walk barefoot in the garden, admire the dew, breathe the smell of lilac, help the agronomists in their hard work, commemorate the work of salespeople, accountants, merchandise</em> . <br><br>  On Tuesday, a letter signed by the ‚ÄúRussian service of LiveJournal‚Äù began to circulate in RuNet.  The letter on behalf of the company "Soup" contains a proposal to blog for celebrities.  ‚Äú <em>When you don‚Äôt have time for LiveJournal, our blog secretary can post entries and respond to comments,‚Äù the letter says.</em>  <em>‚ÄúSoup has never sent such a letter to anyone, period</em> ,‚Äù said Anton Nosik, a blog officer of the ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù, on this occasion.  He also hints that the provocation has been launched from a competing <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/advert/2007/02/06/blog-clown.html">blog hosting site</a> , calling the letter ‚Äúthe next self-made stuffing from the greatestjournal.com,‚Äù <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/advert/2007/02/06/blog-clown.html">reports WebPlanet</a> . <br><br>  The British publishing house Penguin together with the University of De Montfort in Leicester <a href="http://www.amillionpenguins.com/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DWelcome">invited everyone to</a> write a collective novel based on the principles of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia.  The future book has received the appropriate title - "Million Penguins".  All participants are allowed to write their own episodes, edit, edit and delete others, as the project conditions state.  To ensure that the authors comply with the rules of decency, there will be students who are listening to the course on the fundamentals of writing skills and new media at De Montfort University.  The final version of the novel will not be signed by any one name, none of the co-authors of the "Million Penguins" will receive copyright on the book.  For six weeks, during which the project will be open, the text editor will be monitored by the editor of the publisher Viking, belonging to the Penguin group.  He will post his observations on a special blog, <a href="http://www.svobodanews.ru/News/376139.html">Radio Freedom</a> reports. <br><br>  <b>Kurazhist Alexei Khaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007060601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 6, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288560/</a></p>
