The business will have to go to CCT with this data transfer function by July 1, 2017.  For newly registered CCT, the requirements of the draft law should come into force on January 1, 2017. <br><br>  From April 1, 2016, it will be possible to voluntarily begin to register in the tax authorities of the CCV, equipped with a modem and fiscal storage.  Online ticketing will become mandatory from July 1, 2017. <br><br>  As an experiment, the technology has already been tested in Moscow, Tatarstan, Moscow and Kaluga regions.  Testing with the participation of such retail chains as ‚ÄúAlphabet of Taste‚Äù, ‚ÄúM.Video‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrossroads‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMetro Cash &amp; Carry‚Äù lasted from August 2014 to February 2015.

      The objectives of the launch of the system, the government calls the reduction of shadow cash turnover and an increase in tax revenues to the budget. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When transmitting information online, customers can receive an electronic check, the legality and accuracy of which can be quickly checked using a mobile application, and in the event of complaints, they can complain to the FTS. <br><br>  Technically, the innovation is implemented by replacing the EKLZ (electronic control tape protected) with a fiscal drive (chip) in the case of traditional CCP or using mobile devices with an application to work with the bank.  According to the Federal Tax Service, the new technology has been sold to 3.5 thousand units of cash registers, 46 million checks worth 34 billion rubles have been punched. <br><br>  Concerns about the possible growth of small business expenses were expressed by the Ministry of Economy and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives.  After all, small businesses before this could do without KCP.  But from January 1, 2018, taxation on imputed income will be abolished, and entrepreneurs using it will have to switch to patent taxation. <br><br>  The FTS claims that business expenses will be reduced by 40‚Äì50% due to the elimination of the need to conclude contracts with cash service technical service centers.  As for the special regimes, then, according to the bill, they will be able to use a special fiscal drive - it will cost more, but it will have to be changed more than once in 13 months (as usual), but once in three years. <br><br>  In addition, small businesses can save money using tablets and mobile phones as part of KKT.  According to the estimates of the Federal Tax Service officials, the cost of a cash register with an integrated fiscal storage unit will be from 20 thousand rubles for three years.  The cash register can be registered without coming to the tax office through <a href="https://www.nalog.ru/">the</a> FTS <a href="https://www.nalog.ru/">website</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt will be exactly easier for cash register manufacturers to get guaranteed volume sales of their products.  Perhaps (but only in conditions of a stable economic situation), it would be nice for retail chains, especially if they received tax deductions for the purchase of new cash registers.  Well, quite well, if somehow the trading networks themselves had access to the database obtained as a result of the introduction of the new system.  This would allow them to more clearly assess the situation on the market, the dynamics of demand.  A gradual departure from paper reporting is an objective reality, but it will be clear later how useful it is for the state and companies, ‚Äùsaid Ilya Lomakin-Rumyantsev, co-chairman of the presidium of the Retail Companies Association ( <a href="http://www.acort.ru/">AKORT</a> ). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe connected to this program in test mode, but did not have time to feel something positive or negative.  In general, I consider the implementation of this idea a good thing.  A medicine is a socially significant product, and control over its implementation must be essential.  Only those who are accustomed to work past the cash register will suffer from this, ‚Äùsuggests Alexander Filippov, general director of the <a href="http://www.rigla.ru/">Rigla</a> pharmacy chain. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis topic is not new, an experiment has been going on for a year, in which restaurateurs are participating.  We talked with them and have not heard anything bad, nothing good.  From the point of view of costs for cash registers and some related expenses, there is nothing critical.  The problem may arise only in small enterprises.  What will give it to the entrepreneur is not clear.  For example, there is a problem of damage to the goods, and it is still difficult to say how it will be written off.  We haven‚Äôt even discussed this with colleagues yet, ‚Äùsaid Igor Bukharov, president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of Russia. <br><br>  Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2889201">cites</a> data on fines imposed for violating the new requirements: <br><blockquote>  Penalties for the use of CCT, which does not meet the new requirements, and violations of the conditions for its registration and use will amount to 1,500 rubles for citizens, up to 2,000 rubles for officials, and 7,000 rubles for legal entities. <br><br>  Failure to send a cash receipt to an electronic purchaser threatens officials with a fine of 2 thousand rubles, legal entities - 10 thousand rubles.  The violation by the operator of the legislation on the use of cash registers when making payments using cash or electronic means of payment will result in a fine for officials from 40 thousand to 50 thousand rubles, for legal entities from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297790/</a></p>
