Here I would like to share some very simple thoughts about the monetization of applications built on the principle - ‚Äúdownload the free version - buy the full functionality‚Äù.

      For many applications, this is, in general, the only reasonable way to make at least something.  For example, we still didn‚Äôt have enough imagination to figure out how to fasten an advertising or F2P model to our children's book, and the paid version is more expensive than one dollar, users refuse to download, no matter what description and screenshots you come up with. <br><br>  So - three simple steps that helped us increase the monetization of the application by one and a half times. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Evidence </h4><br><br>  Modesty adorns.  It's hard to argue with that.  But if you are not sure that your application is worthy of a purchase - why did you put it on sale at all?  Buy the full version should be as obvious and natural as breathing. <br><br>  <b>Put a purchase offer wherever it can reasonably be.</b> <br><br>  What have we done? <br><ul><li>  Having received the build from the developers, we asked to add a clear ‚Äúbuy‚Äù sign to the main screen.  Large.  Red </li><li>  A dialogue with an offer to buy the full version appears every time you turn over to a non-purchased page.  At the same time, the page itself is shown, but is darkened and becomes inactive.  Our task was to make the purchase an ‚Äúannoying hindrance‚Äù when reading, and not a conscious action.  Entered the password - and read yourself further. </li><li>  The buy button has also been added to the table of contents and in the project. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Timeliness </h4><br><br>  The desire to buy a product from a modern user is akin to a butterfly.  Fragile and fearful.  A couple of awkward movements - and goodbye money. <br>  If you ask for money too early - the user will not buy.  If it is too late, the user will fly away without waiting for the offer. <br><br>  <b>Catch the user at the "peak of interest" and then offer to buy</b> <br><br>  What have we done? <br>  We set the events in flurry (https://dev.flurry.com) and tracked the user's behavior.  In the first version of the book, we offered to buy the full version on stage 5 (there are more than 20 of them).  We were afraid that if you give more, the user will get tired of the tale and will not want to pay for the remaining content.  However, seeing the behavior of users, we saw that about a third of users closed the application on the second stage (having understood that this is a fairy tale, even if it is cool).  But those who read to the third scene, almost did not "fall off" - reading the book to the end.  That is, we could give users more free content without fear that they would get tired of the application.  We moved the purchase to the 13th stage (more than half) - and the monetization increased by 18%. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is not a failure. </h4><br><br>  If the user said no, it does not mean that he did not like your application.  Simply, for some reason, he is not yet ready to buy it. <br><br>  <b>Find out what the user lacked.</b>  <b>Give it to him.</b>  <b>And once again offer to buy.</b> <br><br>  What have we done? <br>  According to our statistics, more than half of users make a purchase 3 days after installing the application. <br><br>  After refusing to buy, we display a mini-questionnaire for the user. <br><br>  Please help us know our readers better!  Why did you refuse the full version of the book? <br><ol><li>  Too expensive for me </li><li>  I have already grown out of fairy tales </li><li>  I still need time to think </li><li>  I do not like the book </li></ol><br><br>  And, for example, if the user chooses the first item, he is given a ‚Äúspecial offer‚Äù - the opportunity to buy the full version with a significant discount.  Indeed, as many users rightly point out, the cost of a digital copy tends to zero, and the user has already refused to buy the application at the normal price. <br><br>  How do you increase monetization in your applications? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182488/</a></p>
