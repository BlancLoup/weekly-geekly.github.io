    <h4>  Developers </h4><br>  The active developer at the core of Yii is currently alone, but plans to attract <br>  developing community.  Wishes, if they are adequate, are taken into account. <br><br>  CodeIgniter is developed by the company to fit your needs.  Proposals for large <br>  kernel changes are most often ignored. <br><br><h4>  Documentation </h4><br>  The CodeIgniter documentation will probably remain a benchmark for me.  90% of the total <br>  The functional is described quite compactly, in simple language and well decorated. <br><br>  Written documentation exclusively by developers.  Adequate wishes are accepted and <br>  are considered.  Translation into Russian was done for quite some time.  Highlights everything <br>  still relevant, but some parts need to be updated. <br><br>  Yii is more complex and young enough.  Therefore, the documentation does not cover some <br>  interesting places (however, well described in the API).  However, from this <br>  the developer does not suffer: the most typical moments are described, which in most <br>  cases and have to use.  Documentation language is more like a scientific (in those <br>  parts of the Russian translation, which I was engaged in, I tried to build sentences <br>  easier).  Making a neat, but does not cause emotion as it does <br>  CodeIgniter documentation. <br><br>  Documentation is written by developers.  Wishes are accepted.  Translation is carried out <br>  several development teams.  This is done centrally using <br>  Svn.  Anyone can join the team of translators. <br><br><h4>  Compatibility </h4><br>  Yii is written in PHP5.2 (it also works with PHP5.3) and does not support PHP4.  Used by <br>  quite a lot of new features for PHP5.2.  PDO is required for operation. <br><br>  CodeIgniter is compatible with PHP4 and uses PHP at the level of the fourth version.  On PHP5.3 it does not start yet. <br><br><h4>  Speed </h4><br>  CodeIgniter is known for its ease and speed of work.  Yii is also very fast <br>  especially if we consider sufficiently flexible frameworks.  On the official website of Yii <br>  There is a <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/performance">comparison of the speed of work</a> . <br><br><h4>  Directory structure </h4><br>  The directory structure is configured better than in CI.  Probably because in CI <br>  the default structure is clearer and there are not many requests for its cardinal change. <br>  I personally reconfigured Yii to a structure similar to CI. <br><br><h4>  Autoload </h4><br>  In CI, the loading of classes is very well done.  Something loads automatically <br>  the rest is through $ this-&gt; load.  Everything that is specified in <br>  configuration files. <br><br><h4>  Router </h4><br>  At first glance, the URL construction mechanism in Yii is similar to CI, but it supports such <br>  nice things like disabling default routes and normal GET support. <br><br><h4>  Controller </h4><br>  For naming, Yii uses MyController vs My in CI, <br>  actionMyCool () against mycool in CI.  This solves the problem with duplicate <br>  class names, and open methods often occurring in CI. <br><br>  In general, in Yii the controller is more flexible. <br><br>  Out of inconvenience: the parameters passed through the URL must be received from $ _GET, and not <br>  of the parameters of the method, as it was in CI. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  View in CodeIgniter frankly weak, though, if you use third-party solutions <br>  ( <a href="http://code-igniter.ru/wiki/View">http://code-igniter.ru/wiki/View</a> , <a href="http://code-igniter.ru/wiki/View_helper">http://code-igniter.ru/wiki/View_helper</a> ) all <br>  not so bad. <br><br>  Yii is very good in this regard.  Layouts, nested views, widgets, <br>  there is an API for implementing your template engines (with already implemented ‚Äúcompiling‚Äù) <br>  in PHP code. <br><br><h4>  Model </h4><br>  In CI, the model is directly connected to the database.  There are no other models. <br>  In Yii, the model may use ActiveRecord, or it may not work with the database. <br><br><h4>  Active record </h4><br>  Active Record in CodeIgniter always gave me mixed feelings: on the one hand <br>  it was pleasant to do some operations, on the other ... in general, the syntax duplicated SQL <br>  without obvious advantages.  The result was returned as an array, or as a stdClass. <br><br>  In Yii, the situation is much nicer: AR here supports deferred loading and relationships. <br>  The data is represented by models for which validators can be defined, their methods and <br>  even behavior (about the same as in Doctrine). <br><br><h4>  Validation of forms </h4><br>  The validator in Yii heads ahead of CodeIgniter.  You can use validators <br>  models, there are quite a few built-in validation rules and it is easy to implement <br>  their. <br><br><h4>  Extensibility </h4><br>  In Yii, you can forget about the CodeIgniter MY_.  Everything is done in a normal OOP way. <br>  At the moment in Yii, I have not met a dead-end code that would not break off. <br><br>  In CI, I have come across such dead ends several times.  The solution was <br>  but pretty dirty every time. <br><br><h4>  Hooks </h4><br>  In CodeIgniter, you can enable a kernel hook mechanism similar to Drupal.  In Yii to achieve <br>  do not include anything like the functional: the kernel itself gives quite <br>  many methods for executing your code at certain times. <br><br><h4>  What is not in Yii </h4><br>  Built-in classes for working with mail, images, FTP, ZIP, Trackback, <br>  scaffolding. <br><br>  Also in Yii there are no helpers in the form that was in CI, but nothing prohibits them. <br>  implement ... or borrow, for example, from Kohana. <br><br><h4>  What is not in CI </h4><br>  Good flexible API, console, class generation, flexible rights, <br>  normal cache, models as such, normal implementation of sessions, OOP. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  And the result will not be.  Everyone chooses the tool himself;) <br><br>  If I missed something or want to find out how things are with other features in CodeIgniter or Yii - ask questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67797/</a></p>
