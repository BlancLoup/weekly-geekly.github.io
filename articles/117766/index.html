You will not choose - they will choose for you. <br><br>  To make your choice objectively, you need to follow political life constantly and in several sources. <br>  Clearing the news of the "water" mixed with the "noodles" and make an objective picture is not an easy job that requires a lot of effort, time and analytical skills. <br>  Understand that Putin is bad - easy, but who else, for whom to put a tick?

      So, I want for a short time to collect as much information as possible about the presidential / deputies / mayors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>I think that a person as a politician can be judged as a politician by three things:</b> <br><ul><li>  what did (specific actions, initiatives) </li><li>  what he achieved (the results of work in the post) </li><li>  what he said (to journalists at press conferences, other political leaders) </li></ul>  This is much more important physique, type of person, origin, election promises and other garbage, because of what people vote. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the project </h4><br>  The idea is simple - to make such a site, by going to which, a person sees a short list of the most popular and unpopular (that is, against which people) policy decisions.  These may be decisions long forgotten, but the most crucial, the most important. <br><br>  For example, Dmitry Medvedev: <br><ul><li>  Increased the term of office of the president to six years </li><li>  Initiated the creation and adoption of the law "On Police" </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.kremlin.ru/post/119">Talked a lot</a> about the imperfection of our democracy </li></ul>  For each decision, you can vote "for" or "against", which helps weed out the most important from the husk. <br>  All solutions can be filtered by position, popularity, novelty. <br><br>  We also need expert comments to help a person understand what is bad and what is good about this or that solution. <br>  It can be well-known figures, analysts, and maybe ordinary people who ate the ‚Äúelephant‚Äù on politics. <br><br>  Naturally, every day the news should be updated so that over time a more and more complete picture emerged. <br><br>  I think that such a view, formed by the community, may turn out to be much more objective than, for example, an article made by one person, and perhaps by request. <br>  It is much faster to see information about politics on such a website than to dig into the news archive in all its diversity. <br><br>  And now, finally, the picture is more fun for the sake than illustrations: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/998218f7/ec32cc08/cf13694f/42ff344c.png"><br><br>  I want to hear comments habrasoobschestva.  Will it work, will it be useful for society? <br>  Perhaps there are people who are ready to help the project: designers, web designers, programmers, or just caring people who are ready for the slave labor of a copywriter and a moderator. <br>  And maybe the idea is useless, well, let's throw it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117766/</a></p>
