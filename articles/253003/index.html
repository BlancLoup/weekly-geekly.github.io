      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      The contest consisted of 6 tasks, the solution was given 2.5 hours (you can familiarize yourself with the tasks of the past year and even try your hand at solving them <a href="http://codeforces.ru/contest/436">here</a> ). <br>  Of course, even at a purely developer event, we remained true to ourselves, so all the tasks were invented based on our games, and, of course, we carefully illustrated them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/627/92a/9f262792ab974c41a8d91d0408bedb09.png"><br><br>  For the first time in the entire history of Codeforces, more than 2,148 people simultaneously participated in the contest (more than 4,600 (!) Registered from all over the world. By the way, the first 3 places were taken <a name="habracut"></a>  developers from Russia, which can not but rejoice.  Some of them even came to pick up the prizes in the office, where they were waited for a mini-tour and the program's nail: of course, the game of giant Cut The Rope and our standard corporate ‚Äúgardening‚Äù at the entrance (we call gardening a welcome-kit funny gizmos of our corporate green). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84a/797/505/84a7975055c2491bb4e667ed48450507.jpg"><br><br>  And some people were even luckier: they stayed with us a little longer than just on a tour, and still delight us with their working success.  Below are a couple of thoughts from one of them, Grisha N. ( <a href="http://codeforces.ru/profile/WhiteCrow">WhiteCrow</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f22/bf4/308/f22bf43082d44a6d8716316730fd17ed.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúInitially, I came for candy (joke), but now, if I share my impressions, it‚Äôs first of all important that I can be myself until the end.  In addition, in Zeptolab, managers set tasks taking into account the abilities of each developer, including in front of me.  And when the manager is also ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù of the algorithms, I have where to turn.  It turned out that I became a sort of client-side back-end developer, which I actually wanted.  Yes, I know some data structures that are unlikely to come in handy at Zeptolabe (they would be more useful, for example, in developing a search engine);  I practically do not address this part of my knowledge in my daily work.  But these skills are useful to me on internal algorithmic contests :) About the working points: my last task was to improve the packaging of atlases when preparing game resources - the well-known NP-difficult task.  I managed to achieve significant success: to improve the well-known and best for 2013 algorithms according to different metrics.  As a result, memory consumption in all our game projects has been reduced by megabytes, and the assemblies have a memory-limit margin.  With the appetite of our artists, I think, this is not for long :) Perhaps, we will publish my work at one of the upcoming conferences.  In general, the skills of sports programming are very much appreciated here, and this, in my experience, is given insufficient value in other companies. ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, the purpose of this post to inform you, dear developers, is this: <br><br>  <b>On April 4 (Saturday) we launch the second contest together with <a href="http://codeforces.ru/">Codeforces.</a></b> <br><br>  We are already working hard to surprise you again with non-trivial puzzles and, by results, to give you no less steep prizes than at the last contest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d17/cba/a4a/d17cbaa4a42c4a309ccafa10372a4a9e.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, except by participating in the contest, such a vest no longer grab.  Vests are cool. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/74a/c32/81774ac32e1d4748bb60ca913aa53e05.png"><br><br>  Well, as before: the one who will show good results in the competition will have the opportunity to get a job using a simplified scheme.  On <a href="http://www.zeptoteam.ru/">zeptoteam.ru</a> - what is it like to be a part of ZeptoTeam.  On contact with the proposal we leave ourselves. <br><br>  Championship will be held in one round.  The format of the competition - <a href="http://codeforces.ru/blog/entry/4088">according to the rules of Codeforces</a> . <br><br>  The round will be rated in the Codeforces system and common for both divisions.  Participants who have not previously participated in Codeforces championships are advised to register in advance on the site (this can be done through open OpenID, Gmail or VKontakte accounts) and deal with the system: you can take a virtual part in one of the past competitions. <br>  <b>Date and time: April 4, 2015 (Saturday), time: 19-30 - 22-00 Moscow time.</b> <br><br>  In order to take part in ZeptoLab Code Rush 2015, you will need to <a href="http://codeforces.ru/contests/526">register</a> . <br>  Registration will open no later than April 2 from 12-00 and will last <b>until April 4, 19-25.</b> <br><br>  Questions about the championship, again, leave in the comments on the site <a href="http://codeforces.ru/">Codeforces.ru</a> . <br><br>  Write code with us. <br>  Write us. <br>  Write better than us! <br>  Well, in general - write. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253003/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253003/</a></p>
