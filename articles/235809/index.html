  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OnePlus One - Chinese Beast</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today we will talk about a very interesting device from a young Chinese manufacturer OnePlus - OnePlus One (abbreviated as OPO). <br><br>  I found out about this device quite by accident (I looked at the review from Rozetked), then several reviews were published on various resources and I began to read, search for information, and so on.  But to buy the device was not as easy as we would like.  I will explain why. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e1/a4a/3f2/4e1a4a3f2bca446fba01fbf95e28b00f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the moment there are 2 versions of the smartphone: <br>  1) International <br>  2) For the domestic (Chinese) market <br>  Several differences.  The smartphone for the Chinese market does not support US LTE networks;  He goes to the Color OS, and not to Cyanogen and, accordingly, on the back panel there is no Cyanogen inscription. <br><br>  The version for the Chinese market can be bought in China, but the international version is distributed through the invitation system, which is connected with the ideology of the company.  Good products should be distributed in a narrow circle of family. <br>  I will start with the technical specifications, which, however, I do not plan to copy from their site and just paste it here (anyone can do it), I'd rather do it in a slightly different way. <br>  You all know that now the IFA 2014 exhibition is taking place in Berlin, where many companies present their products (Samsung, Motorola, Asus and others).  OnePlus decided to compare their smartphones with new smartphones presented at IFA.  And that's what came out of it ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bf/a9d/2c1/7bfa9d2c1a18d188d042aac2a9e2ab07.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1a/388/b44/c1a388b4415dc3584f3d50f5e34b2da7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/590/f7c/cca/590f7ccca8f25326d4dd83f0fe694d52.png"><br>  Yes, some smartphone models surpass OPO in certain characteristics, but their price is many times different, and the new Moto X loses in all respects. <br>  Yes, not all technical specifications are listed here and, of course, OnePlus does everything to make their phone seem better.

      Now about your impressions about the phone: <br>  Get oneplus one in your hands - very nice.  You are waiting for a phone from a Chinese manufacturer and somewhere in the depth of your heart old stereotypes are beginning to emerge that Chinese products cannot be good.  You get a box that is very well made of good materials, you open it and you never cease to be surprised at the quality of the packaging, but what happens next has amazed me the most.  Yes, I took the phone in my hands and felt not a smooth back panel, but ... I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it.  This is something between asphalt and sand.  Tactile sensations are very pleasant.  This phone is unlikely to slip out of the hands, although, as it turned out, it rolls off the car‚Äôs chair perfectly! <br><br>  My previous phone is HTC Hero (the first Android-smartphone in Russia), the current one (at the time of OPO purchase) is Apple iPhone 5. I periodically take the device from Habr for a test drive and came to the conclusion that any Android device should a priori at least where to slow down.  OnePlus One was surprised by the fact that for a month of use I did not notice any slowdowns.  Everything works as smoothly as possible and is not inferior in quality to the iPhone.  The first thing my friends and colleagues say when they take this phone in their hands is: ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOnly $ 350 !?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere to buy such a one?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy does it not slow down?‚Äù, ‚ÄúChinese !? ". <br>  These questions are similar to something that I was asked when I took a YotaPhone for a test drive (with the exception of the question about $ 350 and about the brakes). <br><br>  Compared to all the phones I've ever held, OPO is the best. <br><br>  A couple of weeks ago I was in Berlin and conducted a test of the smartphone camera.  Here's what came of it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/5dc/00a/d105dc00ad354125b8aad3821c5512e8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/159/0e8/0891590e8a1e4ccca9dae7af5c14d44d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bf/55f/a15/0bf55fa159a6497d8258a1368ccc26bf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30a/b23/e66/30ab23e66dec4249b6c22cee13f583f1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d39/8ed/3af/d398ed3af0e0456783f96960642f428e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/955/eb2/f35/955eb2f357e44f7ca0bde3afa6a01b51.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45c/01c/d87/45c01cd878d4477aac7098091bd2b9ed.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6c/656/ece/f6c656ece0744bfd9c9f9283fca2cf8c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/d59/dc1/9b2d59dc1b3a4aa9b2564b27749497ce.jpg"><br><br><br>  The photos are quite decent, although I have to admit, under certain shooting conditions, the iPhone camera comes out ahead, but I didn‚Äôt make a focused comparison of the cameras. <br><br>  Now for the battery. <br><br>  The charge lasts for 1.5-2 days with always-on Wi-Fi, a bright screen and so on.  Yesterday, for example, my OPO showed the following statistics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a74/535/365/a745353655c8488f8d10828234c72afb.png"><br><br>  If you play any game, for example, Deus Ex, by the end of the day the charge level will be about 15-20%.  This is if you play about 4-5 hours a day on a bright screen with Wi-Fi on and periodic internet surfing. <br><br>  It is a decent battery! <br><br>  By the way, OC updates are released periodically and the company claims that OPO will definitely get Android L, which is good news. <br><br>  I will not lay out the box in which OPO comes in, since you can easily find it on the Internet.  The very same device looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/348/4f5/9ad/3484f59addc5438a9295c70d25bee060.jpeg"><br><br>  I apologize for the poor quality photo that was taken at work at the time of receiving the device and in poor light. <br><br>  By the way, the back cover can be easily removed and it can be replaced (OnePlus promise to release bamboo caps for example, soon), but the battery cannot be removed (glued). <br><br>  A distinctive feature of OnePlus is its openness.  You can always go to the company forum and chat with the administration and other happy owners of this gadget. <br><br>  OnePlus One is the best I've ever had in my hands.  I thought about selling an iPhone and purchasing another such beast. <br><br>  Photos of the device and a more detailed overview of the technical specifications can be found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/231127/">here</a> .  I just shared my impressions with you. <br><br>  This is my first post on Habr√©.  I know that there are shortcomings, but I would like to read your criticism and promise to take everything into account when writing the next article.  For a long time was going to write something on Habr√©, but constantly postponed.  I understood that it was time to stop procrastinating and acting! <br><br>  PS I ask you not to throw stones, you can take minuses =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235809/</a></p>
