Now 22 million users (this is the Yandex.Money audience) will be able to use their e-wallets for this. <br><br>  The service previously sold payments for games on PCs, Nintendo consoles, offered to replenish an account on Steam, buy codes for iTunes and Xbox, a company spokesman Yevgeny Arnautova lists.  Through the payment service, users can pay for games on other sites - for example, <a href="http://wargaming.net/">Wargaming.net</a> , <a href="https://www.origin.com/">Origin.com</a> or <a href="https://ru.4game.com/">4game.com</a> .

      No user fees are charged, which is not the case with counterparties. <a name="habracut"></a>  On the website of the service in standard conditions for digital content providers, for example, the commission on Yandex.Money wallets is 3%. <br><br>  According to Json &amp; Partners, the audience of game consoles in Russia in 2014 was 4.2 million people.  But at the same time, ARPU (average revenue per user) in this segment is more than $ 4 per person, the highest in the market as a whole.  "Traditionally, the console segment products are the most expensive on the market: both the set-top boxes themselves and the content bought on them require serious financial investments from the buyer," concludes Json &amp; Partners analysts. <br><br>  According to Yandex.Money, most often games are paid for with electronic wallets and bank cards ‚Äî these methods account for 44% of all payments.  About 4% of payments come from cards linked to wallets, 8% of payments go through Internet banking.  On average, for each user who pays for game content, there are two or three payments per month. <br><br>  The company cites Synovate Comcon data, according to which, in the first half of 2015, Russians spent 23% more money on the Internet on entertainment content ‚Äî games, music, and movies ‚Äî than during the same period last year. <br>  The PlayStation 4 console accounts for about 80% of the European console market - in Russia, this console is also the most popular, Yandex.Money says: ‚ÄúWe expect that about 40% of PSN payments will go through Yandex.Money‚Äù, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2872846">said</a> Yevgeny Arnautov "Kommersant". <br><br>  According to Yandex.Money, by the end of 2015, more than 30 million PS4 consoles were sold worldwide.  The most popular games on PSN were Grand Theft Auto V, FIFA 2015, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Mortal Kombat X, Destiny, Fallout 4 and Minecraft. <br><br>  Sony's profit from April to June 2015 amounted to $ 664 million, exceeding three times the profit for the same period in 2014.  The company is confidently leading the eighth generation game console market.  Since the release of the Sony PlayStation 4 in 2013, the company has sold 25.3 million consoles.  In the second quarter of 2015, the company shipped 3 million.  The sales of the PlayStation 4 amounted to 2.3 billion dollars, and net profit - 160 million.  During the same time, Microsoft has delivered 1.4 million, and Nintendo - 0.47 million consoles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297154/</a></p>
