      There are many myths about a positive mental attitude, and therefore it is extremely important to separate truth from fiction.  Take some of these myths and see what really hides behind them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Myth # 1: Negative thinking is closer to reality.</font> </h2><br>  Have you ever heard how negative people deny their negativity: do they say that they are just ‚Äúrealists‚Äù?  This myth keeps people in a negative reality that they themselves have created. <br><br>  A person‚Äôs thoughts, positive or negative, actually influence his surroundings.  If you reason negatively, your mind will automatically look for confirmation that the world is terrible.  <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/ne-ver-glazam-svoim-ili-kovarnye-tryuki-nashego-soznaniya/">Seeing is believing</a> , and your brain will convince you that reality is negative.  Do you understand what a vicious circle it turns out?  Expecting negative results, you are unlikely to take risks and try something new.  Negative thinking hides your impressions in the guise of fear. <br><br>  Positive thinking works the same way.  Having a positive mental attitude, you are looking for real options and waiting for a successful outcome.  This helps you to avoid fear and <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/">take on what, according to others, "impossible to do</a> . <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/">"</a>  This usually leads to good results. <br><br>  Man's thinking determines his reality.  The world is negative for negative people, simply because their thoughts make it that way.  Ironically, positive-minded people see the same reality, just in a different light.  Each of the types of people refers to situations in their own way, and each considers only his reality as real. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Myth number 2: Positive people are waiting for the money to fall from the sky if they only wish.</font> </h2><br>  For those who do not believe in positive thinking, it seems that positive-minded people believe: their desires will be fulfilled by themselves, if only they think about it correctly.  How wrong it is! <br><br>  Anyone who achieves something ‚Äî whether it is about getting a million dollars or <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/znanie-inostrannyx-yazykov-i-uspeshnost-est-li-svyaz/">becoming a recognized actor</a> ‚Äî does it the same way: by taking action.  Positive people are in an advantageous position, because they believe: the desired object is achievable.  They are guided by the installation "this is feasible."  Their actions are not based on fear or limitations, but on opportunities.  Therefore, a positive attitude helps a person to fulfill his desires: he does not just dream about it, but acts with inspiration. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Myth number 3: Positive thinking does not change reality</font> </h2><br>  People who are limited by this myth, seeing the problem, believe that positive thinking only hides the inconspicuous situation.  The truth is that a positive attitude does not ignore the problem, but helps to look at it in a different light.  In fact, you do not even perceive ‚Äúproblems‚Äù as problems.  Think: no matter how you react to the external situation, it remains unchanged.  If discouragement led to a negative outcome last time, maybe today a positive search will benefit you and your health? <br><br>  A positive mental attitude creates a setting for wealth, enthusiasm and opportunity.  A positive person will not limit himself to speculative "I can" and "I can not."  He is open to finding new ways to solve problems, because he does not hold back the fear of failure.  Living in abundance mode, we create fertile ground for opportunity and turn dreams into reality.  We easily accept gifts of fate, floating in our hands.  When I understood this and changed my thinking patterns, miracles began to happen in my life. <br><br>  A positive mental attitude can change reality, because it allows a person to act completely differently, which leads to completely different results. <br><blockquote>  "Successful people achieve well-being, simply because they develop the habit of thinking in the language of success" </blockquote><br>  Napoleon Hill <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Myth number 4: Positive people have no idea about the real world</font> </h2><br>  It is easy to believe that the lives of people with a positive mental attitude are ideal, and they have never encountered the difficulties of the real world.  Perhaps people would not be so positive if they had a chance to go through difficult times.  But the truth is that this is only an excuse for negative thinking. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know a single positive person who hasn‚Äôt had serious challenges in life.  They faced frustration, the death of loved ones, physical disabilities and the most diverse human emotions experienced by each of us.  The difference is that <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/uroki-kotorye-izvlekli-iz-svoix-neudach-7-ochen-uspeshnyx-lyudej/">these people did not allow such situations to change their outlook</a> . <br><br>  A positive mental attitude means that you control your thoughts and feelings. <br><br>  Everyone is confronted with troubles and trials that test us for strength, but only some of us have the courage to actually act.  A positive mental attitude does not mean that a person bypasses the difficulties.  He simply makes a decision to notice and take part in the good that gives him life, resisting only failures. <br><br>  In his book Man in Search of Meaning, Viktor Frankl, an amazing man who survived the Holocaust, talks about the search for happiness and purpose while in a Nazi concentration camp.  He states: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe cannot avoid suffering, but we can decide how to relate to them, look for meaning in them and move forward by reviewing our goals‚Äù </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Myth number 5: People with a positive mental attitude are annoying and sugary</font> </h2><br>  We recognize that some subspecies of positive-minded people are really a bit sweet.  We are talking about those who obsessively talk about platitudes and expect that everything will be fine no matter what.  But really positive people are not like Tony Robbins commercials.  They have ordinary thoughts, they, like everyone else, face disruptions and discouragement.  But at the same time they are hardy and try to maintain a positive attitude.  And this is not sugary, it's just a healthy mindset!  Reasonable life! <br><br>  Truly positive people do not expect everything to be perfect, but at the same time they know that every event is the best thing that could happen at a particular moment.  And this is the only thing that happened at that moment.  Now, as you contemplate the incident, the moment has passed.  You cannot go back and change it.  Therefore, you need to accept what happened, as the best of the possible, and move on. <br><br>  Yes, we do not have power over external circumstances, but we can always control our internal reaction.  And this is the only thing over which we have absolute power. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Final Thoughts</font> </h2><br>  I sincerely believe: every moment is a gift, and therefore everything that happens is perfect.  There is always a gift or lesson that can be learned from the situation.  I suspect that some of you are already thinking about the events leading to death, and ask: ‚ÄúWhat can be gained from death?‚Äù Life consists of births and deaths, this is life.  When death or change occurs, we need to accept reality, understand it and manage it to the best of our abilities.  When we succeed, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-potryasayushhix-biznes-urokov-ot-izvestnogo-predprinimatelya/">we will get certain lessons</a> , for example, the understanding that: <br><ul><li>  need more time to spend with the family; </li><li>  worth treating people with great respect; </li><li>  life is not eternal, and you must follow your dreams; </li><li>  [enter your version] </li></ul><br>  Note: speaking of death, I do not consider the death of a person or animal.  I mean the loss of time, change. <br><br>  Most resist change and cling to the past with all their might.  Look at it this way: we are constantly confronted with birth and death, because every moment of life consists of them.  Every new moment is the death of the past and the birth of the present.  Take it with dignity. <br><br>  The next time something bad happens to you, instead of showing anger and disappointment, ask yourself these questions: <br><ul><li>  What is the gift of this situation? </li><li>  What do I understand because of her? </li><li>  What can i do now?  (If everything is already in the past, just accept it!) </li></ul><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-byt-samouchkoj/">How to be self-taught</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300352/</a></p>
