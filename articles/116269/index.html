And then you win. <br>  Mahatma Gandhi </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Efficiency is aimed at the maximum approximation to the goal, rationality - at the most economical process execution. <br>  Tim Ferris </blockquote><br>  I was very glad to read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/116250/">‚ÄúTime Management: Evolution‚Äù</a> today.  The man told what and how it happened.  I want to tell a little about why, in my opinion, it happened. <br><br>  I am the author of a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/84530/">webinar</a> on time management and a number of other popular articles, in particular, about models of reality. <br><br>  Now, a year later, I can say that time management is very simple.  After all the principles have moved to the subconscious level.

      In short, the meaning of time management in improving its effectiveness.  This is like the most important task of the actor according to Stanislavsky - that is, behind the whole game on the stage there is a certain meaning, expressed in one sentence.  Almost like morality in a fable. <br><br>  So, I think you need to be able to do the following: <br><ul><li>  Not to do unnecessary things (Pareto principle), to look at each task at an angle, how not to do it, how to postpone its decision, or how to transfer it to another; </li><li>  Highlight the right things.  In practice, it is often impossible to set priorities 1,2,3 - therefore you need to make a list of necessary things, then filter out from the point of view of abandoning each task; </li><li>  Do one or two to the end of the necessary (read, important) things a day, and do it effectively.  So, learn to evaluate its effectiveness and constantly improve it, bringing each task to its logical end. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That's all.  There is nothing more to know about time management, you need to take all the tools and try them yourself (all these Eisenhower matrices, notebook).  And in practice, due to very small iterations and tests, unnecessary ones are cut off and only things that work for you remain. <br><br>  In a sense, evolution is a very precise analogy.  The one who studied TAU (ACS, TARIU, etc.) knows about systems with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258C">negative feedback</a> (where the input is a signal from the output with a negative sign, such systems are the basis of robotics).  You are like such a system, at the entrance you have the task of ‚Äúeffectively doing important tasks for me‚Äù, at the output the current situation.  The signal comes with an iteration of one day in duration, and every day you have a difference between a given signal and reality - usually with a minus sign (interestingly, ‚Äúnegative feedback‚Äù in life has a double meaning in this interpretation - and and portable, talking about the bitter experience that teaches).  True, if you dig deeper, you can find information that in biology at different levels there are different feedbacks in general - both negative and positive. <br><br>  Thus, sooner or later, but you will gain the skill to manage your time.  How to ride a bike - once you feel that your time is not spent on what you need, you will never forget this feeling. <br><br>  And after that the picture will open, how much more can be mastered.  So, to achieve goals beyond one week you will need to link finances and goals.  We'll have to master such a tool as the budget and management accounting. <br><br>  To achieve large goals, you need the skill of splitting goals into small ones, and the process of splitting will sometimes be very long.  Here you need to be able to "supertask" so divided into small tasks in order to build a kind of bridge from your current situation to a distant goal.  Relatively speaking, you need to come up with such an action, having done that right now and doing every day, you approach the goal (and you understand better, you need this goal, or not - the principle of refusal will work here as well). <br><br>  To manage force majeure you need <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">risk management</a> .  In the same way, you will go through all sorts of schemes, like SWOT analysis and so on, then your instinct will develop, intuition is the right hemisphere, our brilliant subconscious will be your helmsman. <br><br>  Then you will understand that all the principles in many industries are the same - and you will enjoy applying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns">patterns</a> found from one area to another.  It seems that Steve Pavlina called it heuristics.  I really like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãiterations everywhere, and systems with environmental protection. <br><br>  You will come to the fact that you need <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/95004/">to develop your brain</a> , this is our center.  You will also train logic on math problems, and imagination, drawing images, pictures on paper, will become dreams and fantasies. <br><br>  Develop the skill to listen to yourself.  Since you will know that behind all actions there is motivation, and the best filter for actions will be inner desire, inspiration, inspiration, which appears when actions are right for you and which can work wonders. <br><br>  And you will understand that a person, that is, you are a truly outstanding being, who has a huge number of talents and ways of their development. <br><br>  <font color="gray">I manage the automation department of a large company, subordinate to 10 people.</font>  <font color="gray">I still have time to study academic vocals (for example, here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvGtJgMY0hrg">'O Sole Mio</a> ), code projects into a high (I‚Äôll soon share a couple on Habr√©), write articles and stories, read a lot of literature and study foreign languages.</font>  <font color="gray">Several years ago, he studied at Baumanka at the same time, played in a youth theater (a couple of times a week rehearsals and a performance once a week), worked for the company and also did his projects.</font>  <font color="gray">But now I prefer to implement the law of transition from quantity to quality.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116269/</a></p>
