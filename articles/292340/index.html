  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The subtleties of choosing a payment aggregator for connecting payment acceptance to the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Choosing a company that will provide decent Internet acquiring for the site is a rather difficult process.  When accepting online payments, there are many subtleties, the poor implementation of which can lead to loss of profits instead of expanding the online sales channel. <br><br>  There are already materials on the Web about which items you should pay attention to when choosing a partner for organizing online payment acceptance on the site.  In this material we will try to go deep and expand the list of items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/bcf/111/9febcf11152b45fa99f72ec65abf0db8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Commission and other payments for services</b> <br>  One of the first questions that are interested in connecting payments.  Naturally, you should pay attention to: <br>  the amount of the commission for successful payments, whether there is a connection fee, whether there is a fee for refunds. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      Special attention should be paid to the payment processing fees.  The rate of the payment aggregator often consists of bank commissions through which payments are made, plus a commission for additional options that the payment service should provide.  Naturally, no one will ‚Äúshout‚Äù about their cost, but, due to interest in the partnership, the payment aggregator can voice the issue price individually.  On the basis of the data, you can substantively talk about the size of the rate for your Internet business, knowing how much classic processing costs and how much additional service costs. <br>  It should be borne in mind that the commission that banks provide to the aggregator is ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù, i.e.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to get such a tariff directly from a bank to an ordinary online store.  In addition, working with the bank directly excludes the possibility of using the service, which is able to bring additional business opportunities, in addition to classic processing. <br><br>  <b>How to quickly connect accept payments</b> <br>  The easiest way is if your site is made on a popular CMS, and the payment aggregator has payment modules for these engines.  For example, for the <a href="https://wayforpay.com/">WayForPay</a> system <a href="https://wayforpay.com/">,</a> we developed payment modules for the following CMS: Magento, Joomla, WebAsyst, Drupal, Opencart, Prestashop, Simpla, Word-Press Woocommerce and E-commerce <br>  In addition, the availability of sensible api and support for integration will greatly facilitate the process when connecting. <br><br>  The availability of payment modules for popular engines is a plus, but not a fundamental factor when choosing an Internet acquiring service provider. <br><br>  <b>Work with documents</b> <br>  Quite often, the Internet business requires the presence of a ‚Äúpaper component‚Äù - monthly acts of completed work, reconciliation and other papers that are so necessary for the accounting and financial department.  It is better to immediately agree with the payment integrator on the frequency and possibility of issuing such documentation. <br><br>  <b>Dealing with fraudulent transactions</b> <br>  The level of card fraud on the Web is growing every year.  If a purchase with a stolen card passes in your online store, then it threatens with chargeback, dissatisfaction with the card owner, loss of customer loyalty, imposition of fines and other unpleasant moments. <br>  Standardly, when accepting online payments, ‚Äúfilters‚Äù are considered, which reject risky transactions.  But ‚Äúfilters‚Äù reject ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù rather than fraudulent transactions from payment.  For example, on 10 suspicious there can be only 1 fraudulent operation.  Those.  9 buyers who were not fraudsters, and will not be able to make your purchase. <br>  It is important that the payment service, which organizes the reception of online payments on the site, works with risky payments (the presence of an antifraud system). <br><br>  <b>Customer support when paying</b> <br>  In order to resolve the issue of passing a payment at earlier stages - for example, if the card data is entered incorrectly or there is a shortage of funds on the card - it is important to have solutions that can lead the payment to completion.  At a minimum, it is necessary to ensure that the user is automatically notified of the problem by letter.  In addition, the payment aggregator must have a competent approach to abandoned baskets. <br><br>  <b>Additional "chips" that can simplify the work of the Internet business and improve its results</b> <br>  Quite often, when customers connect to the WayForPay system, online stores are concerned about the price, payout and connection speed.  We always try to offer additional "chips" depending on the needs of the business, which may be implemented for the same commission.  In any case, when choosing a partner to receive payments on the site, it is better to voice all the problems and subtleties of the business so that the payment aggregator can offer possible solutions based on the specifics of the business. <br><br>  Team <a href="https://wayforpay.com/">WayForPay.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292340/</a></p>
