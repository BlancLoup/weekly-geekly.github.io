  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personal television</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So far, this term does not mean a personal TV channel with exactly the content that you want and like.  But technologies are developing, and it is possible that in the near future, TV channels will look like a subscription to certain "publishers" with certain content.  Well, now "personal television" is a personal television, which is also not so small. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But, probably, every ‚Äúspecial‚Äù product should have distinctive black features, otherwise, what is the difference between personal TV and just a small TV.  Albeit small, but there is a difference. <br>  So, the main differences that can be distinguished to distinguish between two "adjacent" segments: <br>  1. Picture quality.  Cheap small TVs have cheap components.  LCD matrix with low resolution and small viewing angles, "weak" receiver, DAC and ADC modules, and the corresponding picture. <br>  2. The ability to use as a monitor or display for game console / video player.  If there is usually no problem with the second one, there are ‚Äúbells‚Äù even in the most useless models, then I would use such a TV as a monitor only in the most extreme cases.  Neither the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the picture, nor its ‚Äúclarity‚Äù will leave anyone indifferent.  The text ‚Äúfloats‚Äù, the white color is usually ‚Äúbluish‚Äù or ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, occasionally - gives purple.  In general, for the eyes - completely disorder. <br>  3. Ease of use for its intended purpose.  Personal TV should not remain the private property of one pair of eyes.  If friends or relatives came to you, then why not watch a movie together?  Normal sound transmission and a good supply of brightness solve many problems of small (and cheap) TVs. <br><br>  What does LG have for all three points to state that the LG M2382D and LG M2352D are personal TVs, and not just small TVs with an HDMI input that can be connected to a computer or media player?

      1. In both models, the FullHD IPS-matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled, which means that there should be no problems with either viewing angles or picture quality.  LG is one of the world leaders in the field of IPS technology, and this method of displaying images on the screen has been improved for years.  Brightness, contrast and color rendition are at a high level, their performance is 250 cd / m2;  1000: 1;  16.7 million colors for both models. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/mdm.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2. When connected via HDMI or VGA (unfortunately not DVI-D) and selecting the appropriate signal source in the TV menu, the TV turns into a convenient monitor: 1920x1080 resolution is perfect for this diagonal.  The text is well read, the picture is juicy and contrasting.  Despite the fact that many people criticize IPS monitors for not the fastest response, there are no problems here - neither loops, nor "mud huts".  The picture is clear, perfectly falls into the pixel grid, no flickering, no distortions with white balance, no moire - everything is very, very worthy. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2oko.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Excellent viewing angles, good picture quality, details in bright and dark frames, pleasant contrast and good sound of the built-in audio (for embedded audio, of course) - what else is needed for happiness?  Both models perform their main (television) functions remarkably, and in which case they can be connected to the X-Box or PlayStation and not to worry about a bunch of wires - the HDMI cable solves the problem of both video and sound transmission. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2fkf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, television has not yet grown to content-on-demand, television channels split the airtime with advertising, compile ratings for each TV show and series, rank advertising and sponsor content production, and it‚Äôs a shame to tell how the program‚Äôs rating is measured in our country. .  New technologies, the Internet and Smart TV technologies are bringing the moment when you will choose what to watch and when, and then the meaning of the phrase ‚Äúpersonal television‚Äù will change.  In the meantime, these are only universal devices capable of covering several use cases at once, not much inferior to similar solutions in a ‚Äúsplit‚Äù form. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/pjp.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And if you can not see the difference - why pay more? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153039/</a></p>
