  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The introduction of electronic payment methods in the company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The most common electronic payment methods currently used in our country are: credit cards, webmoney, yandex-money.  If you conduct your business to other countries, then you should also think about the paypal system.  Electronic payments can also include Qiwi, Robokassa systems.  Mobile phone operators can also be attributed; all major operators provide the ability to connect a bank card to a mobile phone bill, thereby paying amounts that exceed the amount on a mobile phone bill.  Almost all electronic payment methods have a limit on the size of the transaction - 15 000 rubles, this restriction is dictated by our legislation.  There is no such restriction when paying by credit card.  It is also worth noting about the possibility to pay for purchases through a personal online office on the bank‚Äôs website, but without directly specifying a credit card number, for example, Alpha Click service from Alfa Bank. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem of introducing electronic payment methods can be divided into several stages.  First you need to understand how it is profitable and necessary for the company, whether the problem is key to business development.  However this issue may seem obvious and resolved, it is worthwhile to weigh everything again. <br><br>  Decision making is influenced by the specifics of the business - what kind of goods do you trade in, in what locality do you operate, average check, etc.  As a rule, electronic payments are in demand for goods and services that a customer wants to receive instantly, immediately after placing an order, for example, digital content.  Exceptions may be large real goods that are paid for with a credit card, but the percentage of such purchases in Russia is currently not that large.  In some regions, the culture of electronic payments is absent in principle; therefore, there is no need to show one‚Äôs ‚Äúadvancement‚Äù; at best, this will lead to nothing. <br><br>  Evaluate the necessary forces and means that must be used to introduce an electronic payment system ‚Äî it may require disproportionately more resources than the expected economic effect.  Connecting electronic payments may require the work of the IT department, financiers (and / or accountants), lawyers and even security services - depending on the specific payment system and the size of your organization.

      <br>
      Be sure to conduct research among your customers, ask how much electronic payments are in demand, look at competitors, if they use electronic payment methods and most importantly which ones. <br><br>  The next issue requiring close consideration is the commission of the system for operator activity (acquiring) and the commission for withdrawing funds.  The fee depends on the type of payment system, the level of technological development and SLA, which can eventually reach 5%.  All systems, without exception, have negotiable discounts that are discussed individually.  It is also worth noting that it is considered a bad form to shift the commission to a client in a professional environment. <br><br>  Now a little about related issues.  It is mandatory to require a person in charge of issues related to electronic payments: daily reconciliation (depending on volumes, weekly transactions will be fine for rare transactions), solve customer problems, such as ‚Äúfailed payment‚Äù or back payment. <br><br>  When implementing it is worth remembering that the main value for the client is, above all, the ability to make an instant payment without leaving home and thereby speed up the receipt of goods or services.  Before introducing each specific electronic payment method, be sure to dock your own IT service with a partner service to discuss the level of integration.  Paradoxically, some services do not even provide intelligible technical documentation, which makes the work of programmers very difficult, if not at the connection stage, then at the stage of resolving conflict situations with clients. <br><br>  It is imperative to pay attention to the availability of tracking transactions and confirmation. <br><br>  From my own practice, I will cite a recent case: I ordered goods in one Moscow online store.  When ordering on the site was information that the goods can be picked up from the pickup point on the same day.  I immediately paid for the order with a credit card.  After the order, the store manager contacted me and informed me that the goods could only be issued the next day, since they would see the fact of payment only in tomorrow‚Äôs bank statement. <br><br>  Separately, pay attention to the problem of returning money to customers, namely the way in which you will return the money, while the payment system will not return the transaction fee; moreover, when you return money to the client‚Äôs previous account, you will receive an additional fee for the new transaction.  However, such moments are not everywhere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142162/</a></p>
