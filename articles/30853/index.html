  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 reasons why you should not work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> For fun, I recently asked Erin, ‚ÄúNow that the children are in summer school, do you think it's time to go and find yourself a job?  I don‚Äôt like you lazing around for so long. ‚Äù <br>  She smiled and said: ‚ÄúWow.  I was out of work for really long.  Horror.  I like it!" <br>  None of us had a job since the 90s (my only job was in 1992), so we have been working for ourselves for some time.  At home we have a joke in which one says to the other ‚ÄúCan you search for a job, a fossil?‚Äù <br>  It's like in the scene from ‚ÄúThe Three Stooges‚Äù in which Mo advises Curly to find a job, and Curly‚Äôs answer says, ‚ÄúNo, please ... But not that!  Anything but that! ‚Äù <br>  The funny thing is that when people reach a certain age, such as graduating from college, they think it's time to go and get a job.  But this is not necessarily a good idea, simply because it is being done massively.  In fact, if you are smart enough, getting a job is one of the worst things you can do for self-reliance.  There are much better ways to live than hard labor under the contract. <br>  Here are a few reasons why you should do everything in your power to not get a job: <br>  <strong>1. Income for dummies</strong> <br>  Getting a job and selling your time for money may seem like a good idea.  There is only one problem.  This is stupid!  This is the stupidest way you can create income!  This is really an <em>income for dummies</em> . <br>  Why is getting a job so moronic?  Because you will be paid only when you work.  Do you not see the problem in this or your brain was so thoroughly washed that you thought it was clever and it makes sense to get income only when you work?  Have you never agreed that it may be better to get paid when you are not working?  Who taught you that you should earn income only while working?  The same brainwashed employees, probably? <br>  Have you thought that your life could be much easier if you get paid when you eat, sleep and play with children too?  Why not get around the clock?  Receive regardless of whether you work or not.  Don't your beds grow when you don‚Äôt look after them?  Doesn't your bank account grow? <br>  Who cares how many hours you are at work?  Only a handful of people on this planet are worried about how much time you have spent in the office.  Most of us will not even notice whether you will work 6 hours a week or 60. But if you have something that is valuable to us, some of us will gladly open your wallet to pay for it.  Your time is not important to us - we only worry about how to pay for the value we receive.  Do you care about how long it took to write this article?  Will you pay me twice as much if it took 6 hours instead of only 3? <br>  Non-teapots often begin the traditional <em>income</em> path <em>for teapots</em> .  So do not feel bad if you just realized that you screwed up.  Non-teapots ultimately represent that selling time for money is undoubtedly extremely dumb and there must be a better way.  And of course the best way is.  Its meaning is to separate your value from your time. <br>  Smart people build systems that generate income 24 hours 7 days a week, mostly passive income.  This concept may include starting a new business, creating a website, investing or receiving deductions for some creative work.  The system continuously delivers value to people and generates income from it, and once launched, it continues to work constantly, whether you like it or not.  From this point on, the bulk of your time can be invested in increasing your income (by improving your system or generating new ones) instead of maintaining only one source of income. <br>  This website (meaning steevepavlina.com - approx. Lane) is an example of such a system.  As I write this, it produces about $ 9,000 a month and this is not my only source of income.  I write each article only once (a fixed time investment), and people can get value from them year after year.  The web server delivers the value, and other systems (most of which I have never created or do not even understand) collect the income and automatically deposit it into my bank account.  It's not completely passive, but I love writing and will do it for free anyway.  But, of course, launching a new business was expensive for me, right?  Oh, yes, $ 9 is a terrible lot today (for registering a domain name).  All subsequent was profit. <br>  Of course, it will take some time and effort to design and implement your own income generation system.  But you do not need to reinvent the wheel - calmly use existing systems, such as ad networks and reference programs.  When you start, you will not need to work so many hours to support yourself.  Isn't it better to go to dinner with your spouse, knowing that while you eat, you earn money?  If you want to continue working for hours because you enjoy it, feel free to go.  If you want to sit around doing nothing, feel free.  As long as your system continues to bring value to others, you will be paid if you work or not. <br>  Your nearest bookstore is filled with books containing working systems that others have already designed, tested, and debugged.  No one is born with the knowledge of how to start a business or earn an income from investments, but you can easily learn it.  And no matter how much time you spend on training - there is no hurry.  You should understand that the possession of an income-generating system is the exact opposite of life-long wage slavery.  It is not ‚Äúall or nothing.‚Äù  If your system makes several hundred dollars a month, this is a significant step in the right direction. <br>  <strong>2. Limited experience</strong> <br>  You may think that it is important to work to gain experience.  But this is the same as saying that you need to play golf in order to get a golfing experience.  You can experience life, whether you have a job or not.  Work gives only experience of this work, and you get ‚Äúexperience‚Äù by doing something, so there are no real benefits.  Sit without doing anything for a couple of years and you can call yourself an experienced meditator, philosopher or politician. <br>  The problem with gaining experience at work is that you usually just repeat limited experience again and again.  You first learn a lot, and then stop.  This contributes to the fact that you miss some other experience that may be more valuable.  And if your limited skill set becomes unnecessary, is your squatting experience worth it?  In fact, ask yourself what experience gained right now will be valuable in 20‚Äì30 years?  Will your work even exist then? <br>  Think it over.  What experience do you prefer to get?  Knowing how to do a specific job well is the only thing you can monetize by trading your time ‚Äî or knowing how to enjoy financial independence most of your life without having to work again?  The latter seems more useful in the real world, what do you say? <br>  <strong>3. Lifelong cultivation.</strong> <br>  Getting a job is like writing to a human domestication program.  You learn to be a good pet. <br>  Look around.  Take a good look.  What do you see?  Are the surrounding free-living people?  Or do you live in a cage with unconscious animals?  (*** Have you fallen in love with the color beige? ***) <br>  How is your obedience training going?  Does the boss reward you for good behavior?  Do you get punished if you disobey the host team? <br>  Do you even have a spark of free thinking?  Or have your limitations made you a pet? <br>  People are not meant to live in cells.  You poor man ... <br>  <strong>4. Too many mouths to feed.</strong> <br>  Employee income is the most taxable.  In the US, you can expect about half of your salary to go on taxes.  The tax system is designed to mask the actual results, as some taxes are paid by your employer, and some are deducted directly from your check.  But you can bet that, from your employer's point of view, <em>all</em> these taxes are part of your salary, as well as other compensations you receive, such as bonuses.  Even renting office space can be attributed to this, so you have to create much more value to cover it.  You can feel how the corporate environment supports you, but keep in mind that you are the one who pays for it. <br>  Another portion of your income goes to owners and investors.  That's what ‚Äúfeed a lot of mouths‚Äù. <br>  It is easy to understand why employers pay a large part of their income.  In the end, who has more control over the tax system?  Business owners with investors or employees? <br>  You get only a portion of the income you actually create.  Your real salary may be more than three times higher than what you get, but you will never see most of this money.  She goes straight into the pockets of other people. <br>  What a generous person you are! <br>  <strong>5. Too risky way.</strong> <br>  Many workers believe that getting a job is the safest and most secure way to self-reliance. <br>  Nerds <br>  Social propaganda is amazing!  It is so good that people believe the exact opposite of the truth. <br>  Does putting yourself in a position where someone else can turn off your income just by saying two words (‚ÄúYou are fired‚Äù) sounds like a safe and secure situation?  Does access to only one source of income truly look more secure than access to 10? <br>  The idea that hired work is a secure way of earning income is simply stupid.  You cannot have protection if you have no control, and workers have the slightest control of all.  If you are an employee, then your current position is called a ‚Äúprofessional player‚Äù. <br>  <strong>6. The presence of an evil bull-owner.</strong> <br>  When you enter the idiotic entrepreneurial world, you can look back and go the other way.  When you enter the idiotic corporate world, you have to look back and say, ‚ÄúSorry, boss.‚Äù <br>  Did you know that the word ‚Äúboss‚Äù comes from the Danish word ‚Äú <em>baas</em> ‚Äù, which historically means <em>master</em> ?  Another meaning of this word is ‚Äúcow or bull‚Äù.  And in a lot of video games, the boss is the evil guy you have to kill at the end of the level. <br>  So, if your boss is really angry boss boss, what does it give you? <br>  So if your boss is really your <em>evil bovine master</em> , then what does that make you?  Nothing but cow cake after the herd. <br>  So who is your daddy? <br>  <strong>7. Leaning on money.</strong> <br>  When you want to increase your income, do you have to ask your master for more money on your lap?  Do you feel good when you occasionally throw a few extra sugars? <br>  Or are you free to decide how much to get without having to coordinate it with someone other than yourself? <br>  If you have a business and one of your customers says no, then you just say ‚Äúnext.‚Äù <br>  <strong>8. Degenerate social life.</strong> <br>  Many people see work as the main point of social activity.  They hang out with the same people in the same field.  Such incestuous relationships are social deadlocks.  The exciting day includes trumpets about switching companies from Sparkletts to Arrowhead, delaying the latest Microsoft operating system, and unexpectedly delivering additional Bic pens.  It is believed to be better than going outside and talking to strangers.  Uuuuuuu ... scary!  Better to stay inside, safe. <br>  If one of your co-slaves is sold to another master, do you lose a friend?  If you work in a field where men reign, does this mean that you never speak to a woman whose rank is higher than the secretarial?  Why not decide for yourself who to socialize with instead of letting the host decide for you?  Believe it or not, there are places on this planet where free people get together.  Only be careful with these unemployed guys, they are a bunch of crazy! <br>  <strong>9. Loss of freedom.</strong> <br>  It takes a lot of work to tame a person to be an employee.  The first thing to do is to break a person‚Äôs desire to be independent.  A good way to do this is to give him a weighty set of rules, filled with absurd rules and instructions.  This will lead to the fact that the new employee will become more obedient, because of the fear of being punished at any moment for something obscure.  So the worker will better conclude that it is safest to obey the host commands without question.  Add a little office policy for better digestibility and get a fresh slave mind. <br>  As part of obedience training, workers are often taught how to dress, talk, walk, and everything else.  We could not have workers thinking independently, can we now?  It destroys everything. <br>  God, it is forbidden to put pots on the desktop, it is against the rules of the company.  Oh no, this is the end of the world!  Cindy has a pot on the table!  Call the bouncer!  Send Cindy back for another sterilization training! <br>  A free man, of course, thinks that such rules and regulations are foolish.  The only rule he needs is ‚ÄúBe smart.  Be nice  Do what you love.  Enjoy it." <br>  <strong>10. Becoming a coward.</strong> <br>  Have you noticed that working people have an almost unlimited ability to complain about problems in their companies?  But they really do not need a decision - they just want to go and make excuses, they say, it's all someone else‚Äôs mistake.  This receipt of work somehow sucked the free-thinking out of them and turned them into spineless cowards.  If you can't call your boss a nonentity without the risk of being fired, you are no longer free.  You become the property of your master. <br>  When you work with cowards all day, do you think it will spread to you?  Of course spill over.  It is only a matter of time when you sacrifice the noblest parts of your humanity on the altar of fear: first courage ... then honesty ... followed by honor and directness ... and finally free will.  You sell your humanity just for the illusion.  And now your greatest horror is to find out the truth about who you have become. <br>  I don't care how broken you are.  It is never too late to show courage again.  Never! <br>  <strong>Still want a job?</strong> <br>  If you are now a well-treated and well-bred worker, your reaction to the above should be defensive.  This is part of the processing.  But you must admit that if you saw the grain of truth above, you will not react too emotionally to it.  This is just a reminder of what you already know.  You can deny your cell as you wish, but it is still there.  Perhaps everything happened so gradually that you didn‚Äôt notice anything until now ... like a lobster enjoying a nice warm bath. <br>  If any of this made you mad, then you have stepped in the right direction.  Rage is a higher level of awareness than apathy, so it is much better than being numb all the time.  Every emotion - even a surprise - is better than indifference.  If you work through feelings instead of suppressing them, then your bravery will soon be on the threshold.  And when this happens, you will want to do something with the situation and begin to live a full life instead of the life of a domesticated pet, which you have been trained before. <br>  <strong>Happily unemployed.</strong> <br>  What is the alternative to getting a job?  The alternative is to remain happily unemployed and earn income in other ways.  Imagine that you earn income by delivering value ‚Äî not time ‚Äî so find a way to provide your best value to others and ask for a fair price for it.  One of the simplest and most accessible ways is to start your own business.  By doing what you would do while at work, find a way to deliver the same value directly to those who can benefit most from it.  It takes a little more time to get started, but freedom easily compensates for the initial time and energy costs.  Then you can buy your own sugar pits. <br>  And of course, everything that you have learned along the way you can distribute to others in order to produce even more value.  So even your mistakes can be money. <br>  Here are some free resources to help you get started: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/courage-to-live-consciously.htm">The Courage To Live Consciously</a> (article on how to move to more meaningful work, English) </li><li>  Podcast # 006 - <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/11/stevepavlinacom-podcast-006-how-to-make-money-without-a-job/">How To Make Money Without A Job</a> (audio, English) </li><li>  Podcast # 009 - <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/12/stevepavlinacom-podcast-009-kick-start-your-own-business/">Kick-start Your Own Business</a> (audio, English) </li><li>  Podcast # 014 - <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/05/stevepavlinacom-podcast-014-embracing-your-passion/">Embracing Your Passion</a> (audio, English) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/10-stupid-mistakes-made-by-the-newly-self-employed/">10 Stupid Mistakes Made by the Newly Self-Employed</a> (article, English) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/01/how-to-build-a-high-traffic-web-site-or-blog/">How to Build a High-Traffic Web Site (or Blog)</a> (article, English) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/05/how-to-make-money-from-your-blog/">How to Make Money From Your Blog</a> (article, english) </li></ul><br>  One of the greatest fears you will encounter is the fear that you have no real value for others.
