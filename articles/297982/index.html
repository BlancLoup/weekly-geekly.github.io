      PS After the article is given a specific (real) case from life.  We also learn from your examples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ========================== <br>  <b>Work with social media correctly - automate 5 important processes.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The life of the owner and employee of a small business or agency, without a doubt, is always extremely saturated: a lot of tasks like customer service, financial management, marketing, corporate relations overwhelm the list of tasks. <br><br>  Yes, today the market is filled with various tools for outsourcing many processes.  But I know what you thought - you can not rely on the fact that other people do your job correctly.  <b><i>‚ÄúIf you want the work to be done right, do it yourself</i></b> . <b><i>‚Äù</i></b>  But at what price - at the cost of your health and speed of business development? <br><br>  If you want to work effectively with social media, then you should think about outsourcing, or automate processes to work effectively with social media to reduce the daily workload. <br><br>  Ask yourself the following four questions: <br><br><ol><li>  How much of my time weekly goes to work with social media? </li><li>  Can I justify such expenses of social media time with my hourly rate? </li><li>  What will be the benefits for a business when outsourcing or minimizing time costs? </li><li>  What parts of the business will benefit from social media outsourcing? </li></ol><br><br>  <b>5 tasks for working with social media that you no longer have to do yourself</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Do you prefer to outsource 100% of the tasks of working with social media or retain full control, but there are quite a lot of tools that you need to use to automate some tasks in order to free up valuable time. <br><br>  <b>1 - Content Creation</b> <b><br></b> <br>  There is no universal answer to the question of how much content you should create weekly to preserve the interest of social media users, but there is a lot of data confirming the importance of targeted content when working with an audience.  According to HubSpot, blogging companies attract 67% more potential customers every month than those that do not run a corporate blog.  Moreover, the constant flow of content distributed in social media reduces the cost of attracting potential customers by 80%. <br><br>  Colleagues from the company Curata made a <a href="http://www.curata.com/blog/content-writing-services-the-ultimate-list/">huge list</a> with a description of services for generating content. <br><br>  Benefits of outsourcing content formation process: <br><ul><li>  Cost savings. </li><li>  Save time. </li><li>  Benefit from the experience of others in your field. </li><li>  Access to advanced technologies and standards. </li><li>  Permanent presence in social networks. </li></ul><br>  <b>Conclusions: Based on the research data, the right content attracts 67% more potential customers and reduces the cost of attracting at least 80%.</b>  Outsource or automate the process of generating content. <br><br>  <b>2 - Content Administration (Content Curation)</b> <b><br></b> <br>  A long pause and the lack of updates is one of the main causes of users churn.  As mentioned above: an important element of the presence in social media is a constant flow of content.  In social media <b>Content = Money</b> . <br><br>  You can breathe a sigh of relief, since you don't need to write all the content yourself.  Partial inclusion in the stream of content created by someone else is an effective media strategy called Content Curation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù content administration (thematic filtering, sorting, manual or automatic clustering, etc.) allows you to present it in an organized way, combined with some common topic, from an immense amount of information on the Internet. <br><br>  The advantages of content administration are obvious: <br><ol><li>  Increases confidence. </li><li>  Increases customer loyalty. </li><li>  Improves brand reputation. </li><li>  Inspiring and inspiring. </li><li>  Increases brand awareness. </li></ol><br>  Do not believe it?  Here is <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/b2b-content-curation-list-growth">an example of</a> how one software company expanded its mailing list by 130% with smart content presentation. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://heidicohen.com/content-marketing-original-versus-curated-content/">research</a> , from 50 to 75% of the amount of information you share in social media will be ‚Äúexternal‚Äù content (produced by other people).  It is important to properly pack and submit. <br>  Companies that adhere to this rule get 10 times better conversion than those who do not.  The study also showed that smart content in social media is clicked 33% more often. <br><br>  If you are interested in more precise instructions, see the <b>Rule "5-3-2"</b> - the main idea is that for every ten materials that you publish: <br><br><ul><li>  Five Content - Relevant Content from Other Sources </li><li>  Three materials - own relevant content </li><li>  Two materials - personal or funny content as a means of ‚Äúhumanizing‚Äù the brand. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>3 - Increase in the number of subscribers</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Finding new authors on Twitter is usually quite expensive.  Of course, you can always use Twitter's advanced search, but it does not always help. <br><br>  If you have just recently started working with social media, then you need to use the right tools to speed up the process - the tools will allow you to enter keywords into the program, and the program will give Twitter users that fit these criteria.  Using the results you can subscribe to the most relevant users. <br><br>  For example, if you are interested in dog owners, then with the help of such a program you can find people discussing their four-legged friends.  In some cases, similar programs have the ability and subscription to relevant users. <br><br>  But be careful!  It's one thing to find new subscribers.  The other is automatic subscription, which goes against Twitter‚Äôs terms of use.  When you, with the help of these tools, have found potential subscribers, it is better to check them manually and to subscribe yourself. <br><br>  It is imperative to maintain the right mix of subscribers and subscribers.  <b>You should never have more subscriptions than subscribers.</b>  Well, and if there are more subscribers than subscriptions, it means that your page is more attractive than those who have equal or smaller ratio. <br><br>  We tested this theory in two ways: <br><br>  1 - Create a Twitter account and subscribe to more people than were subscribed to us.  <b>Result: slow growth.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  2 - Subscribed for five pages less than it was subscribed to us. <br>  <b>Result: Growth rate doubled.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  We continued testing for several weeks and the result was maintained. <br><br>  There are many different theories about the ratio of subscriptions to subscribers.  The authorship of one of these theories belongs to digiwriteitit.  According to them, when you just got your page, maintain the <b>ratio on a scale of 5: 1</b> .  Do not subscribe to new pages until the ratio becomes 5: 1 (100 subscriptions to 20 subscribers). <br><br>  Required tools: <a href="http://tweetfull.com/">Tweetfull</a> automates the process of finding and subscribing to relevant Twitter accounts.  He also has two options for setting - autopilot or ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù.  In any case, this program will save a lot of time.  We successfully used it for the development of several niche Twitter accounts. <br><br>  <b>4 - Publishing content on multiple platforms</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Manual update of all your accounts in social networks is the same as copying the same content to each of your subscribers, one e-mail at a time.  It is difficult to call this process optimal in terms of time.  Many modern tools allow you to instantly share content in several social media at once, modify it and receive reporting on the results. <br><br>  The average American consumes <b>34 gigabytes of content and 100,000 words</b> daily.  This means that you should take measures to ‚Äúget‚Äù the reader among the first and do it on an ongoing basis.  Advanced <a href="https://blog.dlvrit.com/2015/09/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/">programs</a> allow you to analyze thousands of streams in order to determine the best time to publish and publish content when the public is most receptive to it. <br><br>  For example, based on BuddyMedia research, engagement levels on Facebook rise towards the end of the week;  they are <b>up 18 percent on Wednesdays and Fridays</b> .  Another study says that in the B2C sector, sellers get <b>32 percent more feedback on their messages over the weekend</b> . <br><br>  <b>5 - Social listening and brand monitoring</b> <b><br></b> <br>  For companies and owners, the mandatory list of regular affairs includes monitoring of social media.  Independently monitor all week, as we used to do, and we are not the best option.  We tried to find a comprehensive solution that combines several types of monitoring, including: <br><ul><li>  Brand monitoring </li><li>  User Reviews </li><li>  Competitor data </li></ul>  In the modern world, full of social media, people constantly communicate and share their opinions - they publicly discuss things that they had previously discussed only personally with their friends when they met, or by telephone.  We have more information available than ever before.  Social media in combination with the latest technology now allows you to: <br><br><ul><li>  Instantly respond to discussions relating to you and your brand. </li><li>  Understand what data competitors share, with whom and what they are talking and negotiating. </li><li>  Understand prospects and find ideas for new products. </li><li>  Improve customer service quality </li></ul><br>  <b>Basic elements of social media monitoring strategy</b> <b><br></b> <br>  <b>Brand monitoring</b> <b><br></b> <br>  You are probably interested to know what they say about you, the company and your products every day.  Eighty-three percent of consumers say online reviews affect their perception of companies and 80% say that negative feedback influenced their buying decision (source: eMarketer.com) <br><br>  In addition to monitoring the name and URL of your company, consider including the following monitoring elements: <br><ul><li>  Related or related concepts / terms from your line of business or business.  You can get information about the market and improve the product sold. </li><li>  Mention and context of key employees.  Award the most effective ones. </li><li>  Negative reviews, for example, ‚ÄúCompany XYZ - sucks.‚Äù  It is important to respond as quickly as possible to quickly resolve the problem and prevent it from growing in the info field. </li><li>  Mention your scope and words such as ‚Äúrecommend,‚Äù ‚Äúrecommendation,‚Äù and ‚Äúadvice.‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Customer service</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Social media is an important element of modern life.  Social networks are a new phone.  For example, when people contact you on Twitter, they assume that you are always in touch and can quickly answer questions - <b>42% of people expect the answer to come within 60 minutes</b> . <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ol><li>  Customize key phrases that include the brand name and words like ‚Äúhelp,‚Äù ‚Äúsupport,‚Äù ‚Äútech support.‚Äù </li><li>  Listen to new ways customers use your product. </li><li>  Remember about good manners: give thanks for retweets, positive references and reviews. </li><li>  Subscribe to your social media buyers. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Competitor Information</b> <b><br></b> <br>  In the general case, when it comes to monitoring social media about the activity of competitors, refrain from getting into conversations.  Accept the role of an active listener in order to gather important information, and not with the purpose of watering competitors with mud and, thereby, promoting your product. <br>  Keep track of the name of the competing brand, its URL and accounts in social networks: <br><br><ul><li>  Add negative characteristics to the name of the competing brand. </li><li>  Give your customers attention.  Help the customers of your competitors.  Sincerely offer help in solving their problems. </li></ul><br><br>  Of the Russian-language social media monitoring systems, Brand Analytics is the leader, which for small businesses and individuals has a separate cost-effective <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/express/"><b>Express</b></a> system with a <b>free probe for 100 mentions</b> : 10 seconds to register and you can use the probe and see if anyone knows you and if they know what they say? <br><br>  <a href="https://blog.dlvrit.com/2015/12/social-media-automation/"><i>A source</i></a> <br>  ============================== <br><br>  According to the advice from the article, and in order to dilute its boring text of the translation, we will give a real example from the latter: <br><br>  A few days ago, a regular study ‚ÄúSocial Networks Winter 2015/2016‚Äù was published, which was massively distributed across hundreds of media outlets and thousands of accounts.  Below are two approaches to implementing content administration: <br><br>  <b>1. Clever administration of content</b> : Rosbalt agency (who does not know - is based in St. Petersburg) filed a study under the ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg sauce‚Äù in its material: <br>  <a href="http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2016/01/16/1480358.html"><i><b>"Petersburgers most often in Russia write to social networks"</b></i></a> <a href="http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2016/01/16/1480358.html"><br></a> <br>  The result is that all St. Petersburg online publications and thousands of St. Petersburg people in social networks gave material and links to agency material: <i>Hooray!</i>  <i>The northern capital has bypassed Moscow!</i> <br><br>  <b>2. (without) Smart content administration:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  We will not cite the publication; apparently, this day was simply not asked by the content editor, so the same study was submitted with ‚Äúpearls‚Äù of the type: <br><ul><li>  <i>‚ÄúAccording to the results of the study, it turned out that most often the citizens of Russia wrote on the social network Vkontakte‚Äù.</i> <br></li><li>  <i>‚ÄúThe gender of the authors is distributed as follows, in Vkontakte the female gender leads by a small margin.</i>  <i>In Twittere male gender.</i>  <i>In Odnoklassniki there are more users of women as in Instagram ¬ª</i> <br></li></ul><br>  Congratulations to users of women and the male gender of Twitter (and other social media) on holidays - may you always have time for happiness! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297982/</a></p>
