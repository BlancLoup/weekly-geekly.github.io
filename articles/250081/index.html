      Conference reports will be purely TECHNICAL.  In a programme: <br><ul><li>  more than 20 technical reports from mobile development experts; </li><li>  Masterclasses from the guru of programming for iOS and Android; </li><li>  Free communication zones - the possibility of informal contact with the participants. </li></ul><br><br>  At the conference WILL NOT: <br><ul><li>  reports on marketing and promotion of mobile applications; </li><li>  presentations about investments, startups, business models, monetization, etc .; </li><li>  lectures on the implementation of Agile and other development methodologies; </li><li>  coworking, hackathon and other annoying bazvord-activities. </li></ul><br><br>  From similar conferences in Russia there is only the Moscow conference <a href="http://mbltdev.ru/">#MBLTDev</a> from the company e-Legion and ... and that's it.  All other conferences are engaged in games, promotions, traffic and other non-developer activities.  So it's nice that at least someone besides us has appeared in this field :) Because at other conferences, of course, developer reports come across, and sometimes whole sections, but this, unfortunately, is still not enough.  Especially against the background of the growing number of technical mobile conferences in Europe and the USA. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  What was wrong with Mobius 2014 </h5><br>  Last year, we conducted Mobius for the first time and, admittedly, made a lot of mistakes.  We conducted a survey among the participants of Mobius 2014, and these are the negative points that came to light: <br><ul><li>  little attention was paid to the preparation of speakers - some were unprepared; </li><li>  in some reports there was a lot of advertising; </li><li>  we made serious discounts on tickets a couple of weeks before the conference, as a result of which offended those who bought tickets in advance; </li><li>  The format of the round table on security turned out to be boring. </li></ul><br><br>  What did we do this year to correct the situation? <br><ul><li>  Speakers training.  We just listen to experienced and good speakers 1-2 times before the conference via Skype and make comments.  For those who are not very experienced, we will conduct a series of trainings on the structure of the material and its presentation, thus ensuring the good quality of the reports; </li><li>  Advertising in reports.  We thoroughly review all reports and remove all ad from presentations :) </li><li>  Price policy.  This time prices will be tightly tied to time; </li><li>  Round table.  We began to study round tables at other conferences and noticed that even though they come across interesting, but classical reports are still better perceived.  Probably this year we will cancel the round table.  If we leave, we will change the format by adding a hard moderation. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Mobius 2014: now for the good </h5><br>  First of all, we note that there were some really strong reports. <br><br><h6>  Cordova / PhoneGap </h6><br>  <b>Anton Keks</b> from Tallinn clearly and in the case told why they use Cordova / PhoneGap in their Codeborne.  The report turned out to be excellent, and from the comments, I would note that the topic of when to write cross-platform software was not disclosed, and in which it is worth writing native code. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hupqKYAtus%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiqShuxfrY_2OrCicdmZQFgS9uTlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  Kotlin for Android </h6><br>  <b>Andrew Breslav</b> from JetBrains talked about how his offspring, the Kotlin programming language, can be used to develop for Android.  Judging by the reviews, the people imbued with ideas: some installed themselves Kotlin priamo at the conference and began to indulge in breaks with him! <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VU_L2_XGQ9s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTVFmcu1pmloI3UvVYN_Zwtr9fKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  Android application protection </h6><br>  <b>Mikhail Dudarev</b> and <b>Ivan Kinash</b> from the Moscow company Licel made a rather deep report and told about those aspects of the development where the developers usually don‚Äôt agree.  True, the advertising of their product in the report was a bit much for my taste.  From the buns was hacking the game right during the report :) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QtmHFgDXKQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxJkJcz7qOXTvaEQvHava4IU2FzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  The insides of the Android platform </h6><br>  <b>Alexey Nikitin</b> from Odnoklassniki, right at the conference, was engaged in surgical activity and dissected Android.  In fact, as rightly written in the reviews, the topic of the report was supposed to sound like "Interprocess communication in Android and several other chips."  It was told about AshMem and about some problems in Binder.  Well, about the first 30 seconds of the life of the application in general, you can do a separate report.  Interesting there is enough. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8OFdevMPLQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgT6N_Ksn9M1BuMtODXqHal79Zmeg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Mobius 2015: what awaits us </h5><br>  Now back to what awaits us at Mobius 2015. This will be a classic conference, with three parallel streams, reports of 50-60 minutes, questions and answers, and an exhibition area from sponsors: Odnoklassniki companies, Luxoft, and others. <br><br>  Reports already approved: <br><ul><li>  Mikhail Dudarev from Licel will talk about how your application can survive in untrusted environments; </li><li>  Ivan Kinash, his colleague, will make a report on the use of the hardware capabilities of modern processors to create a secure Android environment; </li><li>  Denis Kretov from Notissimusou will talk about iBeacon technology in payment solutions; </li><li>  Alexey Rybakov from DataArt will tell about the development for SmartWatches: Apple WatchKit, Android Wear and TizenOS; </li><li>  Alexey Zinoviev from Tamtek will talk about how to build geo-mobile applications, what frameworks to use, whether to connect Google Maps or Bing Maps, how to bypass the pitfalls associated with limits and text licenses, as well as the most popular types of similar applications, their advantages and cons; </li><li>  Phillip Keks, the younger brother of Anton, mentioned above, working for the Estonian company Creative Mobile, will talk about testing mobile games; </li><li>  Yuri Buyanov from Odnoklassniki will talk about how to get rid of a heap of unnecessary actions when developing mobile applications and, thereby, save yourself a lot of time; </li><li>  Vladimir Ivanov from Kaspersky Lab will talk about mobile malware; </li><li>  Michael Samarin from the Finnish company Futurice will talk about the effective use of the latest versions of Unity; </li><li>  Danil Nikiforov from Tamtak will talk about Couchbase lite for iOS, the analogue of NoSQL for mobile platforms; </li><li>  Finally, Andrey Belenko from NowSecure will talk about what‚Äôs worth and what not to do to protect the data of iOS applications. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34e/bf8/94b/34ebf894b5dc4a78b7ccb8018a8846aa.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, we have already announced more than half of the planned number of reports.
