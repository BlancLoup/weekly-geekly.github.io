To properly build communication with the typical representative of this profession, you need to understand how he thinks, how he lives.  Being often a very introverted person, he does not verbalize his thoughts enough to communicate with him in the same language.  But now we will slightly open up what lies behind our silent concentration ... <br><br>  What is programming for me?  At school and in the first year of uni, I literally breathed for them.  I quickly learned new languages, technologies, I was always looking for something new, more.  When any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new project came, I came to life.  It's like falling in love ... For a while.

      I tried to see everything behind the line of code something more, but I did not understand this about myself.  To the question "what's next?" I had nothing to answer.  I did not understand why I should study further, but there was a kind of whip ‚Äî the army.  So I had to step over through myself and take stupid labs, learn all sorts of crap and take it.  But I did not see further meaning.  I started to unwind this chain and came to a standstill.  All this work seemed to me to be some sort of small, not interesting enough, boring.  Sleep, computer, internet.  Occasionally there was laziness, apathy and nothing reluctance. <br><br>  But it was not a depression.  I would not even listen if I began to rub about it.  Depression is about those who are not good.  And it happens to me very well, it happens very badly, but I am not depressed ... And in general, you yourself are depressed!  I had no idea what it was.  I thought it was such a bad emotional state - autumn, rain, everything, everything was sad and depressed, well, or there vitamin deficiencies are not enough.  Bad conditions are covered and released.  Periods of stagnation alternate with periods when you can work for days, you want it, and this is a thrill.  Worse, when you want all this less, and everyday life is covered with a gray haze ... It seems like a childhood, when you think that adults know everything, and when you grow up, you realize that adults can make, well, very childish mistakes. <br><br>  In my student years, programming really filled me up.  He was engaged in freelancing, looking only for interesting tasks in order to stretch the brain and learn something new.  For money and the amount did not chase.  It more or less kept me afloat, supported the desire to live and work, gave me joy.  It is clear that not always, but for the most part. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I already read all the esoteric and smart books on psychology.  Again, it was enough only for the first time, then - loss of interest and apathy. <br><br>  Now I understand that many, like me, are looking for something, they themselves do not know what it is.  But this is something missing.  And this is such a hidden ‚Äúlack‚Äù, because we don‚Äôt even realize it, we don‚Äôt give ourselves an account of this need to find something. <br><br>  Systemic-vector psychology calls these states latent depression.  That is, it is still the same depression, but its manifestations are not so noticeable and not so vividly manifested - tiredness, problems with sleep, doing work through force, or just such a reduced interest in the environment, but not total.  From the side of a person in general can look quite successful. <br><br>  At the same time, depression as such is a feature exclusively of people, in whose character the <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/zvukovoi-vektor">Sound Vector</a> is present.  He sets a certain direction to our desires, and these needs dominate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Abstract intelligence ... When I first heard that the sound vector gives a person abstract intelligence and that all programmers are sound engineers, could not understand for a long time why abstract intelligence was for a programmer, for some reason I thought that logic was more important for writing programs.  It turns out that the actual program is the brainchild of the ‚Äúsound mind.‚Äù  Abstract intelligence is the ability to comprehend abstraction.  Abstracting from the surrounding reality, we strive to comprehend what is removed from this reality as much as possible ... <br><br>  It seems to have nothing to do with programming.  So it is, programming is only a substitute, a children's designer, a model of what abstract sound intelligence is actually intended to be directed to ... Doshingularity.  The answer is still not found, but how do you want to know the meaning, damn it, of this life ... In general, if not the program of the universe, then at least write your own little program so that it works according to your plan ... The Internet is also a sound design , in combination - his happy place ... <br><br>  So about this hidden depression ... Actually, the presence of a sound vector and the related search for the meaning of life is already a hidden depression. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that there are a lot of sound people who do not verbalize these their questions about the meaning of life and do not define their own depression.  The same atheists who say ‚ÄúThere is no God!‚Äù - but even this is already an indicator of the presence of a sound vector and the ‚Äúsearch for God‚Äù, even if they did not find it, but only the sound artists have a search for the root cause and some unknowingly feelings in the sound vector at the expense of their other, extroverted vectors - addicted to sports (using the skin vector), silence themselves with endless idle talk, jokes or scandals (through the oral vector), travel and go to parties (through the visual vector).  But the depression does not go away from this and over the years only grows.  Such anguish attacks at times, even climb the wall ... To get to the red button and bang the whole world to hell ... the world will crash, and I along with it ... <br><br>  By the way, funny observation, but a joyful reaction to events of catastrophes can also serve as a sign of hidden depression ... Conduct an experiment: rush into a room to a familiar programmer, slap him on the shoulder and exclaim with a grimace of horror on his face: ‚ÄúVaska!  There ... on TV ... the volcano exploded, and the tsunami wave covers North America! ‚ÄùAnd watch the reaction of his everlastingly indifferent friend.  As he jumps, as if stung and rushes to the TV, and even if he says something like, ‚ÄúMy God, what a horror!‚Äù, A spark of joyful animation plays in his eyes ... <br><br>  According to the materials of the training <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/">system-vector psychology of Yuri Burlan.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285038/</a></p>
