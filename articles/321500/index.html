This is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/snap-linked-to-swiss-startup-that-fights-product-copycats">reported</a> by Bloomberg.  It refers to information that Comrade Balmelli registered the same email address as Snap employees. <br><br>  Laurent Balmelli, co-founder of the Strong.Codes startup, will strengthen the defense that is so necessary for service in the current environment.  It‚Äôs just that developers of a successful application gape a little, as tricky and cunning envious people will immediately do reverse-engineering or something worse - for example, exploit vulnerabilities. <a name="habracut"></a>

      It is possible that Snap has already bought a startup that is not yet two years old.  Strong.Codes develops and sells technologies to protect software products from hacking and copying.  However, representatives of Snap do not comment on these conjectures yet. <br><br>  At the end of December, they opened an office in Switzerland and registered it at the same address as Strong.Codes.  On the transition to Snap the rest of its co-founders - Johan Wirley, Julien Rinaldini and Pascal Junot - also nothing is known.  Although it can be assumed that Balmelli himself did not agree to move, and the company opened an office in Switzerland. <br><br>  Experts Bloomberg believe that the invitation to the company Balmelli was a kind of unfriendly gesture in the first place with respect to Facebook.  The latter implemented many features of Snapchat in its own projects - for example, on Instagram.  In the fall of 2016, Facebook launched the endangered messages and avatar filters on samples in Poland and Australia already in its messenger.  Such ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù does more harm to Snap than Facebook, because last week Snap Inc submitted an application for an IPO, Bloomberg does not let up.  However, Zuckerberg has a special relationship with the creators of Snapchat.  About it already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321372/">wrote</a> on "Habr√©" on February 7. <br><br>  On the other hand, why should Facebook steal the code or do reverse engineering if you can just look at Snapchat and implement the most favorite features yourself? <br><br>  In any case, Snap hopes to compete with Zuckerberg and his team.  Snap Inc plans to raise about $ 3 billion in IPO through the sale of shares.  The start date of the IPO has not yet been determined, however, there are those who have already begun to actively buy shares.  True, this is connected with a curious <a href="http://www.bbc.com/russian/news-38905637">story</a> , which, however, does not seem so to everyone. <br><br>  The appearance on the stock exchange of a company called Snap Interactive caused a stir among traders.  However, it soon became clear that <a href="http://www.snap-interactive.com/">Snap Interactive</a> has nothing to do with the owner of Snapchat. <br><blockquote>  Snap Interactive is a relatively small company based in New York.  She develops mobile dating and video messaging applications in real time. </blockquote>  The cost of the company was estimated at about $ 54 million, but thanks to the rush buyout of its shares in less than a week increased in price by 95%. <br><br>  Shares of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.">Snap</a> have not yet been put up for sale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321500/</a></p>
