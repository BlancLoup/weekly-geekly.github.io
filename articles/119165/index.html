      - Our company was founded over a hundred years ago ... <br><br>  It's just amazing how people love to do that.  From the first seconds they sit down on the ears of the audience with a story about themselves: <br><br>  - We offer a SAAS solution ... <br><br>  - Our technology ... <br><br>  And my favorite: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI will begin the story with who we are ...‚Äù <br><br>  Why is everyone so sure that this is what interests the listeners in the first place?  The only thing that the speaker is guaranteed to receive in such a speech is the claim to himself and his company. <br><br>  I saw how one of the Microsoft directors shouted a loud hooting, and a representative of Rostelecom was caustic trolling from the audience only because they spoke on this template. <br><br>  Why does it happen every time? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In the book "iPresentation" Carmine Gallo says that the absolute majority of the wrong way to prepare for their performances.  What do they do first?  Open PowerPoint and begin to throw slides.  Then they go to the event and get a natural result - the indifference of the audience to everything said. <br><br>  The book describes how Steve Jobs works when he needs to present something.  No matter how you feel about the head of Apple, the main thing is that there are given the most valuable information on the preparation and construction of the speech. <br><br>  In the very first part there is given the main advice.  If you are preparing for a presentation, first close PowerPoint.  Take paper, pen and write this: <br><br>  1. How do you talk about your listeners? <br><br>  2. What thought should they take out from the presentation? <br><br>  3. Describe your ‚Äúdeclaration of passion‚Äù?  Admit to yourself why you so love to do what you say? <br><br>  4. Write twitter-like headlines. <br><br>  5. Imagine an antagonist: who or what is the enemy of your listeners? <br><br>  6. Imagine the hero: how do you submit the subject of your story?  How will he defeat the antagonist? <br><br>  7. Mark the three things you will talk about.  Three components of your presentation. <br><br>  The book is good, but as with any theory, the main thing is its translation into practice.  I needed more information to think about.  Therefore, I took the points described and made a special checklist.  I promised myself not to open any programs and not to plan any slides until I write on it in writing: <br><br>  1. Write the subject of the speech.  Everything else is considered on the basis of this subject. <br><br>  2. Draw your audience, all listeners or types of listeners, if there are a lot of them. <br><br>  3. Write who they are, what they do, their characteristics, what they are interested in, what they need most? <br><br>  4. Who or what they don't like?  What is stopping them?  What is the nail in the ass?  If not, then who or what could be? <br><br>  5. What you offer will save them?  How? <br><br>  6. What should happen after the presentation?  Remember, if it is not clearly described, there will be no exhaust. <br><br>  7. Declare your passion.  What is great about what you do?  Is this really true?  Admit it yourself. <br><br>  8. Write three points, three parts, three things about which you will tell.  This is a blueprint for your presentation plan.  Use it. <br><br>  9. In this place you already have phrases that could become slogans.  Rewrite them so that they fit into Twitter. <br><br>  Having tried to apply the methods described, I obtained the desired result from the very first presentation.  I just can‚Äôt imagine the thought that I would ever say anything the old way. <br><br>  I am sure that by taking any presentation from those unfortunate ones that you saw and driving it out on the checklist, it will become obvious to you how to rework it so that it succeeds.  Well, do not forget to read the book.  There is much more than I can tell here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119165/</a></p>
