  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FSIN against the laws of physics or bees against honey</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  The Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) plans to make changes to the legislation, according to which it will be impossible to use mobile communications on the territory of correctional institutions, said Valery Boyarinev, deputy director of the FSIN, told Interfax. </blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/ai/af/gvaiafl7ae8kv2mkp06g4ubx2m0.png" alt="image"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5be3ce929a79474a2dbc6f75%3Ffrom%3Dnewsfeed">Read more at RBC</a> </p><br><p>  Let's see what is at stake.  A representative of the Federal Penitentiary Service said that 10,000 crimes connected with the illegal transfer of cell phones to detainees were prevented in the territory of correctional institutions for 6 months.  Statistics, on the one hand, show that a lot of work has been done.  On the other hand, nothing is said about how many phones were transferred after all.  It can also be assumed that this was a planned figure for the identification of offenses, which was successfully implemented, and the remaining part was simply not included in the statistics (the painful round figure for the reporting period of 6 months)? </p><br><p>  In fact, the article is not about administrative methods of dealing with this type of offenses and not even about technical means, such as video surveillance systems, the <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/19/09/2018/5ba239649a7947b5fc8683a2">cost of which is estimated at 16 billion rubles.</a>  and not even about the fact that these illegal acts with a high degree of probability are committed by employees of these very institutions (who, besides them, has access to the premises?).  Speech about the fact that representatives of the Federal Penitentiary Service believe that it is enough to amend the legislation of the Russian Federation and the laws of physics (the <a href="https://habr.com/post/158161/">theory of propagation of radio waves</a> ) will be arranged to work in the new reality (radio waves will cease to spread immediately at the intersection of the fence with barbed wire).  Agree sounds weird?  Let us assume that such a decision will indeed be taken at the legislative level.  At the same time, the laws of physics will not change because of this, and this means that cellular operators, in order to avoid violation of the law, will be forced to turn off or deploy their towers within a radius of 3 km from the relevant institutions in various cities of the country and in a radius of 30 km from those that are not in the cities, but in their vicinity.  Yes, the task is likely to be accomplished, but quite civilians of the country who happen to be lucky to live or temporarily move near the relevant institutions will be among those left without communication.  In such zones, in particular, there will be a population in the center of St. Petersburg in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSIZO No. 1 (Kresty), in Moscow in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSIZO No. 1 ("Matrosskaya Silence"), in Vladimir in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPrison No. 2 ("Vladimirsky Central "), and so on.  It is also not at all clear what to do if there is a residential settlement next to the colony, whose task is the maintenance of this very territory, and it is also a ‚Äúcity-forming enterprise‚Äù, and there is only one single tower for the entire territory? </p><br><p>  Well, now let's talk quite a bit about the technique and what methods exist to combat this evil: </p><br><p>  <b>Jammers</b> </p><br><p>  The decision is quite obvious, but as noted by the representative of the Federal Penitentiary Service, it is expensive.  Indeed, a simple <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fnewwindow%3D1%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26ei%3DqnDpW9v6JIerrgSj1qvwCA%26q%3D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%26oq%3D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%26gs_l%3Dpsy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.0.0.0.15208.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.zfwlehw_5TQ">Google request</a> gives a lot of options.  On one of the sites there is even a separate section "Powerful communication jammers for UFSIN", only the prices in it are for some reason indicated in USD.  Strange ... But what about our import substitution program?  Is our industry unable to reproduce something similar on the domestic element base?  Well, let's say ... Then maybe the jammers, from the category "Jammers for EGE"?  They already stand somehow more democratic and in rubles.  In the extreme case, you can buy a few pieces to increase the signal suppression zone, and for the time of the USE themselves, use them for their intended purpose. </p><br><p>  <b>Substitute base stations</b> </p><br><p>  Place on the territory of the base station with indor-coating, which would be included without encryption and brought to the appropriate "technical means of control" (with the possibility of on-line wiretapping).  They see the following problems: </p><br><ul><li>  it is impossible to ensure registration in this base station only those who really have the right to such registration. </li><li>  The propagation of radio waves from base stations is also heavily controlled, and some honest citizens within their service area will fall into ‚Äúcontrols‚Äù.  Fearfully?  Yes, no, not scary.  An honest person can speak quite freely without fear that he will break something. </li><li>  interception is not quite trivial, but the most important is the decryption of data that can be transmitted through this base station.  The solution in this case is simple - to give the opportunity to register in it for the needs of data transmission, but suppress the data transmission itself.  This is no longer difficult. </li><li>  Formally, to ensure wiretapping, you need a court decision to wiretap a specific subscriber, however, for this particular case, this cannot be considered a problem. </li></ul><br><p>  <b>Sensors, fixing</b> <del>  radioactivity </del>  radio emission in the zone </p><br><p>  A mobile phone is an active thing that tends to emit radio waves in a certain range and with a certain power.  Upon detection of the output of the device to the airwaves, a red light on the corresponding console lights up and a green rocket takes off. <br>  The problem is quite simple - it is also expensive and also not reliable (it can always "break" ...) </p><br><p>  Let's summarize the disappointing result - how not to turn around, but the operators are to blame (for-profit organizations that provide services and slightly raise the country's economy).  They are the ones in an unbridled thirst for profit that refuse to cooperate on this issue and nothing remains except to cover ‚Äúcertain zones‚Äù of the country with a ‚Äúcap of silence‚Äù (in which radio waves do not spread). </p><br><p>  Cherry on the cake can be the following: </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.znak.com/2018-11-13/fso_i_fsb_zaymutsya_razrabotkoy_programmy_podavleniya_sotovoy_svyazi_v_koloniyah_i_sizo">FSO and FSB will develop a program of suppressing cellular communication in the colonies and SIZO</a> </blockquote><p>  The funny thing about this news (if it is of course true) is that the working group did not include "techies" such as ZNIIS and / or the operators themselves.  In the part of the operators, the answer is obvious - "their lust for profit" will certainly not allow constructive work. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD</strong> <br>  Let me reply to the comment <a href="https://habr.com/users/albik/" class="user_link">albik</a> .  The article was intended for geektimes.ru ... As for the "grieved", I would say that Yes, grieved.  Recently, the state has ‚Äútaken up‚Äù telecom operators and regulates with praiseworthy zeal that in regulation, by and large, does not need much, disregarding either the technical or the financial component, considering that operators need to be milked and they owe to the state a share of the population‚Äôs money, ensuring surveillance, wiretapping, and storing everything that passes through them.  The main message is ‚Äúyou need to bark at them‚Äù and they will do everything.  How much it will cost is not our concern (they have enough money for ALL). </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD</strong> <br>  Quite a large number of fraudulent calls and SMS-messages like "Your card is blocked" comes just from correctional institutions. </p><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
