There are currently not many places in the world that directly accept DASH as a means of payment.  The most notable successes in this area are the addition of DASH to the most common Lamassu bitcockomats ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dg1YDPZIMCS4">integration continues</a> ) and the issuance of specialized bank cards.  We interviewed the co-owner of ‚ÄúShake‚Äù - the first card provider offering customers DASH-linked cards. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In April 2016, ‚ÄúShake pay‚Äù integrated into its Dash platform and began alpha testing.  This company allows its users to replenish their Visa plastic cards with Dash, as well as to spend money through a special mobile Android application that allows making payments for goods and services in all places, supporting payment in a contactless way via NFC (Near Field Communication).  Currently, these cards support USD and EUR as the currency of settlement. <br>  Dashpay Magazine interviewed Shakepay co-owner Jean Amiouny and learned his opinion and vision on business issues.  Gene shared with our readers information about debit Dash-cards, as well as how they plan to take part in the popularization of the payment system and currency Dash.

      <b>Dashpay Magazine (DM)</b> : How would you explain in a simple way: what does Shakepay do today and how did it all begin? <br>  <b>Jean Amiouny (JA)</b> : We could not use our Bitcoins!  We could not go and buy a cup of coffee in a cafe, go to the grocery store, or pay online for our purchase in the Amazon online store using Bitcoins.  Today it is very difficult to pay Bitcoin in most cases.  If you want to spend Bitcoins, you need to change your consumer habits and try to find those rare sellers who agree to accept them as a means of payment - this frustrated us just as it upsets all other Bitcoin users.  Therefore, we created our own Shake service - to solve this problem by issuing debit cards that can be used all over the world and converting cryptocurrency into Fiat when calculating which would occur automatically.  We have added many amazing "chips", such as a mobile application that allows you to pay for purchases with the help of the increasingly popular contactless terminals.  You can learn more about this at this link: <a href="http://blog.shakepay.co/2016/bonjour-world/">http://blog.shakepay.co/2016/bonjour-world/</a> <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : How many people work in your team and what is their skill level? <br>  <b>JA</b> : The basis of the Shake team today is two ‚Äútechies‚Äù with experience in developing payment financial services. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : Could you tell our readers about the recent integration of Dash into your platform, and why did you choose Dash as the first alternative cryptocurrency added to your service? <br>  <b>JA</b> : One of the first users of our service from New Zealand told us about Dash.  The more we read about Dash, the more interest we have this digital currency.  Those features that have been implemented in Dash since the launch based on the Bitcoin source code are really impressive - these are InstantX and Darksend, which make Dash a currency that is very suitable for performing standard transactions.  And besides, the implemented <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24552/">model of project management</a> looks promising. <br>  Using our Shake service, you can replenish your debit card balance with the Dash InstantX feature (this happens instantly and looks just amazing!) <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : What makes Shakepay stand out from other providers of cryptocurrency cards? <br>  <b>JA</b> : We make Bitcoin more convenient to use by issuing pegged debit cards, from which national currencies can be debited from around the world.  This makes the conversion from Bitcoin to local Fiat and back simple and without cross-border additional fees (as it should be). <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : Is your product available in the US?  What are your plans for this market? <br>  <b>JA</b> : Alas, we are not working with US clients yet, but we plan to start working there.  The USA is a very difficult market for the provision of financial services.  State regulation there in this area just rolls over, but we receive many requests to start serving US citizens, so in the near future we plan to start providing our services there too. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : How do your virtual cards work? <br>  <b>JA</b> : Initially, the card itself is a sequence of digital information that can be used for online payment or in POS terminals that work in conjunction with an Android phone (current implementation).  Physical plastic cards for everyone will also be available very soon - we will be able to send them to more than 130 countries. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : How do Shakepay provide security issues? <br>  <b>JA</b> : We use the same security protocols that are used in the banking sector, including the PCI-DSS compliant requirements and the security requirements of the card system.  Interaction with the user via the Internet occurs over a secure SSL protocol. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : What role do you assign to Dash debit cards in promoting and promoting the use of Dash digital currency? <br>  <b>JA</b> : The key point here is the ability to spend your Dash funds anywhere in the world.  Dash InstantX technology looks very impressive when used in conjunction with debit cards - after all, you can instantly replenish such a card with Dash.  For example, a visitor in the queue at the cashier and decides to replenish their ‚Äúdollar‚Äù card.  With the use of Dash cryptocurrency, he can perform this operation in just a few seconds - even before his turn comes to pay by card at the checkout. <br>  We also planned the implementation of a number of special projects involving the active use of Masternod Dash.  Details of this we will inform later, in the course of implementation of these projects. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : What do you think about the current state of Dash cryptocurrency?  How do you see the short-term and long-term future of this project? <br>  <b>JA</b> : The implemented management system and self-financing of Dash development community initiatives is a breakthrough and will play a key role in the long-term development of Dash.  Through the community we will independently determine the future directions of development through the community - the system of incentives and counterweights Dash is much better built than in other cryptocurrency projects. <br><br>  <b>DM</b> : What can our readers expect from your Shakepay service in the future? <br>  <b>JA</b> : More features.  In the near future, we are going to hire a Dash cryptocurrency specialist to help us realize unique Dash capabilities.  So if any of your readers are interested in taking part in this - please send them to me - let them write at jean@shakepay.co.  Most likely we will also make a similar request to the Dash community through the DashWhale website. <br><br>  Thank you for the interview, Gene.  We will keep our readers up to date with the projects of the Shakepay service, especially about everything that concerns the declared project on using the opportunities of Masternode Dash.  We will also monitor your budget offer to the Dash network if you make it. <br><br>  What do you think about debit cards that work in conjunction with the digital currency Dash?  Share your opinion in the comments! <br><br>  <i>(For fans of ‚Äúminus‚Äù, I remind you that I am not the author, the article is transferable.
