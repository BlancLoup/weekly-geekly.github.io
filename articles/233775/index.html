Therefore, the smartphone will be considered as a separate full-fledged model, without affecting its origin in terms of design and main features.  In this case, the smartphone has another "chip", which I will tell you later in the review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  iNew V8 is equipped with a new six-core processor from the company MediaTek called MT6591, the cores operate at 1.5 GHz.  Inside there are 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory with the possibility of expansion with a microSD card.  Display 5.5 inches with HD resolution (1280x720 pixels) and IPS matrix, covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 2 protective glass. 13 megapixel camera, Sony's second-generation sensor with a F2.0 aperture.  V8 works on the Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system.  There is also a wireless connection using NFC technology, support for 2 SIM cards and a special rear touch panel.

Before us stands the iridescent iNew Smartphone inscription that says nothing about the model of the phone, and what lies inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93d/3af/96c/93d3af96ce1441febdb64c3ecad58e9b.jpg"><br><br>  We guess to turn the box and see the name of our gadget with brief technical characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f57/ad8/b50/f57ad8b50bef44e3b00299c553078524.jpg"><br><br>  On the side of the box is a cloth eyelet, with which we open the phone box, turning it back.  After opening our eyes, the phone opens iNew V8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90f/972/0f0/90f9720f0b1b4577b067d6313a57327d.jpg"><br><br>  Let's put the smartphone aside for the moment and see what is inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/502/0d2/f505020d2d2940c7b443bda4d7d625c3.jpg"><br><br>  We will decompose everything separately, so that you can better see what configuration complements the gadget. <br>  We see bundled with the smartphone go: <br><ul><li>  Wired stereo headset </li><li>  Usb cable </li><li>  Charger </li><li>  User's manual </li><li>  Protective film </li><li>  Protective bumper </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d82/fac/2fc/d82fac2fc62d4b618a63972e2d188d4d.jpg"><br><br>  A nice addition was exactly a translucent bumper, well seated on the machine itself. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  iNew V8 has a very interesting and non-standard design.  Sizes of the smartphone: 155.7776.8 mm.  Weight: 166 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c63/7e9/121/c637e91215314618ae7a1180ec3704a8.jpg"><br><br>  Now almost all such devices, the front of the phone consists of a single monolithic glass frame with a frame around it.  Immediately we see the top of the phone, consisting of a beautiful white non-glossy plastic, which smoothly passes into the front of the frame of the device.  Immediately are the sensors of lighting, proximity and conversational speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65f/a9e/034/65fa9e0341eb4266add981fe25977a58.jpg"><br><br>  From the bottom, on the front of the smartphone, we see three touch control buttons: menu, home, back.  They are highlighted, so there will be no problems with their use at night.  Such buttons are present on almost all android smartphones, so everyone will be accustomed to using them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/4a9/361/a8c4a9361720463ab14b68d13e3cad5a.JPG"><br><br>  On the right side of the iNew V8 there are volume rockers and an on / off button of the device.  The arrangement of these buttons is good, they fit well under the thumb and are pressed with a little effort.  It is also excellent tactile sensations, so there will be no problems with finding these keys with your finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a88/7de/cd6/a887decd652f4fc1800397b22df1a27c.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side there are no keys, just a beautiful frame for the entire perimeter.  I think that the manufacturer did the right thing, moving all the control buttons to the right side, since  With such a large diagonal, it will be difficult to press something on the left side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/79e/5d6/d4779e5d63db4807a945d8858ca596f8.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the phone is a connector for charging and connecting to a microUSB PC, a speaking microphone and a 3.5 mm audio jack.  Through native headphones on a standard player, a good balanced sound, not refined, of course, but good.  The cables are well inserted, I did not observe any problems with connecting to these connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/a50/921/833a50921d8e4f5aba2cfdeaf6bac333.jpg"><br><br>  On the upper part, there is nothing but a pivoting camera mechanism.  There is nothing more and should not be, since all the alleged parts of the control are on the right side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/17d/552/ba817d5527e64196b89ad06220871c95.jpg"><br><br>  The back is made of soft-touch white plastic.  In the middle is the inscription iNew.  Below the inscription is a square touch panel that can be used to fit your needs.  It is slightly highlighted on the plastic, so as not to lose its location.  Below is the speaker, its volume is large enough, it is enough to hear the call in the noisiest place.  Just above the dynamics is the marking of the smartphone.  Above is the mechanism by which we can rotate the camera by as much as 207 degrees.  It has a camera eye and a dual LED flash.  Under the camera is a ribbed surface, for which I need it, I did not understand.  It is possible so that the device does not slip out of the user's hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/010/d39/5f7/010d395f78934f43be4380f61e08c331.jpg"><br><br>  Under the back cover we see slots for SIM, microSIM and microSD.  The battery on the phone at 2400 mAh.  Hot swap is not provided.  On the reverse side is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe touch panel, which is connected to the phone when closing and the area for wireless communication through the NFC module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70a/f65/a1c/70af65a1c91048a6a57f58ab9dd42158.jpg"><br><br>  It is safe to say that iNew V8 is built with high quality.  Nothing creaks and does not play.  A sort of monolithic block, which looks spectacular and relatively easy to use, given the size of its screen.  But still, such a screen is considered unnecessarily large for mobile devices.  Also one of the downsides is the absence of the LED event indicator.  I do not know why the manufacturer chose this solution, because it is a very convenient common feature.  Vibro is average, nothing special.  You cannot always feel the vibration, it all depends on the case.  Therefore, I missed one call from three. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  Display 5.5 inches with HD resolution (1280x720 pixels).  Built display based on IPS matrix.  Covered with glass Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The frames on the sides are quite narrow - 4 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acd/539/c18/acd539c1815044a5b572873b42562986.JPG"><br><br>  The display processes up to 5 touches, no problems with the touchscreen is noticed.  All touches are well recognized, no false positives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86a/cfe/ba5/86acfeba5b3e423583e52e1f2b178750.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is very high quality and juicy.  Knowing that the display diagonal is 5.5 ‚Äù, and the resolution is only 1280x720, I was preparing for the apparent graininess.  But when I took the phone in my hands, I tried to look carefully, I never saw the grit.  This made me very happy.  Grain is visible only when you increase the screen photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a38/0ee/fb1/a380eefb19f34e469da0c8bf19ee8c5a.JPG"><br><br>  Brightness margin is very good.  I saw a lot of different phones and their behavior in the sun.  This display fades, but not as much as it could.  At the very sunny day, it still turns out to read information from it, but not as easily as we would like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf5/c85/27e/cf5c8527e84047438374ce113bb99dba.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing angles at the maximum display.  If you look at the display from the sides, you can see that on one side the image turns yellow, and on the other it turns blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/171/a1e/f14/171a1ef14aee483392dcfb1cb4407717.JPG"><br><br>  This is a feature of the matrix, in other phones I watched something similar.  From above and below the image remains the same as it is, only slightly darkens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/867/0b7/142/8670b7142a01490eb28daee6691f5919.jpg"><br><br>  The display is not bad, in general, it pleased me. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERA</font> </h2><br>  One of the main features of iNew V8 is a PTZ camera with a dual-LED flash.  The mechanism of the camera makes it rotate as much as 207 degrees.  To save on the front camera and put a high-quality rear camera manufacturer came to this decision.  Especially this decision will be relevant for lovers of "selfie".  Inside is a second-generation 13 megapixel sensor from Sony with an F2.0 aperture.  The maximum resolution of photos - 4160x3120.  The maximum video resolution is 1920x1080 / 30fps.  In my opinion, the camera shoots very high quality, only software processing overdoes with sharpness in some places, and in some places soaps.  Below are pictures in different conditions, with the help of which everyone will make a conclusion for himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7d/fed/fc6/a7dfedfc6e384fd6a9b4e47e2bcf9387.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26e/2c4/e59/26e2c4e593b2407c9e9a33fe2f1d1870.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/582/496/7c4/5824967c4bf0445ea4a958cc2684f644.jpg"><br><br>  Snapshot at night, focus on the tower with fire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/bc6/506/1a1bc650674f43de9c4d007c58a217bc.jpg"><br><br>  Macro shot, focus on the red area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f28/527/06f/f2852706f67042d5b26b00130b5579b5.jpg"><br><br>  A snapshot of the text, focus on the left page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/84b/91a/7f884b91ab58429d81a4cbc765edc4cf.jpg"><br><br>  As we can see, even though the flash is a two-LED, it does not give anything special.  The lighting is just like a regular flash with a single LED.  It was a bit upsetting, as I had placed many hopes on her, thinking that there would be great shots at night. <br>  Video recording in maximum quality. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GD5Fm24tcfQ&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh1DxvqvU4FLP_jIRSvPGM6WSoVjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Videos are amazingly good quality, perhaps only autofocus is not enough to the ideal.  But still, for the camera of the smartphone, very decent videos are made.  On the laptop screen, the video looks as beautiful as on the screen of the device. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  iNew V8 runs on Android 4.4.2.  There is support for the ART runtime, which is famous for the new version of Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/9ea/df2/0f79eadf2b6f4c64a1cf0e1b592d378b.jpg"><br><br>  The shell is not stock, but modified by the manufacturer iNew. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/ca2/bc3/999ca2bc334445899ea43cee096aa1d0.jpg"><br><br>  Next we can see the changed dialers and SMS applications.  They are quite convenient to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2e/300/5b6/d2e3005b6ff045f7a43b48174c58c594.jpg"><br><br>  A screenshot of the settings window shows us that there are several sections below, through which we can quickly find the settings that we need.  The Russian language was originally in the stock firmware, but unfortunately, there are places where the manufacturer did not bother to do the translation.  Therefore, in these places, we see English words. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/f06/dff/560f06dff91145c49fcf8d7128ebf3dd.jpg"><br><br>  And the rest of the problems were not noticed.  The interface works smoothly, no brakes are noticed.  And thanks to that, because there are top-class phones that have not worked well on optimizing the shell. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  iNew V8 supports the work of 2 SIM cards, one full-size, and the other micro-SIM.  It supports both 2G standard and 3G.  The quality of work of both is very good.  As your interlocutor, and you hear it perfectly. <br>  Wi-Fi is pretty far away.  Communication does not lose and works stably.  Below are screenshots: 1) next to the modem, 2) through 2 walls, 3) through 3 walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/8f7/86a/8c18f786ae3c4db49ab69bf0211958b3.jpg"><br><br>  Bluetooth also works without problems.  Files are perfectly transferred, no gaps were observed. <br>  GPS, surprisingly, also worked fine.  Knowing how many rumors about the curvature of this sensor on the MediaTek platform go, I was delighted.  There is support for AGPS.  Below are screenshots of cold starts: 1) second floor window sill, after 1 minute 30 seconds, 2) sitting in the car, 30 seconds, 3) standing outside, 20 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee5/b2a/f4a/ee5b2af4a5794ec3923101f9f2aca654.jpg"><br><br>  NFC is not as common on phones as other wireless interfaces, but is also present on this smartphone.  With the help of it, files were perfectly transferred to another phone with support for this interface.  So there are no problems with this module either. <br>  There is support for OTG.  We can connect any device from a flash drive to the keyboard.  There is an FM radio.  FM lovers will appreciate the opportunity to listen to their favorite radio stations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  iNew V8 is equipped with a new six-core processor from the company MediaTek called MT6591, the cores operate at 1.5 GHz.  Video accelerator: Mali-450MP 700 MHz.  The same video accelerator is in the processor MT6592, all the difference in the number and frequency of processor cores.  RAM - 1 GB, it is enough to solve all the tasks set before the smartphone.  Built-in memory - 16 GB (13 GB available).  There is a microSD connector for expanding the amount of memory, the card with a size of 64 GB was recognized perfectly.  Look at the benchmark results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/428/541/790428541d9341bd83090b5657729c62.jpg"><br><br>  The results are quite good.  Smartphone is more than enough for all the tasks that are usually placed on a smartphone.  Problems are possible only with very heavy games, but this is a separate class of users who love to customize their device.  Let's take a look at how the individual games will go. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ea.games.r3_row%26hl%3Dru">Real racing 3</a> .  In this game there is a slight subsidence of FPS.  But in general, quite playable.  Half of the people will not notice the difference between a smooth and slightly jerking game.  The graphics settings were such that there was a glare on the car, and from the view from the cab there were reflections in the rear-view mirror. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/983/153/74b/98315374beb7420ba37b64917f06e54b.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.madfingergames.deadtrigger2%26hl%3Dru">Dead Trigger 2</a> .  The game goes smoothly, lags are not noticed at all.  I note the fact that it is quite convenient to play shooters on such a large screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/664/1df/f646641df0c948619d49156cb8be95b9.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM%26hl%3Dru">Asphalt 8</a> .  The quality of the graphics is automatically put on the penultimate.  With these settings, Asphalt 8 was the same as Real Racing 3. There was a FPS subsidence, but also insignificant. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.realdriftportnew.sipon%26hl%3Dru">Real Drift</a> .  This game goes without any brakes on the maximum chart.  For all the testing of flights or any other problems were not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fe/cb4/cd9/6fecb4cd950247fd975088655026ba1e.png"><br><br>  In games, heat is practically not observed, just as in performance tests.  For most users, the power of a smartphone is enough for all tasks.  But podlagivaniya in games a little upset and make it clear that the smartphone is not perfect. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone uses a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 2400 mAh.  There is nothing special to expect here, all at the level of similar products from other companies.  It lasts a day of very active work.  If the owner is not so actively using the phone, then it will be enough for three days of work without any problems, which include several hours of calls, several dozens of SMS, several hours of the Internet and instant messengers.  Below are the results of the latest version of Antutu Battery Test, in which the phone scored 6595 points.  The points were close to the numbers in the name of the processor of this device, which smiled.  In the HD video playback mode with the maximum display brightness, the device worked for 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is not so much.  In the detailed history of the discharge of the battery, you can roughly understand how the device consumes energy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/5c7/11e/ae35c711e51d49c7b75a22a04d56867f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I was expecting a lower energy efficiency of the device than it turned out.  The screen is quite large, and the battery is not so large as it would seem.  But still, the operating time of the smartphone was pleasantly surprised. <br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå ADDITION</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the PTZ camera, iNew V8 has one more feature, this is the back touch panel.  It is provided initially for fans of "selfie", like the camera.  But this panel can be customized to your liking: control the music player, control the camera, scroll through web pages, or launch applications.  Screenshots of settings are presented below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/f06/dff/560f06dff91145c49fcf8d7128ebf3dd.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, this part of the shell is not translated, but now is not about that.  Very good idea and excellent implementation.  Everything works as it was intended by the manufacturer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  Now my thoughts are on this phone.  Push down from its price.  She is $ 214.  In Russia, not officially sold, so you can only order from Chinese electronics stores.  What do we get for this money?  Very solid phone with a sort of "chips", without which he would have been an ordinary Chinese phone on the OC Android.  Is it worth the money?  If you are interested in what the emphasis is on in this device, then of course it is worth it!  Otherwise, not sure, because for the money, you can find devices with better stuffing from similar Chinese manufacturers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Decent performance <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality display <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Latest OS Version <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Loud speaker <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  PTZ camera <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Rear touch pad <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Low price <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Cloned design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Microlags in games <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Impressive battery life <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  The device was purchased in the online store <a href="http://ru.coolicool.com/">Ru.Coolicool.com</a> .
