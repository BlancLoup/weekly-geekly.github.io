      In general, information technology directors are more optimistic than a year ago.  However, six out of ten executives believe that 2013 will place high demands on their organizations, and two thirds (67%) expect problems in the industries where their companies operate. <br><br>  The main problems that executives of enterprise information infrastructures expect to face are the ongoing economic recession, as well as the threat to the information security of companies. <br><br>  Moreover, the security problem worries the North American leaders much more (75%) than their foreign counterparts (61%). <br><br>  64% of CIOs are going to focus on the marketing policy of the information department in order for companies to better understand the capabilities and essence of IT processes.  About a third of managers are actively calling for customer communication, against 18% two years ago. <br><br>  And 34% of CIOs teach their employees to focus on external customers (which are not part of the company), against 25% in 2011. <br><br>  More than half of the surveyed heads of information departments are going to complete in 2013 at least one mobile project in their company. <br><br><h5>  Gradually increasing the attention of companies to large data. </h5><br>  At the same time, 59% of CIOs admit that their organizations are mostly late (34%) or are lagging behind (25%) with the adaptation of such projects.  And only 13% of managers confirmed that their companies were able to fully complete the implementation of projects related to big data.  Nevertheless, 37% expect to complete at least one similar project in 2013. <br><br>  In general, most IT managers (63%) spend most of their time coordinating the information projects being implemented with the business goals of companies, as well as improving system performance (54%), introducing new technologies and architectures (50%) and developing interconnections between the IT department and other structures of companies (45%). <br><br>  However, the trend is that more and more CIOs are striving to devote themselves to solving strategic tasks, including business innovation (54%), developing and revising business strategies (45%) and identifying opportunities to build on competitors (41%). <br><br>  The survey involved 563 information technology directors, who represent companies with annual revenues of $ 100 million or more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165389/</a></p>
