Offer - an advertiser‚Äôs offer to promote a product with a specific payment condition. <br><br>  Products may be different, so the offers are divided into groups depending on the advertised product.  To do this, we introduce the concept of vertical offers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Offer verticals </h2><br>  Vertical offers - not only the category of goods.  The vertical defines the methods and methods of arbitration, the sources of traffic with which you will work, as well as advertising creations and approaches that you will use when promoting this product. <br><br>  Offer verticals may be different, and you should not try to work with everyone at once.  Products from one vertical can be well converted on one traffic, but bad on another. <br>  Let us examine in more detail with the types of verticals and suitable sources of traffic. <br><br><h2>  Types of verticals </h2><br><ul><li>  Games (mobile, computer). </li><li>  Software and services. </li><li>  Utilities - Android apps that speed up your device, save power, offer various screensavers and desktops for mobile phones. </li><li>  Travel: booking of air tickets, rooms in hotels and so on. </li><li>  Dating is divided into two sub-lines: Mainstream dating (the usual dating service for everyone) and Adult (the dating service for more frank relationships). </li><li>  E-Commerce - the sale of physical goods through online stores and websites. </li><li>  Gambling - slot machines, slots and casinos. </li><li>  Binary Options and Forex. </li></ul><br>  Let us return to the concept of an offer and consider the 4 necessary elements for each offer. <br><br><h2>  Offer elements </h2><br>  1. <b>Product</b> .  Without it, nowhere. <br><br>  2. <b>Conversion Flow</b> - user action that will lead to conversion.  For example: filling out a questionnaire or form on a mobile site, confirming a subscription by email, installing or opening a mobile application. <br><br>  3. <b>Payment</b> - there are cheap offers with small payments for the lead, and there are offers where they pay a lot for the lead.  The main difference is not only in numbers: it is important how much money we need to spend on data, in order to understand, the offer works in a plus or a minus.  Usually we need to spend less money on cheap offers: <br><br>  If they pay 20 cents for the offer, then we will get 100 leads for $ 20. <br>  If the offer costs $ 100 and we need 100 leads, then we need to spend $ 10,000 on the test. <br><br>  Beginners should start with tests on cheap offers and then transfer their work schemes to expensive offers. <br><br>  4. <b>Advertiser requirements for the promotion of the offer and conditions for payment.</b>  You need to discuss with the advertiser which creatives to use, which users to attract (gender, age, geo), which traffic sources and attraction methods are allowed.  For example, in Dating: are men under 18 or need only men between 25 and 35?  What geo to put for women: only Russia or only Moscow?  What can be shown, and what is not?  Is there any guide line and brand book?  You also need to discuss which sources of traffic are prohibited: many prohibit such sources of traffic as contextual advertising on their own brand. <br><br>  Now let's talk about how to combine different types of offers with traffic sources. <br><br><h2>  Offers and traffic </h2><br>  Not every vertical offers is suitable for working with any source of traffic.  Why it happens? <br><br>  1. <b>User context</b> . Each traffic source has a different user context in which it is now located: different interests and targeting.  For example, if we have an advertising platform - an advertising portal for young mothers, then we will not be able to advertise an application there aimed at a male audience.  And vice versa: on the advertising platform for children, we will not advertise financial instruments. <br>  When you start working in detail with one vertical, you will understand which methods and traffic sources fit your vertical. <br><br>  2. <b>The cost of attraction</b> .  When we choose an offer and choose the type of traffic, we need to think about where we will attract advertising and understand the difference between the cost of attraction and pay per conversion.  There are expensive sources of traffic on which cheap offers will not work: we will not pass the minimum bar for cost per click or cost of display.  As an example: on expensive branded sites, we will not be able to convert a cheap mobile offer to utilities. <br><br>  3. <b>Conversion Flow</b> .  Not on every type of traffic, a user expects one or another Conversion Flow.  For example, if we have a user on mobile traffic, he is unlikely to fill out a long form for a loan.  This offer is suitable only if there is an alternative Conversion Flow with a small application form. <br><br>  4. <b>Advertising policy</b> .  It introduces large restrictions on advertising offers on certain traffic sources.  Many large advertising networks prevent the spread of advertising on certain categories of goods. <br>  For example, on alcohol categories or on Dating (on Adult).  Very often, utilities on Android are advertised using prelendingov, but not all ad networks allow the use of prelanding. <br><br>  In mobile arbitration there are specific types of offers that are not peculiar to conventional arbitration: mobile installation of applications using the CPI model and mobile subscriptions of PIN Submit. <br>  Consider them in more detail. <br><br><h2>  Mobile installations and mobile subscriptions </h2><br>  Mobile installations are subdivided into different subcategories, and their essence is that the advertiser pays for the installation and opening of the mobile application. <br><br>  There are different mobile applications: <br><br><ul><li>  Utilities (Android launchers, battery boosters, memory saver, and so on) </li><li>  Travel subject (air tickets, booking) </li><li>  E-commerce </li><li>  Games </li><li>  Dating services in the form of mobile applications. </li><li>  Forex and binary options. </li><li>  Various applications services, such as ordering a taxi or pizza delivery. </li></ul><br>  Another type of offer is mobile subscriptions.  They are called "pins", PIN Submit. <br><br>  Pin Submit is also mobile offers that work only on mobile traffic. <br>  For example: the user wants to access the site, but does not download the application, but sends a paid SMS and in return receives access to this content.  He can get a password to access the content. <br><br>  Depending on payment, mobile subscriptions are divided into two types: <br><br>  1. <b>Wap-click or one click</b> .  In this case, the mobile operator determines the mobile subscriber number.  You click on the button, agree to certain conditions and subscribe to a mobile service.  After sending the password content is available to you. <br>  2. <b>Premium SMS</b> when you must send SMS to a paid number.  In this case, there are two more payment options: <br><br><ol><li>  MO - the user sends an SMS to a short number. </li><li>  MT - the user receives an SMS from a paid number. </li></ol><br>  In the second case, the user must confirm with a response SMS or pin code on the site that he agrees to this. <br><br>  This is usually a site with the button "enter", "access", "download".  There are necessarily conditions in which it is stated that the user subscribes for them and, for example, 20 rubles will be charged every day for access to this site until it is unsubscribed. <br><br>  Depending on the country and mobile operator, these rules are differently regulated and described: somewhere you need to specify in an explicit form, somewhere you can write in small text. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  We reviewed the concept of an offer and learned what vertical offerings are.  Disassembled what mobile installations and subscriptions. <br><br>  In the next lesson we will find out where the advertiser places offers, and how to get access to them. <br><br>  You can ask any questions about arbitration in the comments or in <a href="https://vk.com/mobionetwork">our VKontakte group</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321780/</a></p>
