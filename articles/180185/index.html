  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business processes and motivation - ahead of time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Consider the popular ways of employee allocation of their own working time (in order of increasing "level of professional responsibility"): <br><ol><li>  It is necessary to deal with "visible" achievement of specific goals.  If the task needs to be done in a week, and I can in a day - I will pull the time, because I get paid and so. </li><li>  I'm not interested in developing someone else's business. </li><li>  Yes, it is clear that in order to achieve the goals it is necessary to wash the floor and perform a lot of routine - but I will move only if they give a bonus for it. </li><li>  To achieve the goal, you need to build a business process, it‚Äôs clear how, I can describe the necessary steps and options - so that an employee of my qualification could in principle achieve the goal in a similar way.  But then I will not need it and competitors will use it :-) </li><li>  It is clear how to build / optimize the business process.  You can also describe the steps and teach them to perform less qualified staff.  But then I will not be needed and, even worse, the task assigned to me can be undertaken by poorly qualified but more ambitious people who are rushing through the career ladder (for fame and money, for example, Vasya Pupkin). </li></ol><br><br>  So is it worth trying to do more than you need to implement and improve business processes? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My opinion is yes!  It develops you well as a manager and as a specialist - brings a lot of positive experience.  You bring benefits not only to yourself, but to the whole company - and even if it is not appreciated, a feeling of deep satisfaction is provided :-) <br><br>  It is also obvious that efficiency is beneficial primarily to the company itself, so you need to try to unlock the potential of employees 4 and 5 "levels", to protect their creative desire to make the company better.

      Without increasing the level of employees' confidence in the company and vice versa, the goal cannot be achieved.  It is enough to drop the phrases: ‚ÄúNo one is holding you here, there is a queue behind the door‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not express your opinion, first agree with the leader‚Äù, ‚Äúhow I tolerate you, idiots‚Äù - and the matter failed, again ‚Äúthey blew in their pockets‚Äù and ‚Äú marriage contracts ‚Äù:-) Employees who‚Äú frankly do not keep ‚Äùwill not create business processes and a knowledge base to replace them. <br><br>  But if you build and maintain a transparent management scheme, implement a corporate portal and / or an analogue of a corporate social network - where everyone can express their opinions openly and in the case (if not strange, most of them speak out exactly in the case, and not about vacation in Turkey) - then employees will think how to improve the common cause, to invest in the work of parts of himself.  The attitude to work becomes spiritualized, as in the parable: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?  Stones we put.  And what are you doing?  We are building a temple! ‚Äù <br><br>  It is good that there are more and more companies with a similar open creative corporate culture aimed at efficiency in our country. <br><br>  After all, the desire to solve the upcoming tasks as efficiently as possible, without hiding behind them and without stretching the pleasure for all the allotted time, a systematic approach, building a system (business process) alienated from you - creates from a professional employee with a capital letter!  Good luck to all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180185/</a></p>
