Fortunately, technology does not stand still, and there are already services that automate and help solve many problems at all stages of this adventure.  In today's selection - six such useful tools that will be useful to any founder. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://smilebright.media/sb-relocate">SB Relocate</a> </h2><br>  There are quite a few tips on the Internet in the spirit of ‚Äúthe main thing is to come to the United States, and all visa issues will be decided later‚Äù.  However, if this were so, then the country would already be obviously overwhelmed with startups from around the world.  Therefore, issues with documents need to be addressed in advance.

      At this stage, the SB Relocate service will be useful - you can both order a consultation about the move and download step-by-step descriptions of obtaining different types of visas.  To whom they are suitable, how to understand whether there are chances - all such questions can be answered for a couple of tens of dollars.  Plus service - the presence of a fully localized Russian version. <br><br>  In addition, you can order data collection on your introductory - for example, if you have a startup whose founders want to move, the service will ask you to fill out a brief, and then you will be sent a pdf with recommendations on the type of visas and their design. <br><br>  The library of documents for the service and the service of paid consultations save time and are cheaper than the initial consultations of migration lawyers (usually about $ 200). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/a5/oa/e0a5oafcvbl5-eueplnsdzwrxao.png"><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://thenameapp.com/">The name app</a> </h2><br>  Another important element of a successful business is the name.  But in the US, there is so much competition - according to <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-small-business-startups-2491.html">statistics</a> , more than 627 thousand companies are registered annually - that it can be difficult to choose. <br><br>  The Name App service helps you find the name and domain name for your startup.  In addition, it helps to check the availability of appropriate usernames in the most popular social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/qm/la/ltqmlabdl5anlnt7qkar_upkx-g.png"><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.clerky.com/">Clerky</a> </h2><br>  You have chosen a name, have established a process for obtaining a visa, now it‚Äôs time to register a company.  You can do it remotely, but not without difficulties. <br><br>  In particular, not all popular paperwork automation services support the launch of a business for founders from the Russian Federation.  These include Stripe Atlas - it does not register companies that "do business in certain countries."  And Russia is on this list (it also includes, for example, Somalia, Iran, North Korea). <br><br>  Alternatively, Stripe Atlas can use Clerky.  On this site you will need to fill in simple forms with answers to questions, but in the end it will segment the package of documents and send them to the registration authorities.  Creating a C-Corp in Delaware with a couple of founders <a href="https://www.clerky.com/pricing">will cost</a> you a little more than $ 700 (you will need Incorporation and Post-incorporation setup). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/4d/my/yx4dmyy6duqgzlh7szvqa5bb6qq.png"><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://upwork.com/">Upwork</a> </h2><br>  If you have a small startup without a huge investment, then saving is your main occupation after moving to the USA.  In this case, it is not always possible to always manage only with the help of fellow freelancers from the countries of the former USSR.  For example, you will probably need a local accountant, marketing specialist or a native speaker editor.  This is the minimum. <br><br>  It will be too expensive to hire agencies and go to specialized firms, and Upwork comes to the rescue here.  There is a huge number of specialists on various issues, and this competition contributes to lower prices and increase the quality of work. <br><br>  You can always run into an optional performer, but the rating and feedback system minimizes the chances of that.  As a result, with the help of Upwork, you can easily close tasks like submitting reports and paying taxes, as well as launching basic marketing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/8g/q9/lt8gq9vz69ncli4uubchog5qhcy.png"><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/">Wave</a> </h2><br>  Speaking of accounting, in the US, the most popular program is QuickBooks.  However, this is a paid software, and you need to pay extra for each individual module (such as payroll). <br><br>  In addition, practice shows that Russians can not use all the features of the service - for example, you cannot post invoices through it with the possibility of paying a bank card until you become a US resident, i.e.  get a green card. <br><br>  Wave is a great free alternative.  This accounting software is completely free, moreover, from the box there is the ability to create invoices with the possibility of payment by card and through an American bank account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/ms/ov/ngmsovog_eccyywbxj-xsll58jm.png"><br><br><h2>  <a href="http://textly.ai/">Textly.AI</a> </h2><br>  Doing business in America means constant communication.  And if your insufficiently good oral English cannot be hidden at all, then you can use specialized software during written communication. <br><br>  Textly.AI offers a service for correcting errors in English texts - the system finds grammatical, punctuation errors, corrects typos and gives recommendations on the style of writing. <br><br>  The tool works not only as a web application, but there are also extensions for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textlyai/ndgklmlnheedegipcohgcbjhhgddendc/">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/textly/">Firefox</a> .  This means that the texts do not need to copy and paste anywhere, the system corrects errors on the fly right where you write - it does not matter whether it is a mailer like Gmail or a blog platform like Medium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/a7/w9/-wa7w9y95kcgl6d69lm2uvq8de8.png"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Launching a project abroad is not an easy task, but it can be facilitated with the help of modern technologies and tools.  The tools described in the article will allow you to get the desired result at a lower cost and faster than is possible in the traditional version.  I hope the selection turned out to be useful - add it in the comments, thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450180/</a></p>
