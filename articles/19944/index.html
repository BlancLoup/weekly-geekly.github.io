You probably expect to find out from the message that you are guilty of violating copyright law and insulting the musicians who created what you are listening to, but you can relax, there is nothing imputed to the above. ‚Äù

      Instead, Jordan turns to listeners, asking them why someone should worry about buying a CD in the iPod era and hard-drives clogged with MP3s.  Jordan believes that he knows the answer to this question: people buy CDs if they really like the music and to support their favorite artist. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWant to buy a CD, just to demonstrate your support?  Feel free to worry if you don‚Äôt like the CD format itself.  Shops, like, Best Buy and Amazon, often inflate prices for sold music by 8 times, from the price set by the artist.  In addition, most CDs are made from non-recyclable plastics, the production of which pollutes the environment.  " <br><br>  Taking a similar step, Jordan hopes that the new audience of file sharing users for him, if they like the album, wants to make small donations or buy his other albums.  You can download them to FLAC directly from its <a href="http://www.alphabasic.com/">official website</a> .  He does not disclose the amount that, at the moment, users have donated, but apparently, their reaction to the act of Jordan, more than positive.  A proposal to download his music was posted on the What.cd main page and the site administrators actively encouraged their users to download this piece of music free of charge. <br><br>  Jordan, it seems to us, is not very sure that they will pay for such a distribution method consistently, but he is sure that new models of music distribution are inevitable. <br>  Attempts to cling to the old system of sales, lead, only, to an increase in piracy, without increasing the profit of the musician and allowing them to prey on labels on inflated deductions. <br><br>  From his <a href="http://www.bennjordan.com/blog/%3Fp%3D35">blog</a> : <br>  ‚ÄúRecord labels can not or do not want to satisfy the client, which in turn leads to piracy and the destruction of the industry as a whole. <br>  No matter how many people you sue, how many trackers you will close or how many will come up with idiotic protection, like, Key2Audio, DRM, etc.  - people will always do what they want to do, force them to accept, forcibly, you will not succeed. <br>  At some point, the entire music industry must decide and change the current business model to a new one that is consistent with the realities of today. <br>  I don‚Äôt think donations are a long-term solution, but what the heck is still better than pretending that 85% of your audience doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚Äù <br><br>  translation: Avvacum <br>  <a href="http://www.p2p-blog.com/item-479.html">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19944/</a></p>
