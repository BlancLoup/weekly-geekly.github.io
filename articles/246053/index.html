  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guinness - The Perfect Beer Pint. Case excellent CRM solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been studying CRM for a long time and have read a lot of literature on this topic.  There are many definitions of what is CRM, but most of all I liked the definition from the book ‚ÄúCRM Guide.  The path to improving customer management.  The author is Adrian Payne. <br><blockquote>  The CRM system, which is also often called customer management, is a business approach.  His goal is to create, develop and strengthen relationships with carefully selected clients, increase customer benefits, increase corporate profits, and thus maximize investor profits.  CRM is often associated with the use of information technology in the implementation of relationship marketing: CRM combines new technologies with new market thinking, thus creating profitable long-term relationships with customers. </blockquote><br>  I believe that the problem of many modern companies is the desire to fully automate the relationship with customers.  We can schedule calls to customers, set tasks and reminders, we can predict transactions and count conversion.  But how does all this help earn customer loyalty?  After all, our competitors are doing the same.  The definition given above tells us that CRM is not only information technology, but new market thinking.  An excellent example that confirms this idea is the Guinness case - ‚ÄúThe Perfect Pinta of Beer‚Äù, which I also stumbled upon in this book.  I bring it to you completely. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Company </h4><br>  Guinnss was founded in Ireland in 1759 by Arthur Guinness.  In a short period of time, the thick dark beer of the company gained such popularity that it forced out imported beers from the Irish market, captured part of the English market and revolutionized the brewing industry.  By 1825, the strong porter Guinness was sold abroad, and by 1838 Guinness' frish Brewery became the largest brewer in Ireland.  In 1881, the volume of Guinness beer produced annually exceeded one million barrels, and by 1914 St James's Gate had become the largest brewing company in the world. <br><br>  Today Guinness beer is brewed in more than 35 countries around the world.  All beer brewed abroad must contain an aromatic extract produced by St James's Gate Brewing Company from Dublin.  Therefore, a special brewing art created by Arthur Guinness.  present in each of the 10 million glasses of Guinness daily drunk all over the world. <br><br>  Today, Guinness, part of the public company Diegio, owns one of the most recognizable brands in the world with very loyal customers.  However, the production of consistently high-quality product was one of the main problems faced by the company. <br><habracut></habracut>

    <h4>  Problem </h4><br>  It is generally recognized that the quality of the product is the most important factor in the formation of customer loyalty, especially when it comes to getting loyal customers from among people who drink beer occasionally.  Studies show that in order to develop a predilection for thick dark beer, a product must meet customer expectations always and in all cases.  At each brewery of the company, the production process is carefully monitored.  The ingredients for each brewing are strictly checked, and among them there is always a special ingredient made in Dublin. <br><br>  Tasters of the company daily take samples from dozens of beer samples.  To guarantee their highest consumer quality, all the company's products are regularly tasted at all stages of their life cycle.  Tasters evaluate beer by its flavor, smell and quality of the foam and notice any problems or deviations in the quality of the product. <br><br>  However, as it turned out, the mere production of a standard product is not enough to ensure that every customer drinks the same ‚ÄúPerfect Pinto‚Äù at any time and in any place. Studies conducted in the UK in the 1990s showed that consumers were often offered pint, "not reaching the ideal."  Guinness Brewing GB recognized this circumstance as the biggest issue related to overall supply chain management.  Consequently, it was precisely this problem that had to be solved in order to guarantee customers a consistently perfect impression in places of beer consumption. <br><br><h4>  Decision </h4><br>  The solution to this problem lay far beyond the capabilities of individual departments of the company.  In order to ensure that the customer always receives the perfect impression in the places of consumption, the company has created a special group to establish cross-functional processes.  The group was tasked with creating the ‚ÄúPerfect Pinto of Beer‚Äù. <br><br>  The group made a detailed map and calculated the whole process of product delivery from the brewery to the customer.  On the basis of the results obtained, a detailed program was developed that ensures that the clients receive an ‚ÄúIdeal Pin of Beer‚Äù when implemented.  Controlling the supply chain, which Guinness calls a quality chain, involves four main steps: <br><br><ul><li>  quality control of raw materials supplied by the company; </li><li>  quality control of cooking and bottling; </li><li>  control that the owner of the pub serves the "Perfect Pinto"; </li><li>  control that the customer knows how to have fun at the final stage of product consumption. </li></ul><br>  In the first two stages, quality control concerned the stringency of requirements for procurement and the maintenance of production standards.  Attention to quality begins at Guinness with suppliers and buyers who try to meet the standards of the company, and the production process is based on world-class methods and a system of integrated quality management.  All employees of the company share the point of view of quality and, thanks to excellent preparation, they understand how important each of them plays in the quality chain.  At each stage of the brewing process, samples are sampled.  Even kegging, cans and bottles are guaranteed to ensure that the beer has a standardized aroma and appearance. <br><br>  At the same time, the group occupied by Ideal Pint discovered that problems sometimes started as soon as the beer arrived at licensed establishments.  Guinness, like any other draft beer, is a ‚Äúliving‚Äù product that requires careful handling.  Often the beer was stored incorrectly and served.  Although these problems were not within the scope of direct control of the company, they turned out to be crucial for the quality of the customer's impression of the product. <br><br>  The group undertook extensive research to find a way to constantly maintain high quality in the final stages of the supply chain, the results of their work were recommendations for pub owners, affecting all aspects of quality beer bottling.  These recommendations included the correct gas mixture recipe for dispensing beer from barrels, the ideal pouring temperature, the washing of beer racks and glasses and the perfect presentation of beer. <br><br>  Guinness spent tremendous efforts on research and development in the field of bottling equipment and methods for filling glasses, for example, creating a faucet through which Guinness is poured in pubs today cost the company ¬£ 1 million. The faucet was designed to easy to manage and thus ensure the perfect look of each pint.  Another development was the introduction of a program to compile a gas mixture for pubs selling barrel beer.  The introduction of such initiatives helps the company to ensure that the client receives an <a href="http://www.guinness.com/en-us/thebeer-process-enjoying.html">‚ÄúIdeal Pinto‚Äù</a> every time. <br>  Not paid attention and training staff.  The Ideal Pinta group recognized how important the staff plays in getting the Ideal Pinta to the customer.  For example, the implementation of the famous "two-stage loading" requires a long practice.  To ensure the correct bottling of beer and the correct use of its customers, the <a href="http://www.guinness.com/en-us/thebeer-draught.html">company has developed detailed instructions and training:</a> <br><br><blockquote> <a href="http://www.guinness.com/en-us/thebeer-draught.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/4e3/587/7404e3587afb40a1a5fed1c5d4032feb.jpg" align="right"></a> <ul><li>  Hold the glass at a 45 ¬∞ angle at the very tip of the faucet, so that large bubbles do not form in the foam. </li><li>  Completely unscrew the roll and fill the glass by 75%, before topping up the glass, let the beer settle well. </li><li>  Let the cream-colored foam separate from the dark base. </li><li>  When refilling beer, move the tap slightly forward so that the foam protrudes slightly from the edges of the glass. </li><li>  Never allow beer to overflow or flow down the side of a glass. </li></ul></blockquote><br><br>  Thanks to good training, every Guinness employee is aware of his responsibility for doing so.  that customers always get the ‚ÄúPerfect Pinto‚Äù everywhere.  Attendants in licensed institutions are taught how to produce a two-stage filling, and encourage them to strictly control the methods of filling beer, to monitor the height of the froth and the temperature of the pint.  If any problem arises, staff can immediately report it to the Ideal Pinta's support team, and the pub owner will receive additional tips or instructions. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The task assigned to the "Ideal Pint" is not limited to this.  As the company's research has shown, in order for the impression of customers to be stable over time, the training of customers themselves is required.  The company needed to inform consumers about their role played in creating the "Perfect Pinta".  Laminated cards were placed at beer sales points, on one side of which was explained how to pour the ‚ÄúPerfect Pint‚Äù, and on the back side - indicated the optimal temperature of the beer supply and a line was drawn, with which customers could measure whether the foam was the correct height. . <br><br>  Consumers were also impacted by an extremely successful advertising campaign, in which they praised the merits of the ‚ÄúIdeal Pinta‚Äù waiting process, since Guinness ‚ÄúIdeal Pinte‚Äù should be allowed to stand for one and a half to two minutes.  So thirsty customers now began to wait patiently for their beer.  They have become part of the process and are now convinced that the beer that is worth drinking is worth the wait.  Even the company's main clientele has learned to tolerate the expectation of receiving a pint.  As one of the pub owners says: ‚ÄúThe regulars drink their glasses in three sips.  They re-order immediately after the second sip, and as soon as the glass is drunk, the new one is ready.  They are strong people. ‚Äù <br><br>  This strategy to create the impression of customers contributed to the fact that the company captured the largest share in the draft beer market in its history.  Guinness acknowledged that to guarantee a re-purchase of a beer, its proper presentation becomes a crucial task.  And this requires the full integration of all links in the supply chain, including the customers themselves.  The Ideal Pinta project was so successful that its methods were used around the world to improve the delivery and quality of Guinness draft beer. " <br><br>  As we see, in order to become the most desired beer brand, Guinness, having achieved a high, even perfect product quality, having introduced new technologies and carefully trained personnel, involves customers in the process.  And these are not just traditional marketing techniques.  To enlist the loyalty of the audience, teaching and entertaining it, is a completely different type of communication.  This is the new thinking, the new business approach, which should be the basis of any customer management.  And information technology is only a way to achieve a goal. <br><br>  Source: CRM Guide.
