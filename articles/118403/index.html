  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One year as one moment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear Habrovchane. <br>  In April, one year has passed since the advent of the company. <a href="http://www.rp-server.com/">Relational programming</a> (hereinafter RP for short).  The year was full of events and flew for everyone who works in the Republic of Poland as one moment. <br>  In the first post on Habr√©, and, in fact, in general, the first post in the history of the Republic of Poland, we will talk about why and how we came about, what we managed to do over the past year.  In the future, we will try to talk about what our product is suitable for, how to develop RP-applications, what the developers and ideologists of the RP do, and also how the RP is trying to help those who are already conducting RP-development or are only considering RP Server as "Workhorse" to perform their tasks. <br>  Yes ... another moment.  We hope for support, criticism and questions from your side.  We will try to answer everything in detail, in essence and, as far as possible, avoiding advertising. <br>  So, about the RP and about the main product of the company - the RP Server platform. <br>  The main idea and the first versions of software for developing and executing business applications, which since the end of last year has been referred to in industry media as RP Server, appeared more than fifteen years ago. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The initial idea was to separate the development of the system part and the application code of several software products of the BOSS series.  Benefits - reducing the development time of finished application products, saving time and money during the implementation and maintenance phases.  It also affected the ability to adapt application products to the needs of specific enterprises and users in virtually unlimited limits (within the domain) with a reasonable time frame for implementation. <br>  What was called the ‚Äúsystem part‚Äù above is the RP Server, i.e.  development environment and implementation of applied products for corporate use.  An example of one of the applied products is <a href="http://www.bosshr.ru/">BOSS-Kadrovik</a> , which works for 20% of the largest Russian companies (from Expert RA ratings TOP-100 and TOP-400, see PC Week No. 21, 06/08/2010).  By the way, in May 2011, one of the customer enterprises will hold a BOSS-Kadrovik tournament, the winners will be selected in nine nominations and receive gifts. <br>  About three years ago, it was noticed that enterprise developers use the tools of the applied products of the BOSS series for solving problems from other subject areas.  Additional studies were conducted and their results turned out to be interesting: it turns out that the environment for developing and executing applications, in our terminology, the system part, is quite often used to solve both standard corporate automation tasks and fairly specific tasks.  Because it is flexible, convenient, integrates with technological equipment, other systems ... and so on. <br>  In early 2010, we evaluated the feasibility of separating the system part into a separate product, developed a draft of a new product, and later came up with the name - RP Server (Relational Programming Server) platform. <br>  At the end of 2010, they announced the release of RP Server in three editions: Express, Standard and Enterprise.  RP Server Express is a completely free version of the product, the main limitations of which are the lack of tools for organizing collective development and generating license keys.  Standard and Enterprise editions are distinguished by the versions of Microsoft SQL Server that are included in the package - Standard and Enterprise, respectively. <br>  In the second quarter of 2011, the final version of the free edition of the product was already on the RP site, a section was opened for buyers of commercial versions of the product. <br><habracut></habracut></div>
