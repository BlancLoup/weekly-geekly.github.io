  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Can we set up an experiment?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wrote a small <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/massmedia/80968/">post</a> today, it hit the main page.  Everything is good, but there is one big BUT.  Most of the comments are absolute offtopic.  And then my head was visited by an absolutely idiotic thought. <br>  What if now I replace the source text with a fake, tailored to the existing comments?  How will the habrasoobshchestvo react, waking up in the morning and seeing the text is absolutely crazy news, but with quite serious comments to yourself? <br>  Naturally, I myself can not decide on such a step without your approval. <br><br>  Several hours later, having enlisted the support of Habrahabr users, the above experiment was carried out. <br>  Under the cut that post that hung for two hours on the main Habrahabr, and small conclusions.  I want to apologize in advance to those who took it all at face value and commented on the message in all seriousness. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, some text: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>

      <br>
      <i>At the end of the past of the city in the small town of Kofeykovo in Ukraine, a rather resonant local event took place.</i>  <i>The mayor, while intoxicated, shot down a 15-year-old.</i>  <i>As is typical of this kind of news, this information, posted on the local site, has collected a huge number of comments and attracted considerable attention (it is unlikely the whole story would be developed if the driver was a mere mortal).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For a couple of days the people expressed their indignation at the mayor‚Äôs deed.</i>  <i>At this time, the guy was in the hospital with a concussion, and in the general "verbal protest" did not participate.</i>  <i>But a stormy discussion got an absolutely unexpected continuation!</i>  <i>After the teenager's condition improved, he began writing on the same site.</i>  <i>And he told the whole city that an accident had an unexpected effect on his ability to think logically.</i>  <i>And what is most unexpected - for the better.</i>  <i>The guy discovered the ability to multiply four digits in his mind, despite the fact that he had previously had constant problems with mathematics at school.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Rummaging through the Internet, the teenager found the most interesting studies of the British scientist David Fake, which state that the general opinion that injuries and head injuries negatively affect mental abilities is a huge delusion.</i>  <i>These studies show that head injuries (of course, not fatal :) just the opposite, improve the work of that part of the brain that is responsible for logical thinking.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Given the huge number of jokes that go about the programmers and their children's head injuries, it would be very interesting to know the opinion of the community about this.</i> <br><br>  So, this message hung on the main page of Habrahabr.  For three hours I courageously watched my karma melt away).  Many people took the news at face value, in separate comments they tried to prove to me that I was wrong.  Once again I want to apologize to these people.  And agree with them - indeed, David Fake's research is hardly true. <br>  And only two hours later, a comment appeared in which it was clearly indicated that it was a fake, and this was indicated by the name of the city and the name of the ‚ÄúBritish scientist‚Äù. <br>  Unfortunately, it was not possible to achieve the purity of the experiment and to answer the main question - whether we read posts, or focus primarily on comments.  Is it possible to answer - who is like ... <br>  The first to respond to the new text is a fairly well-known on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mecommayou/" class="user_link">mecommayou</a> with angry comments and the question of how they thought, checked, etc.  His comments and everything that goes below are left during the experiment.  As an apology, I add to karma to everyone who fell for it. <br><br>  Please note that the first comments to this post were written at the stage of discussing the need for such a trick. <br>  I hope you smiled). <br><br>  PS I myself know what nonsense, but the attempt was interesting ... <br>  PPS Can transfer to a humorous blog? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80989/</a></p>
