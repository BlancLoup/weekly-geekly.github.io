  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Video podcasting: TV channels are trying to turn to the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Video podcasting is not yet so popular in Russia.  Russian users have not yet completely ‚Äúmoved‚Äù to the Internet, broadband access to the network is becoming more and more active, but mostly - within the Moscow Ring Road.  And users are accustomed to watching ‚Äúcool clips‚Äù on American websites, without paying such close attention, for example, to TV news releases. <br><br>  In the West, the situation is reversed: well-known politicians, journalists and other famous personalities who are not interested or inconvenient to type lengthy texts on the keyboard use video podcasts to communicate with their audience.  One of the most famous examples is the <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/DE/Aktuelles/VideoPodcast/video-podcast.html">podcast of German Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> , which is quite popular among the citizens of this country. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  There are no statesmen so open to their voters in Russia.  Meanwhile, more and more Russian TV channels are trying to make access to their products more convenient.  At least, the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù - <a href="http://www.1tv.ru/">‚ÄúChannel One‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/">‚ÄúRussia‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/">NTV</a> - are already posting news on their websites not only in text, but also in video format.

      Channel One and Russia have opened access to video fragments of news releases.  The NTV channel took the next step by opening a subscription to <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/interactive/index.jsp%3Fwhat%3DPodcast">its news podcast</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe began to produce podcasts with NTV plots when we finished the complete reworking and redesign of the corporate website,‚Äù says Andrei Klass, design director at ntv.ru.  - ‚ÄúThe concept assumes interactivity and the most active use of new technologies.  Our task is to give people content in all possible formats.  So we did widgets and podcasts. ‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://ntv.rpod.ru/">With the help of the portal Russian Podcasting,</a> NTV is trying to establish contact with its users.  However, Andrew notes that the feedback is not particularly active.  ‚ÄúThere are user comments, but not many.  The only thing we can do is evaluate the statistics.  The podcast has been released since August 2005, and since that moment the number of users has been slowly but steadily growing. ‚Äù  Cooperation with rpod.ru in any case expanded the possibilities of users: NTV news can be viewed not only on a computer, but also on a mobile phone. <br><br>  In addition to NTV, another media from Gazprom‚Äôs team, TNT, took video podcasting.  For example, excerpts from the popular comedy show <a href="http://www.tnt-tv.ru/programs/ComedyClub/">"Comedy Club"</a> are available for viewing on the website of the TV channel. <br><br>  In its ‚Äústruggle for the Internet,‚Äù Russian television is trying to keep up with the West.  The example of the YouTube and CBS deal is indicative: shortly after the start of cooperation, the American media holding <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1614/">reported on increasing its audience</a> , linking this with the fact that excerpts from some shows were made available through YouTube.  True, many analysts questioned these statements: it's hard to imagine why the American Internet users massively switched to televisions.  With the help of the Internet, the CBC media holding was able to reach those countries where Comedy Central and its other TV channels are not available, but it is unlikely to receive material benefits from this decision. <br><br>  However, CBS was able to solve the problem of copyright infringement.  Such a problem is not yet facing the Russian TV channels - due to the relatively small number of Internet users.  "NTV protects its copyright, including the materials distributed in the form of podcasts," says Andrei Klass.  - ‚ÄúAs for the TV audience, while we are not afraid of its reduction.  The percentage of users who prefer to download TV programs, rather than watch them on the air, is still too small. ‚Äù <br><br>  The trend is obvious: Russian TV channels are turning to the Internet.  Face or not - this is already up to the users themselves.  Ultimately, the number of subscribers to podcasts will determine whether Russian media companies will develop this area.  The problems that the Internet creates have not yet become so important to them, therefore - use, while free! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4845/</a></p>
