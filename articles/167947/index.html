      A very interesting DualSim model called Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO came into my hands, and I would like to share my impressions of ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù with you. <br>  What offers buyers a well-known manufacturer of tablets and e-books at a price of just over $ 200?  The company is by no means new to the ‚Äúsmart phone‚Äù segment, since it has recently successfully ‚Äúshot‚Äù with the MultiPhone 4000 DUO series, which also boasted DualSim support.  The main difference of this smartphone from its predecessors is the larger display size, which now reaches 5 inches.  But first things first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ac/7df/267/7ac7df2671ec8b0dfaf6f308ad0d1223.jpg"><br><br>  In a neat little box of a characteristic Prestigio design, you can find a standard set of equipment.  It is possible to select only a rather pleasant case, which is not so often available for free along with the purchased device.  In addition, there is a rechargeable battery, USB cable, power adapter, headphones with a microphone and a clip and user manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c1/e61/1e9/5c1e611e9003039619d73bb9827b5fd4.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's move on from the introduction and description of the package to the design of the Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO, and here do not expect any special revelations, since the manufacturer did not set itself the task of striking buyers with the appearance of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03d/d54/848/03dd5484800d42d727f7f8e36b54be77.jpg"><br><br>  Before us is a rather large and massive black "brick", the left and right sides of which are decorated with a mirror inset.  The entire back side takes a glossy brand cover, which, which is nice, perfectly resists scratching. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60d/d42/46e/60dd4246ebc47c7b1e2cb01ad25db27a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6c/85e/856/d6c85e8565fdafbd85f76a27d6c8f11d.jpg"><br><br>  However, this coating does not allow you to securely fix the candy bar in your hand, which every now and then tries to slip out of your palm to the floor.  On the back of the camera is located 5 MPks, flash, as well as the speaker.  For access to the battery pack at the bottom there is a special notch that allows you to remove the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/878/d14/f91/878d14f91666d34a7b1f99ea3cc70f55.jpg"><br><br>  Under it lies a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 2200 mAh, seats for two SIM-cards (the first with WCDMA support), as well as a slot for microSDHC / SDXC memory cards (support up to 32 GB). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d6/975/233/2d697523320d778c7c6c5eb98f7baab9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32f/8e6/97f/32f8e697fa46fc047e15c50b40ff20a4.jpg"><br><br>  The entire front of the Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO is occupied by a 5-inch screen, protected by glass, directly above it is a 0.3 Mpx camera, light and proximity sensors, a speaker;  under the screen - three menu control keys.  It is noteworthy that with the active screen, these buttons are not highlighted in any way and at first it seems that they are not there at all, but, in fact, the backlight turns on only when you touch any of these keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97f/848/c45/97f848c4511f350bdbb7f8ea62f1c580.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side there is a power button, which in combination is also a screen lock, on the left side there is a volume rocker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbe/641/fce/fbe641fcefaa1fadcf92db58fb7eaa93.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/855/adc/c50/855adcc501258fd1cafaf9cb11263bd2.jpg"><br><br>  On the upper side there is a 3.5 mm audio jack for connecting a headset, as well as a micro USB port, which is used both for synchronization with a computer and for charging a smartphone (both from a network and from a PC). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b57/598/009/b57598009547e965b9d7740e3cff7011.jpg"><br><br>  The 5-inch touchscreen capacitive display has a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels (186 ppi), is based on the TN matrix, is capable of displaying up to 16 million colors, and is supported by the Multi-Touch function.  Of course, the clarity and viewing angles of the screen are inferior to those of the more famous 5-inch models with higher resolution, but we must remember that we have a device that is more than two times cheaper than such competitors.  In general, it can be noted that the screen has a good level of brightness and a picture rich in colors, and for its dimensions such resolution is still sufficient. <br><br>  <b>The main characteristics of the Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO smartphone are as follows:</b> <br><br>  <b>The processor</b> is a dual-core MediaTek MT6577 Cortex A9 1 GHz <br>  <b>Graphics Core</b> - Imagination Technologies PowerVR Series5 SGX <br>  <b>RAM</b> - 512 MB DDR2 <br>  <b>Memory</b> - 4 GB eMMC <br>  <b>Sensors</b> - lights, proximity, G-sensor <br>  <b>Navigation</b> - A-GPS, GPS <br>  <b>Communication standards</b> - WCDMA + GSM (UMTS: 900/2100 MHz; GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz) <br>  <b>Wireless connection</b> - WiFi (802.11 b / g / n), Bluetooth 4.0, 3G <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> - 148.57910.2 mm <br>  <b>Weight</b> - 199 g <br><br>  The smartphone runs under the popular operating system Google Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), which already in its basic configuration provides users with almost maximum functionality.  The Google Play Market service is naturally present, which will allow the owner of the device to download the necessary programs.  In addition, the Prestigio installer utility available here offers fifteen, according to the manufacturer, the most useful applications for download.  Not all of them are likely to be in demand, so we load at our own discretion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5be/25d/70f/5be25d70f8f8bd51509d80f188f2e52b.png"><br><br>  A few slot should be said about the speed of the device, including when navigating through the menu.  Turning pages is almost smooth, barely noticeable twitching is present, but it is unlikely to annoy the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b83/b30/bb2/b83b30bb2f88036a0b8c81374c57b137.png"><br><br>  We were pleased with the work on the Internet using the built-in web browser.  The smartphone almost instantly reacts to clicking links, and the page is loaded very quickly.  By the way, the speed of page scalability also occurs quickly, but at the initial stage, this process slows down noticeably.  In general, we can say that Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO can be quite comfortably used for surfing the Internet - the large screen and good download speed contribute to this. <br>  The maximum volume of the call signal is sufficient and, most likely, guarantees the user the ability to hear the call even in a noisy room or in a busy street, the vibrating alert seemed a bit weak, but this is a purely subjective opinion.  There is no objection to the audibility in the dynamics of the interlocutor: the voice is distinct, recognizable and well distinguishable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74f/e0f/f7e/74fe0ff7e6baf7c3f636aa48cbd3acbf.jpg"><br><br>  Note that the smartphone has only one radio module, so when we talk, let's say on the SIM card number 1, to receive calls on the SIM number 2 will not work.  In the characteristics of the device manufacturer of this property is silent. <br>  Fortunately, it is impossible to call this a big minus, and the presence of a second radio module would increase the power consumption of the battery.  So in a sense it can even be considered an advantage. <br>  Let's say a few words about photos and videos.  The main camera shows a good quality of shooting indoors (the maximum resolution is 2592 x 1944 pixels), and most users will find the photo quite acceptable.  Video recording takes place in 3gpp format and its quality at a maximum resolution of 640 x 480 pixels is quite decent. <br>  A polymer lithium-ion battery will provide the device with up to 6 hours of talk time and up to 320 hours of standby time.  The indicator is average, however, a similar situation can be observed in almost all models with a large screen. <br><br>  In order for readers and potential buyers to have a complete picture of the capabilities of the smartphone, we present you the results of the smartphone in popular test applications. <br><br>  <b>Nenamark</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76e/b9e/86a/76eb9e86a7351b8ccbfe21b09b6a9fbf.png"><br><br>  <b>Vellamo</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d6/2f3/51e/1d62f351e117e5eda904a5f9cadfb166.png"><br><br>  <b>AnTuTu</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9a/4e6/87d/d9a4e687d206db49c6227367c17fc3e7.png"><br><br>  <b>Comparing sizes with 4-inch dvuhsimochny HTC Desire V:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03d/8dd/f37/03d8ddf371b93cc36ce0ff91275dd38a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb1/6c7/54b/eb16c754b820d1c498b20dc621209528.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d3/e5d/b65/8d3e5db65b8e6662ed75eec9f7d67706.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23a/709/b80/23a709b80f56b6188c62ed4975bbbfbf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c0/b86/1f2/5c0b861f2636402807c1d6353fb56a8a.jpg"><br><br>  To sum up all of the above, I want to say that Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO leaves a pleasant impression and can probably become a real full-featured assistant if, of course, you don‚Äôt have enough money to buy a large-format two-symbol from Samsung, Nokia or HTC.  The device coped well with all the tasks assigned to it, demonstrating good performance in tests and applications. <br><br>  Smartphone Prestigio MultiPhone 5000 DUO for writing a review provided by the company PCshop Group. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167947/</a></p>
