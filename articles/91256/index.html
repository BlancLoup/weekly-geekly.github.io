  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open Office. Green coworking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Spring has begun.  All the more insistent she pushes to change jobs.  More than two years of home freelancing exhausting.  But now I know how to distribute working time, but it‚Äôs not easy to keep the schedule, working and relaxing at the same place.  Communicating via Skype and sharing documents in Google Docs allow you to remotely solve most of the work tasks.  But due to the complete lack of live communication with their own kind there is a feeling of lack of the atmosphere of co-creation.  I‚Äôll not focus on the problems of homework, because every freelancer inevitably comes across them every day and understands all the pros and cons of such semi-solicitations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGo to the office plankton,‚Äù some will say.  But to stay in a dull building with long corridors, with cabinets with their narrow aisles between the tables and the wrong, right-sided lighting, and you are lucky if it is natural. <br>  With the same force, you do not want to pay a decent amount for apartments with conference rooms, rooms filled with expensive furniture and other (essentially unnecessary) stuff.  Most of the coworking offices that I have seen, unfortunately, cause just such impressions. <br><br>  But somehow I met an office that I would love to visit:

    <img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It's about co-working Green, how I see it.  And it would be nice to know how you see it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Thinking about the office, I understand that I want something devoid of formalism (including modern) - the thick guard of the distributing passes, expensive sofas and conference rooms.  I would prefer all this - let it be a cheap, but creative, not formal atmosphere.  And the center of the city, the number of floors in the building and a place in the elite parking for my fawn - I would gladly trade for the outskirts with trees around, fresh air and the sky overhead. <br><br>  <b>Open-Location.</b> <br>  It is obvious that such an Office will not be located in the city center.  But on the other hand, why should he be there? <br>  Within our boundaries, or very close to it (I am about Rostov), ‚Äã‚Äãthere are ‚Äúgreen‚Äù places - for example, a botanical garden, the left bank, or a green island.  Getting to them is not at all difficult, by car or bike.  Moreover, renting space there will be noticeably (if not by an order of magnitude) cheaper than renting office space. <br><br>  Green co-working I see domed: <br><br><img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.dolphin-gps.ru/habr/5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Open Office is a space</b> where there is enough space for designers, programmers, programmers and other creative people.  Where you can arrange an exhibition, concert or performance. <br>  It is important that this space is flexible.  Like in the theater.  Only in place of the scenery and revolving stage will come the dome architecture. <br><br>  For example, three freelance programmers have a common project that will take a month to work on.  For the work to be fruitful, they do not put a large dome (which is provided by the Office, on lease terms or for free).  The dome protects them from excessive noise from outside, and inside you can quickly create the necessary and pleasant atmosphere for work. <br><br>  The feeling of comfort depends not only on the location of the desktop and the objects lying on it - these are the sounds that are heard from the neighbors, their faces, and the lighting, and the wallpaper on the walls - all the space around that the freelancer faces, tearing his eyes off the monitor.  Well, if there is an opportunity to build this space.  Under each group of freelancers.  Under each major project.  For each concert or performance - its own unique showroom. <br>  I think the dome architecture will allow very quickly to create the most amazing designs and interiors, most sharpened by the spirit of the team and the project that is being worked on. <br>  And it does not fall out of the general infrastructure - a wide Internet channel with a backup line, equipment and all the other benefits of office life. <br><br>  <b>Open Office is a freelance service center.</b> <br>  These are monitors, tablets, and other equipment that you don‚Äôt need to carry with you in your backpack.  These are powerful servers, data warehouses and access to systems for rendering (if you work with video or 3D graphics).  All this can be used on the spot.  And carry with you only the most important thing - for example, a laptop. <br>  This is legal support, including the opportunity to work on ‚Äúwhite‚Äù with the conclusion of contracts in the name of the Open Office. <br><br>  <b>Open Office - Open project.</b> <br>  I believe that coworking in its essence is not a business, it is not a project aimed at making a profit (albeit small).  But at the same time, the work of people involved in organizing the work of the center, equipment maintenance, security and other issues should not be based on enthusiasm, even if this work is done by the freelancers themselves, moreover - it must be paid for at least the time of the freelancer engaged in its core business . <br>  Open Office is not only an open-air office, but also a completely open project in its quality and form of management. <br>  Like other open-ended projects, he does not have specific owners, but there is a group of selected managers who support the work of the center and develop it.  Each freelancer can take part in this work and get paid for their work. <br><br>  <b>Rent a place.</b> <br>  I think that taking into account the location, the absence of large fees for renting space in elite office buildings and the lack of goals for making money from freelancers - prices are quite realistic to keep at the level of 2000-3000 rubles / month.  from the workplace (you can call it a membership fee). <br>  At the same time, people involved in the maintenance of the center will receive a decent payment for their work, and freelancers will be a convenient place to work and create, as well as technical and legal support. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91256/</a></p>
