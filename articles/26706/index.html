Well, at the same time, the blog of the same name started ... <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation, the material will not qualify for the perfect completeness of studying the issue.  But only can be paid attention to the implicit nuances that are not described in numerous E-bay help, or simply briefly outline the essence of the issue. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before you even go into the business of shopping on E-bay, you need to understand whether you are satisfied with the terms.  To those who are extremely in a hurry, I recommend to score on this venture.  What I myself often do.  Sometimes the prospect of saving a couple of hundred dollars fades away before wanting to become the owner of any device or feature as soon as possible.  Urgently on E-bay can not buy anything.  Repeatedly, he ran into a dynamo of ‚Äúpromise-sellers‚Äù violating their promises - ‚Äúwe send the next working day‚Äù, or got on weekends, or at the Russian customs ‚Äúpre-holiday plug‚Äù or the FIG knows what they have there, but always have to wait. <br>  Approximate dates (excluding customs clearance. About customs separately):

      <strong>1.</strong> Amerikos brakes on shipment = from 1 to 5 working days.  The larger the seller, the longer it is possible to expect an ‚Äúambush‚Äù from him. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> Travel time by mail: <br><br>  Regular mail ( <strong>Parcel Post</strong> ) - unpredictable.  Because the parade is usually.  From a week to 4 months.  Depends on the weight of the parcel.  More weight, more time.  It will weigh up to 0.4 kg - they will throw it into AirMail and it will come quickly.  But an extremely cheap way to send. <br><br>  By plane ( <strong>AirMail</strong> ) - from a week to a month.  The same weight plays a role. <br><br>  <strong>USPS Priority Mail</strong> - a week, two, and in Russia.  At least 4 days.  BUT!  Since Priority Mail arrives after customs in the "subsoil" of our NORMAL Russian Mail, the parcels of this service go around Russia longer than they travel from abroad.  The total transit time without customs from America is 14-23 days. <br>  Sending this service has limited tracking capabilities.  On the site <a href="http://www.usps.com/">www.usps.com</a> (this is ‚ÄúMail of America‚Äù like this :)) you will see when it was sent and when it left the USA.  In more rare cases, then climbs the date of arrival in Russia.  Everything.  Further not tracked.  Take on the notice in the mail. <br><br>  UPDATE !!!  (Thank you <a href="http://beartamer.habrahabr.ru/">beartamer</a> for the tip) Now this service is tracked.  Here it is - <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/resp_engine.aspx%3FPath%3Dportal/ru/home/postal/trackingpo%26BarCode%3DCJ288696822US">www.russianpost.ru/resp_engine.aspx?Path=portal/ru/home/postal/trackingpo&amp;BarCode=CJ288696822US</a> <br><br>  <strong>The USPS First Class International Package</strong> is almost the same as the USPS Priority Mail, as applied to Russia (the fact that the Americans laid in the Priority Mail does not work very well in Russia, therefore it comes out the same way).  Slower will not.  But cheaper. <br><br>  <strong>USPS Express Mail</strong> is the most expensive of the reasonable, but the most sane service.  Depending on the sending state and weather :) appears in Russia on the 2nd or 4th day.  Immediately gets in line at customs.  After customs, the next day gets up to the courier shipment to your address (this is about Moscow).  It is rarely delayed at this stage for two days.  By number is tracked all the way.  On the website <a href="http://www.emspost.ru/">www.emspost.ru</a> or at the polite or not very cameramen of our ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù on the phone around the clock! .. In general, I prefer this service.  Never lost anything if sent by this service.  And besides E-bay, I bought a lot directly.  This service in many countries has the name "EMS POST".  In China and many ‚Äúattractive‚Äù countries for purchase, it is and is searched for by the name of the country and the phrase ‚ÄúEMS‚Äù (Express Mail Service).  Show the seller the local EMS site and ask to send this service.  There are almost everywhere.  In Germany, no.  There is a dominance of DHL. <br>  Tariffs and travel time of all the above-described packages from America can be viewed on the website <a href="http://www.usps.com/">www.usps.com</a> in the section ‚Äúinternational calculator‚Äù. <br>  The transit times indicated there are REAL, but do not take into account the Russian customs and the Russian ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù of our mail, which in all cases except USPS Express Mail leaves much to be desired.  Most sellers have a calculator on the product page.  Depending on the country chosen, he will calculate the amount of the delivery.  And when you pay, PayPal will automatically add this amount to the account based on your shipping address registered in the system. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> You all had a legitimate question - ‚ÄúWhy does the author forget about such‚Äú super ‚Äùexpress delivery methods like UPS, FeDex or DHL?‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt forget ... And the packages go for three days ... But here a SMALL nuance creeps out. All three of them = ‚Äúfreight forwarders‚Äù and not ‚Äúpostal service.‚Äù Accordingly, the items brought by them do not fall under the preferential rules for customs clearance of mail items for individuals and must be cleared in full, that is, the CCD, the customs rate by product code, and then VAT. Depending on the product code, this is usually ((‚Äúprice of goods‚Äù + ‚Äúprice of shipment  and ") + 15%) + VAT. Expensive. And gimorno. Because these" carriers "customs clearance procedure takes 4 hours each, you have to go personally to Domodedovo or to Sherem, in general, I ran into a couple of times and started to get the goods" by freight carriers ". <br><br>  <strong>4. Customs.</strong> <br>  About customs "freight" I told.  It makes no sense to paint further.  If someone really needs nuances, then call any of them, they give the phone numbers of the ‚Äúcustoms brokers‚Äù of theirs, and with a tired voice repeat the order of customs clearance and send samples of the necessary documents to the soap. <br><br>  Now about the Law on receiving mail for individuals.  It is very simple.  You have the right once a week to receive goods without customs clearance in the amount of up to 10,000 rubles.  provided that these products are ‚Äúnot intended for commercial activities."  The order is as follows.  On Warsaw highway there is a customs at the post office, where all the parcels flow, there ‚Äúbrava customs are great‚Äù look at their weight and assessment, and if the estimate is up to $ 400 (shipping costs are not taken into account!) And they have no doubts in this assessment, then cheerfully stamp "released by customs" and passed into the hands of our mail.  Regional (Moscow and other parcels) go to the post office (or customs, if detained) at the address of residence, still lingering at this point.  I really do not know how things are with Sakhalin and similar ‚Äúremote‚Äù regions = maybe there they go directly from America, and not through Moscow. <br>  If suddenly ‚Äúbrave customs lads‚Äù have doubts, they ‚Äúdelay‚Äù the package, send you a notification (or in the case of USPS Express Mail, dispatchers will tell you by phone) and wait for you for two weeks to disassemble.  For disassembly, you must bring a printout from E-bay, a printout with PayPal about payment and a free-form statement - ‚Äúlet me go uncle‚Äù.  The list of documents is on the website <a href="http://www.emspost.ru/">www.emspost.ru</a> in the "documents" section.  The procedure is short - a few windows and usually a small tail line.  I issued a power of attorney for the driver a long time ago and he drives and draws everything by power of attorney.  Usually fit in an hour.  If the customs officers make sure that you are not deceiving them, they will release the package without any problems.  If they see that they are deceiving, then they will be forced to pay 30% of the excess of 10,000 rubles.  If you underestimate the cost of the invoice and the parcel is delayed, then you will not be planted.  Write in the application the real cost, write - ‚Äúthe hell knows why the sender pointed it out to it‚Äù and after paying the required fees (30% of exceeding 10,000 rubles), you are merrily released with the parcel.  But if this is not a gold watch, NOT EVERYTHING that is more expensive than $ 400, then it usually ‚Äúslips‚Äù even if the invoice is too low.  The practice of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù the seller to understate the invoice, I will describe below. <br>  Customs in Moscow has a queue for the "passage" or "detention" of parcels through it.  In normal time 3 days a week.  On New Year's Eve - up to two weeks.  This period must be added to the above postal. <br><br>  <strong>5.</strong> Now, if you are not afraid of the terms and customs, then proceed directly to the purchase procedure: <br><br>  1. We try to choose those products that are not sold through a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù auction, but those that have a ‚Äúbuy it now‚Äù badge. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04e/891/f6e/04e891f6eeba68524769084c07945c8e.gif" width="54" height="15" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  All that does not have such a badge cannot be bought ‚Äúright now‚Äù (you will have to wait for the end of the auction) + everything that really costs money and will be sold on E-bay for this money.  Freebies like "mobile phones" for the dollar does not happen.  Rather, it happens at the beginning of the auction, and by the end the price will be reached by 99% close to the real one.  Therefore, I do not buy at such auctions.  Naturally here we are talking about a new product. <br><br>  2. Immediately look delivery options.  Many "blinkered" sellers sell current in their region.  Type "America + Canada."  You can of course write to him and ask - ‚Äúwill you send to Russia?‚Äù, But in 99% of cases they ‚Äúproudly‚Äù answer = ‚Äúno!‚Äù.  If it is written Worldwide or Europe is listed in the list of countries, then this is ‚Äúour client‚Äù.  The Chinese, Japanese, Taipei rather willingly send from their regions around the world in contrast to the Americans.  If he delivers to us, then we go and read what mail service he sends (remembering the information above) and if he is satisfied, then proceed to the payment options described by the seller. <br><br>  3. Payment options. <br>  Most "serial" merchants accept payment via PayPal.  Firstly, this is the service of the E-bay itself, secondly it is convenient for the seller and the buyer, it has thoughtful features and post-payment service.  After paying for the purchase of PayPal, you can always then ask for the money back if something does not suit you (according to the procedure described in the help of PayPal).  If the seller by the time does not hide with the money, then you will be returned if you have a good reason.  At the time of filing a complaint, PayPal blocks the amount of the purchase on the seller‚Äôs account, gives you 20 days to figure out for yourself, if you don‚Äôt agree, it starts to participate in your disassembly. <br>  I initiated complaints several times, usually the seller, ‚Äúfrightened‚Äù by the complaint, becomes sane and doesn‚Äôt get to the ‚Äúescalation of complaints to the complaints service‚Äù.  Fond of everything is solved.  Although once it came to me and I was cheerfully returned all my $ 200.  In general, it is preferable to use PayPal.  The only thing - some sellers write in terms of payment - ‚ÄúOnly confirmed address‚Äù.  Further they write that ‚Äúthere are no exceptions‚Äù or they write - ‚Äúwrite, we discuss.‚Äù  Russian addresses are not confirmed.  And can not be confirmed at this time.  This is not visible in the PayPal interface, but when the seller receives a notice of your payment through PayPal, there is the status of your delivery address - ‚ÄúUNCONFIRMED‚Äù. And then they can link to the PePal rules, where they are described that in such a situation they can run into fraud .  Therefore, you must pay a bank transfer or look for another seller.  Bank transfer having a bank account (and especially with the Internet bank system) is easier to send.  Restrictions - up to $ 5000 for one payment without submission of documents to the bank.  Write in the payment that product and no one bothers you.  The operation code for the intended purpose = 13020. Current, this payment method makes you completely unprotected from the seller.  So think for yourself. <br><br>  4. Well, if the delivery to us is sent, as we need, if the money from us is taken as we want, then it is recommended to carefully read what is written there and buy, if it is impatient. <br><br>  <strong>A few short tips:</strong> <br><br>  1. Buy from "shops" or "private shops", and not from those who sell one item once a year.  You can always see a list of all the lots of the seller and understand who it is.  Torgash normal or just a special case of the sale of a single item. <br><br>  2. I like to buy not from those with a rating of tens of thousands, but from those with whom it is ‚Äúaverage‚Äù.  Conveyor McDonald's has its drawbacks, and sellers with an average rating, at least not ‚Äútemplates‚Äù communicate.  Soul they generally.  Purchase should be nice :) <br><br>  3. After payment in a couple of three days, you will wipe the seller prophylactically with a message - ‚ÄúHello!  You send my item?  This is useful and necessary.  I was faced with the fact that asking such a question in a month immediately received the money back.  As a result, I waited in vain. <br><br>  4. If you ask the seller to lower the invoice, then write to these slow-witted people such a phrase - ‚ÄúWith the item there should not be anything, except invoices on $ 399.95.  NOT appraisal, other documents, advertising materials. ‚Äù  These "stupid" can write on the package that it costs $ 400, and inside put the estimate at $ 5000.  Or put prospectuses with prices.  Collided.  It is very difficult then to explain to the customs officer ... <br><br>  5. If you lower the invoice, then understand that if the item is lost, the seller will not receive insurance more than what is written in the estimate of the item.  Accordingly, you will not want to refund the amount greater than the invoice was written.  This explains the reluctance of many sellers to do it.  After all, if you pay PayPal, then you can then demand a full amount of payment from them.  And they will receive from the mail only the one that they wrote in the invoice.  Therefore, many "super-power" sellers immediately say in the rules - "we do not underestimate the amount of the invoice."  So that their stupid questions are not disturbed.  Those with a lower rating are usually more inconsistent.  50 to 50%.  In one of the cases, buying an expensive knickknack, I persuaded to lower the invoice only in this way - I offered to pay two sums from the paper.  $ 400 "for the goods", and the remaining several thousand "for the services."  Thus, I deprived myself of the ability to demand money back and reassured the seller. <br><br>  6. Write DIRECTLY IN ADDRESS, registered on PayPal (or when sending the receipt address to the Seller) phone number with city code.  Often, shipments do not arrive in your mail, but in FIG know what.  Sometimes good postmen call.  It makes life easier. <br><br>  7. Do not forget that in some countries (America and Japan for example) 110 volts.  Not all sellers know that this is the only way for them ... Therefore, either carefully read the description of the lot, or bear in mind that sometimes you will have to purchase an adapter 220-110V later. <br><br>  In short, that's all. <br>  As memories will edit this topic. <br>  And color the pictures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26706/</a></p>
