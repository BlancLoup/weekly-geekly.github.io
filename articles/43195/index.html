It's simple!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <em>I would like to draw the attention of the venerable public: I respect Google and its creators, the presented article is just an attempt to tell a little about the development of Google in a satirical form, which sometimes does not conform to the stereotypes living in minds.</em>  <em>Very many of them have collapsed and after reading the book ‚ÄúGoogle.</em>  <em>A breakthrough in the spirit of time ‚Äùby David Wise.</em>  <em>This article was born precisely after reading this book.</em> </blockquote><br><img src="http://do-finance.com/uploads/posts/1206709361_google.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  All of us sometimes find ourselves captive to stereotypes.  So I have for a long time the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe success story of Google has evolved more from abstract stereotypes than on the basis of facts.  It‚Äôs better not to ask where the stereotypes come from, they just are.  And here is one of them. <br><br>  An ordinary guy from Russia meets another ordinary guy from the United States, and as a result of communication and friendship, they have a mega-idea.  Having created everything on the knee, the guys lock themselves in the garage and from there alone quietly seize the world with their excellent ideas, which they do not tire of inventing.  One day, the guys wake up and, lo and behold, they are already billionaires, everyone and everybody knows their names, and they use their service in all countries of the world.  A kind of version of the so-called ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù, about which we hear so much: ‚Äúas a child I sold matches on the street, and by the age of 60 I had saved a billion‚Äù. <br><br>  ABOUT!  Already have an idea?  And you even gathered to go on this stereotypical path leading to the seizure of the world?  Wait a minute, let's formulate a few conditions necessary to defeat Google.  Beat them with their own weapons! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Simple guys </h4><br>  We all consider ourselves to be ‚Äúsimple guys,‚Äù well, in fact, why are we worse than Page, or especially former compatriot Brin?  Well, no, really?  Well, except that not all of us dad worked as an employee of the state plan in the USSR.  What?  Isn't your dad a finance ministry official?  Well I do not know.  Probably, even without such a dad, we will be able to immigrate to the United States and go to the University of Maryland, which will not have your dad as a teacher.

      Stop.  Do you still consider Bryn and Paige "simple guys"?  Well, you will not be difficult to get a bachelor's degree at a university in the United States at 19 and enroll in a doctoral degree program at Stanford University. <br><br><h4>  Mega-idea on the knee </h4><br>  As we remember, we already have a mega-idea.  The case remains for a small somehow implement it, try at least.  I hope you have the capacity of the Stanford Institute, its patent office, its support in the form of doctoral staff and the staff of the institute themselves.  Nope  Well, at least you have someone who will pay you a place of research, your traffic, your resources?  What?  No one will give you even 10 thousand dollars, as Brin and Paige were given as part of the Digital Libraries project ?!  Some strange mega-idea that was born in the wrong environment. <br><br><h4>  All by yourself </h4><br>  As is well known, ‚Äúperseverance and hard work are going on.‚Äù  I did not like this saying since childhood.  It seems to sound cool, but you will see that some other principle works everywhere: ‚Äúcommunication and kinship is always good.‚Äù  But we know that we are simple guys.  True Page and Brin had an acquaintance and meetings with David Filo, one of the founders of Yahoo!  and Paul Flati, the creator of AltaVista, but this is so - nothing.  In addition, you will think, because Paul is a graduate of the same institute where we studied too!  What?  Is there no AltaVista alumni creator at your institute?  How so?  It's just that you ended up with some kind of institutions.  Otherwise, if you received a doctoral degree at the right university, a professor at your university would introduce you to a man like Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, who travels on a Porsche and can easily write you a check for $ 100,000 on the first day of your acquaintance. <br><br><h4>  Capture the world from the garage </h4><br>  You probably already hurried and bought a garage, probably of Soviet times, in which the car barely fits.  Well, never mind.  You did it, because you already have a working system in your pocket, a mechanism run-in on the hardware base of the Stanford Institute and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars by Behtolsheim.  It remains only to sit and wait until everything rushes to use your system.  What?  There is not anyone?  And you did not send emails, did not send messages via ICQ?  Well, you give!  After all, even Bryn and Paige, such simple guys, did it. <br><br>  By the way, are you sure that your garage is suitable for facilities comparable to those used by the creators of Google?  They ordered computers in batches of 21 each.  What?  Do you have so much space in the garage ?!  Some kind of wrong garage.  By the way, I forgot to tell you, Brin and Page spent only half a year in the garage, and then moved into another building, where they occupied an entire floor.  Well, not bad things, only you bought a garage, and it is time to sell it. <br><br><h4>  Crush google </h4><br>  So, things are in order, everything works, it‚Äôs spinning.  That and look we become billionaires.  But something does not go long capital, and self-sufficiency somehow does not appear, that look of money soon will not be enough, and a hundred thousand dollars will end.  What to do?  Well, of course, contact your friends and relatives.  What?  You do not have those who can give you a million dollars?  Yes, you are laughing!  Some are not your relatives and friends.  They gave Bryn with Paige easily, but why don't they give you something?  Well, okay, then you probably managed to find venture funds like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia, which gave Brin and Page $ 25 million.  What?  You can not find such amounts?  Well, I do not know, for sure, you were looking bad. <br><br><h4>  Become billionaires </h4><br>  As you see, it is easy to become billionaires; all you have to do is observe a few points described above.  Your mega-idea captured the world, venture capital works, everything goes as it should.  You even have someone who helps you, like Eric Schmidt, who used to work at Sun Microsystems as chief engineer and director general at Novell.  What?!  There's no such thing?  And what is?  Well, is there any ?!  No?  Well, you give!  Search faster! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  You did everything right!  We went to the IPO and became billionaires.  The goal was achieved and, notice, the conditions for achieving this goal were not so much.  Just a business - to do what is written in this article.  What?  It's impossible?!  Well, you give!  Brin with Paige did it, and you say "impossible."  Learn! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43195/</a></p>
