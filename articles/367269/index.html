      Another article says that Flash has given the web a lot, HTML5 is already quite mature (video and audio).  Further, they write that Flash continues to be the key technology for delivering premium content (games and premium video) until the new web standards are fully matured.  They emphasize that the Adobe Flash Runtime team is now in a working relationship with Microsoft, Google, Facebook to improve the quality of the Flash Player itself. <br><br>  <b>Everything.</b>  <b>That's all.</b>  <b>There is not a word about abandoning Flash Player.</b> <br><br>  News sites tried so hard to get traffic to their sites, where they have incredibly expensive ads, that we all expected to see side banners of the type <i>‚ÄúAlla Pugacheva does this with the Flash Player ...‚Äù</i> or <i>‚ÄúTo enlarge the member - you need to disable Flash Player.</i>  <i>And that's why...."</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We all understand that the Flash Player browser plugin locomotive is gradually leaving for nowhere.  With this, no one argues and stupid even deny.  But this does not mean that the technology is forgotten and no one will work on it. <br><br>  The problem with all news resources is that most of the yellow headlines are written by people who are not able to distinguish between warm and wet.  For this reason, they reprint the news, weighing them with new details on the principle of "damaged phone." <br><br>  For everyone involved, I‚Äôll give <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/message/8242387">a message clipping to the</a> product of the Flash Runtime Manager and Adobe AIR: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4e/382/3cf/a4e3823cf3ceef4dda05eb9a6e87a3ef.png" alt="image"><blockquote>  For the Flash Runtime team (Flash Player and AIR), there‚Äôs  We are continuing our partnership and ongoing work with Microsoft and Google, and we‚Äôre very excited to work with Facebook.  This multi company collaboration will provide the most secure and stable runtime possible.  Our plans for our customers.  We always keep track of our business needs.  For all new features, and an active beta program.  None of this changes. </blockquote><br><br>  Who is not strong in English - briefly summarize: <br><br><blockquote>  For the Flash Runtime development team (Flash Player and AIR) there are no changes in the work.  We will continue our work with Microsoft and Google and we are very pleased to work with Facebook.  We have no plans to change the approach to the release of the flash player. We have a certain rhythm for releases and an active beta program.  None of this changes. </blockquote><br><br>  Grand misunderstanding and vain triumph among people arose for the simplest reason.  They do not understand the difference between Adobe Flash and Adobe Flash Professional. <br><br>  Flash (Player) is a video recorder that plays video. <br>  Flash Professional is the camcorder that makes this recording.  But recording can be done with different cameras. <br><br>  If the manufacturer of video cameras and video recorders decides to change the appearance of the camera, this does not mean that he decided to stop producing video recorders.  So here.  Flash Professional's ‚Äúcamcorder‚Äù was called and became known as ‚ÄúAnimate CC‚Äù.  Nothing more in the direction of "cut off support" will not.  Especially since I am a member of the beta group of many products at Adobe, including Flash Pro and Runtime.  They have absolutely no plans to stop developing.  Who does not believe - write to Chris, he will confirm. <br><br>  Another good news for supporters of Flash Player and, possibly, for his haters.  Famous personalities in a narrow circle are trying to create a FlexJS compiler to distill Flash content under the web standard.  The code, as before, will need to be written in ActionScript 3.0.  At the output we get a working version of flash content without a plugin.  The principle of operation is different from converting swf to html5.  To create content, you must have the original source.  Also, Starling is being developed on JS for WebGL on the sidelines.  Starling is a GPU accelerated framework for Flash Player that allows you to work on a video card.  When all the cards come together - it is likely that our good development tools just by clicking on the Publish button will be able to spit out a js-webgl product that will run without plug-ins.  And we, as before, will conduct our development in warm tube FlashDevelop, Flash Builder, <s>Flash Professional</s> Animate CC. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367269/</a></p>
