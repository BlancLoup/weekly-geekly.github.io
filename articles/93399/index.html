The first thing you need when working with any client is

    <h4>  Contract for the provision of services or the sale of goods </h4><br>  Usually the company has one or several standard contracts, in which data on new clients is copied by diligent office managers or the business owner himself, who dreams about how he will entrust him to do a fat office manager. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, in terms of aesthetics MoeDelo will not replace lush-looking beauties, but it will be as good to generate a completed contract with all the customer data.  To do this, select the contract for one of the pre-installed templates, enter its number and customer data and get the completed completed contract in the .doc format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/df/01/df0184b0718a04a2f248b50c175475aa.png" alt="image"><br>  I need my own contract template - not a problem.  We take the contract template in the .doc format, mark it once with special characters and upload it to us.  After that, you can receive a completed contract for a specific client with one click. <br><br><h4>  The contract is concluded - now you need to invoice for payment </h4><br>  You can manually copy all the data entered into the contract into an account template from Excel, or do it in our system <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">MoeDelo.org with a</a> few clicks.  Create an invoice, enter information about goods or services, if necessary, add your logo, signature and stamp and send an invoice to the customer by email or download in pdf or xls format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/40/0f/400ff314ecdd359f516cca6245d0cde2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After the invoice has been issued, it receives the status of unpaid and is displayed in the statistics on your current debtors.  That is, you can always get an answer to the question very quickly: <br><br><h4>  To whom to go today with a soldering iron? </h4><br>  After payment is received, press the button ‚Äúaccept payment by invoice‚Äù and the account is marked as paid, and the system adds funds to the system, which will be taken into account when calculating taxes for the quarter. <br><br><h4>  Received payment - do an act or invoice </h4><br>  It needs your customers to show the tax that the money was spent on a real product or service, and did not go to launder money in the organization with the general directors from solar Tajikistan. <br><br>  If you provided a service, then you need to make an act of the work performed, if you sold the goods, then the invoice in the form of Torg-12. <br><br>  If everything is quite simple with the act, then the Torg-12 consignment note template causes a feeling of rejection in any healthy individual.  Therefore, without going into details, I will say that these documents are also being created here with one click on an already existing account. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b5/4f/b54fdd105aa6cc93af62d1d7b763ee9a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Summarize </h4><br>  To work with each client, the legal entity or individual entrepreneur must have the following papers. <br><ol><li>  contract </li><li>  an invoice for payment </li><li>  invoice (if you sell a product) or an act (if the work was performed) </li></ol><br>  All this can be created by oneself, or you can give a busty girl with a proud office to an office manager, or you can use our service with just a few clicks. <br><br>  I think the choice is obvious. <br><br><h4>  Busty office managers naturally </h4><br>  After all, it is for this and open your business :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/97/57/9757e45667563b88f43584e44905b32b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, that's all for today. <br><br>  Successes in business and do not get lost in the papers! <br><br>  Ps.  The service for creating the described documents works equally well for both individual entrepreneurs and LLCs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93399/</a></p>
