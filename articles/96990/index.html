I believe that this topic has become more active due to the fact that fighters for ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù have become more active in expressing their position, have begun to act more, often with the use of heavy equipment (UPC, MVD, FSB, RW, etc.) and mass media. defeats (laws, orders, orders, ...). <br><br>  In this post I will try to build a rationale for my position regarding information and various aspects of its existence - ownership, ownership, distribution, etc.  I do not think that my position is the most correct, I believe that the rationale of the position helps a person to be consistent in his actions.  Perhaps some of my thoughts will help someone to gain a foothold in the position opposite to mine. <br><br>  The main starting point in my thinking will be the principle - "the <b>man himself is the blacksmith of his own happiness</b> ."  Those.  the person himself must worry about the result (s) of his (life) activity.

      I will also be based on the <b>laws of information</b> (a special case of the laws of nature) - the fundamental bases of creation, existence, reproduction (use), change, distribution and destruction of information.  These are not laws invented by people, they are laws according to which our world exists, like the laws of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology.  I will try not to give any academic language about this, but I will try to find the forms of these laws available to the layman. <br><a name="habracut"></a><h1>  Information </h1><br>  So what is Information?  Information is ... this is a category that cannot be defined through other categories.  In a broad sense, Information is the answer to a certain question.  That in itself is not a good definition, since the answer to a question without the question itself does not make sense.  My personal point of view is this - there is nothing but information, because at the basis of the material world there are elementary particles that are characterized by certain values: probability density distribution, mass, charge, spin, etc., i.e.  in fact, what we consider to be matter is a multitude of units of information of special types.  But this is metaphysics, let's go back to the information in its usual sense. <br><br>  I divide the information on the type of organization into two classes: analytical and figurative.  Figurative information - information that we perceive through sensation.  For example: personality, subject, picture, music.  We perceive analytical information through understanding.  For example: number, word, property, dependence, concept.  This is how our world works, that we can perceive only figurative information, but with the help of thinking, we can easily transform it into analytical information. <br><br><h2>  The emergence of information </h2><br>  The process of the initial appearance of information in the human mind, I will call it the occurrence.  Information arises from the sensation of some tangible image - type, sound, smell, taste, tactile sensation of the form of the object of sensation.  All these mechanisms create an image of the object inside us.  Further, analytical thinking is turned on and compares the image with already known images and on the basis of this creates elements of information that we call the properties of the object (in fact, the image, but at this point it is impossible to distinguish). <br><br>  In the opposite way, the appearance of an image is possible - thinking adds various properties of images together and then we are talking about the created (synthesized) image. <br><br>  Information may be useful and not useful.  Useful I will call information that a person can apply in practice, i.e.  he believes that at some point in time he can make a decision based on the information he received.  The rest of the information is not useful.  The usefulness of information is automatically determined by the person at the time of its occurrence and may change over time.  Further I will call information only useful information.  Not useful information I will call the data. <br><br>  <b>Information is created on the media through perception and analysis.</b> <br><br><h2>  Existence of information </h2><br>  I think so, but I cannot prove it, and you cannot deny this that absolutely all information already exists in the world of thinking, which exists independently of the material world and of man.  But since we are interested in practical aspects, I will continue to talk about the existence of information either in the mind of a single person or in the material world.  For this information you need a carrier.  A carrier can be either a person‚Äôs consciousness, which has access to the world of thinking, namely, that part of it, which is called memory, or a material carrier, on which information is recorded in figurative (picture, photo, sculpture) or analytical (disk, book, drawing, nodules) form. <br><br>  <b>Information exists on the media, but it is not its owner.</b> <br><br><h2>  Reproduction (use) of information </h2><br>  Since information, this is the answer to a question, it is natural that the act of its use (reproduction) is the moment of answering this question, that is,  - decision making based on the answer to the question.  In the case of analytical information, this is quite obvious.  For example, knowing that a person breathes air, when I get into the water I decide to breathe only above the surface of the water and not to breathe under water. <br><br>  In the case of figurative information, this is less obvious.  I will try to explain how I propose to understand this.  Reproduction of figurative information leads to a change in a person‚Äôs personal attitude to certain images or properties of images, which can later be used to make a decision.  For example, after reading a poem about a grasshopper, I felt sorry for insects, and later, walking in the meadow, I stopped crushing the grasshoppers with my feet, although I did it with pleasure before.  Reproduction of figurative information often causes sensations that arise when information arises through perception. <br><br>  <b>The carrier can use the information - to make decisions based on it, to feel it.</b> <br><br><h2>  Change information </h2><br>  In the process of perception of the material world, mental analysis of information, a person can change the information of which he is the carrier.  In fact, a person creates new information and, perhaps, destroys the old one.  For example, I burned a candle and concluded that what glows is always hot.  But then I touched the fluorescent lamp and did not get burned, and concluded that what is glowing can be both hot and not hot.  I could make a false conclusion that the luminous is not hot, and destroy the information about how to burn, but probably would repeat this experience after some time. <br><br>  <b>The storage medium may change it.</b> <br><br><h2>  Destruction of information </h2><br>  When information becomes reliably not useful, its carriers cease to use it and it ceases to exist as information.  However, this may be new information.  For example, I thought that a bank loan is obviously a good deal.  After I took out a loan for an apartment, I realized that the benefit of the loan is not obvious, and I stopped using information about the obviousness of the benefit of the loan.  At the same time I had information that I could be a carrier of unreliable information, i.e.  information, the use of which does not allow making a profitable decision for me. <br><br>  <b>Information may be destroyed by the carrier.</b>  <b>Information is destroyed only on the media that destroys it.</b> <br><br><h2>  Spread of information </h2><br>  The most interesting property of information, around which millions of copies break and millions of copies are cracked.  Information is disseminated when it is reproduced by the carrier in the perception zone of another carrier.  This formula is suitable for both people‚Äôs carriers and material carriers. <br><br>  As soon as information has been perceived by another carrier, it becomes a <b>full-fledged</b> carrier of information.  The primary carrier <b>stores</b> information on itself and <b>can</b> in <b>no way directly influence</b> the distribution of information by another carrier.  <b>This is how nature works.</b> <br><br>  Moreover, at the time of dissemination of information, additional information is created on the change in the composition of the carriers of this information (if it is useful). <br><br>  <b>Dissemination of information is carried out by reproducing it with one carrier and creating another on itself.</b> <br><br><h2>  Right </h2><br>  It so happened that in addition to everything related to information, in matters of ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù, such a category as a <b>right</b> matters.  This concept also has no clear and unambiguous definition.  I will assume that a <b>subject</b> (person, legal entity, ...) <b>has the right to act if neither the state nor society interferes with the commission of such an act</b> either directly or through the mechanisms of the state, church, other institutions of influence. <br><br><h1>  My position on "copyright" </h1><br>  I think that: <br><ol><li>  A person must understand the essence of such a phenomenon as information and laws of information - how information arises, exists, changes, spreads, is destroyed. </li><li>  The person carrying the information has the right to use the information that he carries, under the conditions that he considers acceptable to himself </li><li>  The person who carries the information has the right to distribute the information that he carries, under the conditions that he considers acceptable to himself (regardless of how it is received) </li><li>  No one has the right to restrict a person in matters of creation, carrying, changing, destroying, disseminating information. </li></ol><br><br>  Thus, it follows: <br><ul><li>  I believe that no one has the right to <b>forcibly</b> restrict a person in all matters related to information - creation, wearing, changing, spreading, destroying. </li><li>  I believe that information is <b>not a commodity</b> , since the laws of its existence and distribution are fundamentally different from the laws of existence and distribution of material objects. </li><li>  I believe that the concept of <b>"ownership" cannot be applied</b> to information. </li><li>  I believe that the <b>authors and users of</b> information should reconsider their attitude towards the existence, use and dissemination of information. </li><li>  I believe that <b>there are</b> business models that allow authors of information to receive decent remuneration for their work. </li><li>  I believe that some types of information are overvalued and some are undervalued. </li><li>  I believe that <b>I have the right to violate the</b> laws in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrestricting my distribution rights, understanding that the state and society <b>can apply measures to me</b> , according to my understanding of my rights. </li><li>  I believe that those who prohibit the dissemination of the information they created ( <b>supporters of ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù</b> ) and those who prohibit the non-proliferation of modified information ( <b>supporters of ‚Äúcopyleft‚Äù</b> ) are equally wrong. </li><li>  <b>I believe that any other person may not agree with me.</b> </li><li>  <b>I believe that the readers of this text have the full right to do whatever they want with the information received.</b> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96990/</a></p>
