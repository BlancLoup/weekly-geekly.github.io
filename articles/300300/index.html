      <b>Kahuna</b> mobile marketing automation system analyzed the behavior of 39 million users of mobile applications and came to a number of conclusions.  She sees a way out in two main things - the <b>implementation of a marketing strategy for participation and the systematic retention of users from the moment they install applications</b> .  In this way, publishers can increase the number of users withheld by 180% for 90 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/3f8/9ce/1c33f89ce96a4847be20886185055217.png"><br><br>  <b>Anti funnel</b> <br><br>  Adam Marchik, CEO of Kahuna, introduces such a thing as an ‚Äúanti-funnel.‚Äù  He explains this as follows.  Now all marketing strategies are built around the sales funnel clause, which demonstrates the transformation of a potential client into a real lead.  But it is much more relevant to identify the cause of the outflow of customers and save them, rather than continue to massively ‚Äúprocess‚Äù loyal customers, who are already doing the necessary actions for you.  So, according to Adam, you can double your level of customer retention. <br><br>  <b>Reasonable push notifications</b> <br><br>  An important part of such a retention plan is to send push notifications to mobile users that will help them attract, interest and retain in the future.  But most developers are actively abusing them. <br><br>  The default screen about the consent of users to receive push-notifications is not effective enough - it is much more expedient to send such requests within the applications themselves, or in the interval between the performance of targeted actions by users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/32a/bf8/7b632abf83a8489fa9da203b491f601f.png"><br><br>  However, this is not about sending annoying or too frequent messages, which can lead to disastrous results.  Kahuna revealed that users delete applications more often when they go to the settings page to turn off annoying notifications. <br><br>  <b>After the user has performed a primary opt-in, companies should make maximum efforts to retain it - ensuring competent personalization, contextualization and selection of such notification content that will be of value to the client.</b> <br><br>  For example, opt-in rates on iOS and Android vary greatly - 46% versus 78%.  Why?  Kahuna explains these numbers by saying that Android gets automatic permissions to send messages to users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e39/097/b18/e39097b184134de2bfcdde574085ab32.png"><br><br>  <b>"Capture"</b> <br><br>  Retaining users is not an easy task, but a much more laborious and high-priority process is their ‚Äúcapture‚Äù.  After all, attracted users can bring considerable profits to developers by buying paid products within applications or by viewing a sufficient amount of advertising - even if these users do not fall into the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù 0.15%, which brings 50% of game revenues. <br><br>  The average consumer has about 33 applications on his mobile device, but only the 12th uses daily (Kahuna data).  And if your application is not a game in which users can stay for hours, not a map or navigator, accessed regularly, and not a mobile version of social networks, then it makes sense to periodically remind yourself to users by sending notifications. <br><br>  Research shows that travel, finance, and travel-related applications have been able to more than double their 30-60- and 90-day user retention rates through the use of notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e4/fda/184/2e4fda1841284bb195f8a5abbf95652b.png"><br><br>  The Kahuna CEO Board will be relevant for mobile developers of all topics: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe main thing that companies have to work on is the‚Äú polishing ‚Äùof messages sent to users in notifications.</i>  <i>They should not annoy, but delight.</i>  <i>This is the key to customer retention. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  What should be the conclusion of the foregoing?  Is there a universal algorithm for retaining customers and turning them into sources of real income? <br><br>  No optimization or a well-developed marketing strategy can guarantee you a repeat ‚Äúseizure‚Äù of those users who once lost interest in your development.  Therefore, initially, you need to create such applications, in which users will regularly need and apply again and again.  <b>The customer benefits of the product are key to the financial success of the mobile application.</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg21042016">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300300/</a></p>
