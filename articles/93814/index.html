  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Panasonic 3D Convention</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A few days ago, I visited the Panasonic 3D Achievement Exhibition held at Crocus Expo.  Not only TVs were shown, so the format of the event was very similar to the Samsung Forum, where I visited a couple of months earlier.  There are many photos and descriptions of tasty technologies under the cut.  Go! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da2/f7f/fda/da2f7ffda33dbb91ffef7e8c7d62a912.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Stand home theater.  A huge TV with a bunch of built-in functions (I‚Äôll tell you in more detail below), surround sound, and stereo to 5.1 conversion technologies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ab/bc/abbc8e286276022846f147ef2a6fc213.jpg"><br><br>  Disassembled monitor.  They talk about the difference in the types of illumination.  In the cheapest models of TVs and monitors, some manufacturers use LEDs mounted on the sides of the screen.  Pros - a thin monitor, cons - uneven backlighting.  The monitor shown in the photo will be slightly thicker, but its center is not darker than the sides of the screen.  The most advanced technology in this regard today is plasma panels, since  each pixel is used as a light source, and in the photo there are only about 200 light sources for two million pixels. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/758/e9d/2f0/758e9d2f007eb2a776addd46ff48807d.jpg">

      Many photos turned out to be meaningless (this is especially obvious when describing 3D), because the photo will be displayed on your monitors.  On this monitor, for example, we were shown how small the light sources can be when each pixel emits light.  In the photo you will see, most likely, a muddy halo around the points.  On the monitor itself it was not.  At all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/84/f0/84f082f4d95920abbe1c6d48b67af49d.jpg"><br><br>  And here in real time (in red) electricity consumption was shown.  Past models consumed 30% more, now this huge colossus consumes less than a 100-watt light bulb! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87c/4a0/236/87c4a0236fa61c1d3977bc326640447c.jpg"><br><br>  Very often, a new model, an old model and a ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù were compared (which made associations with the world famous brand ‚Äúordinary laundry detergent‚Äù because the panels with logos were stuck in order to prevent competitors from advertising or anti-advertising).  This photo shows the gorgeous black color of new monitors with improved contrast ratio - five million to one.  I somehow don‚Äôt even believe in this number (there are three thousand on my own monitor), but the black one is really impressive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0c/35/0c3555a083717fc942e9fae5d8193ca1.jpg"><br><br>  And here we are told about the Viera Cast technology complex.  The bottom line is that the TV without a computer can connect to the Internet - in the presence of Skype, YouTube, Twitter, Picassa, like the wid7-widgets informers like weather forecasts and other services.  I am skeptical about the need for Twitter on the TV, but Skype seems to me to be a very, very useful thing for video calls from the TV. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/98/bf/98bf82cc2198d1ba992e4cf4dfd96a60.jpg"><br><br>  Skype again.  A call to a nearby monitor.  In the field of view, unlike cheap computer webcams, several people fall at once, the movements are not slowed down, the graininess is not observed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b3/104/614/4b3104614acbb3c8ed1c4222c08eb172.jpg"><br><br>  All this is due to the wildly expensive (about 10 thousand rubles) webcam, which, of course, does not come with the TV.  At this price, the meaning of Skype becomes the same fiction as Twitter on TV.  However, the picture on the monitor itself is still great :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7a/92/7a92b28ef26348fc83ad13a83abef5ac.jpg"><br><br>  The organization of the event pleased.  Each group (I got the smallest) had its own guide, and the groups moved according to some tricky schedule, which made it possible not to overlap with the same stands and to consider everything without special crowds. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/941/3c0/08c/9413c008c1e0507670b562a69158e773.jpg"><br><br>  Stand with photographic equipment.  I learned a lot about this industry.  They showed a new model of the camera Lumix G (about it just below) and accessories for it - different models of lenses and flashes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f6/af/f6afd8f440c3e5fd6941b059da0b8877.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f8/431/e99/9f8431e990fdf2d85005329016556eea.jpg"><br><br>  Model in work.  There are many functions that are not obvious to me, much - on the contrary, automated.  One of the most spectacular and, it seems, not implemented by anybody more functions - the screen of the camera is touch-sensitive, which allows a little relief from the buttons of the camera itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/80/8c/808c59db13ece7de125d19d86a3f8ac6.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo viewing mode, you can flip through them ‚Äúlike on an iPhone‚Äù; in shooting mode, pressing can be viewed as a ‚Äúshutter release button‚Äù, and the focus is on the place of the photo that your finger presses. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f35/4f8/2ab/f354f82abd1abecba76af32a4ec31abf.jpg"><br><br>  We all look at the screen through the 3D glasses.  On the handle you can see the points button.  On the monitor, by the way, we look at ourselves in real time - a strange feeling, considering that the image is in 3D FullHD.  The clones are coming - that‚Äôs the appropriate description. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/97/8e/978ec817a2175ec32ecb72c367295bf0.jpg"><br><br>  And this is just a "two-eyed" camera located above the monitor and shooting us.  Representatives of Panasonic assured us that it is the only one of its kind.  It costs $ 15,000, which is a mere penny for the budget of a full-length film. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/067/365/119/067365119b96003f946ac59e56be2abc.jpg"><br><br>  Panasonic also follows the trend of total gardening.  They plan to complete, if my memory serves me, in the year 2018m. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6d/76/6d764b70491eb7d24fd48d42df81a74d.jpg"><br><br>  Portable Blu-ray player.  For me, the truth is strange - what to do with FullHD on an 8 "device, if I even have a normal (720p) HD even on a 22" monitor?  However, in any case, more resolution is more pleasant for eyes :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb1/b91/3f3/cb1b913f3898acdf3d027d29723b0c09.jpg"><br><br>  Portable speaker system.  It supports a lot of things, including regular disks ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e3/aa/e3aa7a971d68ef1f44fe9366f302ec98.jpg"><br><br>  ... and, of course, iPhone / iPod.  Everything is simple, everything is automatic.  I even wanted such a device for myself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2f/1bd/7aa/d2f1bd7aacc7c5314b74dc8fe5471ef1.jpg"><br><br>  All together in action.  It seems that the worship of Apple products was transferred to competing manufacturers.  What to do, the market requires.  <s>Gays</s> Apple fans have nothing against iphone, but android is better. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/c9/bcc9cb332b775d0bcf8a3792254a7fde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c93/717/382/c937173829c2449e383b683516f03e4b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e0/94/e094cfc8ebe847815fda686dc552a59d.jpg"><br><br>  In the final, they also showed us a 152 "monitor in 3D, but, unfortunately, for some reason they were not allowed to shoot it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93814/</a></p>
