      Most of us work in one way or another, and this work is in most cases connected with a computer. <br><br>  I am a designer.  Most of the time I spend at the computer.  Most often I work at home, I get to the office for special cases. <br>  I have always strived to create for myself the most convenient conditions at work.  Today I have a spacious table, a comfortable chair, a large monitor, quite bright lighting, a comfortable temperature in the room.  My back almost never gets tired, my eyes do not hurt.  I work in conditions where the work is not annoying.  Something is missing‚Ä¶ <br><br>  No matter how comfortable I sit, it's time to get up, you can not sit forever.  One day, not so long ago, I decided to go to the gym, start working on my body.  Probably most of you thought about it, some even engaged, someone not up to it. <br><br>  Subscription to the fitness club - from 50,000 R per year.  There are many options. <br>  Many different simulators, loud music, girls in uniform. <br>  Of course, this amount can be spent for the sake of such a thing, I thought.  For the sake of your health :-) <br><br>  While choosing a club, a week has passed.  And something in me so clicked, you know, an idea! <br>  Why not study at home? <br><br>  Instantly looked through the catalogs of simulators, offering any from the simplest to the most complex.  Found a <a href="http://error/">treadmill</a> in an elite store for 800,000 R!  Thought to sell the car for her.  Changed his mind. <br>  Quite quickly, expensive stores for lazy housewives dropped out, got to the site of a factory near Moscow that produced almost all types of simulators.  You can even buy a boxing ring from them.  The prices are excellent (1 dumbbell = 2 chocolates Rieter Sport).  As far as I understood, their equipment is in most schools and state gyms.  Great, that's what we need.  Simple, reliable and efficient. <br><br>  Placed an order: <br><ul><li>  wall bars </li><li>  horizontal bar </li><li>  barbell bench </li><li>  2 rods </li><li>  16 pancakes of different weight </li><li>  2 dumbbells </li><li>  gloves </li></ul><br>  In total it turned out - 9000 R. Delivery is free, 2 days. <br><br>  Brought to the promised time, I collected everything (instructions for gifted ones, of course).  Now it is fashionable to glue the apartment / office with drywall - there is no place to put the horizontal bar, there is an <a href="http://error/">excellent solution</a> . <br><br>  Almost everyone who knew about my plan said: ‚ÄúJanis!  You will never study, money thrown away.  This is all nonsense, a week is enough for you. ‚Äù  The first 2 days angry a little, could not pull myself together and start.  Then common sense won laziness, and I gradually began to engage. <br><br>  Of course, I consulted with experts beforehand, I watched a lot of videos on how to do exercises on which muscle groups.  I highly recommend <a href="http://zmix.ru/">this</a> collection of videos.  All parts of the body - just choose what you want to pump. <br>  Everything was a little easier than it seemed.  3 times a week for 1.5 hours doing exercises on different muscle groups.  Then he began to add.  Now 1.5 months have passed.  I am engaged 4-5 times a week.  Gradually I set up food for training.  The overall feeling is excellent, in the body appeared composure, strength. <br><br>  Music helps a lot during training.  If you listen to the soundtrack to " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_(%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC)">Blood Sport</a> " you will become an all-powerful fighter! <br><br>  After a workout, I go to the shower, then rest for a while, and you can return to work. <br>  The costs are minimal - no time wasted going to the gym, no subscription fees. <br><br>  It is not obligatory to buy simulators in large quantities, two dumbbells, several pancakes of different weights and a bench for the press will be enough.  The treadmill is also an excellent investment, they are quite inexpensive (from 20,000 R). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/53/4e/534ebf74a180c0b4188cac669bd5c1f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I strongly advise everyone who feels like a stale sausage to start correcting the situation.  It is very simple - 1 hour a day, 3 hours a week, practically free of charge, you work for your health and excellent well-being.  Buy a pair of dumbbells in the office - take short breaks in work, and colleagues will catch up.  If you have a family at home, do it together.  The costs are minimal, but what a plus. <br><br>  I think it is nice to feel in shape, to have a straight posture, strong hands, not to choke on a minute jog.  Life is so short to just sit.  I wish you all good luck and a lot of willpower. <br><br>  By the way, photos of my training space can be viewed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yanismarkin/sets/72157623234791779/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88371/</a></p>
