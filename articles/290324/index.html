How many customers have transferred to our site? ‚ÄùEtc.  Well, if you take a regular website or a blog, then yes - I think that will be enough.

      But what about those who are not used to content themselves with the restrictions that they are provided with?  How to squeeze as much information from the statistics that our programs or freelancers give?  And most importantly, how to put it into practice? <br><br>  And for this, let's look at the statistics from the other side.  And let's go from simple to complex and interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Interest </h4><br>  As already wrote before.  Have an interest in our newsletter. <br>  It is necessary to know whether it is not for nothing that we are writing, it would seem, interesting news to us, it is not for nothing that we pay copywriters and generally spend both machine resources and money. <br><br>  And if there is no interest in your newsletters, then you need to come up with interesting content, action, event.  Depending on your type of activity.  In a word, to revive the audience. <br>  If you are all right with this, then read on. <br><br><h4>  2. Clickability = CTR </h4><br>  I think everyone knows what CTR is.  But still recall: <br><blockquote>  CTR is an important indicator of the effectiveness of any advertising campaign.  CTR may be applicable to any hypertext link on the Internet, if its impressions and clicks are counted. </blockquote>  - Wikipedia. <br><br>  Even if your article is very interesting and it is read, your CTR may be small.  This can be caused by many factors.  Such as: <br><ul><li>  Irrelevance of the proposal; </li><li>  The subscriber is "dead"; </li><li>  No call to action; </li><li>  Do not read at all; </li><li>  Not logical factors; </li></ul><br>  etc. <br><br>  <u>Irrelevance of the proposal.</u> <br>  Of course, if you sell skis in the summer, then ... you understand.  Or simply it is not the time for the subscriber to make such a step (purchase, for example). <br><br>  <u>The subscriber is "dead."</u> <br>  You need to constantly check your database for status.  In the process of life, some subscribers simply forget or ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù to their inbox.  Check the base before shipping.  Do not overpay money. <br><br>  <u>No call to action.</u> <br>  The most probably stupid mistake that you can make.  You do not make it clear to the person what is required of him.  If you need him to follow the link to the site, then write to him like this.  ‚ÄúGo to the site‚Äù, ‚ÄúClick‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet the details‚Äù. <br><br>  <u>Do not read at all.</u> <br>  There are, unfortunately, such subscribers.  Who do not read the newsletter at all.  The reasons are different.  And it is better not to delve into them.  The main task is to know whether he should continue to do the newsletter.  The easiest way is to send him a personal letter.  And addressed to him.  And already more difficult is to call (depending on your niche). <br><br>  <u>Illogical factors.</u> <br>  This means that if you are read, but very little, then you need to look at the statistics.  Namely: What days are better than its (newsletter) read and at what time.  By this time, you will already have enough mailings to look at your statistics with more accurate numbers.  Usually statistics are best at weekends in the morning.  And then send the newsletter on Monday morning, as you went to work, there is no sense.  Excel to help.  Build your newsletter charts, and then you will see for yourself. <br><br>  The most important thing.  How to calculate it.  <b>CTR = (number of clicks / number of impressions) * 100.</b> In your case, ‚Äúnumber of impressions‚Äù is the number of addresses that read your letter. <br><br>  For example: you sent N letters, and only 100 people read them, and 10 people followed the link.  That CTR will be <b>(10/100) * 100 = 10%.</b> <br><br>  Question.  Why do we need this CTR.  It helps to know the effectiveness of your proposal as a percentage. <br>  If your CTR is good and suits you, then go to the next item. <br><br><h4>  3. ROI </h4><br>  If you conduct the newsletter yourself and do not spend money on it, then this item is not very important to you.  But nevertheless read, will not be superfluous. <br><br>  And those who order the newsletter, I think it will be useful.  To start the formula.  Everything is clear in it. <br><br>  <b>ROI = (income - cost) / amount you spent * 100%</b> <br><br>  What is this indicator for?  It shows how effective your newsletter is in terms of profit.  And whether to use it further.  I will not write more about the importance and usefulness of this indicator.  But be aware.  He is important to you. <br><br><h4>  4. Segmentation </h4><br>  Let us talk about one more interesting point in your statistics, which, unfortunately, very few businesses use.  This is the segmentation of your customers.  What segmentation options are there?  Easy.  Although by age and sex.  This is more than enough for a regular online store. <br><br>  Why do you need to segment customers?  First of all, to know more about your customers.  And you are very lucky if you already do it.  After all, you will agree, for a more effective distribution, it is better to sell the female thing to a woman than to try to sell to the entire base, where men and women of different ages are gathered. <br><br>  And what about those who can not technically conduct a segmentation of their base?  For you, I wrote this in the next paragraph. <br><br><h4>  5. Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrica </h4><br>  You have a little bewilderment, and here Google and Yandex.  The fact is that they will help us show one more statistic on your newsletter.  And, as I wrote above, help segment your base. <br><br>  What statistics are we talking about? <br><br>  It will help you to find out how long your letter is being read.  How many letters are deleted.  Which of your subscribers are men, and who are women.  As well as a map of paths on the site, and the opportunity to observe at what stage your subscriber left you.  But this is a completely different conversation. <br><br>  By combining two statistics as one, you can cover up many holes in your business, through which your customers flow. <br><br><h4>  I will sum up </h4><br>  I specifically did not talk about how to set it up.  Because this is the topic of another article.  And we'll talk about it later. <br><br>  I also didn‚Äôt talk about spam, because you are posting to your customers.  And getting into spam should not be.  Nevertheless, it is, even if you send out to your database. <br><br>  I wanted to talk about statistics, which can be monitored and measures taken to improve it.  And implement new tools to improve email marketing. <br><br>  Therefore, you need to constantly work on your email-campaign and see in a large one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290324/</a></p>
