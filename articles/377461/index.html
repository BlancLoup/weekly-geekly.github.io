  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home GSM alarm. Galakteko danger. 18+</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The servants of the people still will not pass laws permitting the active protection of housing.  It seems that until thieves steal a pair of diamond pens, no progress will appear.  But then the IT specialists will have orders for arduino-platforms with stun guns and gas cylinders with NPG.  Especially poor will order quadrocopters with travmatik, straziki and management on iPad.  But the whole thing is near future.  And what will the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù do in this future?  It will be as always shaking for the acquired overwork. <br><br>  Last year, there were several articles on GSM alarms for the home on Habr√©: enthusiasm about how reliable and convenient they are. <br>  <i>Pss!</i>  <i>Hey guy!</i>  <i>Want some truth?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/e67/b37/5a9e67b3752d41f9b7da19acffd51658.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Summary of the previous series </h5><br>  I arrived in the Default-city in the early 2000s, renting apartments in the cheapest areas.  I always agreed that I would put my lock on the door, keeping silent that it was an ‚Äúelectromagnetic lock‚Äù: a European noname mortise with a 4-inch deadbolt.  Do not confuse the ‚Äúlock‚Äù with the ‚Äúelectromagnetic latch‚Äù from CISA or Unifort, the centimeter tongue from which you can press a credit card if the door is curved.  And do not confuse with the "electromagnetic cover" as at the entrances - the door will open there if there is no electricity.

      At that time, all imported electronics were three times more expensive than in the Rotting West.  For many years, this castle was the most valuable thing in the apartment.  Sold offered to him strapping from car alarms with remote controls for only $ 199.95.  In 2000, $ 200 was equal to a monthly salary or a Siemens cellular brick.  But I saved. <br><br>  I had caller ID and I put numbers of payphones away from home on his ‚ÄúWhite List‚Äù.  Payphones worked like this: dialed the number, heard the interlocutor - throw a coin so that he could hear you.  I did not throw a coin.  If my caller ID identified a familiar number, then I lost the melody, if not, I was silent as partisans.  Further sleight of hand and a handful of electronic junk.  The signal from the speaker AON amplified, the relay was triggered and the lock was opened.  Before leaving the apartment, I pressed the button at the door and after 10 seconds the lock was closed.  Such is the Life-Hack out.  Later, MGTS acquired an egg and began to tinker with copper wires and real estate, the caller ID ceased to identify numbers.  Therefore, I had to change the principle of the castle (I will not tell this secret). <br><br>  In 2013, according to tilivizer, our guarantor said that there is ethnic crime in the country!  I guessed something like that.  The cheap area where I rent, every year more and more resembles Harlem (with Russian specifics).  And I decided to give myself an alarm for the New Year.  About five years ago, there was only one option - an off-site desk guard, in the city, 200,000 apartments were allegedly connected to it.  You pay 10,000 rubles for the installation, the monthly fee is 300 / month, you give them copies of the keys to the apartment.  And you are guarded day and night, mostly by former police officers.  Uh, god forbid to meet those beasts that extorted bribes from me. <br><br>  Relatively recently, cheap GSM home alarms with thermometers, tetris and tamagotchi flooded the whole world.  Dozens of names and enclosures, and different fillings for one case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e76/130/28b/e7613028b97e4d5c9f7e38f16c2ae99d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Many domestic "developers" claim that this is their development, but they sell Chinese with aliexpress at a price three times more expensive.  Even supermarkets began to sell such junk.  I ordered this from Uncle Liao for 2000 (this was before the next crisis, now two more expensive): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38b/0f9/3e6/38b0f93e612f43c8b3906607ed6d8129.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can connect a bunch of wireless sensors, there are inputs for wired sensors, there is a power output for an external device, there are several protection zones, there is a schedule for each day, there is a control by SMS.  A dream come true idiot.  I put the wireless reed switch on the door, hung the motion sensor and calmed down on it. <br><br>  In April 2014 at 10.30 pm a siren screamed.  I sat with a laptop at a desk lamp, stretched out my hand and pulled out the siren and was surprised - if the signaling has been working for six months without a single failure, then she has no reason to misbehave.  A few days later, before leaving, I glanced at the security module.  Scheduled alarm automatically guards the apartment all night and off in the morning.  But now the light was on - the module was in protection mode.  If I open the door, the siren will scream and an SMS will be sent to my cell about hacking.  Whatever miserable, insignificant people would say - I have a brilliant mind.  He immediately knew who is who. <br><br><h4>  so </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8f/a99/d7a/b8fa99d7a9794c6bb17cb4fb10d3c466.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you know, for the summer burgers from all over the USSR come to Moscow.  The holiday period is the most bread time.  For two weeks before, my wife and I came across a <s>Chechen boy, 20-25 years old, about</s> ten times, who passed the Russian language exam for 146 points.  When we go out of the chain door or when we open it - he grew up behind his back, as if going down from above or as if walking down, as if frightened from our doors.  Or at the time of our exit, he walked along the lower flight of the stairs; this is also a convenient position to take a look.  Perhaps he was very interested in what was inside. <br>  We leave and we come at very different times, and if we are not paranoid, we must assume that he, as an institution, runs from top to bottom all day (we are on the 5th floor, there is an elevator).  At the janitor, he does not exactly look like.  Or maybe he just rented an apartment on the 9th and just very strange.  In the summer I did not see him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79e/a8e/214/79ea8e21472a45ddb8df9c3b0fdc3638.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anyway, each time the door is opened, the wireless sensor sends a signal to anyone who is interested.  So does the key chain. <br><br>  Now about what happened in April.  Criminals are good psychologists.  After the siren goes off at night, the man in the street will turn on the light all over the apartment and begin to check the sensors.  That is a sign of who lives in a cottage house.  The same thing about the morning trick.  First, the siren to the whole house, then after five minutes from the entrance comes the owner. <br><br>  I erased from the alarm connection with wireless remote controls and sensors.  I found a wire reed switch and attached it to the door.  The next day I was sitting with a laptop, and at 10 am I saw how the Unknown Scum could not stand it and turned on the code override.  On the alarm module there is a SIGNAL light, it monitors any signals on the carrier frequency.  The bulb blinked for about a minute.  So the Unknown Scum has recording and transmitting equipment and he was surprised not to see the signals from my reed switch or keychain today.  I showed the Unknown Mrazi the most friendly factor.  My theory is confirmed. <br><br>  In the era of the initial ‚Äúaccumulation‚Äù of capital, a stream of bird droppings (guano) rushed into Russia.  Among other things, there were car alarms.  After a few years and tens of thousands of hijackings, it came to many that in order to crack these alarms, it was necessary to sort through 16 combinations or 256 in especially difficult cases.  No you have a floating code or KeeLoq.  <s>This was done at the request of the NSA to make it easier for terrorists to steal cars and fill them with explosives.</s>  Such car alarms became extinct like dinosaurs, but their primitive scheme was transferred to the Home Alarm System, which sell hundreds of thousands around the world.  On ebayah and aliexpress, they always write "any key chains and 433MHz sensors fit the alarm."  And wireless sensors beacon: my host has something to protect. <br><br>  I disassembled keychain and reed switch.  As I expected, inside there is only a transmitter chip, it has an 8-bit address (put by jumpers) and 4 data bits for the buttons.  No encryption processors, just 4096 possible combinations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/352/384/9d13523846c94c88b87e12ea8f10414a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Total we have: <br>  1. Focus on the apartment.  Is free.  And considering that all and sundry have access to video cameras at the entrances ... <br>  2. Breaking the alarm.  1 minute. <br>  3. Bumping upper cylinder lock.  2 minutes. <br>  4. Breaking the lower lock.  On average, 15 minutes, but can be reduced.  50,000 video cameras on the doors to the porch are poked straight into the face - we are waiting for an article on Habr√© on how to make a key cast by video recording, when a customer goes through the keys in search of an "electronic tablet" of an intercom. <br>  5. PROFIT! <br><br>  Of course, in a remote village such an alarm can and should be set.  Neighbor Ivan Ivanovich definitely does not have a code grabber.  But what to do "urban" and "cottage"?  These alarms can be set and disarmed by SMS.  Write two message templates in your phone.  True, these templates are standard for all alarms.  But you do not think that mobile operators can track them and merge such information to the left?  If you are paranoid - go to a psychiatrist, if it does not help, buy a SIM card from Givi at the exit of the metro.  Mad printer for the present does not put for it. <br><br>  But the key chains - erase from the system, replace the sensors for opening windows / doors with wired ones, because  criminals can iterate through all 256 codes with the ‚Äúdisable system‚Äù flag or simply mute the frequency of the sensors and the system will not even know about the intrusion.  Simple jammers are collected from wireless door bells for 300 rubles, there are plenty of forums about it, here I will not open the omery for you.  I was lucky that I didn‚Äôt initially trust the wireless sensors, so I chose an alarm system into which you can plug in a loop.  <s>But many people will find themselves in .opa.</s>  But many specifically bought completely wireless systems. <br><br>  If so, then who is to blame and what to do? <br><br>  As for the first, you yourself, your security is only needed by you, and not your uncle in ... As for the second, there is an idea.  It is necessary to lower the frequency of transmission.  Let's say up to 400 MHz to fall out of sight of criminal filth.  I think that the planes from this do not fall and the missiles will not start.  The range of remote controls and sensors is only 10 meters. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the whole world is sharpened at 433 MHz and it is difficult to get non-standard frequency quartz.  I could not retail.  The boards are "boats" and "round."  If you have a little - write in a personal, I will be very grateful. <br><br>  We save all.  If a false alarm occurs - do not rush to blame the sensors, better look at the qui prodest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377461/</a></p>
