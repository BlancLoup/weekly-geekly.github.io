"Their children are crazy about the fact that they have nothing more to want ...".  Against this background, I wanted to immerse myself in the topic of staff motivation, having found something exotic.  To be honest, at the very beginning the idea seemed trivial, but, as we know, good luck favors perseverance.  Let us delve into this horn of corporate abundance and motivating excesses. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Google: I want to, I do not know what, because I already have everything</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ao/1n/do/ao1ndog5crr6evyrkcbjtdwe1n4.jpeg">

      Google can be considered a trendsetter in matters of staff motivation.  A lot of PR and even feature films tell the whole world that this is the best company on earth.  In addition to the fantastic offices, the Internet Corporation provides its people with playgrounds, swimming pools, free travel to the workplace, as well as other free services, including rental of electric vehicles, meals, medical services (on-site), laundries, hairdressers, massage parlors.  Also, every employee of Google has the right to devote 20% of their working time, that is, one day a week, to third-party projects that are not related to their core business.  These are less known facts.  From the curious, perhaps, few people know that in the event of the death of an employee, the company pays another ten years to his spouse (wife) 50% of the wages of the deceased employee. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Netflix: 100% flexible</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/bt/8a/jwbt8auqxporuauxjazfwi6o8nk.jpeg"><br><br>  With Netflix, concepts such as flexibility and freedom are reflected in everyday life.  Employees solve work tasks when it is convenient for them.  Work schedule - a convention, the value is only the result.  The concept of vacation is also very conditional.  Employees have the right to take "time-outs" whenever they want.  In addition, in the first year after birth (or adoption) of a child, one of the parents has the right to take as many days off as necessary. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Apple: motherhood by schedule</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/bf/1f/gjbf1flkvwyke1_azxn5okve7si.jpeg"><br><br>  Time is the most valuable resource given to us by the creator.  But it can be spent on the benefit of the beloved corporation.  For example, in the ‚Äúapple company‚Äù women are offered exclusive compensation - covering the cost of freezing biomaterial (the cost of the procedure is approximately $ 10,000, and each year of storage is $ 500).  Thus, a young mother can build a career indefinitely, hoping later for a surrogate mother. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Airbnb: travel money</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8g/pj/va/8gpjvag9fxyjpys8xar0wkplxt0.png"><br><br>  This young and dynamic startup, professing the culture of freedom and travel, allocates each employee $ 2 thousand to ensure that a person goes there, where they want the most.  In addition, company employees in various international offices can enjoy sailing, yoga or playing table tennis, and even take pets to the office. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Yahoo: all the best to people</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/y_/4s/n8y_4s1b1c4ochtl-ysmmj-yl7i.jpeg"><br><br>  Yahoo strongly encourages staff athletic initiatives: Pilates, yoga, kickboxing, and even golf - all of this is available as part of a corporate program.  In addition, the company offers discounts on holidays in popular ski resorts and visiting a variety of theme parks.  The company also holds its own "Oktoberfest" and even finds time to organize special parties for the employees of the waiting children - baby-shouers. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Parallels Health and Comfort</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/to/n4/iston4ai7hibzuv5npehl0vkg5g.jpeg"><br><br>  In Parallels, a set of corporate benefits can be considered conditionally ‚Äústandard‚Äù for the industry: insurance, parking, free meals, reimbursement of fitness expenses, English language classes, office recreation areas with tennis and massage, as well as family holidays for employees and family members.  On the other hand, she is a classic to satisfy the needs of the majority. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Facebook: ‚Äúsweet life‚Äù and children</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l4/c0/oq/l4c0oqzzrbsfmrooinp8rmpnim0.png"><br><br>  Facebook can safely compete with Google for the title of "Most-most" in matters of staff motivation.  From the interesting, perhaps, it can be noted that the company pays its employees $ 4 thousand at birth in addition to the four months of leave to care for them.  Also, many interns earn more than $ 7,000 a month.  This is due to the fact that Facebook offers its interns free housing and medical care. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Salesforce: on the road volunteering</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nv/h2/it/nvh2it9lz-cyenhzfr6knpwpvoc.png"><br><br>  The company helps employees find a person to care for their elderly or aging parents, as a qualified carer can sometimes be harder to find than a nanny for a child.  In addition, the staff receives six paid days a year to volunteer, and they are also given $ 1,000 each year, which can be donated at their discretion. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Twitter on pins and needles</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/_u/m5/jw_um5pexago0vtyj8zizsqohaa.png"><br><br>  Along with all the ‚Äúbuns‚Äù that have already become familiar to IT, Twitter offers employees acupuncture sessions and improvisation classes. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Gazprom: dreams come true</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_a/yk/cq/_aykcqoevhsbixg4zpxkhc_zwwm.png"><br><br>  In fact, not only the gas monopolist has corporate mortgage lending programs for its employees.  The company subsidizes 50% down payment and interest on the loan.  In addition, due to its relations with banks, the company is able to receive more favorable interest rates on loans. <br><br>  And if the examples given above seem to you very ‚Äúbearded‚Äù, catch a couple of, to say the least, strange motivators. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Onebestway: English strawberry</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/s_/3a/jjs_3ay6pzhp84qpvvegdtpzfde.jpeg"><br><br>  Within the walls of this British company practiced ‚Äúbare Fridays‚Äù.  All employees get rid of clothing and internal complexes.  The most shy can work in underwear.  In a word - a paradise for nudists, exhibitionists and other "istov". <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Munich Re and the "moths"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m_/va/tb/m_vatbiyvmcgxxmtgunxfsurg0g.jpeg"><br><br>  Once, German insurers rewarded their employees with a non-standard corporate event with the participation of "night butterflies."  This immediately became a subject for public discussion.  An event took place in the spa.  The waitress could be distinguished from a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù guest by ribbons on her hands: they were red in the waitresses, and yellow in the women of love.  The choice of how and when to encourage or punish their subordinates is the right of a manager.  According to the company's management, the main thing in this business is a sense of proportion.  ‚ÄúMotivation of subordinates should be carried out based on their needs and interests of the organization,‚Äù the company noted. <br><br>  Summing up, we can safely say that today, in matters of staff motivation, the impulse of fantasy is limited only by the budget and moral principles of owners or shareholders.  Otherwise, a solid field for experimentation.  I wonder what motivates you?  Could you share your experience and give examples of excellent, in your opinion, motivators? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423555/</a></p>
