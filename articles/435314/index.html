    <hr><br>  <i><b><a href="https://habr.com/en/users/alinatestova/" class="user_link">alinatestova</a> : We will talk today, as always in this podcast, about the content and everything connected with it.</b></i>  <i><b>Therefore, Katya, I will ask you, as usual, to start from the beginning and tell you about your way in the editor.</b></i>  <i><b>How did you get into this difficult area?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> How I got edited is a good question.  I still do not understand how it happened.  I started working as a ‚Äúcommunications specialist,‚Äù a marketing manager, but I always liked to write.  Then something went wrong: ‚ÄúWhat do you have here for the text on the landing page?  And what do you have here for the text in the mailing list?  You can't do that, and let's do it differently. ‚Äù <br><br>  In such an atmosphere, I worked. <br><br><blockquote>  You know what's best ‚Äî do what's best.  So it all spun. </blockquote><br>  At some point, I started editing on a more regular basis.  These were some commercial projects.  Sometimes I write something for my own pleasure. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: You started talking about how you came to the editorial topic through ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôs not quite right,‚Äù and so on.</b></i>  <i><b>How did you yourself come to an understanding of how to do it right, and understand what should be changed and where?</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>How did you get into "looking"?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> As they always say, if you want to learn how to write, then read and write.  It seems to me that this is an experience that comes at some point, and you begin to see [opportunities for improvement].  For example, in video games there is a button that you press and highlight enemies.  Here at some point this began to work.  You just look at the text, and you highlight some points, there are questions and options for how to remake it. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: In any case, this comes with practice, and this means that before commercial projects and serious tasks related to the text, you wrote for yourself in one way or another.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>Please tell us about your projects at the junction of hobbies and texts.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>I know that you write about books and TV shows.</b></i>  <i><b>How did all this translate into a <a href="https://t.me/howtolooksmart">Telegram channel</a> , interesting texts and, in general, a story related to content?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> It all started at the university.  My first education is journalistic.  I received it at the Higher School of Economics, then it was a department of business and political journalism, it was called so pathetically, and then became a department of media and communications. <br><br>  We found one of the earliest versions of the program, where every year you had to read books on Russian and Western literature.  There are such books that if you compose them, they will be taller than you are.  And you had two months for it. <br><br>  Of course, two months will be enough to read several centuries of Russian literature, and then another Western.  And these are two pairs, and you have fifteen more. <br><br>  When you read at such a pace, then you tell about it at the same pace, and then you write, there are simply no options: you either survive or do not survive. <br><br>  And this approach remained.  I am always interested in trying to describe some kind of experience, because this is how you yourself understand it better.  This is a habit that I have left from the university.  She became my interest, because if you are not interested, you have to go and do something else.  Otherwise, you will simply die and hate everything that surrounds you. <br><br>  When I stopped getting ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù liberal arts education, I wanted to maintain a connection with this.  So it happened.  I have not yet invented some kind of permanent work related to cultural work.  Where I owe nothing to anyone? <br><br>  I'll get a channel in <a href="https://t.me/howtolooksmart"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a>  . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kj/ff/ix/kjffixvoc70txycy5bacqpjkklc.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: Alina Testova, founder</i></font></sup> <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia"></a> <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></i></font></sup>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia">Glyph media</a></i></font></sup> <br><br>  <b>A:</b> You bring some hardcore to your hobbies. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Yes. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Tell, please, about your channel.</b></i>  <i><b>Why do you choose these series and books?</b></i>  <i><b>Does your journalistic education influence your taste in this case?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Taste is, of course, beautifully named.  In fact, over the question of what to read and what to watch - a lot of beer was spilled during the stormy humanitarian discussions. <br><br>  In culture, there is an idea that there is a high, medium and low culture, and there is some kind of ‚Äúcomplete slag‚Äù.  And if you look at the ‚Äúfull shame‚Äù, then you yourself are most likely not a very educated person.  But I had my favorite professor in cultural studies, who adored absolutely ‚Äúslag‚Äù horror films, where all that blood was. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258D%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580_(%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2580)">Slasher</a> . <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Yes, yes.  He analyzed them very cool.  And this man - a professor, doctor of philological sciences, super-dude dude.  At some point, when you cook for a very long time in this, you understand that the separation into high and low culture is a complete garbage. <br><br>  The question is how do you look at it yourself. <br><br>  In fact, in any absolutely weird series or absolutely weird book you can find a lot of interesting things from a cultural or sociological point of view.  From the point of view of how you look at it or how other people look at it, how they perceive it, what they take from it.  This huge context applies to everything that culture produces. <br><br><blockquote>  The question of how to choose ... Just: what you like, see.  The question is how do you see it, what do you take out of it for yourself? </blockquote><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YF8JqKOaabQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: I immediately had a tricky question in this regard related to our work on content.</b></i>  <i><b>Do you think this cultural basis gives you the opportunity, when sorting out with some work topics, to look at the problem from an interesting point of view and to develop it from an interesting point of view?</b></i>  <i><b>Since there are no topics that are frankly ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or frankly ‚Äúlow‚Äù.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Or rather, frankly uninteresting. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> Yes.  Frankly boring or frankly interesting. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Yes, of course.  This is also a lot of experience and experience.  As they say, traditional education on memorizing facts has died.  You just need to google well and be able to understand the sources - choose what is interesting from this and what is not very good. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Now the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa technical background with writing people is very popular;</b></i>  <i><b>that it‚Äôs great, because they‚Äôre better off to understand the technical nuances of what they‚Äôre writing about (if it‚Äôs a technology or production area, for example).</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>In spite of this, humanitarian education and a humanitarian basis give just this interesting ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, the opportunity to pull out non-trivial things, look at the question from an unusual side, and make an interesting topic out of a potentially boring topic.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Probably, yes.  About the resistance between humanitarian and technical education: for me, humanitarian education has always been about explaining the world.  The technology will help you get from point A to point B more efficiently and productively.  Humanitarian education will tell you what is there at point A and at point B;  why do you need this way;  who are you;  that you will understand yourself when you get from point A to point B;  who else went this way and what did he get for himself.  And yet - here is a selection of books about traveling from point A to point B. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> It seems to me that you have now listed the mini checklist by topic for any company.  Who are you, what will you carry out for yourself, if you use our product, why do you need to use it and so on. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Actually, yes.  Any humanitarian direction is very strongly tied to storytelling, on this banal word.  Marketing is essentially storytelling.  Therefore, I have all connected in one. <br><br>  This in many respects complicates life when you come somewhere and you begin to see semantic lacunae that people do not want to fill.  They are okay - everything works: the traffic is ‚Äútrafficked‚Äù, everything is sold, ‚Äúlentils are lentils‚Äù. <br><br>  Seeing such moments is like that. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> You feel an unclosed gestalt that needs to be closed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a7/jx/qm/a7jxqmjrq-zyzq557sofhbuylfc.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: Catherine</i></font></sup> <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/howtolooksmart"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></i></font></sup>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/howtolooksmart">howtolooksmart</a> Kudryavtseva, content producer and marketing editor at RBC</i></font></sup> <br><br>  <b>E:</b> This is like one of my favorite jokes about the fact that if you have a liberal arts education, you cannot normally watch, read, or be somewhere and always be happy. <br><br>  You always begin to analyze this, and it is impossible to ‚Äúunwind‚Äù the sociocultural prerequisites of something.  You'll just always see it.  And you think: "Damn, here I could have fun, but this is ...". <br><br>  <b>A:</b> A good piece of advice is to attract humanities to the editorial team, who will see and say: ‚ÄúNo, folks, this and that is missing here‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: I‚Äôll come back to editing and writing again.</b></i>  <i><b>Some time ago it was very popular to all be stylists.</b></i>  <i><b>Relatively speaking, every person who understood something on Instagram and saw a couple of glossy magazines called himself a stylist and said that he was working in a creative profession.</b></i>  <i><b>Do you think there is such a problem or such a phenomenon in the editor now, when so many people go into the profession?</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>Again, not everyone has a specific background in terms of education.</b></i>  <i><b>It turns out that everything is in this profession, and it is not clear which of them is really professional and who is not.</b></i>  <i><b>Was there a desire to build up from this image when each editor?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Not really.  I call myself an editor not long ago.  For me, all this running around is someone in a white raincoat, and someone in an even more white raincoat;  someone is a labor editor, and someone is not a labor editor - it is rather strange.  For me, it was always just a function of something that you can bring to the project, work of any kind. <br><br>  This function I can do at a certain level.  And the style depends on the task.  There are tasks where you are given 140 slides consisting of percent signs, numbers and abbreviations, and they say: "We want to make an intelligible presentation out of this." <br><br>  It does not need a style - you need to disassemble this pile of slides into pieces of meaning.  This is a function you can do in any situation and in any situation, if you can do it well. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Do you think that courses or additional education are necessary in order to be able to do it well?</b></i>  <i><b>Is it possible to just take and start writing cool?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> I do not even know.  What does it mean to write cool? <br><br>  <b>A:</b> In your opinion.  Here you see some article or just someone writes interesting material on Facebook - and you understand that it is catching and it is interesting. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> These are also very different things.  On the one hand, there are people who are really fucking writing life sketches on Facebook, but they don‚Äôt make a profession out of it and, most likely, don‚Äôt, because they don‚Äôt like that. <br><br>  They can write what happened to them, fun and funny, and in life they are sales managers.  Well, well done, interesting to read you, great. <br><br>  There are people who have been doing copywriting for several years, and everything they write looks weird.  On the other hand, if they are able to sell their services, then this is someone you need.  I speak as a person who does not want to stand in a white raincoat.  Life is flowing, something will die, something will remain.  Everything is changing. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Do you not think that there is a hard way of a samurai that an editor needs to go through without which he cannot be called a full-fledged editor or author?</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>Take the topic of commercial journalism and writing.</b></i>  <i><b>It is clear that you can be <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7">Charles Bukowski</a> and write on the table for many years and so on.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> He's been writing to the table for many years.  This is a very strange way of telling a story about a dude who ‚Äúherachil‚Äù for many years, did not lose motivation.  In commercial editing, few people do that.  If someone doesn‚Äôt like your text, that's all, ‚ÄúI throw the pen right away.‚Äù <br><br>  Probably not.  There is, of course, the temptation to turn on the internal snob and say that if you haven‚Äôt read Pasternak, what are you doing here?  Not really.  I know people who can write well without a very big background reading or humanitarian writing. <br><br><blockquote>  The main principle is just to look at your text every time and ask yourself if I write as a badger.  If like a badger, then you need to rewrite.  That's all. </blockquote><br>  <b>A:</b> How do you define the inner badger?  Did you have any books, artworks or notes that influenced your writing and editing experience? <br><br>  <b>E:</b> In a professional sense or in general? <br><br>  <b>A:</b> And so and so. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Yes.  Like all writers of some kind, I read Write, Cut, some time ago, and I liked it.  This is a good tool in our difficult time - when information rolls on you from all cracks, and the words that are repeated in all this information can be simply removed, because they are really superfluous.  I think there is not something that I reread every night before bed, so as not to lose talent in any way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tp/vc/q5/tpvcq5hg6p5mrmy3_xlxnyhb-wi.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: Alina Testova, founder</i></font></sup> <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia"></a> <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></i></font></sup>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia">Glyph media</a></i></font></sup> <br><br>  <b>A:</b> To hell with literature, just sit down and write. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Well, yes.  Just sit down and read, and then sit down and write. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> You have the most liberal approach.  If someone reads you, if your work is evaluated positively, it has the right to exist.  If not, you need to change something. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> There are moments when you meet a Telegram channel or something else, and you see it and think: ‚ÄúWell, this is a complete garbage.‚Äù  And this bunch of subscribers.  You can get a few points in his self-esteem, calling this author and all his readers fools.  From this you will not write better, and more followers you will not appear.

If you understand that you ‚Äúshut up‚Äù, then the longer you stand in front of this wall, the more irritation it will cause you, and the more will be your ‚Äúplug‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> What distracts you at such moments? <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Do another task, switch to another job.  Sort layouts, "comb" task tracker.  Physical activities help: walk or do exercises, go to the sport.  It would be a good advice to just go to bed, but for some reason it does not work for me. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> He doesn't work for me either. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Thank God.
