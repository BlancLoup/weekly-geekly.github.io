  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 IBM Business Games: Customer Service, Supply Chain and Traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Innov8 is an IBM Business Process Management (BPM) game.  The game is used for educational purposes in the field of business analysis of IT professionals and business users.  In the games of this series, players start by learning the basics of business modeling to optimize the business process and increase company profits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c8/089/26c/8c808926c9684c5087d3a711a0f02ca1.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The game has a fictional call center agency After Inc, which uses models of business processes that do their work in the most optimal way.  The player, as the main protagonist of Logan, needs to research the current model to find out the reasons for the lack of efficiency, optimize it to meet current market needs. <br>  This serious game helps students learn more about business process management and the SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) architecture.  Players will be able to quickly see in practice how iterative process improvement can increase business profitability, achieve customer satisfaction and other goals in solving real problems that government and business face today. <br><br><h4>  Smart traffic management </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/487/1ea/9114871ea9df441f9599accfc3575337.png" alt="image">

      Today, traffic management systems require reliability, real-time data and effective management tools allow us to solve the unpleasant problem of traffic congestion.  In this scenario, the player will be asked to apply his knowledge in the field of Business Process Management to find the best way to control traffic. <br><br>  Applying proposals to improve the traffic situation in real time, it is necessary to achieve a significant reduction in traffic congestion and environmental pollution by exhaust gases in the city.  The scenario allows to analyze existing traffic patterns and change traffic routes based on input indicators.  To test the decision, the player needs to distribute the budget among all available traffic control methods and simulate the traffic management model with the given input parameters.  As a result of the simulation, the following business process performance indicators are measured: satisfaction and efficiency. <br><br><h4>  Smart customer service management </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64b/e07/e04/64be07e04a374ccaaa28b9030fb76479.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Achieving a higher level of customer service is becoming the most important goal for a business.  Therefore, many companies are struggling to provide adequate customer service.  Using the environment of the call center customer service, players develop more effective ways to respond to customer requests.  By applying BPM and SOA solutions, you can improve customer relationships, reduce wasteful inefficiency and increase company profits. <br><br>  The player needs to choose a call distribution model, which should have a margin of flexibility to apply the business rules for routing incoming customer calls.  Then it is proposed to choose a scenario for receiving call service quality feedback.  By configuring the product sales model and distributing the budget on the customer service line, a significant improvement in customer satisfaction and company profits can be achieved. <br><br><h4>  Smart supply chain management </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/0ae/d40/b2f0aed40eaa4e5aa40723676bc82792.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The purpose of the scenario is to assess the traditional model of the supply chain, the balance of supply and demand and reduce the impact on the environment.  Whether redistributing resources on the fly or restocking store shelves to keep up with demand, effective supply chain management is critical to the success or failure of a business. <br><br>  In the game, supply chain management occurs by applying business process management techniques, applying new technologies such as RFID tags and changing the supply chain path.  Using real-time data processing, you can optimize transport lines, deliver necessary goods to the warehouse and significantly reduce the greenhouse effect. <br><br>  First, it will be necessary to select a work plan that allows you to determine the most suitable combination of suppliers.  The principle of the game is to select the input parameters of the model that affect the necessary key performance indicators of the model.  Then, simulation of the model execution and calculation of the results of the performance indicators is performed. <br><br>  Our business process simulation service is also used not only for professional purposes, but also participates in training programs around the world.  The free functionality of the service and the online platform make it easy to integrate it into the educational process of the university or the MBA program. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.bpsimulator.com/ru/business/">Description of business simulators</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/innov8/">Official game page</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297682/</a></p>
