This is the natural nature of man and of mankind, therefore ignorance of the laws of nature will lead the contentists to secure their safety.  So that they finally began to benefit, and not advertising reasonable people. <br><br>  Here we talk only about trends, because  their implementations are many separate chapters for the future development of browsers.  And, it should be noted, they are not far off, the technology of cleaning content from garbage has been around for a long time, and as soon as scavengers cross the line, retribution will follow, and only limited speed of technological development of tools can stop it.  The article will show that these technologies are quite simple to take the next step in the struggle of humanity for the knowledge of the world around it. <br><br>  <b>TL; DR</b> : there is a way to get around aggressive anti-adblockers now, within the existing rules of the game, in browser extensions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, advertisers are no different from distributors of viruses, the struggle only goes not at the level of programs - it goes into the brain of the consumer.  Advertising takes the parasitic part of consciousness, temporarily subordinate to another's will.  The same thing happens outside the computer world - in street advertising, in politics, in religion, so we see only part of one big front of the struggle.  The bait of knowledge (and, increasingly, entertainment under the guise of knowledge) is caught by consumers with advertising hooks, the goal is to take away more money - the equivalent of labor expressed in readers' money.  If money is taken directly by a bank account hack, this is a crime; if through the brain, in the most obvious cases, it is fraud, and in other cases it is called advertising.

      And this advertising aggressively accompanies the content (bait).  Poor employees of sites complain that advertising is the only source of their income, and in fact, breaking a person‚Äôs brain is their only way of income.  But who said that we live in an ideal world in which our equivalent of labor is not stolen?  This music will be eternal, only technology becomes complicated.  There are enemies not only in nature, but also among us. <br><br>  Once this is realized at the level of society and it will no longer be decent to put advertising on sites and be proud of it.  If your site works only on advertising, it will be appropriate to ask whether you are engaged in this business, gentlemen?  But so far, at this stage, we have to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/318996/">deal with content merchants</a> .  They lobby their bills (for people - a consensus of behavior, for them - an effective way of programming the brain), we respond with our actions.  Let's look at the technical actions that were and will be possible at the browser level. <br><br><h2>  Let's return to the topic.  We pose a problem in technical terms </h2><br>  We have the struggle of consumers and content producers, and in fact, the exploitation of bait as content in the form of bait to control the consumer‚Äôs brain and program it to empty its wallet.  Already quite difficult, but because  The article is intended for reasonable people, for whom the content (information) is not a chewing gum for pleasure, but a tool for managing nature, they understand without any further explanation what is the matter.  With some, for the most part, worthy people - the site holders, we have to fight with technical measures - to defend the primordial right of a person to know the world through a network of promotional baits.  Clear content from ads, protecting the brain from debris.  Some of these worthy people understand the rules of the game and do not struggle with adblockers expressing the human right to information.  But part of it is to build up their desires to get into another pocket in the absolute, and it comes to the point that content is blocked if site scripts detect the presence of adblockers. <br><br>  Examples of such sites are overclockers.ru (where I even hiding banners with CSS caused content blocking), cnews.ru.  Probably, the ranks of such super-blockers themselves are expanding.  And with this we need to do something.  This is a question of the honor and self-esteem of a reasonable person against a vegetable person and an avid person who uses unworthy means for his own profit.  After all, one day they will have really useful and unique information, to clear from the advertising debris that the task is facing right now.  They put it - they will be the first volunteer helpers of the ‚Äúwarriors of good‚Äù (not in the sense of Lyapis), who exfoliate their knowledge from advertising evil. <br><br>  Let's expand their list to make it more fun, so that we know on which sites to train, so that as many people as possible see that their personal interests are affected?  I start, then write in the comments, I will bring here: <br><br>  (@spmbt) overclockers.ru <br>  (@spmbt) cnews.ru (it turned out that they wrote bad code, it <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/319118/">does not work for everyone</a> ) <br>  ... <br><br>  Technically, from empire philosophy we narrow the problem to the solution of technical problems.  Find the means to separate the hooks from the baits.  After all, we are people who deserve to receive information in its pure form.  Use the mind to solve. <br><br>  Here again it will be necessary to spread the thought, because the task, too, as it is widely set, will be solved as widely, in various ways.  And the process will go on dialectically - new means of circumventing hooks will cause their new, more cunning systems.  To delineate the expected dynamics of the development of processes, it is necessary to dream up and outline where that could go further. <br><br><h2>  Philosophy of information technology </h2><br>  Like everyone who knows, adblockers were initially very hard.  That's what forced them the reality of the dominant browser (IE 4-5-6).  In the browser, it was not possible to install software extensions (software add-ons that are fairly complex in technique appeared with IE6-7).  We had to intercept the local proxy stream of requests from the site and bite advertising inserts, replace them, add your own scripts.  This method works fine now (for example, Ad Muncher) and all the complications of advertising promotion such as loading widgets and promotional scripts, it could also block in as much detail as modern ad-blocker extensions.  But something stopped the blockers.  Did they beat them?  No, just the creators of browsers realized that it was impossible to defeat extensions.  Well, except that if you transmit a stream over an encrypted channel, deploy it in a proprietary browser extension program (let's talk about this later).  But few people even wanted content providers to become their own evil Pinocchio and restrict access.  There are such, paying consumers too, but they are few and we know little about them. <br><br>  And they have introduced into the browsers and are forced to recognize the extension mechanism (add-ons, extensions).  Now (starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add-on_(Mozilla)">versions of Firefox Beta, see the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù section, 10.667 years ago</a> ) custom script inserts have appeared in browsers.  This tool is not a vegetable person with pockets full of money, but a reasonable person.  It is quite obvious that the support for such instruments was not from the love of the user's free will, but from a more terrible prospect that they would start cutting the input stream and get into the habit of playing without rules.  There is even less chance to get into the consumer‚Äôs brain from contentrs.  And it hangs over them with a Damocles sword, forcing it to wriggle in search of loopholes for an advertising model.  The list of sites - ‚Äúblockers of themselves‚Äù - is the frontline of the Darwinian struggle for existence, among which there are rare and valuable species (not according to the method of suicide, but according to the value of information) you need to find a chance to help. <br><br>  Radically filtering content before coming to the browser is a powerful weapon, it keeps browser manufacturers within reasonable limits, forces content scripts to support, no matter how advertisers rave about to take over the world. <br><br>  But so far this is not necessary.  You can build a bypass anti-adblockers within the existing rules of the game.  Against this approach, of course, they will find ways to get around them and describe how, but you can start building blockers of the next level right now.  They will greatly help for other similar cases - for a meta-search, for example, bypassing the desire of each search engine to be the only one on its page. <br><br><h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe next advertising bypass is not to block ads. </h2><br>  Let her live on the site in full accordance with the intentions of the creators.  Just we will not look at her.  Collect useful information from the page - it can make a browser extension script.  It remains to show the page in the form in which it is necessary for the reader (reasonable).  Send control signals, clicks on the pages of the original content.  Allow the script to click on the useful buttons of the original. <br><br>  The opposition here can also be quite inventive.  Pages can strictly monitor the activity of the mouse, the presence of oneself in the focus of the window, the detour or the need to by clicks of the overlying layers, with aspiration to monitor the presence of unnecessary elements, block scripts with directives.  As soon as there are ways to bypass (2nd generation of adblockers), anti-bypass methods will also appear - scrolling the page, checking covering layers, placing windows on the top in view or, conversely, loading original pages in a headless browser (like PhantomJS, but strictly similar to the real ), mouse emulation based on real reader behavior.  In the end, wars also lead to the progress of technology, and the chosen ‚Äúblockers of themselves‚Äù give us a chance to make the first contribution to this progress.  We come up with an intellect that behaves like a dummy-consumer, the dream of advertisers and businessmen from trading. <br><br>  We will bring progress to the fact that in the future virtual consumers will call stores and speak with comedian voices about the desire to buy their goods to support CTR on the site.  The origins of cheating advertising companies are being <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/318172/">tested now</a> , this is just the beginning.  Let the greed of man also work in the service of progress, it has always been in the history of wars. <br><br><h2>  What exactly should be done now to save the self-blocking sites? </h2><br>  <b>1)</b> Reveal a list of self-blockers to find out which various self-blocking methods they use; <br><br>  <b>2)</b> Build a Saito-compatible model for their salvation.  I propose to begin to make a model of double page, living in the same tab, but covering the original;  the most valuable thing is that such a model will also be useful for proxying the view (View) of other, less upset, and not upset sites at all.  We will be able to build a completely new approach to reader comfort, a little like what Safari and Firefox are doing with their ‚Äúreading list‚Äù.  But there they are trying to universally calculate the content, and we can individually support the "content lists" for sites that interest us.  One model will work on the mass of sites, almost all; <br><br>  <b>3)</b> The ‚ÄúMVC original =&gt; MVC for human‚Äù architecture will be a new word among universal proxy connectors of information transformation.  Data from sites in any degree, the details and desires of the owners (unlike RSS) can be sent immediately to scientific databases, filtering them by man without the need to filter advertising with the eyes; <br><br>  <b>4)</b> For even more uporotyh will remain the same Damocles sword, which does not need browser extensions.  This terrible dream will undoubtedly once be fulfilled for advertisers in the future, but as long as this weapon is not claimed, the intensity of the confrontation is far from the one when it is needed.  There will be many more steps to model the fool consumer, and this dream is much closer for execution at about the 3rd stage, after advertisers play up to the need to generate special browsers in virtual environments and AI for them. <br><br>  And this is good.  Progress is being made not only on the present war, with an infusion of 30% of the state budget and millions of victims.  Progress is also initiated by advertisers on a fairly toy front, with a small number of victims (smoking, MMM, hawthorn, real estate investors, SMS), on the one that will soon lead to the improvement of AI and future victories of humanity over nature and itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319118/</a></p>
