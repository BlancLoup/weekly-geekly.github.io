  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Epic Feil in the world of robots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/1b/pf/ra1bpfzziezmldnay8brwnj7cma.jpeg"><br><br>  The main goal of robots is to make life easier for humans, performing instead of it both primitive operations, such as supplying blanks in production, and ‚Äúmental‚Äù tasks.  Artificial intelligence systems cause major difficulties, but the development of electronics and mechanics has gone far ahead.  Therefore, modern robots look and move very impressively, but they do not shine with special ingenuity.  And often robots begin to behave quite differently, as was intended, performing completely absurd actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgUdrbSGW5w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  For example, a nurse for pouring beer, resembling R2D2, was close to the triumph of his professional career, but ... at the crucial moment, his hand fell off. <br><br>  With the "kitchen" robots generally a lot of incidents.  Small peddlers of ketchup bottles heroically try to please the person, but miss the mark and pour the contents onto the tables and walls.  If you want to increase your efficiency and build a robot that serves you chips, so as not to waste time eating, be careful: instead of satiety and saved minutes, you can lose teeth, get a broken face, or even be knocked down.

He flew so beautifully, flapping his wings, but instead of returning to the developer‚Äôs hands fell on the viewer.  However, the next demonstration of the robot was successful. <br><br>  Most of the problems with anthropomorphic upright robots.  We do not remember how difficult it was in infancy to comprehend the science of walking and manipulating objects.  And the developers of humanoid robots are enjoying in full, trying to get their iron blockheads to overcome an uncomplicated route, open the door, take something.  Looking at these shots, you immediately realize that the profession of penguin lifter in the Antarctic (fallen birds allegedly cannot get up on their own feet) is not at all as ridiculous as it seems.  And the scenes with a robot that is trying to get in the door or unscrew the valve are just heartbreaking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ae/a58/e11/8aea58e11a17e1922269eefd97ac68f2.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to battles, when robots are trying to destroy each other in the arena, much more pacifist competitions are popular among robot builders.  For example, robot football.  And this is not only a demonstration of their achievements in front of competitors and potential investors, but also a great opportunity to test their offspring in ‚Äúcombat‚Äù conditions, assess the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen solutions, and see what is interesting in their rivals.  And let iron footballers today not act in the best way, another thing is important: robots are already playing football!  We can already create anthropomorphic machines that can analyze ever-changing conditions, make decisions and sometimes achieve goals.  But thirty years ago they only fantasized about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/nd/bu/d8ndbur3nyhxhyywcvvezk4x6gq.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, we recently gave robots a great chance to prove themselves - we brought them to the celebration of the birthday of Hi-Tech.Mail.Ru.  The robots <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-wIPvfFATV/%3Ftaken-by%3Dmary_4i">presented a greeting</a> in the form of a dance and did an excellent job: they danced better than some people in the clubs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/5d/yi/rb5dyiaim5axs6rbdnuchoncjjw.jpeg"><br><br>  Such a thing, similar to a modernized flash drive, can move more interesting and rhythmic than a person. <br><br>  So do not judge robots strictly.  They have already achieved a lot and in 30 years can become integral - and useful!  - a part of our life, like smartphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410753/</a></p>
