  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Main arteries of your office</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When it comes to office IT communications, everyone always writes and talks about computers, servers, switches and other equipment that everyone can see. <br>  In this topic, we would like to discuss the topic of so-called passive network equipment, which, as a rule, is hidden from the eyes of office workers ‚Äî these are copper and optical cables, sockets, patch panels, etc. <br>  We will consider the main possibilities for creating a network infrastructure of an office (and, indeed, any enterprise), we will designate their features and tell you why it is so important to make the right choice of equipment from the very beginning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you know, human health depends not only on the work of the internal organs, but also on the state of the vessels - capillaries, veins, arteries.  Similarly, the efficiency of office communications is determined not only by the stability of servers and switches, but also by the quality of the cable, patch cords and modules, other large and small components of the cable system, as well as the quality of their installation. <br>  Special attention should be paid to the fact that replacing or installing a switch or server component, as a rule, does not cause difficulties, and cable pulling is a time-consuming procedure, which is usually performed once and for all.  Therefore, by making the wrong choice of ‚Äúpassive‚Äù initially, you can negate all the benefits from the quality of active network components and provide your employees with a full set of problems with data transmission, both in the local network and when you access the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Options for arranging cable systems in the office </h4><br>  Consider existing opportunities for the creation of cable infrastructure of any office or enterprise.  In fact, there are only three of them: <br><ul><li>  A set of network components, combined into a certain structure </li><li>  Structured Cabling System (SCS) without certification </li><li>  Structured Cabling System (SCS), certified by the manufacturer </li></ul><br>  Since the concepts of pros and cons are rather arbitrary, we will use the term ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù when describing a particular solution.

      <b>Network Components Set</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.tayle.ru/habra/nestrukt1.jpg" alt="Something like this can be obtained by installing a network from a set of disparate components" hspace="18" vspace="12" align="right">  It is a structure assembled on initially separate components of one or several manufacturers. <br>  Features: <br><br><ul><li>  As a rule, this solution is the cheapest possible.  Cheapness is achieved mainly by saving on quality and quantity of components. </li><li>  Separate cabling systems are used for different needs - telephone network, local area network, etc. </li><li>  There is no warranty on the system.  If problems arise, the end user will have to solve them, laying out money from his own pocket. </li><li>  Certification testing of the finished network is not carried out.  At best, the installer checks the correctness of the connection of contacts. </li><li>  The reliability of such a ‚Äúcomposing‚Äù system is not supported by a manufacturer's certificate and depends only on the quality of components and the qualifications of installers. </li><li>  Due to the use of cheap components and the lack of clear standards for cable laying, the probability of its physical damage increases. </li></ul><br>  Based on the above, we can say that the network assembled on a set of components may well be operable, however, it is not recommended to use this solution for serious projects - the savings at the installation stage can turn into serious costs in the future. <br><br>  <b>SCS without certification</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.tayle.ru/habra/sks1.jpg" alt="And this is what SCS looks like. Another thing, right?" hspace="18" vspace="12" align="right">  At this stage, it is necessary to clarify the terms "SCS" and "certification". <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nikomax.ru/">Structured Cabling System</a> (SCS) is a specially designed integrated solution for networking an office or an enterprise.  SCS includes the ability to organize all the services needed by a modern enterprise - local area networks, telephony, video surveillance systems, security, etc. <br>  Unlike a set of components, SCS is a complete solution, the development of which, as a rule, is ‚Äúfrom the needs of users‚Äù. <br><br>  SCS certification is not mandatory, but is a desirable process that takes place after the installation of the system.  It consists in testing the network, verifying the quality of installation and, in fact, issuing a certificate with a <a href="http://www.nikomax.ru/2/%3Faid%3D3">system guarantee</a> . <br>  The SCS installation is performed by the integrator company (installer), and the manufacturing company certifies and provides a guarantee. <br><br>  Features of structured cabling systems without certification: <br><ul><li>  The cost of non-certified SCS, as a rule, exceeds the cost of "artisanal" cabling and depends on the quality of the components used. </li><li>  A single system is used for all applications (LAN, telephony, alarm, video surveillance, etc.). </li><li>  The system configuration change is performed by simple re-switching in the switching node. </li><li>  The result of installation is neatly laid cables, in compliance with standards for bending radii, etc. </li><li>  The quality of the installation depends on the professionalism of the performers and is not guaranteed by the manufacturer of the SCS. </li><li>  There is no warranty service from the manufacturer of the system, which increases the likelihood of additional investments. </li></ul><br>  Summarizing the above: a structured cabling system is undoubtedly a better solution than a network on a set of disparate components, but in the absence of a manufacturer's certificate, the end user is not insured against poor installation and the need for subsequent investments. <br><br>  <b>Certified SCS</b> <br><br>  After installing the SCS, the installer either performs the testing independently or invites a specialist from the system manufacturer to carry out certification. <br>  A check of the quality of the installation, testing of the network parameters is carried out, and upon successful completion of all tests, a certificate is issued confirming that the project complies with the SCS standards and gives the right to use the manufacturer‚Äôs brand warranty. <br><br>  Features of certified SCS: <br><ul><li>  The cost of the certified system is the highest of the solutions considered by us.  The costs are due to the quality of the components and the exact observance of the norms for the design and construction of the network. </li><li>  A single system is used for all applications (LAN, telephony, alarm, video surveillance, etc.). </li><li>  The system configuration change is performed by simple re-switching in the switching node. </li><li>  When adding new workplaces, installation work is not required, or the need for them is minimized, since the number of sockets corresponds to the SCS standards. </li><li>  The result of installation is neatly laid cables, in compliance with standards for bending radii, etc. </li><li>  The reliability of the system is confirmed by the certificate and the manufacturer‚Äôs original warranty, therefore, the need for additional investments is minimized. </li></ul><br>  In general, as they say, "think for yourself, decide for yourself." <br>  In our opinion, the best treatment is prevention.  Lead the right lifestyle and enjoy excellent health.  Install high-quality equipment from the very beginning and be insured against problems and unnecessary investments in the future. <br><br>  Do not be ill!  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87599/</a></p>
