  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is vinyl coming back?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://prdm.ru/habr/images/vinyl-2.jpg" align="left"><br>  Music lovers have always said that the quality of sound in vinyl records is higher compared to CDs or MP3s, but their loyalty seemed no more than nostalgic against the background of the 25-year dominance of digital recording in the music industry.  However, in recent years, online sales of LP (short for Long Play records) have more than doubled thanks to new customers who want more than 99 cents online purchasing of mp3 tracks. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2008, 1.88 million vinyl albums were purchased, more than any other year in the history of Nielsen SoundScan, a company that began tracking sales of vinyl records in 1991.  The previous record was in 2000, then 1.5 million records were sold.  According to SoundScan, more than two of the three vinyl albums sold in 2008 were purchased at independent record stores. <br><br>  Between 2006 and 2007 alone, sales of vinyl records increased by 14%, from 858,000 to 990,000.  CD sales, on the other hand, have fallen sharply in the past three years, from 553.4 million in 2006 to 360.6 million in 2008. MP3 sales grew from 32.6 million to 65.8 million in the same period.

      Observers believe that sales of vinyl records have skyrocketed, because new buyers are attaching more and more importance to owning albums, with their artistic and envelopes, large booklets and a warm sound. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is nothing more pleasant than a vinyl record.  This is an analogue.  The sound is so close, as if you are next to the performer.  If you belong to those people who, while listening to music, sit in a certain, optimal place in the room, you will definitely hear the difference, ‚Äùsays Steven Sheldon, president of the Los Angeles recording studio. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow, 99% of the public listen to music as background music on iPods and similar devices, but this is by far the worst sound quality.  On the other hand, it is very convenient - and convenience is being sold, ‚Äùhe says. <br><br>  Studio Rainbo Records, which has been producing vinyl records since 1955, doubled its production from 2006 to 2007, and more than doubled it last year.  The company currently releases 25,000 albums per day;  this is much more than about 6,000‚Äì8,000 albums a day from the late 80s to the late 90s, when CDs were in full bloom.  Since then, there has been a steady increase in sales of vinyl products.  Surprisingly, Sheldon attributes this increase not to ‚Äú <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X">Generation X</a> ‚Äù and not even born in the so-called ‚Äú <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Boom">Baby Boom</a> ‚Äù, but to 13-24 year old people who rediscover the aesthetic value of album collecting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey grew up on everything virtual.  Their games were on the computer or on television.  Their music was in the box, ‚Äùhe says.  ‚ÄúI think they also feel differences in the sound, but it also seems to me that owning a 12-inch work of art and holding it in their hands creates an extra buzz for them.‚Äù <br><br>  If you thought that Sheldon has a grudge against modern forms of sound recording, you are mistaken.  His company also produces compact discs - 75,000 per day. <br><br>  Over the past 30 years, the number of record companies has declined dramatically, says Sheldon.  But for those companies that remain in this business, the output remains relatively steady, thanks to fans who are sure of a more vigorous quality of vinyl. <br><br>  Josh Bizar, commercial director of Chicago-based MusicDirect, a network supplier of players, needles, and other accessories, believes that Nielson probably underestimates the information about the sale of records, as it does not include in its calculations many network and independent retail stores. <br><br>  The plates really returned so much that specialized online stores such as Amazon consider it necessary to make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html%3Fnode%3D372989011">specialized sections for their sale</a> . <br><br>  SoundStageDirect.com, an online record retailer, increased their sales by 49% from 2007 to 2008, selling 55,000 records last year.  Frank, his owner, said that in 10 years he worked in the store records.  After college, he got a ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù job, but he hated it.  Five years later, he decided to return to his first love. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe records just sound better.  They have that warmth - which only analog sound can have.  The record plays music, but on the CD, the music is transformed into zeros and ones, ‚Äùsays Frank.  ‚ÄúFor me, digital sound is sharper.  It is suitable for background music.  When I want to listen to music, then I listen to the record " <br><br>  According to Frank, the music industry is actively responding to the increased demand for vinyl.  Labels representing musicians such as Nirvana, Van Morrison, Cream, Guns' N Roses and Metallica recently released new albums or re-released old ones, including new LPs.  ‚ÄúMotley Crue recently released all of his vinyl albums, and I can't keep them on the shelves,‚Äù says Frank.  ‚ÄúSome artists, wanting to promote their records on vinyl, put additional tracks on the records, instead of CDs.‚Äù <br><br>  Dan Phipps, head of Newbury Comics, says that most of his record buyers are teenagers who are not satisfied with the online music they buy.  They want to have art work and other additions that are put in envelopes with plates.  In his opinion, the best-selling genres are classic rock, pop and hip-hop. <br><br>  Not only vinyl records are sold.  Phips points to the emergence of a large number of players, upgraded USB ports, which are used to transfer sound from records to digital equipment.  However, today's players are somewhat more expensive than before.  The Thoren player can cost as much as $ 6,200. Moreover, the player from Clearaudio, can cost as much as $ 150,000 ( <i>ofiget - approx. Translator</i> ).  But don‚Äôt worry - the simplest model from Sony, Panasonic or Stanton can still be bought for just over $ 100.  According to Josh Bizar, a decent player should now cost about $ 350.  It will be a player for life. <br><br>  Those music lovers who have not listened to records lately will likely find that the sound quality on today's albums is superior to the quality of the records of the old school of the 20th century.  In the eighties, companies released records weighing 120 grams.  Now, they have become thicker - 180 grams, and recorded using more sophisticated electronic equipment. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48400/</a></p>
