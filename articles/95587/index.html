  <section class="page js-page"><h1>School Project in Rostov-on-Don</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Saturday, May 22, we, in a group of three people, Eugene (enpx), Dmitry (diskin) and I (supervisor) - all members of RND-LUG, re-visited school number 83. As promised, in fact.  Our arrival was caused by the fact that there were two computer classes in this school, and during our first visit we managed to install only one. <br><br>  In the second grade (more precisely in laboratories) we started the installation.  This time we installed the fifth platform.  The benefit of iron was excellent.  It was 10 Toshiba laptops with 2 gigabytes of RAM and a powerful processor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Linux we installed the second system.  In this case, the first system was installed OS MS Windows Vista.  No special unnecessary software was found on laptops, with the exception of a couple of toys and traces of viruses.  Installation was quick and without problems.  All the equipment was determined, up to WiFi, sound and webcams.  From the periphery there was only an ancient Canon Pixma printer.  There were no native drivers in the system for this model, and the Canon drivers did not work.  In this connection, the printer connection was postponed.  By the way, Eugene enpx (he is from the ALT Linux Team yet) later assembled the drivers for the fifth platform.  If you need a driver, you can get it <a href="http://enp.itx.ru/linux/alt/5.1/enp/i586/RPMS/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/702/9d7/3c0/7029d73c032938c056fa40cbfb0fb88a.jpg" alt="image">

      Of course, this fest installation cannot be called a full-fledged implementation.  But we did not set such a task.  The fact is that the main idea we chose to help in the first step.  That is the installation.  Of course, in actual operation there will be a lot of problems (and then they will have to be solved), only if Linux is not installed, then its operation will not begin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/369/b49/1a9/369b491a9b60abd4e5fe6f9a6e91bad6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The operational tasks of implementation and operation will have to be solved by teachers, after studying at courses or self-learning, as well as IT specialists serving the schools.  Maybe our LUG will help you with something.  As for training, our group also conducted five-day training courses for teachers.  And ready to spend more. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/192/29a/2a8/19229a2a8f00eca365d00c53f3f2999d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The attitudes of teachers to the process is very different, and by the way is highly correlated with the level of knowledge of teachers.  Schoolchildren, according to reviews from another school, are very interested - more than when windows was installed on their computers.  There is no explanation for this phenomenon.  School principals build their attitude on the basis of an understanding of the situation, and the situation is primitively simple - budgets do not include procurement software on the one hand, and there is control over the targeted use of funds. <br><br>  The PP also has a budget, and there is also no purchase of proprietary software in it.  Well, and so on up.  And at the top of the budget code.  But that's another topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95587/</a></p>
