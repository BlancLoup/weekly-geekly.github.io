  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where are the negative reviews on ebaytoday.ru?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is an appeal to the administration of the ‚Äúshopping service‚Äù.  I'm not going to cry, what an unpleasant situation has come out of me (in fact, it is tolerant and comes down only to the question of time), I just want to point out the obvious shortcomings / self-serving actions of this company.  Before starting to raise this topic, I looked at a dozen pages of reviews and flipped through a little more than 10 pages of reviews on the site itself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As I expected, I have not met a single negative review.  Maximum dissatisfaction was expressed only in the phrase ‚Äúnorms‚Äù (no details should be given).  But on your Internet I came across interesting complaints about the service.  Major claims are based on package delays of several months.  Mail has nothing to do with it, sometimes it doesn't even reach mail.  But the staff is confident that the case is moving, that now there are just a lot of packages, they cannot cope with the load, but everything will be fine soon.  I personally experienced it.  I give an example (on one of the two premises): <br><br>  <a href="http://www.parcelforce.com/portal/pw/home">01/24/11</a> |  The parcel arrived at the warehouse (track number to check: VZ1699601). <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">01/26/11</a> |  I am writing that the packaging business is not moving at all, although in fact there is nothing to pack, since  Parcels do not combine, add.  I did not pay for the packaging. <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">01/26/11</a> |  I answer that a large flow of parcels can not cope.  And where does such a stream after the New Year holidays come from? <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">01/30/11</a> |  I am writing that my parcels have been going for a week (after arriving at the warehouse) as they cannot go to me.  I doubt about the positive reviews on the site. <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">01/31/11</a> |  I am assured that my review will definitely be published.  No information that the goods still can not be sent to me, no. <br>  01/31/11 |  I have the stage of sending from one of the parcels, they give me the track number. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Now 03/02/11, the track number is still not tracked.  The second parcel hangs in the "packed" section from 01/27/11 with the note "Before you in the queue 27% of the parcels."  This mark has been preserved for several days (weekdays), which suggests that they do not work there at all or work somehow incorrectly. <br><br>  Surprisingly, company employees do not admit their mistakes.  Instead, they begin to lie.  I also met reviews where they wrote that they found a shortage in the packages, but the staff denied this.  Someone has some incomprehensible situations in the course of buying from a store.  These are the moments that I stumbled upon, so I cannot answer for authenticity, but nevertheless ... <br><br>  The most unpleasant in this situation is the following.  Any user who is unfamiliar with the service, first of all, going to the site, will get into the comments about the service.  And what does he see there?  No negative feedback.  Pushing the idea?  I took a few screenshots that also made me doubt: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/24/2b/242b52d16af0da798e3e6cc0da9934b9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/35/45/3545eb539b400554b3a8b879466ef1e5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/29/2829673318b7506aaa59e0d363b0b68a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There are no reviews from clients from Krasnodar and Omsk at all (well, this is logical, the cities are not so large, the probability of meeting is small), but sometimes they skip in pairs.  In the first picture, in addition to the ‚Äúurban couple‚Äù, there is also the same comment.  But the track indexes are different.  The last picture shows that there is something wrong with the package.  However, the comment does not contain a word about it. <br><br>  What provides us with a service to validate these comments?  Only the track number, which gives us an idea about the work of the mail, and not about the service.  Well, as well as some kind of photo.  On some there are parcels with inscriptions on stiches in the style of "ebaytoday.ru".  As a potential buyer would you sculpt such stickers on your packages to photograph them?  Why do you need it? <br><br>  What would you like?  I would like to be able to write to the man himself from Omsk, ask him how his package is, which was barely alive in the photo, why he did not write anything in the comments.  I would like to see the entire event log of each package in the comments, starting from the order and ending with the delivery.  Again, this information must somehow be confirmed. <br><br>  I hope that my packages still reach me.  But if the administration does not change its attitude towards its customers, if it continues to stamp only positive reviews, lie about the condition of the package, I will refuse the services of this company and don‚Äôt bother my friends to advise the same. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, Andrei. <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> .  UFO for unknown reasons, threw me into "I resent", but not everyone can look there, including the administration of ebaytoday.ru.  It would be better if the UFO sent me directly to the ebaytoday company blog.  That would be fair. <br><br>  <strong>UPD2</strong> .  Well.  Yesterday, ibeitudey provided me with the contacts (at my request) of the very Maxim who is in the bottom screenshot.  Yesterday I contacted Maxim, we agreed to meet.  Today the meeting was over.  Now for the points, how are things going. <br><br>  To begin with, the comment was really written by Maxim (more precisely, his colleague).  I wondered why he was so insubstantial?  To which I received an answer, that from the commentary posted by Maxim, only the title was left.  All claims (as I understood, they were with regards to delivery) politely wiped. <br><br>  Now with regards to the parcel.  I asked how long it took to process, pack, send the goods, to which I received an answer, which is about 2 weeks.  But it looked like this: the parcel is queued for shipment, then something <strong>suddenly!</strong>  changing and the service says that the parcel is weighing 120 kg - choose another delivery method.  Why this was not proposed before is not clear. <br><br>  The photo shows that something is wrong with the box.  Maxim and his colleague told me that they paid for the extra packaging.  The packaging is cardboard, but it is so ‚Äústrong‚Äù that, if desired, it is pierced with a finger.  Unfortunately, they did not keep this package, so I personally could not check it, but <i>for some reason</i> I did not hesitate to believe it.  The additional packaging also includes "crushed foam".  Here is the most interesting.  This thing not only looks like garbage and does not protect against shocks and stresses, it also electrolyzes.  In general, the servers that were in the package did not live up to the owners.  Which is very sad.  Administration ibeytudey invites them to send the server back for examination.  Courageous offer. <br><br>  I think the situation is clear to everyone.  I am grateful for the comments that helped each of us to draw our own conclusions regarding the company.  I specifically published this article on Habr√©, because  a rather large percentage of users (including future ones) of ebaytoday.ru probably enter the circle of readers of the resource, but the UFO transferred this article to a closed blog, thereby closing it from unregistered and unsigned to ‚ÄúI am indignant‚Äù.  I make a "mirror" of the article with its comments.  If you see fit, you can distribute the link among your friends. <br>  <a href="http://www.peeep.us/15814a50">www.peeep.us/15814a50</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113072/</a></p>
