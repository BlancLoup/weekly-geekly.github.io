  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Part 0. Requires an elf to work in the Matrix. Relocation possible</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <strong>Attention: contains system programming.</strong>  <strong>Yes, in essence, nothing else and does not contain.</strong> </p><br><p> Let's imagine that you were given the task to write a fantasy-fiction game.  Well there about the elves.  And about virtual reality.  Since childhood, you dreamed of writing something such and, without hesitation, you agree.  Soon you realize that you know about the world of elves mostly from anecdotes from the old bashorg and other isolated sources.  <em>Oops, discrepancy.</em>  Well, where ours did not disappear ... Taught by rich programming experience, you go to Google, enter "Elf specification" and follow the links.  ABOUT!  This one leads to <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">some kind of PDF</a> ... so, what do we have here ... some <code>Elf32_Sword</code> - elf swords - it looks like what you need.  32 is, apparently, the level of the character, and the two fours in the next columns are damage, I guess.  Exactly what is needed, moreover, how systematized! .. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  As it was said in one task on Olympiad programming after a couple of paragraphs of detailed text on the topic of Japan, samurai and geishas: ‚ÄúAs you already understood, the task will not be at all about that.‚Äù  Oh yeah, the contest was, naturally, for a while.  In general, I declare the five-minute stop up closed. </p><br><p>  Today I will try to tell you about parsing a file in a 64-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a> format.  In principle, that it just does not store - native programs, static libraries, dynamic libraries, any implementation-specific, like crashdump-s ... It is used, for example, on Linux and many other Unix-like systems, yes, they say, even on phones his support was previously actively stuffed in patched firmware.  It would seem that supporting the storage format of programs from serious operating systems should be difficult.  So I thought.  Yes, so it probably is.  But we will support a very specific use case: loading the eBPF bytecode from <code>.o</code> files.  Why is that?  Just for further experiments, I will need some serious (that is, not <em>knee-length</em> ) cross-platform byte code that can be obtained from C, rather than manually writing, so eBPF is simple and has an LLVM backend for it.  And I need ELF to parse just as a container in which this byte code is put by the compiler. </p><br><p>  Just in case, I will clarify: the article is in the nature of exploratory programming and does not claim to be a comprehensive guide.  The ultimate goal is to make a bootloader that will allow you to read C programs compiled into eBPF with the help of Clang programs in C - those that I have - in a volume sufficient to continue the experiments. </p><br><h1 id="zagolovok">  Headline </h1><br><p>  Starting with a zero offset in the ELF lies the header.  It contains the very letters E, L, F that you can see if you try to open it with a text editor, and some global variables.  Actually, the header is the only structure in the file located at a fixed offset, and it contains information to track down the remaining structures.  <em>(Hereinafter, I am guided by the documentation on the 32-bit format and <code>elf.h</code> , who know about 64-bit. So, if you notice errors, you can easily correct it)</em> </p><br><p>  The first thing that meets us in the file is the <code>unsigned char e_ident[16]</code> field.  Remember these funny articles in the ‚Äúall following statements are false‚Äù series?  Here is about the same: ELF can contain a 32-bit or 64-bit code, Little or Big Endian, and even under a dozen processor architectures.  You are going to read it as Elf64 under Little endian - well, good luck ... This is an array of bytes and is a kind of signature of what is inside and how to parse. </p><br><p>  With the first four bytes, everything is simple - it is <code>[0x7f, 'E', 'L', 'F']</code> .  If they do not match, then there is reason to believe that these are some kind of irregular bees.  The next byte contains the class. <del>  character </del>  File: <code>ELFCLASS32</code> or <code>ELFCLASS64</code> - digit capacity.  For simplicity, we will work only with 64-bit files (and is there 32-bit eBPF?).  If the class turned out to be <code>ELFCLASS32</code> , we simply exit with an error: the structures will still ‚Äúfloat‚Äù, and the sanity check will not hurt.  The last byte of interest in this structure indicates the endianness of the file - we will work only with the ‚Äúnative‚Äù order of bytes for our processor. </p><br><p>  Just in case, I‚Äôll clarify: working with the ELF format on C you shouldn‚Äôt read every int according to the cleverly calculated offset - <code>elf.h</code> contains the necessary structures, and even the byte numbers in <code>e_ident</code> : <code>EI_MAG0</code> , <code>EI_MAG1</code> , <code>EI_MAG2</code> , <code>EI_MAG3</code> , <code>EI_CLASS</code> , <code>EI_DATA</code> ... You just need to bring pointer to the read or mapped data from the file to the pointer to the structure and read. </p><br><p>  In addition to the <code>e_ident</code> header contains other fields, some we just check, and some use for further analysis, but then.  Namely, we check that <code>e_machine == EM_BPF</code> (that is, it is ‚Äúfor the architecture of the eBPF processor‚Äù), <code>e_type == ET_REL</code> , <code>e_shoff != 0</code> .  The last check has the following meaning: the file may contain information for linking (section table and sections), for launching (program table and segments), or both.  With the last two checks, we check that the information we need (as if for linking) is in the file.  Also verify that the format version is <code>EV_CURRENT</code> . </p><br><p>  <strong>Immediately make a reservation, I will not check the validity of the file, assuming that if we load it into our process, we trust it.</strong>  In the code of the kernel or other programs working with untrusted files, this, of course, <strong>cannot be</strong> done <strong>in any way</strong> . </p><br><h1 id="tablica-sekciy">  Section table </h1><br><p>  As I said, we are interested in the linking view of the file, that is, the table of sections and the sections themselves.  Information on where to look for the section table is in the header.  Its size is also indicated there, as well as the <strong>size of one element</strong> - it may be larger than the <code>sizeof(Elf64_Shdr)</code> (how this will affect the version number of the format, to be honest, I don‚Äôt know).  Some of the higher section numbers are reserved, and in fact in the table are not present.  Referring to them has a special meaning.  We are interested, apparently, only <code>SHN_UNDEF</code> (zero is also reserved - the missing section; by the way, as you understand, its heading in the table is still there) <code>SHN_ABS</code> .  The symbol ‚Äúdefined in the <code>SHN_UNDEF</code> section‚Äù is actually undefined, but in <code>SHN_ABS</code> it actually has an absolute value and is not relocated.  However, <code>SHN_ABS</code> doesn't seem to be <code>SHN_ABS</code> me yet. </p><br><h2 id="tablica-strok">  Row table </h2><br><p>  Here we first stumble upon string tables - tables of strings used in the file.  In fact, if <code>const char *strtab</code> is a string table, then <code>sh_name</code> is just <code>strtab + sh_name</code> .  Yes, this is just a string, starting with a certain index, and continuing to a zero byte.  Strings may intersect (more precisely, one may be a suffix of the other).  Sections can have names, then in ELF Header the <code>e_shstrndx</code> field will point to the row table section (the one for section names if there are several), and the <code>sh_name</code> field in the section header is for a specific row. </p><br><p>  The first (zero) and last bytes of the string table contain null characters.  The last is clear why: the value is hour, ends the last line.  But the zero offset specifies the <em>missing</em> or <em>empty</em> name - depending on the context. </p><br><h2 id="zagruzka-sekciy">  Loading sections </h2><br><p>  In the header of each section there are two addresses: one, <code>sh_addr</code> is the download address (where the section will be placed in memory), the other, <code>sh_offset</code> is the offset in the file where this section is located there.  I don‚Äôt know how both are, but each one of these values ‚Äã‚Äãmay be 0: in one case the section ‚Äúremains on disk‚Äù, since there is some service information there.  In the other - the section is <em>not loaded from the disk</em> , for example, it just needs to be allocated, and filled with zeros ( <code>.bss</code> ).  Honestly, until I had to handle the download address - where it was loaded, it was loaded there :) However, we also have, we must say, specific programs. </p><br><h1 id="relokaciya">  Relocation </h1><br><p>  And now it‚Äôs interesting: as it is known, safety does not go to the Matrix without an operator remaining on the base.  And since we still have fantasy here, the connection with the operator will be telepathic.  Oh yeah, I declared the five-minute perusibility completed.  In general, we briefly discuss the linking process. </p><br><p>  For my experiment, I will need a piece of code compiled into the usual so-shku loaded by the usual <code>libdl</code> .  Here I will not even describe in detail - just open the <code>dlopen</code> , stretch the characters through <code>dlsym</code> , close the program with <code>dlclose</code> when the program <code>dlclose</code> .  However, even this is already implementation details not related to <em>our</em> ELF file loader.  There is simply a <em>context</em> : the ability to get a pointer by name. </p><br><p>  In general, the eBPF instruction set is a triumph of aligned machine code: the instruction always takes 8 bytes and has the structure </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> {</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint8_t</span></span> opcode; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint8_t</span></span> dst:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint8_t</span></span> src:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> offset; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint32_t</span></span> imm; };</code> </pre> <br><p>  Moreover, many fields in each specific instruction may not be used - saving space for a ‚Äúmachine‚Äù code is not about us. </p><br><p>  In fact, the second instruction can immediately follow the second one, which does not contain any opcodes, but simply extends the immediate field from 32 to 64 bits.  Here is the patching of such a compound instruction called <code>R_BPF_64_64</code> . </p><br><p>  In order to perform a relocation, once again look at the partition table for <code>sh_type == SHT_REL</code> .  The <code>sh_info</code> field of the header indicates which section we are patching, and <code>sh_link</code> - from which table to take a description of the characters. </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">typedef</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> {</span></span> Elf64_Addr r_offset; Elf64_Xword r_info; } Elf64_Rel;</code> </pre> <br><p>  Actually, there are two types of relocation sections: <code>REL</code> and <code>RELA</code> - the second explicitly contains an additional term, but I haven‚Äôt met it yet, so just add assertion to the fact that it really does not meet, and we will process it.  Further I will add to the value that is written in the instructions, the address of the symbol.  And where to get it?  Here, as we already know, options are possible: </p><br><ul><li>  The symbol refers to the <code>SHN_ABS</code> section.  Then just take <code>st_value</code> </li><li>  The symbol refers to the `SHN_UNDEF section.  Then we pull out the external symbol. </li><li>  In other cases, just patch the link to another section of the same file. </li></ul><br><h1 id="kak-poprobovat-samomu">  How to try it yourself </h1><br><p>  First, what to read?  In addition to the already specified <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">specification,</a> it makes sense to read <a href="">this file</a> , in which the iovisor team collects information extracted from the Linux kernel via eBPF. </p><br><p>  Secondly, how to work with all this?  First you need to get an ELF file from somewhere.  As stated <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47895418">on StackOverfow</a> , the team will help us. </p><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">clang -O2 -emit-llvm -c bpf.c -o - | llc -march=bpf -filetype=obj -o bpf.o</code> </pre> <br><p>  Secondly, you need to somehow get the reference file parsing into pieces.  <code>objdump</code> command would help us: </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ objdump : objdump &lt;&gt; &lt;()&gt;     &lt;()&gt;.          : -a, --archive-headers Display archive header information -f, --file-headers Display the contents of the overall file header -p, --private-headers Display object format specific file header contents -P, --private=OPT,OPT...

Here we remember what we collected using LLVM.  And LLVM has its own extended analogues of utilities from binutils, with names like <code>llvm-&lt; &gt;</code> .  They, for example, understand LLVM bitcode.  And they also understand eBPF - it probably depends on the compilation parameters, but since it is compiled, it probably should always be parsed.  Therefore, for convenience, I recommend creating a script: </p><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">vim <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">test</span></span>-bpf.c <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#     clang -Oz -emit-llvm -c test-bpf.c -o - | llc -march=bpf -filetype=obj -o test-bpf.o llvm-objdump -d -t -r test-bpf.o</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  Then for this source: </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;stdint.h&gt; extern uint64_t z; uint64_t func(uint64_t x, uint64_t y) { return x + y + z; }</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  There will be such a result: </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ ./compile-bpf.sh test-bpf.o: file format ELF64-BPF Disassembly of section .text: 0000000000000000 func: 0: bf 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 r0 = r2 1: 0f 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 r0 += r1 2: 18 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 r1 = 0 ll 0000000000000010: R_BPF_64_64 z 4: 79 11 00 00 00 00 00 00 r1 = *(u64 *)(r1 + 0) 5: 0f 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 r0 += r1 6: 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 exit SYMBOL TABLE: 0000000000000000 l df *ABS* 00000000 test-bpf.c 0000000000000000 ld .text 00000000 .text 0000000000000000 g F .text 00000038 func 0000000000000000 *UND* 00000000 z</code> </pre> <br><p>  <a href="">Code</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452608/">Part 1.
