  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Second day with Apple TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, that happened.  Apple's set-top box release date has been pushed several times.  At once I will make a reservation that how correctly to call this device and to which category I‚Äôm not very aware of.  Apple calls it "the center of entertainment" (as if it did not sound crooked;) or "iPod of the Internet era."  Both of these definitions, to a certain extent, are not far from reality, but I will try everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It turned out that being theoretically wishing to get an Apple TV, practically I was not really going to do that.  The fact is that, as Apple does, it usually allows itself and has allowed it many times in the past, and in this case they ran ahead of technological progress.  I hint at some strange, at first glance, technical requirements of the console.  Here is the requirement for TV specified on their website: <br><br>  Enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen TVs capable of 1080i 60 / 50Hz, 720p 60 / 50Hz, 576p 50Hz (PAL format), or 480p 60Hz

      <br>
      Those who do not have a widescreen TV, at least 480p, may not be worried, although rumors about the almost successful connection of AppleTV to a regular 4x3 TV are already beginning to sound. <br><br>  So, theoretically, lusting like a multimedia center, I was preparing to postpone its purchase until better times, because  I, alas, was not the owner of an advanced widescreen TV.  But it turned out that a couple of days ago, when I went to the store and saw 40 "Sony HDTV there, I left with the purchase. The next day I called the nearest Apple Store and asked if" you don‚Äôt have an Apple TV by any chance. " they had one. True, there was only one in a warehouse, which I was immediately postponed. <br><br>  By paying the required $ 299 plus some taxes, I brought home a small but rather weighty box.  In style and packaging, it is very similar to the box from the iPod, but of course the size is bigger. <br><br>  Apple TV turned out to be a rather thin device (less than half of mac mini in height), but at the same time somewhat wider / deeper.  Somewhat surprised by the weight, heavier than can be expected judging by the size of the box.  The power supply unit is tucked inside the device, which personally makes me happy and minimizes the number of inserted bp. <br><br>  Connecting AppleTV to the TV took seconds probably 30. Power to the network and HDMI to the TV.  By the way, in addition to the power cord of other wires in the kit does not go, so the HDMI or component cable must be searched and purchased separately. <br><br>  First of all, a menu of language selection appeared, where Russian was proudly displayed among various others.  I really chose english, and I got to the next screen for selecting the resolution of the TV and then setting up the connection.  AppleTV carries 802.11n onboard and requires at least a 802.11g network for full-fledged wireless work, which I have and which, as practice has shown, is quite enough for everything.  The choice of password / key is made by the remote control unit that comes with it, which is the same remote control that comes with all new computers from Apple.  By the way, the remote can be paired with Apple TV, which allows you to avoid the influence of other similar remotes, if you have more than one of them.  I have 3 of them, so the function turned out to be quite appropriate and in demand. <br><br>  Then something started that clarified the definition of the ‚ÄúiPod of the Internet era‚Äù for me.  On a computer running iTunes, another iPod-like device appeared under the name Apple TV.  A 5-digit code appeared on the TV, after dialing which it became possible to do everything with this Apple TV as with a regular iPod.  Those.  select movies, TV shows, music, podcasts and photos to sync.  The Apple TV's drive size is 40G, and about 32 of them are available for user data.  Well, a typical 30G iPod, only remote and with an external screen.  Everything related to this mode of operation is absolutely identical to working with iPod. <br><br>  The second mode is ‚Äústreaming‚Äù.  It is implemented in a separate mode, where you have to select one of five computers in the list and switch to it.  From this point on, navigation screens allow you to browse through the content of a remote iTunes.  I did not see photos in this mode, although I admit that if I had run iPhoto on the computer, they would have appeared there. <br><br>  This is a separate mode, which seemed to me not quite comfortable and wise decision.  When you browse a remote computer, you can go back to your local disk (iPod mode) by pressing a few buttons on the remote.  Not so very difficult, but somewhat annoying the need for frequent switching. <br><br>  In both modes, the speed of work is amazing.  There is no noticeable delay in controlling the console, movies and audio start playing almost instantly.  For movies and TV shows purchased from ITS, navigation in parts is supported.  It is said that for self-made films you can simply twist forward / backward.  All that is played in iTunes plays and Apple TV.  In any case, I did not find a single exception to this rule here.  Movies are shown conveniently sorted by time - the most recent at the top (at the beginning).  Somewhere there was an opportunity to change the sorting, although I will not give a head for clipping. <br><br>  Navigation is very intuitive, it doesn‚Äôt cause any brain strain and works as you would expect.  I don't even know what else to say about navigation.  Well, except that anyone who has ever held an iPod in their hands will find a lot of acquaintances. <br><br>  Photo showing is done through a slideshow, where you can choose both effects and music.  In general, the impression of a photo on 40 "HDTV is difficult to describe in words, but I made a definite conclusion for myself - printing paper copies is a distant past :) <br><br>  Podcasts (both video and audio) work just like a regular iPod.  Nice to see high-resolution video podcasts.  I have a couple of such in the subscription - DL.TV and MacBreak.  Films and series of new, high resolution 640x480, look just great.  Those that were before (320x240) are also tolerant, although of course not. <br><br>  In conclusion, let me remind you that Apple TV is a cross-platform thing and can work with any system that runs iTunes.  Personally, I have not tried Windows, but they say it works perfectly. <br><br>  From an emotional point of view, Apple TV gives me the warmest and most enthusiastic feelings.  Perhaps, for me, nothing closer to the ideal device "under the TV" is hard to come up with. <br><br>  PS Put the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/umputun/AppleTV">pictures</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5801/</a></p>
