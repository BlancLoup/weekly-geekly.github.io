But still, it is not always possible to withdraw on the card, because sometimes you have to use translations, especially when you need money as quickly as possible.  So, I’m used to using translations, most of all I’m glad about the Anelik system, but more recently a new money transfer system called Golden Crown has appeared on the website perevod.webmoney.ru, which I decided to use this time, since one from the “cash points” was right in front of my house, across the street.  To my surprise, this item turned out to be one of the stores of the well-known Russian mobile phone chain chain Svyaznoy ( <a href="http://www.svyaznoy.ru/">www.svyaznoy.ru</a> ).  But since the <b>money was needed urgently</b> , I confirmed the transfer without hesitation and after an hour of waiting I ran to the Messenger for the desired money.  But it was not there, the details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5f/11/5f111d7a7c6ae7267bf1414949226aa3.png" alt="image">

    <h4>  In connected </h4><br>  When I came to the liaison office, I turned to the employees and found out that the <b>money is not given in cash</b> , and the first transfer is the “Svyaznoy Club Mastercard” <a href="http://www.sclub.ru/">card</a> ( <a href="http://www.sclub.ru/">www.sclub.ru</a> ).  But I already had such a card, which I purchased much earlier, which I told them about.  Taking the card from me, they tried to transfer the funds to the card, but they did not succeed for an “unknown reason”, they advised me to call the contact information center and find out what was wrong.  I nodded and went to call from the mobile to the center (good call is free), the operator asked for the transfer number, and said that “the transfer was not found in the system” advised me to contact the Golden Crown information center. <br><br>  Well, I’m calling them, the answering machine replies that “Now all operators are busy, the approximate waiting time is <b>17 minutes,</b> ” if the money wasn’t needed so urgently, I would spit on everything and cancel the transfer, but this is not the case ... After waiting 17 More than minutes, I finally contacted the operator who found the transfer and said that everything is in order, the transfer must be issued, but not in cash, but to the card, namely to the “Svyaznoy Klub Mastercard Club” card, I was asked to transfer the call to the employee of the messenger .  The employee told her for a long time that the system gave an error, as a result, she was connected to a technical specialist who told her what the reason was: it turns out that it is necessary that the name of the cardholder and the owner of the certificate Webmoney match (it coincided) and that the phone numbers match indicated contact in the certificate and on the map. <br><br>  But, it is interesting that webmoney did not warn about it anywhere in the process of making a transfer, there was not even anywhere written about the fact that a phone number would be read from my certificate and much less any information about making cards, etc.  There is written everywhere about the issue of <b>cash</b> ! <br><br><h5>  Briefly about the “Svyaznoy Club Mastercard” card (you can skip) </h5><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/01/60/01608a526f8bb02196fc91715c50da48.png"></a> <br>  I have been using this wonderful card for some time, which is also a bank debit card, as well as a discount cumulative card store.  For me, it is convenient, because it is issued free of charge (when you make a deposit, you need to pay 500 rubles, which you can immediately withdraw at an ATM or spend at the store), no service charge is taken, payment by card in stores without a fee, cash withdrawals in certain ATMs (the list is on the website) without a commission, well, the fact that this card is real and it can be <a href="http://pay.sclub.ru/advantages.aspx%3Ftab%3D2">easily paid off,</a> for example, on eBay or for paid Skype calls, and as another bonus, for every 100 rubles spent where 1-21 rubles discount in a liaison.  Conveniently. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  The problem is clear, the point is the mismatch of phone numbers.  The employee began to change the contact phone number of my card in her database so that it coincides with that in Webmoney, but the database answered her “Inadmissible personal data change”, she phoned the technical specialist, after waiting 20 minutes again and reporting the situation, he answered that he also failed to change the data.  And then I remembered one fact that maybe the number is not installed, since it is already registered to another card in the same system, but with a different name.  This card was also with me, but I did not manage to change the number to another one (I wanted to enter the sister’s number, which the card was issued to), the technician also failed in the system, and the employee denied access ... The technician advised I didn’t manage to get a card (as it’s not surprising), because “such passport data is already present in the system” ... I arrived, I think. <br><br><h4>  A casket just opened </h4><br>  Hoping for good luck, I decided to call the Svyaznoy Club information center in order to change the number first on the sister’s card (my number there, which is in the certificate) to her, and then change the number on my card, to the one that is in the certificate.  Oddly enough, I managed it, no failures and access restrictions.  I told the employee that the number now corresponds, she entered the data into the translation system, and, finally, the transfer was finally “successfully completed”, the funds were supposedly on my card.  2.5 hours in the evening I ditched for an operation that takes only 5 minutes. <br><br>  <i>But I want to say a huge thank you to these two employees from a liaison officer in Volgograd at ul.</i>  <i>Eletskaya d. 10, Daria and Mary.</i>  <i>While Daria worked only for me for several hours, Maria served the rest of the store, although the work was designed for at least two employees.</i> <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  Despite such a lengthy procedure for obtaining an “instant transfer”, I was happy and satisfied, I ran to the store and scored a whole cart of products and other necessary things.  At the checkout, I used to pay with a card, but it turned out that the payment was “not approved” because there were not enough funds in the account.  I had to give up my purchases and go home dead ... There was no longer any strength to call and complain.  The money that was really needed that day came only in the evening of the next day, sms-ka told me about it, which fell on the phone.  Of course, I was glad that the money came at all, but unfortunately, at the time when they were needed “to the point of hysteria” they were not there.  As they say, "He who gives in time gives twice." <br><br>  PS: I would like to transfer to the blog "I resent." <br><br>  <b>Upd</b> : Thank you, transferred to "I resent." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97902/</a></p>
