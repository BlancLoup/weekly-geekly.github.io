Soft Skills </h2><br><ol><li>  I am silent at meetings.  I try to make an attentive and intelligent face, even if I do not care. </li><li>  People consider me positive and negotiable.  I always politely and unsustainably inform you about what is written in the task card to do.  And only once.  Then I do not argue.  And when I finish the task and it turns out to be what, I don‚Äôt laugh, and I don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI have spoken!‚Äù. </li><li>  I do not care what kind of prog.  If the customer was interested in my opinion, he would not have hired a project manager, product manager, scrum master, agile master and UI designer.  Here these hipsters even form all opinions, visions and marketing pieces. </li><li>  I am disciplined.  I come to work at 9 and leave at 6. I feel so comfortable.  I can stay for double pay or if the task is interesting. </li><li>  I have a good sense of humor and a rich life experience.  I can easily disrupt the work of the team by half a day with stories about how my Saturday went.  But I rarely do it, because I think that I am paid not for it, but for the fact that I passed some kind of thread. </li><li>  I spit your teamwork, you know where.  I can prod any kaku myself, but with a smart look I can explain to my subordinates that they must do some kind of kaku beyond my powers. </li><li>  I'm just amazing in the presentations.  Especially if you want to present the unfinished bottom.  I master the bugs at the presentation of the program.  Once I presented the login window for two hours, because the program did not work any further.  And the login did not always work. </li><li>  When everything gets me, I quietly quit, and do not go to the departments and not the gunzha "Everything is bad, we are on the bottom, everything is fools." </li></ol><br><h2>  Section 2. Hard Skills </h2><br><ol><li>  Inheritance is a godless thing if only 1 child is inherited from dad. </li><li>  I only use encapsulation when the Idea emphasizes yellow and writes that this method can be made private.  Same with final. </li><li>  I never used volatile, finalize and many others. </li><li>  I do not mind what to use: ArrayList or LinkedList.  I always use ArrayList. </li><li>  I can not use getters and setters in Java if I know that nobody will read my code.  person.name = "john".  If I know that someone will read it, I‚Äôm shy. </li><li>  I still do not understand why we need interfaces in java, with the exception of callback and lambda.  All the examples with their use are far-fetched and I can make it easier without them. </li><li>  I do not know how gc works, I have never used it.  And in general for 6 years in my memory, he was mentioned only once.  In addition to interviews, of course. </li><li>  I have a turnip on a githaba, but I won't show it to you.  She is my personal, and I am there the skin, as I want.  You are not at home in a tailcoat, go? </li><li>  I <s>can</s> and I like to burn the front if I am tired of backing.  The reaction I already forgot and fell behind.  But I remember Senchu. </li></ol><br><h2>  Section 3. Achievements </h2><br><ol><li>  I made 3 sites which were used by less people than it did.  When I did 2 sites I knew that no one would enter them (they were expected to take over the world) </li><li>  I made three web applications (ExtJs-Java-Docker), two of them were never compromised, and one was used twice (they were expected to take over the world). <br><br>  When I did them, I knew that this would happen, because I do not believe in users who learn by heart a 20-page manual, I myself presented my work with a printed manual in my hands. </li><li>  I made a native android application of 8 screens in which no one went further than the second, it was downloaded 107 times in the google market (it was expected that it would take over the world). </li><li>  Once I repaired the highest-bug for two days, and then I realized that no one went to this section of the site for about three years.  And it was a very healthy section of the site, which spent a lot of man-hours. </li><li>  I spent about a week on the fact that the combo box did not leave on top, but on the right. </li><li>  I managed 4 people and for half a year we did one project that I could do alone in a week.  And yes, this is a draft of clause 2. </li><li>  I set up query caching in Mongu on an application that hosts one person per day. </li><li>  I did a corporate email client, despite the fact that there are hundreds of freebies and everyone was better. </li><li>  I was engaged in pixel idealization (or what is it called?) On the front. </li><li>  I redesigned the Material UI library design for React, because our UI freelance designer from Kurgan decided that he had a better understanding of design than Matthias Duarte, Google‚Äôs vice president of design, bachelor of computer science with distinction .  education in the field of art and art history, the head of the Student Art Gallery in Maryland. <br><br>  I never understood why reworking the good things that smart people did for you and gave away for free, especially if you are obviously dumber. </li><li>  I made a feature for a month, which, with the most optimistic calculations, would have fought off 437 years.  (ordering mops for cleaners) in ERP. </li><li>  I reworked one Kaku from scratch 7 times, because I changed the TK.  As a result, it became worse than it was. </li><li>  I understood for 4 hours why the penny was wrong in the bill, moreover, I knew in advance that I could not fix it, otherwise the balance would not converge. </li><li>  I did microservice to increase the reliability of the main business logic, and yes this microservice crashed 20 times more often than business logic.

      But then they made a whole department out of 12 people to increase the reliability of this microservice reliability, and now microservice crashes another 20 times more often, makes half-hearted transactions and loses data completely.  When I quit, they conceived to make a microservice of reliability for microservice of reliability. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450266/</a></p>
