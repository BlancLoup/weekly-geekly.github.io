This, however, does not mean that you should accept money from any angel.  Choosing the right type of business angel is also an important success factor. <br><br>  Like any other classification, this is also quite subjective. <br><br><h3>  Return on Investment Angels </h3><br>  The most important thing to know about them is that they invest only when the market is good.  Such investors are mainly associated with financial rewards, which they can receive in view of high-risk investments.  For this type of angels, investing in startups is another important addition to their already diversified investment portfolio. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Corporate Angels </h3><br>  These angels most often are former heads of enterprises.  While it seems that their investments in your business are made only for income, in fact they are looking for a paid and privileged position in the company in which they invest. <br><br><h3>  High-tech Angels (High-Tech Angels) </h3><br>  Although these investors are the least, experience shows that the investments made by them in modern technologies are very significant.  They value the profitability of a business as much as they value the launch of a new technology on the market. <br><br><h3>  Angels entrepreneurs (Entrepreneurial Angels) </h3><br>  These are successful investors who have their own business, which provide them with a constant flow of funds to invest in high-risk enterprises.  Although they make every effort to help entrepreneurs start a business, they do not actively intervene in the activities of the company. <br><br><h3>  Core Angels </h3><br>  These are investors with extensive business experience who have accumulated huge cash reserves over a long period of time.  The important fact about these investors is that they tend to make high-risk investments that diversify the investment portfolio, despite the losses.  These Angels not only make capital investments, but often share useful knowledge. <br><br><h3>  Professional Angels </h3><br>  Being professionals in their industries, these angels invest in companies operating only in the same fields.  Sometimes, they can invest several companies at the same time.  Professional angels are extremely useful at the initial capital investment stage. <br><br><h3>  Micromanagement Angels (Micromanagement Angels) </h3><br>  They are considered the most serious types of investors.  While most of them were born in rich families with high social status, many others acquire wealth through hard work.  These investors tend to enter the company's management.  After that, they try in every way to involve the invested startup in their own business strategies. <br><hr><br>  - <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/articles/2352/">TOP-15 of the most active angels of Russia for 2013</a> <br>  - <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/articles/4404/">TOP of the most active angels of Russia in 2014</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284008/</a></p>
