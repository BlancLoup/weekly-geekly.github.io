To begin with - a brief overview of who and in what cases need Veeam ONE. <br><br><h5>  Veeam ONE: Short Review </h5><br>  With the proliferation of server virtualization, effective management of the virtual environment is becoming increasingly relevant.  This happens for the reason that: <br><ul><li>  Virtual machines now support mission-critical workloads. </li><li>  IT professionals have to document the process of using virtualization and its business value for a wide range of people, from heads of IT departments to company executives. </li><li>  Resources must be allocated efficiently, and the growth of virtual machine infrastructure must be manageable. </li></ul><br>  Veeam ONE helps system administrators to solve all these tasks with a single, simple and effective tool.  Administrators need to be among the first to find out about issues affecting the performance and availability of the virtual environment.  Thanks to more than 200 built-in alerts and an extensive knowledge base, the user of the product has the opportunity not only to receive notification of a problem, but also to get all the necessary information to troubleshoot a problem, identify the root cause of the problem and resolve it quickly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://www.veeam.com/images/screenshots/one/reporter_vmware.png" alt="image"><br>  Domestic policies, regulations and simple common sense require complete and up-to-date documentation of the ever-changing virtual environment.  Management of the environment requires information about the workload, resources and their consumption.  An instant picture of the performance of a virtual infrastructure is needed.  Veeam ONE provides all of this, including embedded reports, dashboards and automated reporting.  You can quickly get all the necessary information. <br><br>  Veeam ONE allows you to create both technical and business-oriented presentation of a virtual infrastructure.  With it, you can monitor and generate reports for dynamic virtualization server groups, clusters, virtual machines, and data warehouses that are logically combined by organizational unit, geographic location, department, service level, service type, and other criteria you define.

      Veeam ONE supports VMware and Hyper-V in one solution, which allows you to monitor and create reports without wasting time and effort on deploying and managing individual tools. <br><br><h5>  The release of the new version of Veeam ONE 6.5 </h5><br>  Starting with version 6.5, the capabilities of Veeam ONE are enhanced by supporting the backup infrastructure as an object of monitoring and reporting, as well as many other improvements that will allow system administrators to improve the performance and availability of their virtual environments.  Now Veeam ONE is delivered as a standalone product, and as part of Veeam Backup Management Suite 6.5. <br><br>  <b>Next, consider the new key features of Veeam ONE 6.5:</b> <br><br><h5>  Support for vSphere 5.1, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V </h5><br>  Version 6.5 provides full support (in terms of the standard set of metrics, events and alerts) for new Hyper-V objects, including SMB shares, High Available (HA) SMB shares and CSV 2 data stores;  and support for new metrics for data warehouses that show IOPS I / O performance. <br><br>  In addition, version 6.5 contains ready-to-use alerts about the problems described in the articles of the knowledge base of technical support based on new events and vSphere 5.1 metrics. <br><br><h5>  Integration with Veeam Backup &amp; Replication </h5><br>  Version 6.5 allows you to receive reports and operational monitoring of real-time key events and backup infrastructure indicators Veeam Backup &amp; Replication from a single management console ‚Äî that is, from the same user interface that is used to monitor VMware vSphere virtual infrastructure and Microsoft Hyper-V.  New views allow you to monitor the status of backup tasks, replication tasks, and backup validation tasks on different backup servers at the same time. <br><br>  Veeam ONE 6.5 contains a ready-to-use set of alerts on key parameters Veeam Backuup &amp; Replication, which allows the user to quickly find out about key events (for example, lack of free space in the backup repository, the status of backup servers, task status, etc.) in the backup infrastructure copying without the need to constantly monitor it through the user interface. <br><br>  Starting with the new version, the product also provides reports on virtual machines with unprotected data, which allow you to determine which virtual infrastructure machines are not included in the backup tasks, as well as reports on key metrics.  Reports can be received by mail on a schedule, which allows for automatic regular monitoring of the data protection status of the virtual infrastructure. <br><br><h5>  Capacity Planning </h5><br>  Version 6.5 allows you to see the load trend (according to the size of the data being processed) and to forecast the free space on the disk repositories of the backup repository.  Veeam ONE 6.5 also allows you to simulate virtualization server failures, analyze the performance of data warehousing I / O operations, and make recommendations to improve the situation with the bottlenecks of a particular virtualization system.  A dashboard is available for VMware vSphere, allowing online monitoring of key metrics of the virtualization system.  If the forecast shows the imminent soon, lack of resources to perform current backup tasks, the product issues operational notifications about these risks. <br><br><h5>  A total of over 25 enhancements and new features. </h5><br>  Version 6.5 contains user interface improvements, new monitoring modes, advanced notification modes, improved dashboard, new reports on analyzing quantitative trends of the virtual infrastructure, new reports with summary information about notifications, a report in Flash format showing the growth of infrastructure, and has a generally improved performance. <br><br>  <b>Ps1.</b>  <b>More information about all the features of the product can be found <a href="http://www.veeam.com/virtualization-management-one-solution.html%3Fad%3Dhabr">here (English)</a> .</b> <br>  <b>PS2.</b>  <b>Limitations of the free version of the product can be found in the table <a href="http://www.veeam.com/veeam_one_free_product_bulletin_en_ds.pdf">in this document (English)</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157559/</a></p>
