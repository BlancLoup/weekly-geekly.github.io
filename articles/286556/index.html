      How to keep such a client?  How to build a strong trusting relationship with him? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Customer of our time</b> <br><br>  To become closer to the client, you need to figure out what he is. <br>  What is your customer? <br><br>  1. Call me, call <br>  In most cases, this is a bit arrogant, sometimes obsessive person.  The idea to call, ask for help or just talk can come to his head quite suddenly.  He wants to be able to contact you even late at night.  Round the clock and free. <br><br>  2. Client - one hundred coats dressed <br>  Modern customer spoiled attention.  He is always surrounded by a large number of proposals.  He will have to be treated politely, even if he does not reciprocate. <br><br>  3. Wait for me - and I'll be back <br>  The client wants to feel caring.  He wants to be the only and very necessary.  Raise him above the rest - and he will forget about small nuances and competitive offers, basking in the rays of your own fantasies and elevated self-esteem. <br><br>  4. Eat Filed <br>  The client does not want to strain.  He loves when the dish is brought ready.  And fast.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis one of the most important criteria for a modern person. <br><br>  5. On the Internet with a head <br>  What does your client do in his spare time?  Chats in iPhones, do not let go of gadgets?  Become available to the client in his usual space.  Fill up your applications in the Apple Store and Google Play - show that you are ready to work with a fashionable modern client, who always has a mobile device at hand. <br>  What's next? <br><br>  So, our client is a modern, spoiled, but needing affection and attention user.  How to get closer to him? <br><br>  Find an additional communication channel, convenient and original.  We have a suggestion! <br><br>  <b>HOTLINE</b> <br><br>  This is a simple and convenient mobile application for your customers.  It will help them quickly and free to call your office or call center from anywhere in the country and the world.  Also, with the help of HOTLINE, you can send out information and advertising notifications to users. <br><br>  For the user <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ To use HOTLINE is very simple - to make a call to your company, just install the application and press one button. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The user of the application can receive important information or advertising notifications from you. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The client can also receive personal alerts.  For this, he needs to confirm his phone number. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The application works via the Internet (Wi-Fi / 3G / LTE). <br><br>  For your company <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ When an incoming call, the subscriber number is automatically determined on your device. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sending notifications - an additional channel of communication with your client. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sending PUSH notifications does not contradict the latest version of the Law on Advertising. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Custom design to suit your preferences or corporate identity. <br><br><br>  <b>How to use HOTLINE?</b> <br><br>  8-800 <br>  Surely you have the number 8-800, and incoming calls cost the company a decent amount.  Want to cut costs by two, three, ten times? <br>  HOTLINE functionality is not inferior to the number of 8-800, on the contrary, they greatly benefit - users can make free calls from any country.  Over 80% of your customers use smartphones, for them it will be a familiar and convenient service. <br><br>  SMS distribution <br>  You may also spend significant funds on SMS mailing.  You can save a lot here too. <br>  Send HOTLINE push messages instead of SMS to users.  These alerts can be made both common to all users - changes in tariffs or promotions - and personalized - for example, the state of balance or transactions performed.  Notifications are tied to the user's phone number and pass through a secure protocol, so you should not worry about their privacy. <br><br>  <b>Who uses HOTLINE?</b> <br><br>  For travel business, a customer can call your office for free from another country. <br>  For banks, you will be able to organize a call-center and send free notifications about the balance. <br>  For a taxi service, a client can call a car and get notifications with trip information. <br>  For restaurants and cafes - you can take an order and provide delivery information with a notification. <br>  For online stores - the buyer will easily contact you, product information can be sent in the form of notifications. <br><br>  Many successful companies have already created their applications.  The main customers of such companies are the multimillion audience of smartphone owners. <br>  Communicate with the client in a convenient form for him, and he is more willing to respond to your suggestions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286556/</a></p>
