Trends 2019</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a translation of the article by Stephanie Donahole, which was published on hackernoon.com. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g3/dt/cz/g3dtczsk1owfpowetx3h5rxsgl4.jpeg"><br><br>  What is the difference between fashion and trend?  The wind is fleeting, it appears suddenly and disappears just as suddenly.  A trend can survive much longer and affect different industries and markets.

      To successfully run a business, you need the appropriate software that allows you to store data in the right format and use it for a long time.  Each company has its own needs.  In the hotel business, for example, it is convenient to use software for hotel management, and there is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management System) to account for customer data. <br><br>  In this article we will discuss the latest trends that are very important for specialists in the field of software development. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Single Page Applications </h3><br>  Over time, needs and requirements change.  Now there is no need for bulky websites, and one-page applications are becoming more popular.  They load a single HTML page that is dynamically updated when you interact with it.  To create such a responsive site you need to use JavaScript. <br><br><h3>  Mobile devices in focus </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/n7/ve/pxn7vep2frbx8vy6pwamxedpem4.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2015, Google released a new algorithm.  Its goal is to simplify the launch of websites on popular devices such as phones and tablets.  This, of course, increased the burden on developers.  Now the scope of mobile development will occupy all developers of mobile applications, because compared with the usual search queries, the number of requests from phones and tablets is constantly growing. <br><br><h3>  Sensors and scanners </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/kl/jh/bukljhskzz4d8o2x7hp_cgp465y.jpeg"><br><br>  Sensors and scanners are extremely important for <a href="https://www.tatvasoft.com.au/">developing special software</a> .  As a rule, sensors collect data independently, and scanners react to user actions.  This means that when developing scanners, potential user actions should be automatically programmed into sensors. <br><br><h3>  Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m0/ar/2q/m0ar2q93e0k2vcsveatk7qhuau0.jpeg"><br><br>  The Internet of Things has long been a popular trend in software development.  Usually we use the Internet not on one device, but on several at once, and all of them are connected to Internet servers, cloud storages and much more.  This phenomenon is called the Internet of Things.  It is becoming more common, developers are showing interest in it and are trying to determine how to properly program devices so that users can easily manage them. <br><br><h3>  Progressive Web Applications (PWA) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f_/iz/0u/f_iz0u9rrmqwrl8x3vzregob_yo.png"><br><br>  PWA is a cross between web and mobile applications.  Thanks to this software, owners of several devices receive the most up-to-date user experience, quickly switching between their gadgets.  PWA is easier to develop and maintain than standard mobile apps.  This is probably why their popularity is growing. <br><br>  Applications use Service Worker scripts that run in the background in every part of the PWA in the browser.  The script allows you to intelligently cache, visit sites offline, update in the background, and send notifications.  It also gives access to other important functions that help to load the site faster after the first visit. <br><br><h3>  Portable devices </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/2k/py/j-2kpycl6hgvxep48kpx2ybnqok.jpeg"><br><br>  We live in an era of wearable technology and can observe how technology giants like Apple, Pebble, Motorola and LG present us with portable smart devices (for example, smart watches).  Prior to this, software developers were engaged only in applications for mobile devices, but now they also create applications and services for portable gadgets based on quite complex algorithms. <br><br><h3>  Software Protection System </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y7/lh/b2/y7lhb2hdpfojak6zu2ts7eq3yvo.jpeg"><br><br>  The more network connections you have, the greater the security issues.  The popularity of mobile devices is growing rapidly, and software must protect new technologies. <br><br>  If your business assumes any software development, it is recommended to design and build it in accordance with current trends.  Then you will get quality products that will last much longer.  You can ignore previous approaches to development, but you can not ignore today's trends.  It is on them that they should be guided in order to maintain their stability in the conditions of tough competition. <br><br><h3>  Development of technologies compatible with AI </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ai/tq/exaitqqii4bfogng_s0kwi6mj5i.jpeg"><br><br>  This type of development deals with tools and technologies, as well as advanced techniques that are used to embed artificial intelligence (AI) in software applications.  Using the tools of AI, you can create advanced methods: advanced analytics, automated software testing, automatic code generation and solution development.  For example, home helpers that respond to voice, insight-as-a-service, processing large volumes of information and smartphones improve customer experience and help users navigate online processes. <br><br>  AI is increasingly penetrating our lives.  These technologies are integrated into the transport, finance, education, and healthcare industries  With the help of AI tools, suppliers and consumers can predict inventory levels and reorder points and thus reduce costs.  Also, machine learning tools are becoming very popular due to the ability to monitor the condition of parts and make predictions related to their repair and maintenance. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Trends in all industries change depending on customer base and business requirements.  But any business always seeks to be on top.  If you want to succeed in your business, do not lose sight of these trends that will help you remain competitive.  We hope that the information provided will be useful to you in the development of the next project.  Keep growing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455106/</a></p>
