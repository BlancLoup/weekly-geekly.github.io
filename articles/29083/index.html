Fell LATE.  There is no iron wall, who could and wanted to bring down ‚Äî already there for a long time, those who remained ‚Äî remained for some objective or subjective reasons. <br><br>  And as long as we are left, it is silly to moan about how bad everything is and how bad everyone is.  All that now makes sense is to build up, cultivate strong people and set an example to others.  In the largest country in the world, there should be no place for people with weak spirit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thinking that a person is a wolf to a person, people simply demonstrate their stupidity, forgetting that it is thanks to the work of other people that they have the infinite amount of benefits that they now have or that they can afford in the future.

      Of course, you can think that this drunk who was lying near the bus stop, could not do anything for my personal good, but this is the position of the weak ‚Äî the strong one would think: how offensive it is that the institute of fighting alcoholism in the country does not work well a person could be useful for me and for my country ... This is a constructive approach, and if most people (especially on the ground) start thinking from the position of the strong, everything will be in order both with institutions and with society. <br><br>  A small sketch.  Last week I was bitten by an unknown dog, since then I have been running around the emergency room, being vaccinated against rabies.  In the lobby of one of the clinics, while waiting for her turn, I witnessed how the woman who came after me bled to the doctor‚Äôs office, occasionally looking into the same office, but the doctors did not receive the attention of the queue, no Does anyone have wool or at least a scarf. <br><br>  After that I could not stand it, opened the door to the office and yelled at the medical staff.  I understand everything, when every day you see fractures and other horrors, it is not enough to be undermined because of some kind of wound in the temple, but not to give the woman the usual cotton swab to stop the bleeding, this is blasphemy. <br><br>  Only after this incident, I began to realize how relevant the issue was, that even at the Habr√©, to put it mildly, was not ignored.  I think many here are well aware - to blame is not our method.  We must stay here, to the detriment of weaklings and lazy people, to kick society, to learn to think and live constructively. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29083/</a></p>
