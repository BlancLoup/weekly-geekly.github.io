It seems to me that it is necessary to draw people's attention to the problems of medicine, health care and aging in general, since these problems bring enormous harm to humanity in all its spheres.  Aging and death are those things that unite humanity, no matter what your world view, material condition, status, race, age or health.  Immediately I warn you that there may be many new and incomprehensible terms ahead, even though I tried to decipher all these terms. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  1. Human longevity.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 300M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnfull/20151013/276390LOGO?max=200" height="600" width="600" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.humanlongevity.com/">Human Longevity</a> is a company founded in 2013 in San Diego.  The company aims to create the largest and most complete database of human genotypes, phenotypes and clinical data.  HLI develops and applies large-scale computing and machine learning in order to improve medical practice.  On the basis of this organization, there is Health Nucleus, a clinical research center that positions itself as the leading platform for collecting health information.  Anyone can write to this center, and they will answer and tell you about everything that they can do with you.  So, for only $ 5500 and in 3-4 hours you will be fully tested.  Data collection includes: <br><br>  - Complete sequencing of your genome; <br>  - MRI of the whole body; <br>  - MRI of the brain (for some reason, separately, perhaps this is a special kind of MRI); <br>  - CT of the coronary artery; <br>  - Laboratory blood test; <br>  - Analysis of body composition.

BlueRock Therapeutics.  Country: Canada |  Funding: $ 225M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://dllxf7y5z4-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/BlueRock_Logo_RGB_02.png" height="600" width="600" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://bluerocktx.com/">The company was</a> founded in 2016.  The main goal is the development of regenerative drugs for intractable diseases.  The company is developing the Cell + Gene platform, which is designed for the production and supply of native cellular and engineering cellular therapies.  They use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">pluripotent stem cells</a> for development (i.e. cells that can eventually differentiate into all cell types except for the placenta and yolk sac). <br><br><h1>  4. Unity Biotechnology.

Country: USA |  Funding: $ 65M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58cfdbf5db29d633eb7b09a9/t/598b2863f43b55981fa141f3/1544114977641/?format=1500w" height="600" width="600" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.restorbio.com/">The company was</a> founded in 2016.  In the company name you can see the abbreviation TOR.  I will not bother too much and take the definition from Wikipedia: "The <b>target of rapamycin mammals</b> (target target English; TOR); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1)) - serine-threonine protein kinase specificity, which exists in the cell as a subunit of intracellular multimolecular signaling complexes TORC1 and TORC2. As part of these complexes, TOR regulates cell growth and survival. The TORC1 complex is the target of the immunosuppressant rapamycin (this explains the name of the protein "rapamycin target"). "  Studies have been conducted that have proven the effect of mTOR on aging.  That is, aging is not only cellular depreciation, but also complex specific intracellular processes, one of which is mTOR.  In addition, presumably, TORC1 affects the various systems of the body regarding the aging of these systems.  However, TORC2 works the other way around, that is, it reduces life expectancy.  This company has developed a method in which mTOR ‚Äútunes to the mode‚Äù of TORC1 inhibition without inhibiting TORC2. <br><br><h1>  7. Alkahest.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 50M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://www.biospace.com/getasset/7e7141d7-680c-4f9a-bca1-284a7fd7e08f/" height="400" width="400" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.alkahest.com/">The company</a> is developing a therapy aimed at working with human blood components.  The company has identified specific proteins (chronokines) that increase with aging, as well as those that decrease with aging.  Chronokines, which reduce the likelihood of developing age-related diseases, are candidates for replacement or supplement, while ‚Äúbad‚Äù chronokines are supposed to be inhibited or deleted.  Currently, the company is developing two drugs, code-named AKST / GRF6019 and AKST4290. <br><br><h1>  8. Calico.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 1.5B </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://www.calicolabs.com/wp-content/themes/calico-theme/library/images/calico-brand-logo.png" height="200" width="200" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/">Calico</a> (California life company) is a company owned by Alphabet, whose mission is to use advanced technology to improve the understanding of biology that controls life expectancy.  The company is suitable with an interdisciplinary and long-term focus on research.  Founded in 2013.  Probably it would be worth talking about more. <br><br><h1>  9. Alzheon.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 37M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://alzheon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/alzheon-logo2.svg" height="400" width="400" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://alzheon.com/">Alzheon is</a> developing a drug codenamed ALZ-801, which, according to current research, is well tolerated and can slow the course of the disease in Alzheimer's patients. <br><br><h1>  10. Neuraly.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 36M </h1><br>  Neuraly is a subsidiary of the biotech company at Johns Hopkins Medical School and is committed to providing the first disease modifying agent for neurodegenerative disorders and aging. <br><br><h1>  11. Elysium.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 28M </h1><br>  The main goal of the company is to solve problems in the field of healthcare with the help of science.  At the moment, there are various studies that are related to the physiology of the skin, microbiome, muscles, cognitive functions and circadian rhythm. <br><br><h1>  12. Nuritas.  Country: Ireland |  Funding: ‚Ç¨ 23.9M </h1><br>  <a href="https://www.nuritas.com/">Nuritas</a> uses artificial intelligence and genomics to research so-called bioactive peptides.  Bioactive peptides (BP) are organic substances formed by amino acids linked by covalent bonds, known as amide or peptide bonds.  Although some BPs exist for free in their natural source, the vast majority of known BPs are encoded in the structure of the parent proteins and are released mainly by enzymatic processes.  Some BP were obtained by chemical synthesis.  PD plays an important role in human health by acting on the digestive, endocrine, cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems.  BP is considered to be the biologically active regulators of the new generation;  they can prevent oxidation and microbial degradation in foods, as well as improve the treatment of various diseases and disorders, thereby improving the quality of life. <br><br><h1>  13. Samumed.  Country: USA. </h1><br>  The work of the <a href="https://www.samumed.com/default.aspx">company</a> directions on the fight against cancer and research in regenerative medicine.  There is a so-called Wnt signaling pathway, which is one of the intracellular signaling pathways that regulates cell embryogenesis and the development of malignant tumors.  Samumed develops treatments for diseases based on the management of this signaling pathway.  The company has already discovered many new biological processes related to the Wnt pathway, identified new biological targets and developed low molecular weight drugs that affect Wnt activity. <br><br><h1>  14. Bioquark.  Country: USA </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.bioquark.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bioquark31.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.bioquark.com/">Bioquark</a> is a very ambitious research company.  They directly declare that they are fighting death, fatal diseases and aging in general.  The most interesting is that the company conducts research on the regeneration of the body, even after death.  That is, we can say that they want to start raising people from the dead.  It sounds fantastic, but however someone is already trying to do it (or at least trying to talk about it on a serious level).  Of course, it is possible that all this is just a marketing ploy, but even if this is the case, then attention to the problems highlighted by them can only increase, which will definitely affect the awareness of a large number of people of these problems in the field of medicine and society. <br><br><h1>  15. Insilico Medicine.  Country: USA / Russia </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6331-3038-4261-b232-353966636339/Insilico_logo_4_2.svg" height="300" width="300" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="http://insilico.com/">The company</a> , which deals with the processes of research and development of drugs (drug development), as well as aging research, with the help of the achievements of state-of-art machine learning.

Telomere Diagnostics.  Country: USA </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://telomeredx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Telomere_Full_RGB.png" height="500" width="500" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="http://telomeredx.com/company/">Telomere Diagnostics, Inc.</a>  - This is a privately held molecular testing company founded in 2010 by a group of four scientists, including Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2009 for her groundbreaking work in the field of telomere biology.  The company recently launched TeloYears, a simple genetic test that detects the cell age encoded in your DNA so you can know how old you are.  With age, telomeres shorten.  To measure the length of telomeres, the company has developed its own method for quantitative analysis of polymerase chain reaction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://telomeredx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Telomere_Illustration.jpg" height="400" width="400" alt="image"></div><br>  Why precisely telomeres?  DNA is the building block of life and is found in almost every cell of all living things ‚Äúpacked‚Äù into chromosomes.  As is known, in humans, each of the cells (except germ cells) contains 46 chromosomes.  For the organism to grow and function, the cells must divide and produce new cells in order to replace the old ones.  During cell division, it is important that the chromosomes remain intact and are evenly distributed between cells.  Telomeres are the end sections of chromosomes that perform a protective function in the same way that the tips of the laces protect them from disentangling.  With each cell division, telomeres lose most of their telomeric DNA, the cell does not multiply and dies.  Thus, the loss of telomeric DNA during each cell division acts as hours of aging throughout the life of the cell.  Therefore, it is important to fix their length in the body. <br><br><h1>  17. Oisin Biotechnologies.  Country: USA </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58f6968115d5dbcc64eb277e/t/590256baff7c50a305bf83ab/1536104740733/?format=1500w" height="500" width="500" alt="image"></div><br>  As mentioned above, aging of an organism is a consequence of cell aging.  <a href="https://www.oisinbio.com/">Oisin Biotechnologies</a> is developing methods for purifying aging cells.  In 2016, two goals of the organization were achieved: the creation of such DNA that would recognize and destroy aging cells;  safe and efficient delivery of this structure to cells throughout the body.  At the moment, the company is engaged in experiments with their developed technology. <br><br><h1>  18. Elevian.  Country: USA |  Funding: $ 5.5M </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7168984eddec1ee06cba31/t/5b992c6af950b779d552bd0b/1544825368604/?format=1500w" height="500" width="500" alt="image"></div><br>  Studies have shown that older animals with blood transfusions of young animals experience regeneration in many tissues and organs.  The reverse is also true: young animals experience accelerated aging during blood transfusions of older animals.  <a href="https://www.elevian.com/">Elevian</a> researchers <a href="https://www.elevian.com/">have</a> identified specific circulating factors that may be responsible for these effects.  One example, the natural molecule, known as "growth differentiation factor 11" ("GDF11"), when injected into elderly mice, reproduces the regenerative effects of young blood.  GDF11 supplements reduce the age-related hypertrophy of the heart, accelerate the recovery of skeletal muscles, improve physical activity, improve brain function and cerebral blood flow, as well as improve metabolism.  Elevian develops a range of therapeutic agents that chastise GDF11 and other circulating factors in order to restore the body‚Äôs natural regenerative capacity, which, we believe, eliminates the underlying cause of age-related diseases. <br><br><h1>  19. BioViva.  Country: USA </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://mk0biovivahll279xswf.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/logo-1.png" height="300" width="300" alt="image"></div><br>  For me, <a href="https://bioviva-science.com/">this is</a> one of the most interesting companies.  Their CEO is a well-known woman, <a href="https://twitter.com/parrishliz">Elizabeth Parrish</a> , and she is known for being the first woman to accept gene therapy.  In 2015, Elizabeth conducted two gene therapies.  The first was designed to suppress age-related muscle loss caused by a protein called myostatin, which was injected into the muscles of the legs.  The average person loses 50% of his muscle mass by the age of 80.  This age-related muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with many age-related disorders and leads to poor quality and longevity.  The second therapy was aimed at preventing telomere shortening.  In September 2015, it was revealed that Elizabeth has extremely short telomeres, like a man who is 60 years old.  In March 2016, another telomere was measured.  It became known that telomeres increased by 10%.  This meant that in just half a year Elizabeth‚Äôs cells had become 20 years younger.  Gene therapy has restored telomere size to normal.  In 2018, the last measurement of telomeres was made, which, as it turned out, increased by another 10% percent of the result of 2016, which is equivalent to the rejuvenation of cells for another 10 years.  This result exceeded expectations.  First, because so far there have been no negative effects of therapy.  That is, cancer did not develop due to the perceived danger of activation of the enzyme telomerase.  Second, the telomeres continued to grow longer without any additional treatment.  The consequence of such changes was the achievement of treatment of muscle degradation: muscle mass has increased and remains stable at a normal level for 3 years.  At the moment, it is not completely known whether telomeres increase in all cells of the body.  BioViva people are trying to figure it out. <br><br>  The company already has some finished products: <br><br>  <b>MapMyFitness</b> ($ 299) - DNA analysis aimed at providing information about personalization of diet and exercise. <br><br>  <b>Whole Genome Sequencing</b> ($ 2,199) - complete DNA analysis. <br><br>  <b>MapMyHealth</b> ($ 379) is also part of a DNA analysis that focuses on correcting and optimizing lifestyle. <br><br>  Research and development continues in the field of gene therapy. <br><br><h1>  20. GERO.  Country: Russia </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.tollpatzig.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Gero_01.jpg" height="400" width="400" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://gero.com/">Biotech is a startup and community</a> consisting of people from interdisciplinary areas.

This is probably the most unusual startup at the moment.  The company's website contains a pdf file with goals, strategies and explanations about their activities.  After reading, it seems to me, there are no questions left.  The main goal is to find ways to safely epigenetic rollback (epigenetic reset).  I will try to explain what it is.  There is a special type of pluripotent stem cells - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell">Induced pluripotent stem cells</a> or iPS.  Their main property is that they can be induced from an adult cell.  The iPSC technology was developed by Sinya Yamanak's laboratory in 2006, which showed that the introduction of four specific genes (Oct-3/4, Sox family, Klf family, Myc family - OSKM) that encodes transcription factors can turn adult cells into pluripotent cells.  For this discovery, Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 2012.  It is assumed that due to this technology it is possible to use the so-called epigenetic reprogramming.  What is epigenetic, epigenetic clocks and more, is described in the <a href="https://habr.com/post/373575/">article</a> by Yuri himself. <br><br>  So, I analyzed 21 organizations that deal with age-related diseases and the study of the aging process of the body.  Perhaps I have not fully revealed the purpose, research and current state of some of them in more detail.  For this, it would be necessary to thoroughly study the history of news and articles released by each company, which could require an enormous amount of time, since at the moment I have no education in the fields of medicine, biochemistry, cell biology, and so on.  If you are aware of any organizations dealing with such things, I would be glad to know about them.  In addition, I will not give up advice on my further path in this area from people who are engaged in similar things (bioinformatics, bioengineers, ML-recercher in medicine and biology, etc). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433254/</a></p>
