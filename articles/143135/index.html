  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personal approach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this blog, we often write about personalization and targeting of letters that you send to customers.  But sometimes there is little advice, and we decided to show you one practical example of a personalized letter, which also includes two subtasks: resuming communication after a long silence and working on the errors in previous letters. <br><br>  <b>Dear jgdfh!</b> <br><br>  You may be a little surprised to hear from us after so many months.  We had some problems.  But we coped with them.  And now we want to please you: finally we were able to install a modern system that allows you to automatically target letters on your previous purchases and actions.  And this, you see, is really cool!

      So let's imagine that the 15-month break seemed to be absent.  Fortunately, as we can see, you have not forgotten about us, since you have not sent this letter to the spam box. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, our system reported that a month ago you bought a modern lawn mower from us.  Therefore, we decided to offer you all the best and new from our section ‚ÄúHome and Garden‚Äù.  Isn't it a good idea? <br><br>  For example, if you order a new lawn mower from us by the end of the month, you will receive a 20% discount.  As much as 20%! <br><br>  Yes, we know that you already have one lawnmower.  That is why we offer you all the best and new from the section "Home and Garden".  In addition, technology today is developing so rapidly! <br><br>  Or maybe the second lawnmower for your spouse? <br><br>  Not?  Not interested? <br><br>  Oh well.  In any case, thanks for your time. <br><br>  *** <br>  Dear jgdfh! <br><br>  Yes, we know.  15 months of silence, and then immediately 2 letters in just 10 minutes. <br>  Sorry, but this is all a new system.  We are not to blame. <br>  So, 3 years ago you purchased the book ‚ÄúHow to teach a child the alphabet‚Äù on our website.  We have good news for you.  Just this week, we had another similar book. <br>  With that, with the purchase of this book right now - delivery is free. <br>  What do you say about this? <br><br>  No, we did not say that your children are stupid. <br><br>  We agree: three years is enough to learn 33 letters. <br><br>  Or maybe you are waiting for replenishment in the family? <br><br>  Good.  Excuse for troubling. <br><br>  *** <br>  Dear jgdfh! <br><br>  Today is your lucky day! <br>  As many as 3 messages in just 20 minutes. <br>  We are sure that you did not regret that you filled in one line just below the order registration form.  And now you even rejoice at this. <br>  We know, there was an error with the previous two letters.  But we are sure that you will definitely appreciate this letter. <br>  Last year you bought the book How to Live with Elderly Parents from us.  Tomorrow comes the sequel.  And you can purchase it from us at a discount.  What a luck! <br><br>  What? <br><br>  Sorry.  Our condolences. <br><br>  By the way, could you add us to your contact list? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> More interesting posts and useful links are on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia">facebook page</a> every day, as well as on our blog <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/blog/">on the UniSender website</a> .  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia"><b>Like?</b></a> <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> For those who suddenly still misunderstood - this is a <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/iland/2007/06/personalization-worksbut-not-always.html">post-joke</a> , approximately exactly the opposite of how it is recommended to build relationships with a client so that he waits for your letters and read them with interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143135/</a></p>
