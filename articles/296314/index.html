It is so?  You love sharing your knowledge, and your enthusiasm is contagious.  So say friends and customers.  But knowledge and enthusiasm are not enough to sell products and services.  We have translated the article Enchanting marketing on how to talk about products and services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Imagine that you haven't ridden a bicycle for many years</b> </h2><br>  In bicycles, you have little understanding.  But you want to put yourself in shape, and great seems like a good idea.  Go to the nearest store and tell the smart consultant that you are looking for a bicycle for long, unhurried walks. <br><br>  An enthusiastic consultant advises a hybrid and features several popular models.  It has 24 speeds and cantilever brakes.  This brake disc and transmission Shimano.  Pay attention to this model with an aluminum frame and hydraulic disc brakes.

      BUT? <br><br>  You have no idea what the guy is talking about.  But he makes you feel like an idiot.  The only desire: to run home and forget about training for the next couple of years. <br><br>  Sounds weird? <br><br>  This happens all the time in online stores. <br><br>  Sites are full of service information and technical details.  But nothing is said about what it gives the buyer. <br><br>  What does your site look like?  Full of feature descriptions?  Or do you tell the reader what all this means? <br><br><h2>  <b>Use the question "So what?" To make the site better</b> </h2><br>  The list of features and services are facts about your product or service.  And the benefit is why the product is needed by the reader. <br><br>  Imagine selling a kitchen stove.  And one of the main functions is fast warming up.  A quick warm-up system is a fact about the stove - what it can do. <br><br>  To understand the benefits, ask yourself: "So what?". <br><br>  The stove heats up quickly. <br><br>  So what? <br><br>  Turn on, and she is instantly ready to cook lasagna. <br><br>  So what? <br><br>  You can eat faster. <br><br>  So what? <br><br>  Life will be easier.  No need to wander around the kitchen while the oven warms up.  No need to worry that you forgot to include it in advance. <br><br><h2>  <b>‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù Works in any industry:</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  Our doors have strong hinges.  So what?  They will not bend after the door has been shut 1000 times. </li><li>  We are monitoring servers.  So what?  You will not fall in the middle of the day - you can work in peace. </li><li>  We write selling texts.  So what?  More site visitors will become customers. </li></ul><br>  Review your site and ask each fact a question: "So what?".  Keep asking until you get to the real benefits. <br><br>  <b>Benefits are directly related to people's desires:</b> save time, make more money, become happier, have a better time to rest or work better. <br><br>  Imagine you are creating a kitchen design.  You can answer the question "So what?" In different ways: <br><ul><li>  You will have a kitchen where you can relax and feel truly at home. </li><li>  Cooking will be more convenient and more pleasant. </li><li>  You can impress guests with cool kitchen gadgets. </li></ul><br>  You can sell well only if you know what the audience wants and what they secretly dream of. <br><br><h2>  <b>Functionality is boring</b> </h2><br>  Let's go back to the bike shop. <br><br>  Tightened guy now tells not only about the features, but also about the benefits.  These brakes are good, because even in the rain they work flawlessly.  The bike has 24 speeds, so that regardless of whether you are going uphill, from the mountain or on a flat road, you will enjoy the ride.  The ergonomic seat means that even after several hours of driving you will feel comfortable. <br><br>  Now you understand what the consultant is talking about.  Each word sounds more convincing than when it is full of terms.  In the meantime, they tell you how this product is multifunctional and what a favorable guarantee it has - you think about anything, just not that you choose a bicycle. <br><br>  A lot of positive information sounds monotonous and sleepy.  To capture and hold the reader's attention, enter the problem. <br><br>  People avoid difficulties and discomfort. <br><br>  Replace positive with the problem from time to time, and instantly attract the attention of the audience.  Virtually every feature of a product or service helps to avoid difficulties. <br><ul><li>  Disc brakes prevent wheels from slipping in the dirt. </li><li>  With 24 speeds, you don‚Äôt need to think about how to climb a mountain - you can drive at the lowest speed. </li><li>  The saddle is comfortable, so you can drive 70 kilometers and not worry about your ass. </li></ul><br>  Talking about a simple benefit or how to avoid a problem depends on the reader.  What interests him more: get additional benefits or avoid hassle.  If you do not know what to choose - conduct a test. <br><br><h2>  <b>How to talk about the advantages and benefits of the product on the site</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  The reader is always in a hurry: he needs to write to the blog, watch the news and cook dinner. </li><li>  You need to quickly grab his attention while the cursor hovers over the back button. </li><li>  Highlight the main benefit or problem in the heading or subtitle. </li><li>  Use bulleted lists because they are easy to scan with a look;  put the main thing in the beginning. </li><li>  Avoid technical terms that the reader may not understand. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <b>How to seduce a visitor</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  Your main quality as a businessman is empathy. </li><li>  Get into your client's brain. </li><li>  Understand what he secretly dreams about, how you can fulfill his dream and get rid of problems and anxiety. </li></ul><br>  Translation: <a href="http://www.enchantingmarketing.com/features-and-benefits/">www.enchantingmarketing.com/features-and-benefits</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296314/</a></p>
