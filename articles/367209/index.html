According to the latest media reports, a real revolution should happen in this area. <br><br>  Many <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/tags/mnenie">experts</a> are sure: over time, sex in its classic presentation will sink into oblivion.  If earlier it was the highest form of intimacy between a man and a woman, then in the future it will become just a way of receiving individual pleasure, and a <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/tags/robototehnika">technician</a> will act as a partner of a man.

      According to <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/naibolee-futuristicheskie-prognozi-kotorie-sbilis-v-2014-godu">futurologists</a> , in the coming decade, the production of robotic lovers should begin, which will have an appearance and voice like a Hollywood star.  Such a girlfriend or boyfriend can be purchased at the price of a budget car. <br><br>  Today they are actively testing ideal partners who do not suffer from a headache, and boyfriends who do not drink beer in liters and do not watch football for hours. <br><br>  To make the car look as plausible as possible, it is covered with silicone skin, which is used in plastic surgery.  Under the "skin" you can hear the heartbeat, which creates a special simulator.  During sex with the robot, the pulse quickens, and breathing becomes intermittent ... <br><br>  Recently, robot dolls named Roxxxy, which can simulate an orgasm, began to be sold in the USA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MeQcI77dTQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9ngMhaY6fuZ3FOUh51Nas-1B1Iw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Marry a car </h4><br>  Can an iron construction with leather-covered wires create a romantic attraction?  The answer to this question was tried to be found even in the times of the myth of Pygmalion and Galatee, and in our time it was investigated by David Levy from the University of Maastricht in Holland.  He devoted to this topic the scientific work ‚ÄúIntimate Relations with Artificial Partners‚Äù. <br><br>  At the same time, a technical opportunity has arisen for the implementation of the idea, and therefore the scientist does not exclude that after 30 years, people will marry robots.  If you look at the story, 100 years ago there was a ban on interracial marriages, which are in the order of things today. <br><br>  Levi is sure: such robots will have superpowers in sex.  Their software may contain "Kama Sutra", as well as all the methods of seduction.  For example, such a robot could be a Japanese geisha or an ancient Greek hetero, liberated by a woman of the East, and also quickly find where the point G. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmN38P-HWOM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzD2XUptvWLpdhbCTz0PAqojb9bQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Robot lover as an assistant </h4><br>  Another direction in which the industry of intimate pleasures will develop is the creation of microchips that have a direct impact on the human nervous system.  The machine will be able to memorize a person‚Äôs positive reaction to any of its actions, so that later, if necessary, it can be performed again, giving the partner pleasure. <br><br>  That is, having sex with the machine, you can experience all the same sensations as during contact with the human body.  The creators are going to implant the chip under the skin of the robot, so that it can be activated by your team - just like any other mechanism. <br><br>  Experts believe that robot lovers will have several categories of potential customers.  In particular, they will be able to use wives whose husbands are on business trips, as well as those who for various reasons cannot find a normal partner for themselves.  According to an expert in the field of robotics from the Georgia Institute of Technology, such know-how will reduce the number of crimes committed on sexual grounds. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/57o380nALxY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjy_-wzwjQXaACDoE7I39BlmpGtXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Opposite view: love is holy </h4><br>  There are also scientists with other views.  They are sure: nothing can replace traditional sex, since no robotic lover will not exceed the emotions experienced by a person in the period of being in love.  There have always been and will be supporters of various experiments, and the percentage ratio of typical and extraordinary behavior in sexuality has always been reflected in the mass media that write about homosexuality, pedophilia, etc. <br><br>  Scientific Secretary of the Russian Scientific Sexological Society (RNSO), Head of the Department of Interdisciplinary Sexology, Humanitarian-Economic and Technological Institute (GETI), Doctor of Science Yevgeny Kashchenko believes that there is nothing romantic in the appearance of such sex machines and you should not expect any super-sensitivities.  Creating an intimate robotics is a way to promote a new development on the market - especially since today the whole business is built on sexuality.  Semi-naked beauties are used to advertise everything, be it cosmetics, fur coats, sheepskin coats, or motor oil and washing powder. <br><br>  On the question of how sex in the future will differ from what exists today, Yevgeny Kashchenko is in no hurry to make accurate predictions.  Although it suggests that after 50 years, children will begin to grow exclusively in a test tube. <br><br>  It is also possible that carriers of the gene pool will be alone watching pornography online, while simultaneously having fun with sex toys.  In "single" sex is much more advantages in comparison with the courtship for a girl who can refuse and thus hit on self-esteem and self-esteem.  The expert believes that this is unlikely to make people happier.  The challenge facing society is to make men and women in the future find each other in the real world, which requires changes in attitudes towards sexuality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367209/</a></p>
