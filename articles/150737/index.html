      <a href="http://hashref.com/">Xavier Noria</a> (Spain): Member of the Rails core team and winner of the Ruby Hero Award 2010 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/720/550/6e2/7205506e28679fbf1e2fb63cbbc3d5ba.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How do you imagine Moscow?</b> <br><br>  - I don‚Äôt really know Moscow much, though  It is a great deal of pleasure to make your day.  It was a five-year plan. <br>  My memory failed there.  It was revised. <br><br>  - Actually, I know little about Moscow, but I would like to fill this gap during the trip.  In 1979, my grandparents were like tourists behind the Iron Curtain, although they did not visit Moscow.  I remember that they were impressed by the big difference in the ordinary life of the people of our cultures.  For example, that the process of obtaining an apartment by a family was regulated by the state, five-year plans are such things. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to see here?</b> <br><br>  - It was a good idea to play the game.  He also made a draw with Karpov in Barcelona.  Some detail,. <br><br>  I was found 1976: <a href="https://twitter.com/fxn/status/231825490091048960/photo/1">twitter.com/fxn/status/231825490091048960/photo/1</a> <br><br>  - My father was interested in chess at leisure and achieved success in them, was one of the best in Spain in the 60-70s, became a master of international class in correspondence chess (it was long before the advent of computers - then they corresponded!) And played with the Russians chess players.  He even played a draw with Karpov during a simultaneous game in Barcelona.  It would be great to visit a place connected with chess - some legendary school or club, something, and bring him a photo, a souvenir, a book ... some detail. <br><br>  I even found the transcript of my father's draw with Karpov, it was in 1976: https: //twitter.com/fxn/status/231825490091048960/photo/1 <br><br>  <b>What do you expect from a meeting with Russian developers Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - Meeting local communities is enriching wherever you go.  I am looking forward to meet people online.  And, of course, you always meet at some conference or another.  It is a great experience. <br><br>  - Meetings with communities from other countries always enrich, no matter where they go.  I look forward to meeting people who have so far communicated only online, meetings and new people.  And of course, meetings with regular participants, with whom you regularly meet at one conference, then at another.  This is always a great experience, and this is what I like about traveling to conferences. <br><br>  <b>What project / open source are you working on?</b> <br><br>  - I am a Ruby on Rails consultant for a living.  I am working with all over the world.  My main open source project is of course Ruby on Rails, though I have some humble stuff out (I am a CPAN author). <br><br>  ‚ÄúI make a living consulting Ruby on Rails.‚Äù  I work from home for clients that are scattered around the world.  My main open source project is, of course, Ruby on Rails, although I have other nice projects, for example, I still support my Perl modules (I am the CPAN author). <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life or career?</b> <br><br>  - My most important project is my daughter.  Everything else is quite relative. <br><br>  - My most important project is the education of my daughter.  Everything else is less significant. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do in your free time from Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - I am a very curious guy and am into all sort of things.  The most recent ones are:  The sea in Barcelona is great and it is a lot of fun. <br><br>  - I am very inquisitive and interested in many different things.  One of the latest hobbies is classes at the flight simulator, and I also take the first steps in surfing with a paddle.  Barcelona has great weather, so surfing with a paddle in the sea is a pleasure. <br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><br>  - When I was a child of my generation.  I learned Basic by myself.  Did I work in a Triumph Adler Alphatronic?  I have always been programmed in my spare time, though I was 30 when I got a computer programmer. <br><br>  - When I was a child, like most of the guys of my generation.  I independently mastered Basic thanks to the Spanish magazine "My Computer".  Something he did on Triumph Adler Alphatronic, which my father used in his small company.  I programmed all my free time, but only in 30 years I got my first job as a programmer. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to achieve in your profession?</b> <br><br>  - I‚Äôm not goal-oriented.  I live in the moment.  Achievements, direction and direction of your dedication.  Day after day. <br><br>  - Although at the important points of my life I imagine my future and think about whether I like this picture, I do not set myself specific goals.  I live in the moment.  Achievements, change of direction and forward movement come as side effects of your dedication.  Day after day. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to become if you didn't become a programmer?</b> <br>  - Anything.  I find pleasure in doing the best possible way.  The task itself is a problem to perfect. <br><br>  In my 20s, I‚Äôve been in the morning.  It was great.  I have been a salesman proof-reader of textbooks for 6 years.  I dropped out of school when I was a teenager.  I have been in my school for seven years in my spare time. <br><br>  You can‚Äôt see what you‚Äôve seen. <br><br>  - Yes, anyone.  I like to perform the task in the best way possible.  A task in itself is an opportunity for improvement. <br><br>  When I was 20, I woke up at 6 in the morning, got into the delivery van and went shopping and markets, and it was great: the city wakes up while you quickly drive your van through the morning streets.  That was great.  I was a salesman in a record store, for six years I was editing books on mathematics.  I left school when I was a teenager, and years later I went back to school to get a degree in mathematics.  For seven years in my free time I taught mathematics at summer school and Perl at university. <br><br>  As you can see, I did different things besides programming and could switch to something else, because in almost any business you can find something interesting. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  - I would recommend programmers to read tons of books. <br><br>  If you‚Äôve been talking about it, I‚Äôm not always talking about it.  Let me recommend Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey EF Friedl.  It is a bit of a funk.  It is among the best technical books I've read.  If you master this powerful tool. <br><br>  - I would advise programmers to read a bunch of books.  If we single out one, I would recommend one of the books that are not usually mentioned, for example, ‚ÄúCode Complete and friends‚Äù.  Allow me to advise ‚ÄúMastering Regular Expressions‚Äù by Jeffrey Friedl / Jeffrey EF Friedl.  This is a thick book about regular expressions, it hooked me great, because everything is damn well shown there.  This is one of the best technical books I have ever read.  And I know from my own experience, many programmers do not know regular expressions very well ... You will be a cut above if you master this powerful tool. <br><br>  <b>Russia has strong literary traditions.</b>  <b>Have you read any of the Russian writers?</b> <br><br>  - not that I remember, but that fix <br><br>  - I don‚Äôt remember this, but I think this trip will fix it :) <br><br>  <b>Our sponsors</b> <br><br>  We remind that the general sponsor of our conference was the company <a href="http://undev.ru/">undev.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/bc8/536/8e4bc85362c29e29b879248da2aeb028.png"><br><br>  UnDev is a unique company that develops large and complex projects.
