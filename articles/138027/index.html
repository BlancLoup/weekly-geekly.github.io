It is better to lose a day, then fly in five minutes!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few simple rules for working with Yandex.Direct, so as not to go broke in the first month of the advertising campaign for the most tomatoes and get the maximum effect at a lower cost. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f0/d66/b4b/4f0d66b4b5574c039681c84cefffb867.png"></div><br><h4>  Measure 7 times </h4><br>  The work on studying the behavior of people on the site and their interaction with advertising is better to start with preparing how you will evaluate the quality of the audience: <br><ol><li>  Install Yandex.Metrica.  This will determine the effectiveness of each ad and specific keyword phrase for your specific site. </li><li>  Determine how you expect actions from visitors to your site when you click on ads. <br>  For example: <br>  make a call (we activate the service ‚Äú <a href="http://metrika.yandex.ru/promo/call">Target call</a> ‚Äù, which takes into account the number of unique / non-unique, unanswered calls, their duration and all incoming numbers) <br>  make an order through the basket (" <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/metrika/%3Fid%3D1115036">parameters of online stores</a> " when considering the source of the visitor, the composition and amount of the order) <br>  send a letter through the feedback form (we set the goal to press the <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/metrika/%3Fid%3D1036897">button to send a message</a> or visit the page with the message ‚Äúthank you, your letter has been received‚Äù) <br>  download file (section in the ‚Äúfile upload‚Äù metric) </li></ol><br>  That is the basic rule: you need to measure what will show you positive feedback from the visitor who came through advertising.  Just do not bother with absolute values.  It is necessary to measure the dynamics, i.e.  This is worsening or improving the overall situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A couple of times cut off the excess </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/023/e9a/590/023e9a59083697459a8bd1055376d023.png"></div><br>  After that you can make a list of key phrases for which you are going to show ads. <br><br>  I advise you to clean the list this way before creating your ads: <br>  For each key phrase, see the natural issue and what is shown in the ads, because  the meaning that you put in the keyword can be very different from how the search engine and its users understand it.  For example, the phrase ‚Äúproduction of cookies‚Äù is mainly given information about the equipment, and not about manufacturers, so it makes no sense to use it to advertise a confectionery factory. <br><br>  Next, the words from the list are grouped together in the sense so that they can lead a person to a specific page. <br>  The result is a plate with 2 columns, each line of which contains a group of phrases and the address of the page where we are going to lead the visitor.

      It is better if in each group there will be no more than 5-6 phrases, otherwise it will be difficult to make an imputed ad out of them. <br><h4>  Let's pause the words. </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c8/045/96c/2c804596cbdc4c260cc84f3fff728765.png"></div><br>  When writing ads, consider: <br><ol><li>  Key phrases in ads are highlighted in bold and therefore attract attention.  This means that your keywords should be maximally included in the ad text and title. </li><li>  in some contradiction with item 1: it is necessary that the text is attractive, so if you because of the abundance of keywords do not get a coherent and simple sentence, it is better to divide the group of key phrases into several. </li><li>  To really want to go to your ad, its text must contain a call to action - buy, sell, right now, etc.  In addition, publish in the text additional buns about prices, delivery times and other amenities offer. </li><li>  if you work in several regions, do not forget to specify the name of the city in the texts. </li></ol><br><br>  Now one more thing: if you are launching a campaign for the first time, do it in guaranteed shows, because  you still do not have any data on how effectively you have picked up phrases, made up ads and determined the pages where you need to bring a visitor. <br><br>  Everything.  Go! <br><h4>  A couple of interesting trivia </h4><br><ol><li>  For guaranteed impressions, the place of an ad in the list depends on the product of the CTR for a bid, so a well-composed ad will be higher, all other things being equal.  As far as I remember, the effectiveness of the advertising campaign as a whole is also taken into account. </li><li>  It is noticed that clickability is more for ads that are located opposite the first line in the issue (and this is usually 2 or 3 ads in guaranteed impressions) </li></ol><br><h4>  Stop, I think myself </h4><br>  The result should be evaluated after two weeks.  From experience, it turns out that contextual advertising never works right away (in the first month). <br><br>  Using the Metric and the control panel in Direct, we make a report on the statistics: <br>  ad title and ad text, search phrase, region, refusals, number of clicks per phrase, number of impressions per phrase, depth of views, goal achievement. <br><br><h5>  Possible problems </h5><br>  <b>There are transitions, but many failures.</b>  Ad man confused.  He is looking for something else. <br><br>  See what appears next to our ad and see if the key phrases for impressions or the wording in the ads are defined correctly. <br><br>  We find out whether we have chosen the right key phrases for displaying the ad: for example, if we mean one meaning of the request, and the search engine in natural output shows sites of other subjects, you should refuse these phrases. <br><br>  <b>Man confuses the page on which he comes.</b>  It is necessary to revise its content or pick up another page (product). <br><br>  We determine whether we have correctly defined the page to which the visitor should go.  It should correspond to his request to the maximum and he should immediately understand it.  In addition, think about who exactly can come to this page and what information interests him in the first place. <br><br>  <b>There are shows, but the transitions are few.</b>  Text ads do not meet the expectations of the desired response of the visitor (key phrases) <br><br>  Revise the text of the ad, see what is next to our ad shows how attractive they are, whether our maximum key phrases are used. <br><br>  <b>Different effectiveness of different phrases for the same ad.</b> <br>  If the CTR differs greatly from one word to another, and the previous problems are checked, then it is necessary to select problem phrases (where there are few transitions) into separate announcements: <br><ol><li>  The most effective phrases - in separate announcements, we rewrite texts and heading taking into account only these phrases, we indicate additional advantages - price, delivery and so on. </li><li>  All ineffective phrases for which there are impressions, but no transitions - we also highlight in separate ads. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Improving the performance of contextual advertising </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f16/5d1/c27/f165d1c2735247753baaa08c212dbd3b.png"></div><br>  If we see phrases according to which the maximum achievement of goals and good other parameters - we translate ads into more visible places of Yandex issuing. <br><br>  We maximally optimize the promoted pages for the queries used (we are doing this so that in the first second the visitor will understand that he has come to the address and determined the advantages of the UTP). <br><br><h4>  Possible errors in the calculation of data Metrics </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/619/d31/020/619d31020870aa909982122e9e7439f6.png"></div><br>  Yandex.Direct statistics are different from Metric statistics.  The fact is that Ya.Direkt statistics records clicks on an ad that were not filtered by the protection system.  Only for these recorded clicks in the statistics of Ya.Direkta, the viewing depth, conversion and price of the target are calculated. <br><br>  Ya.Metrika, in contrast to Ya.Direkt, does not register clicks, but visits (‚Äúsessions‚Äù), and all Ya.Metrika reports are based on them.  (Visits - the number of sessions of interaction of visitors with the site, including one or more page views. The session is terminated after 30 minutes of inactivity, that is, if the user has not viewed another page within half an hour after the next page view, the visit is considered completed.) <br><br>  The number of clicks recorded in J.Direct, and the number of visits displayed in Ya.Metrika reports, may differ, because a single visit may receive several clicks on an ad or a click may not be registered by Ya.Metrika as a visit, if the Metrics counter was not uploaded while browsing the site. <br><br>  <b>There are a number of other reasons why a click or view can sometimes not be counted by J. Metrica:</b> <br><ul><li>  incorrect installation of the counter code; </li><li>  presence in the browser / OS of the user or on the corporate proxy server of the ad blocker, which may contain rules for blocking the counters; </li><li>  ‚ÄúTechnical‚Äù problems are the remoteness of the server serving the counter call and the workload of the ISP channel. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Work on the measurement and correction of the campaign should be carried out continuously.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138027/</a></p>
