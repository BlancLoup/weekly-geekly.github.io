And if two years ago, the path of an online store visitor from advertising in Yandex.Direct could be tracked using Google Analytics before purchasing goods on the site, then it was almost impossible to understand how the company got to know about the company by phone.  In this regard, the stores did not understand what kind of advertising attracts this part of the audience and how to motivate them to buy.  Today, the answer to these questions is provided by the Internet marketing tool - dynamic call tracking. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Call tracking works as follows: each site visitor sees a unique phone number and, as soon as he calls the company, the service determines from which source the person came to the resource and entered the phrase (keyword) in the Yandex search box.  For example, the report will show that the user who called 123-45-67 came from an ad in Yandex.Direct at the request of ‚Äúbuy a refrigerator‚Äù.  Some time after the visitor has left the site, the phone number is transferred to the next one, so with a daily attendance of an online store, for example, 10 thousand people, no more than 100 numbers will be needed, which will be assigned only to this resource. <br><br>  Suppose the call tracking data shows that the key phrase ‚Äúbuy a refrigerator‚Äù received many calls, but the number of orders did not increase.  In this case, it is worth thinking about the effectiveness of this query and using the phrases that the sales bring.  Integration of call tracking with CRM, where each transaction is displayed, will help identify them. <br><br>  Companies that provide a wider range of services, for example, the sale and maintenance of air conditioners, should separate the flow of calls.  The user can see the advertisement of the air conditioner, but call for service.  If this appeal is included in the general statistics, the evaluation of the advertising campaign will be erroneous.  Some online stores distribute calls with call center operators who manually mark the purpose of each call.  However, this method is imperfect: a person can make a mistake or specifically ‚Äúwind up‚Äù the number of sales calls, if his salary depends on this indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a2/67a/820/8a267a820f784980b0454ec1aaf98f52.jpg"><br><br>  Splitting calls as accurately as possible allows the integration of call tracking into the voice menu, in which the caller independently determines the purpose of the call.  So, if a person is going to purchase an air conditioner, he needs to press the "1" key in tone mode, and to get a consultation on service - the "2" key.  The information is automatically displayed in the call tracking system, assigning the tags ‚Äúsale‚Äù and ‚Äúservice‚Äù to each call.  By highlighting target calls in this way, you can focus on the queries and channels that sales bring.  It should be borne in mind, the cost of attracting one client, which is calculated from the ratio of the cost of promotion to the total profit.  For example, the price of one treatment for the keyword "Koltach" is 96.03 rubles, which is quite a lot compared to other phrases that cost from 19 to 58 rubles.  One could simply remove it from the ads, but before making such a decision, it is necessary to evaluate it in terms of the acceptable cost of circulation (CPA), which each company chooses individually.  Suppose we have defined the CPA indicator in the amount of 100 rubles, the cost of circulation for the word ‚ÄúKoltach‚Äù is lower, which means that it can be used in advertising. <br><br>  Having identified the sources and keywords that bring sales, it is necessary to determine the most effective time of advertising.  For example, statistics online cosmetics store shows that most users call on weekdays in the interval from 12:00 to 13:00.  This is not surprising: as a rule, people study similar sites during the working day, but prefer to call when there are no colleagues around - during lunch hours.  Information about the peak of calls will help adjust the time of advertising and get more calls with the same budget. <br><br>  By the way, call tracking makes life easier for ordinary Internet users.  Analyzing the keywords that people often use to search for products in search engines, online stores can make the most useful advertisements.  For example, if a customer wants to purchase a wooden table in Moscow and enters this query into the Yandex search box, he sees advertisements for companies selling wooden tables, rather than metal chairs.  Thus, the user immediately finds what he is looking for. <br><br>  Considering the call-tracking data on peak call times, an online store can increase the number of call center operators for certain hours and save customers from having to wait on the line. <br><br>  In addition, call analytics makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of advertising campaigns with the same budget and save prices for goods without increasing them, which is especially important for buyers during a crisis. <br><br>  The possibilities of call tracking do not end there, and in the near future the market is waiting for another breakthrough.  For example, in our plans to complete the integration of the service with a speech recognition system.  The use of this technology will allow you to automatically determine the purpose of a client's call, without requiring additional actions from him and dividing calls into ‚Äúservice‚Äù and ‚Äúsales‚Äù, reducing personnel costs and reducing the percentage of errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/87b/42a/8fa/87b42a8fa4968077b6636cd3be8ea60a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speech recognition will help improve the quality of the sales department.  To do this, it is enough to load phrases into the program that employees are recommended to say when communicating with customers and words that need to be deleted.  Automatically analyzing the conversation, the program will determine how well the manager conducted the conversation and will report if, for example, he was rude or did not offer the client an additional service. <br><br>  Information obtained using a speech recognition tool will increase sales by increasing the effectiveness of advertising.  For example, the program will help identify words that were not previously used in ads, but are regularly used by customers in a conversation when they call the online store.  By including them in the text of advertising, we will be able to increase the reach of the audience and attract new potential customers. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2015/09/15/zvonki.html">Russian Business Newspaper</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294518/</a></p>
