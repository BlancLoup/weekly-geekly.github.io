Which is not surprising, because applications and systems are becoming more complex every year.  The size of the team and teams participating in the same project is growing.  The business (customer) wants low-cost solutions and quickly.  This all has to face Software Solution Architect (Solution Architect or SA for short).  Our industry, though young, has already accumulated a lot of ready-made solutions, ranging from libraries and frameworks to approaches, practices and patterns. <br><br>  On each project we make a large number of decisions, on the correctness of which depends the success of the project.  All these questions are answered by Solution Architect. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Java or .Net or Python or can PHP?  React or Angular (first or second)?  Get ready library / framework or write your own?  What library / framework to choose for your needs?  REST or SOAP?  RDBMS or NoSQL?  And if NoSQL, which one?  How to provide the necessary load?  Will the solution scale?  How to make it in a year with a team of 50 people?  How will we integrate with a third-party system?  And if it is unstable, then how will we provide the characteristics we need?

      Hundreds of questions and answers.  Some are critical to the project, some are less important.  But one thing is clear: in the modern world it is very difficult to make decisions based only on one‚Äôs own experience.  To cover gaps in knowledge, we study, read books, blogs, attend conferences, study ready-made solutions, <i>communicate with colleagues, acquaintances, like-minded people, share experiences.</i> <br><br><h3>  Gomel Architectural Community </h3><br>  The most difficult thing to understand most often is what is taught, read, which conferences are useful.  Where to find colleagues and like-minded people with whom it will be possible to effectively share experience? <br><br>  People who know me personally remember 3 years ago I was looking for myself, I was looking for like-minded people, I was looking for a way to remain a technical specialist and not to become another manager (although, as an architect, the experience of a team leader and a manager was very useful to me).  I searched, I searched for a long time, but in the end I found my way.  The path to architecture. <br><br>  Now I want to simplify the search just like me, to people who have outgrown a developer and want more.  But, like me, wants to continue to encode, learn technology, to be at the forefront of technology.  For this, I create an Architectural Community that will help you understand what architecture is.  During community meetings, we will share our own experiences and tell who the Architect is and how to become one.  I learned a lot and learned a lot over the years of my career.  All these I want to share with you during meetings and communication via the Internet. <br><br><h3>  How i see it </h3><br>  I must say that I have no experience in organizing such communities outside the company.  I rely on the experience of other people, my own feelings (what I would like to see) and a <i>team of like-minded people</i> who help me organize all this.  We will, as they say, Agile.  So expect experiments, feedback gathering, new experiments and again polls, ... <br><br>  Community, it is primarily <i>people, like-minded people</i> .  Therefore, the first task is to gather such people and introduce them to each other.  To solve it, social networks are ideal.  Therefore, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SolutionArchitectureGomel/">group has been</a> created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SolutionArchitectureGomel/">on Facebook</a> . <br><br>  Secondly, it is a <i>common goal</i> .  The purpose of the Architectural Community is to share knowledge and experience, grow and become more successful.  For this, in a group / tape we will share thoughts, experiences, advise good books and articles, ask questions that interest us. <br><br>  Well, the third.  In order not to lose contact at all, we will periodically <i>meet live</i> .  As practice shows, the Internet is the Internet, but it is much easier to communicate when you met a person in person.  We plan to meet once every 2-3 months. <br><br><h3>  First Community Meeting </h3><br>  The first meeting will be held in late November, in an informal setting, in the evening after work, in one of the anti-caf√© / anti-cinema halls in Gomel.  We do not want a large audience, this is not a conference.  It is rather an interest club.  There will be a man 30. I will invite personally. <br><br>  The duration of the meeting will be 3 hours.  Topics and speakers for the first meeting have already been selected.  Total reports will be 3, 45 per topic and 15 minutes for questions, comments.  I will tell you in detail about the topics of the reports in a separate post (the current one has already become inflated incredibly, IMHO). <br><br>  If you want to participate, please contact me: andrei.kavaleu@gmail.com.  Be sure to tell about yourself: who you are, what you do and how you are connected with architecture. <br><br><h3>  Architects of all countries Unite! </h3><br>  In general, if you are interested in Architecture, if you want to find like-minded people and start communicating on topics of interest to you, if you want to share your knowledge, learn something new, just have a good time ... <br>  If you know how to answer questions at the beginning of the article - come to us, if you do not know, then all the more come. <br><br>  <b>Let's unite the Architects of Gomel!</b>  <b>And not only Gomel.</b> <br><br>  What can you do now?  Come to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SolutionArchitectureGomel/">group of our community</a> , follow the news, ask questions, find out about the next events.  Write me a mail about the desire to participate in the Community. <br><br><h3>  Survey: community ground </h3><br>  I still have one unresolved question: which site to choose for the community? <br><br>  <b>Requirements</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  the ability to communicate, share experiences, announce events; </li><li>  easy access to the community both for the participants and for those just interested; </li><li>  ease of maintenance so that me and my team can concentrate on the community itself and not waste time on administration. </li></ul><br>  Under the first and last requirements are ideal social networks.  On the other hand, Facebook and LinkedIn require registration to view content (for example, I didn't have a Facebook account until this week, and restrictions on the length of a LinkedIn message are depressing).  Own site / site does not fit the last criterion. <br><br>  In general, I hope for your help in choosing the site.  Interested in the opinion of all, not just Gomelchan.  (Facebook is a temporary solution) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315058/</a></p>
