  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Invented a scheme of withdrawing money from credit cards through pawnshops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sberbank charges for a cash withdrawal on a credit card of 3-4%, Alfa-Bank - 3.9-5.9%, VTB 24 - up to 5.5%.  For cash withdrawals at ATMs, limits are set lower than for non-cash payments by card. <br><br>  Therefore, some customers hand over expensive goods to the pawnshop, and after a few minutes they return to redeem the security deposit by paying with a credit card. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e08/78d/e30/e0878de3018245849fce68754ca77574.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One-day transactions with credit cards by pawnshop customers are carried out repeatedly and in large volumes - for hundreds of thousands of rubles.  For such a sum, you can pawn a few massive gold products or a piece of jewelry with large diamonds.  There are many such cases, for example, the sum of such operations in the Fiatt Pawnshop network (300 pawnshops) is estimated at 15 million rubles.

      Lombard takes for a one-day use of the loan is much less than banks for withdrawing cash from a credit card.  ‚ÄúEntrepreneurial citizens pawn a thing into a pawnshop, and a minute later they buy a pledge on a credit card for only 0.3‚Äì0.4%, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2017/04/06/684379-obnalichivanie-zalog">‚Äù Vedomosti</a> reports. <br><br>  Such a short loan ‚Äî 1‚Äì2 days ‚Äî is unprofitable for any pawnshop; the average loan term is 30 days.  In addition, with non-cash payment, the costs of the pawnshop for acquiring are up to 3%, and the pawnshop incurs a loss.  When large sums are cashed, the pawnshop will need to spend another 2% for collection in order to replenish its cashier. <br><br>  There are no formal reasons for denying such an operation to serious pawnshop market players.  The Consumer Protection Act allows only companies with annual revenues of less than 120 million rubles to refuse to use card terminals, and restrictions on loan terms and commissions for various payment methods are illegal. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPawnshops are turning to us with such complaints, I recommend them to move away from‚Äú card games, ‚Äùsays Mikhail Unskov, president of the Pawnshop League. <br><br>  Pawnshops are hoping that the new scheme will interest Rosfinmonitoring.  Although the payments to 600 000 rubles.  pawnshops are not obliged to report to the office, they take the initiative and themselves inform the office about suspicious customers.  The press service of Rosfinmonitoring declined to comment, redirecting the pawnshop regulator - the Central Bank. <br><br>  The Central Bank of Russia is aware of this scheme, but, according to the regulator, its scale is ‚Äúrelatively small‚Äù - about 100 million rubles.  per month. <br><br>  Until the regulator takes the problem seriously, pawnshops themselves form blacklists for such borrowers.  In the list of "Fianita" already more than 300 blocked customers, who used the scheme repeatedly.  There were cases when, due to a denial of service, the client called the police, but she did not find the corpus delicti. <br><br>  The network of pawnshops "The key to success" in the contract with customers provides them with a choice: to repay the loan in cash at any time or by bank transfer, but after three days.  After the refusal of immediate non-cash return of the loan from a credit card, one of the pawnshop clients went to court, demanding compensation in the amount of 80,000 rubles, but the court did not find any violations of the law on consumer protection and considered the client‚Äôs complaint unjustified. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402953/</a></p>
