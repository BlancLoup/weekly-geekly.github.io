Since more than once all the details were voiced, I publish a brief digest of topics on the topic: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hpodcasts/72733/">How to buy on eBay.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hpodcasts/72733/">Tips from personal experience</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/olyapka/" class="user_link">olyapka</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/85354/">How to buy goods on Ebay</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/darbin/" class="user_link">Darbin</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/85115/">What to do if you received a damaged parcel?</a>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/cuamckuykot/" class="user_link">CuamckuyKot</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/84937/">ebay</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/84937/">Lost buy and refund for her</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/vo1/" class="user_link">Vo1</a> </li></ul>  Enough is enough. <br>  Of course, there is always something to add.  I take this opportunity to say hello to my grandmother! <br>  Today, you will learn how to buy goods that are not delivered to Russia in the most convenient way.  You can choose from two well-known companies providing intermediary services - <a href="http://shipito.com/">Shipito</a> and <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">Ebay today</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Oddly enough, but let's start with them - based on the experience of the above articles.  Summarize the information received. <br><br><h5>  ebay </h5><ul><li>  It is profitable to buy new or used goods from auctions at a rate lower than the price of <i>Buy It Now</i> . </li><li>  It is best not to sit for 24 hours until the end of the auction in the hope of killing the opponent‚Äôs bid, but using a <a href="https://rapidcatch.com/">sniper</a> . </li><li>  It is worth buying only from <b>PowerSeller</b> 's with several thousand products sold and the number of positive reviews of more than 98%.  In case of problems with the parcel, issues with these comrades are solved quickly - they value their reputation. </li><li>  You can find / buy not only cheaper than in Russia, but also such gadgets / devices, which we simply do not have. </li><li>  If the seller does not send to Russia - you can try to negotiate with him.  Often rolls. </li><li>  You can also agree on a low price or a special product name in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581">invoice</a> . </li></ul><br><h5>  Amazon </h5>  Very often there are nice discounts.  For example, now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Compact-USB-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmusical-instruments%26qid%3D1267292978%26sr%3D8-1">you can buy a</a> stunning compact condenser <b>Samson Go Mic</b> USB microphone for only <b>$ 36.23</b> .  Headphone output for real-time monitoring and positive <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/umputun/" class="user_link">umputun</a> reviews available. <br>  However, many sellers do not want to send to Russia, and agree with them, as is the case on <b>eBay</b> , is almost impossible. <br><h6>  Payment </h6>  You can often pay directly with a bank card, but I strongly recommend registering with <b>PayPal</b> and linking your bank account with it, because when dealing with controversial issues, this system will help, for example, to return money back through the so-called <b>Resolution Center</b> .  In addition, you do not have to enter the shipping address or data from the card every time - all this data will already be known by the <s>big brother of</s> <b>PayPal</b> . <br><br><h6>  Delivery </h6>  Delivery is desirable to carry out through <b>USPS Express Mail</b> .  We have this <a href="http://emspost.ru/">EMSPost</a> - over 10,000 rubles we pay tax (price is 10,000 rubles. * 30% + 250 rubles for customs duty) at customs.  Delivery usually takes from 7 to 14 days (depending on the workload of customs terminals). <br>  A slightly cheaper option with <b>USPS Priority Mail</b> .  We have - <a href="http://russianpost.ru/">Russian Post</a> .  Duty free limit is the same as that of <b>EMSPost</b> (this is one office).  It takes about a month, but you can pay a tax, if any, at the post office, where the package is received (after finding the receipt in the mailbox).

      <b>Updated:</b> It has been rumored that from January you can pay customs fees via courier <b>EMSPost</b> .  If anyone has experience - share. <br><br>  <b>DHL</b> , <b>FedEx</b> , <b>UPS</b> and other offices are better off.  Besides the fact that they have a duty-free limit of only 5,000 rubles, together with the cost of shipping, so many of them were repeatedly seen in attempts to divorce an unknowing recipient. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://emspost.ru/tracking/EC602193438US">Sample tracking package from the USA via EMSPost (9 days)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.dhl.ru/publish/ru/ru/eshipping/track.high.html%3FpageToInclude%3DRESULTS%26AWB%3D2208354713%26type%3Dfasttrack">Sample tracking package from the UK via DHL (14 days)</a> </li></ul>  <a href="http://www.vxzone.com/usps.htm">Delivery Details</a> <br><br><h5>  Personal experience </h5>  It makes sense to buy small things or what we simply do not have for sale. <br>  You can try at your own risk to catch a package with a low invoice.  In the case of the <b>EMSPost,</b> it always rolled (in a reasonable aisle).  For example, the <b>Sanyo Xacti HD2000 camcorder</b> , a review of which I <b>am about to publish a</b> review, actually cost about 16 thousand rubles, but was declared as <i>‚ÄúCamCoder $ 249.99‚Äù</i> .  Passed customs only so - without delay. <br>  I would not recommend ordering <b>MacBooks</b> with a <i>‚ÄúRefubrished Notebook $ 319‚Äù</i> invoice from the states :-) <br>  If customs have any questions, you will have to show printouts from bank accounts, links to lots.  In case the fraud is revealed, you can receive the full tax payment.  I myself did not come across this, and thank God. <br>  For three years of periodic purchases from abroad, so many different things have been bought that you can‚Äôt remember everything :-) <br><br><h4>  Intermediary Services </h4>  We turn to the main topic.  If the seller refuses to send the goods to Russia or you want to take the shipment into your own hands, then there are several services that are ready to come to your aid. <br><br><h5>  Ebay today </h5>  Russian-language service with a clear modern interface in the spirit of <i>Web 2.0</i> .  The main advantage is that the service itself buys and sends the goods to your address, you are free to pay for its services through any payment system known to a Russian person.  Even nalik accept :-) <br>  Work with any shtatovskimi online stores, not only with <b>eBay</b> . <br> <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/"><img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/7524/image20100227213409.th.png"></a> <br>  You can place as many items as you like in one package (profitable, because there is a fix in the cost of sending in any way). <br>  The system has its own sniper, which will punch free of charge for you the best price per lot. <br>  For their services, the service requires <b>10%</b> . <br>  Also, <b>Ebay today</b> can act as a forwarder of parcels (take them to your address and send you in a convenient way).  Prices vary depending on the weight of the package.  <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/mailforwarding">Price</a> . <br><br>  I ordered <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/82594/">Epson Artisan 800</a> MFP through them (yes, yes, that one ;-) - the guys worked perfectly, there are no altercations about the service.  The caliper responded in time, with the formation of the final parcel, too, did not pull. <br><br><h5>  Shipito </h5>  Foreign mail forvarding (receiving and sending parcels).  Accept parcels and send them for a fee. <br> <a href="http://shipito.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e5/760/247/4e5760247d0be471eb8bded64f6841bf.jpg" alt="Shipito"></a> <br>  They have several fares: <br>  <b>Individual rate</b> <ul><li>  $ 8.50 for one parcel + payment for shipment. </li><li>  Free storage for 7 days. </li><li>  Unlimited size of stored parcels. </li><li>  Consolidation of packages (merging several into one) is impossible. </li></ul><br>  <b>Virtual Mailbox - $ 50.00 per year</b> <ul><li>  You can consolidate the parcels and thus save on shipping costs.  $ 8.50 for consolidation + $ 8.50 for sending a parcel. </li><li>  Unlimited Consolidated Parcels. </li><li>  Free storage for 45 days. </li><li>  Unlimited size of stored parcels. </li></ul><br>  <b>Virtual mailbox - $ 10.00 per month</b> <br>  All the same as with the option above, but when you pay for one month. <br><br>  <b>Premium class mailbox - $ 150.00 for half a year</b> <br>  The same as a simple box, but the penalties for services are smaller. <ul><li>  $ 2.50 for sending parcels </li></ul>  For myself, I chose a tariff for $ 50 per year and already in the process of forming the first parcel of 5 other parcels from <b>Amazon</b> .  When the parcel arrives at the warehouse, you will receive an alert by mail.  Also made one tiny photo of the parcel. <br>  You can order additional services: <ul><li>  Fill out the invoice for you - <b>$ 8.5</b> . </li><li>  Destroy the package - <b>$ 0</b> . </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup parcel processing - <b>$ 8.5</b> .  As they say, out of turn :-) </li><li>  Send 3 large pictures of the contents of the package - <b>$ 2</b> . </li><li>  Send 10 large pictures of the contents of the package - <b>$ 5</b> . </li><li>  Do something special with the package (on request) - <b>$ 8.5</b> .  Suddenly the phrase <i>‚ÄúEat this‚Äù</i> comes to mind :-) </li></ul><br>
<h4>  The choice is yours </h4><br>  The services described in this topic are different.  Everyone chooses for himself what is more convenient for him. <br>  I decided to try collaboration with both sites to tell you about it. <br><br>  On the one hand, <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">Ebay today</a> takes a percentage of the value of a product that grows with it, but on the other hand, it has a website in its own language, a free sniper of lots and no additional payments or subscription fees.  Also, the undoubted advantage is the possibility of input / output of <b>WebMoney</b> and other electronic currencies, not to mention the payment in cash, although this is not always convenient. <br>  <a href="http://shipito.com/">Shipito</a> at first glance seems cheaper, but after receiving the first parcel that hit :-) You have to buy a subscription and pay for each step to the right. <br>  I think that in some cases the systems of equal value and excess will have to pay them equally. <br><br>  I hope you find my experience useful.  Do not be afraid to try - buy something insignificant for a start, and then you will delay, as well as many.  Cheaper, more convenient, and most importantly - more interesting!  Adventure is here. <br><br>  Have a nice shopping! <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> If you are grateful to me for the article, please use the referral links - <a href="http://bit.ly/bXqmpK">Shipito</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/apfSXq">Ebay today</a> . <br>  <b>Update:</b> People, please, stop minusovat my comments for just like that.  Everyone has the right to make mistakes.  I didn‚Äôt know that referral links are perceived as hostile - I thought it didn‚Äôt matter to everyone. <br>  I realized my mistakes, please do not poison the post with a hare of failure. <br>  Learn to be better than mercy than anger. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85761/</a></p>
