  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FAS Russia did not find aggression in the advertising campaign of the mobile operator TELE2 in Komi</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Expert Council of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia did not find aggression in the advertising campaign of the mobile operator TELE2.  This was reported to KomiOnline by the department. <br><br>  Recall that at the suggestion of Komi, frightening TELE2 advertisements could be banned throughout the country if the FAS Russia saw in it hints of aggression.  Initially, they were interested in the regional office of the service at the request of Syktyvkar pensioners, in whom ‚Äúgangster‚Äù advertising is frightened. (Http://komionline.ru/news/2924) <br><br>  According to the Deputy Head of the FAS for Komi, Tatyana Mikhailova, during the consideration of the issue, it turned out that advertising is being broadcast today in several regions of Russia and Video International is a possible defendant in the case - Moscow.  This was the reason for the transfer of proceedings to the federal level.  "In addition, the case is connected with questions of ethics, psychology, in order to prove violations, expert examination will be required," she noted.

      However, after viewing an advertising video shot in the parody genre of the famous film ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù, the experts of the council did not find any aggressive connotations.  As you know, the plot of the movie gangsters threaten to throw the hero out of the window of a skyscraper, drown, shove into the safe, if he does not replace the cellular operator.  Most experts in the video did not see obvious and demonstrable calls for violence and cruelty, as well as for committing unlawful actions, but were interested in the insistent call for a change of operator.  Thus, the expert council recommended that the FAS Russia should check this advertisement for incorrect comparison with other mobile operators. <br><br>  At the same time, the press service of the UFAS for the Chelyabinsk region reports, on April 4, the regional arbitration court upheld the decision of the management declaring the advertisement ‚ÄúTELE2: always cheaper!‚Äù Unreliable.  The first decision on this issue was made by the Chelyabinsk OFAS on June 26, 2006, at the request of Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, which was later joined by VimpelCom (Beeline trademark), Ural JSM CJSC (MegaFon), and Uralsvyazinform (‚ÄúUtel‚Äù).  In TELE2, it was noted that under the slogan ‚ÄúAlways cheaper‚Äù, one of the tariffs was promoted, but during the consideration of the case it turned out that advertising and other services were being spread with this motto. <br><br>  As specified in the FAS Russia, now all documents, including a copy of the decision of the Chelyabinsk FAS, have been transferred to the St. Petersburg territorial department of the department, which will continue to work in this direction in the future.  The body is to determine the advertiser, and in the event that it is established that the advertisement contains an incorrect comparison, an order will be issued to cease its broadcast throughout Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6722/</a></p>
