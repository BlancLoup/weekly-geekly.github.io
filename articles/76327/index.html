She was born very quickly and painlessly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One evening, tired of the bustling day, the Wanderer lay down to rest.  I really wanted to sleep, but the dream did not come - the thoughts about the futility of existence interfered.  The thirtieth birthday of the Wanderer was near, although he was not yet a Wanderer at that time.  Then he could be called the Man Entering Maturity.  That's what he thought about, lying on the sofa and looking at the colorful carpet on the wall: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI will soon be thirty years old, it is time for maturity.  Is there something in my life that would indicate that I MATTERED?  I live poorly.  Take at least this colorful carpet - vulgarity and petty bourgeoisness!  It would be better - Persian, wool.  Yes, but I don‚Äôt have enough money even for a Persian cat, not that on the carpet ...

      The service has nowhere to grow.  The fire brigade is not a business school for you.  The pinnacle of a career is an obituary about the heroic salvation at the cost of a one-year-old boar‚Äôs own life from a shed.  After all, I had some dreams!  What did I dream at the time of my stupid youth? .. Yes, a lot of things: I wanted to become a pilot, a hockey player, a rocker, an artist, a writer ... so what?  Where are all these dreams now?  Hidden far, far away in a memory chest under a thick layer of dust and everyday cares. <br><br>  Family? .. Not warm.  Something is missing.  Something very important, without which you are suffocating, and you really want to get drunk ... this is not an option: you forget yourself for a while, and then it becomes even worse - even into the noose.  It seems that this is called depression, and it seems that they are being treated in the same hospital, by the way, as alcoholics ... no, this is also not an option.  Sit "on wheels" without feelings and thoughts with a piece of biomass ?!  Is this whole set of filth and maturity?  Nothing to say, ripe! .. My God!  After all, there is he somewhere this very way out!  From Maturity to Old Age you have to live with something!  And this is the same, at least how many have already lived - thirty years! ‚Äù <br><br>  It was then that these fastest and painless genera of Ideas happened.  Just like that - bang!  - and it fell out of nowhere on the Man Entering into Maturity: ‚ÄúFOR THAT IT WAS THAN LIVING FROM MATURITY TO AGE, HAVE TO FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE!‚Äù <br><br>  Fell out and lay, breathless, on the breast of the parent.  The man cautiously sat down, afraid to drop her, precious, on the floor, shifted the Idea to his still cushy place and stared at her with crazed eyes ... A minute later he came to his senses - something must be done!  For once, something worthwhile was born!  It is necessary to save! .. But how? .. You will not call an ambulance - the Dead Idea will not be taken to the intensive care unit.  Rather, he himself will be sent to the "exit" in the second variant, next to the alcoholics ... We must think of something myself ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy God, my God!  - Feverishly thought ‚Äúparent‚Äù, - how can it be reanimated, idea something? .. Living Water is needed! .. Nonsense, of course!  And here are tales about Ivan Tsarevich ?! ‚Äù <br><br>  But it seemed that for the resuscitation of delusional dead ideas, only this delusional Russian-folk remedy is suitable.  So what's next?  Where to get it, this Living Water?  In fact, not in the Tridentary Kingdom, in the Tentieth State ?! <br><br>  Our Man, entering the Maturity, ran to the store and bought, just in case, different water: mineral "Holy Spring", "Narzan" and even "fiery" water picked up a bottle.  Of course, there were doubts, but I tried everything - the Idea does not come to life, although shout! <br><br>  Then a man began to dig in different books.  I read a lot of things: from a chemistry textbook to the same Russian and non-Russian folk tales, from the Bible to treatises on black and white magic.  In each book, he found some kind of index ‚Äî where to find Living Water, put all this in a notebook, and when a person closed the last book, it turned out that there was a detailed search route in the notebook for all the components of Living Water. <br><br>  On that day, the Man Entering into Maturity became the Stranger.  Many roads he went to our meeting with him.  But to the end of the road, he said, is still far away. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThank God, the Dead Idea is not a dead person, it does not decompose with time, but it won‚Äôt become alive until you find this Living Water!‚Äù The Wanderer told me goodbye. <br><br>  Author Elena Chelnokova <br>  The parable from the book "Weird House" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76327/</a></p>
