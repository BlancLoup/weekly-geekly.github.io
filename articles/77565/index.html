      Sobno, I repeat once again - the reviewed <b>Audio-Technica ATH-AD1000 is</b> not cheap because they belong to the audiophile class, or close to it.  Let's build on that. <br><br><h2>  Speck </h2><br>  The Internet states that ‚Äú <i>Audio-Technica was founded by Hideo Matsushita in Tokyo in 1962.</i>  <i>Today it is one of the leading Japanese companies in the production of high-quality audio equipment.</i>  <i>In the early years of its existence, the company was known as a manufacturer of sound pickups for phonographs, today the company creates headphones, microphones, wireless systems, mixers and electronic devices for home and professional use</i> . ‚Äù <br>  Headphones <b>AD1000</b> - dynamic, open type.  This feature of the design practically deprives any sound insulation, which initially has a device for listening to the house, and not on the street and even more so, somewhere in the subway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c0/7da/8e9/0c07da8e90c85fe5f4243cdee17ed5c7.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  In the box for the ears was a flimsy stand (not even a stand, but just a form for transportation) - there were headphones and an adapter from a small jack to a big one.  In fact, nothing else was there, although it would be nice to see something else - a stand there, a cover, or some other bonus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c4/013/5ea/5c40135ea62b89915728e9adea2412c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the manufacturer has a Premium version of these ears - <b>Audio-Technica ATH-AD1000 <u>PRM</u></b> - perhaps the bonuses are in it.  It seems the company has never been seen in vile marketing tricks and desires to cut money from scratch, but how do these ears differ from the regular version (except twice the price) - I don't know :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c0/6eb/7f7/4c06eb7f7f7d2d5bdfb25aaa7b0fc966.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>* UPD *</b> The Premium version uses speakers and a wire (99.999% oxygen-free copper) from the older model ATH-AD2000, but in the case of the AD1000.  Only 1000 of these headphones were released, of which NOT 210 are only for Japan. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  "Ears" are very big.  Not such, of course, like an elephant, but still the size catches the eye at the very first acquaintance.  Yes, and with further listening - even the cheekbones, which are slightly touching velvet cushions (toroidal shape?).  I don‚Äôt know for sure whether they are velvet or not, but the material is very pleasant and tactile for the ears - after a couple of hours, there is no discomfort from them.  The ears are light and do not crush, and in the cold will easily warm) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44c/a5b/632/44ca5b63268e123bbd98974ed5015b45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An unusual element is the small movable ‚Äúlegs‚Äù that freely stick out between the two arcs of the headband - with their soft pads they additionally fix the headphones on the head, which has a positive effect on the ploddingness of the device.  True, on my fluffy)) there were small traces of them - long hair was worn out, which looked very funny from the side.  I personally reassure myself by trying to cut my hair shorter and generally do not like such devices because of their cumbersomeness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29a/ae0/4dd/29aae04dd561971db79c2544baf63875.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cups themselves are also large - outside they are formed of a perforated metal plate.  In addition to the ability to change its position in space due to the flexibility of the headband, there is an additional degree of freedom - they can rotate by 30 degrees around its axis of attachment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe1/7c3/16f/fe17c316ffde3f90fa6b4b3e63a1dd1b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A thick three-meter wire comes to the left side, at the end of the wire - a massive 3.5mm jack, capable of getting into a larger hole through the adapter in the kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/759/752/214/759752214b0e38d96a1eb75848e65441.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Impressions </h2><br>  If I say that I once again tested the headphones on portable players, unnecessary raging will begin again) However, with 40 ohm impedance, they are also suitable for players without players, which was confirmed by my beloved Cowon S9.  Taking this opportunity, the new firmware <b>2.50</b> was released for it - there are some interesting features in it, but the sound in it became noticeably quieter than in version <b>2.41</b> . <br><br>  I agree that the portable player (even the most advanced player) is not able to unleash the full potential of these lugs.  And I will not lie, they say, ‚Äúlistened to them from a friend on hi-end equipment‚Äù.  So, as always, everything is fair) From the improvised means there was nothing better than the audiophile <b>ASUS EssenceST</b> , a review of which I immediately <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/multimedia/1261">did</a> after duty in Russia, but it was not published.  Next on the list is Foobar and a couple of gigabytes of the most heterogeneous music. <br><br>  The sound of these headphones delighted from the first seconds of listening - even with a portable player.  I had never heard such a clear and detailed sound before - every slightest sound on my favorite recordings was demonstrated crystal clear. <br>  Recently, I have tried as closely as possible (as far as possible) to get acquainted with the musical technique itself, and with the ways of describing the nuances of exactly how it conveys to the listener of the recording, but here the involvement in listening turned out to be so strong that for a long time about all These aspirations forgot and just listened to your favorite tracks as if for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8c/ec6/2fc/e8cec62fc736590dcbb2e111e36a531c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I'm more warm or interesting / melodic songs or electronic music.  One acquaintance ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù said that another ‚Äúthousandth‚Äù model would be more suitable for electronic music, with the <b>W</b> index (‚Äú <i>huh, with their price, they have no choice but to be even better</i> ‚Äù - my inner voice), but me so, AD sounded just fine.  Is that occasionally lacked the level of the bass - with a very good depth of its amount was not enough.  I think it would be possible to twist something with an equalizer, but I am not a fan of these shaitan rites. <br><br>  However, the AD1000 is a monitor headset designed for home listening with a quality source.  But with the fact that I had, in the first ‚Äúmusical‚Äù minutes all intentions ‚Äúabout thoughtfulness‚Äù again went to the forest.  It turned out that the player almost did not reveal the possibilities of these "monitors".  The lack of bass was gone (it seemed to play in full force - which was what I was waiting for), just like the feeling that you listen to headphones at all.  The whole musical picture moved into the space of the room - next to me at a distance of several meters (even where the walls physically interfered with it) "real live musicians" played - to feel like it was damn unusual and pleasant (before the localization of the instruments was simply not felt). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a7/7ec/d60/2a77ecd60e9ef2c933ca4a3c1aa590c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Listened to a completely different music - from the works of famous jazz musicians of different times and nations (where they were particularly impressed with the wind and vocals), to the classics, in which ‚ÄúFlight of the Valkyries‚Äù surprised the depth of consciousness with its scale and dynamism (although it would seem who and where did not hear this melodies?).  If you take the more ‚Äúclose to the people‚Äù musical directions - without a single nagging you enjoy music, be it the powerful ‚ÄúAi dasapp√©ar‚Äù Metallica, the electronic ‚ÄúHowe mats from the fish‚Äù from Scooter and the mix from Pendulum, or the intimate verses of Trofim (for ‚ÄúI miss for you "a separate plus).  By the way, the volume at which the headphones are able to maneuver without any problems is enough for all. <br><br>  Huh ... sort of finished and lit))) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b3/bfe/e58/3b3bfee5837c1f8885cf3ac95a47d975.jpg" alt="image"><br>  No, this is not Boomburum, but just some bearded man :) <br><br>  These headphones were the best in the collective audio test on the <b>DoctorHead</b> website in the article ‚Äú <b><a href="http://www.doctorhead.ru/articles/privat_concert_part2">Private Concert</a></b> ‚Äù (and there are no more reviews).  An additional example of evidence can be considered reviews left by a few owners.  True, I rarely trust them (reviews), but in this case their ‚Äútransparency‚Äù is obvious) <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - High-quality materials and reliable design; <br>  - Convenient and securely kept on the head, light; <br>  - To ugliness pleasant sound; <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Weak equipment; <br>  - Large in size; <br>  - No noise insulation; <br>  - Price. <br><br>  As for the three-meter wire, I did not dare - it seems to interfere sometimes (minus), and at the same time allows me to move away from the sound source (plus). <br><br>  The average price at the time of writing the article is <b>8950</b> rubles (range from 8 530 to 10 900 rubles).  Dynamics of prices for ears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/016/a47/d11/016a47d1180bd9e366a66b911338c038.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  I'll be brief. <br><br>  With confidence in the words I declare - these headphones in a quiet environment will make it pleasant even to the most capricious ears.  And whether there is a need for such pleasure and whether there are several thousand for it - decide for yourself. <br>  Do not judge strictly - there is still little audio experience, I catch up on the sly ... but here I am really delighted - I never thought that such a sound could be obtained from headphones, even if they are expensive. <br><br>  I almost forgot about <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">twitter</a> ) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77565/</a></p>
