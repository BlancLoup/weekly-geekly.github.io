Farewell to the Old Believer Cake</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <i>(You are reading the text of the Universal Nostalgic Pattern (UNP), invented by someone else at the time of parting with horses, locomotives or even earlier, Roman galleys. You should not be surprised if words coincide - they are common for such a circle of sighs. In this case, it is applied to some object with the conditional name ‚Äúcake.‚Äù There is no doubt that that pattern was brought to light from under the tram of the turn of the century, which once buried the guardian of the district silence on the side of the big road.)</i> <br><br>  The ideological inspirer was a similar pattern of nostalgic confession on a similar topic.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/132311/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/132311</a> .  Perhaps this is the one, closer to the meaning of what is happening in this place, its retelling. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Somehow, surfing on thematic blogs, I brought to the Sphinx a search for the latest technology articles on developments.  The picture upset me, a dozen titles with a meager total rating.  Within the Russian sector, one of the articles was fresh.  Diving into the hieroglyphs of old-fashioned CSS code examples, I came across links to articles from famous bloggers of the past who left this world a long time ago.  Passing through them, I turned the search to the next page of sadzhestov and found myself among the picturesque billboards before the search sample "HTML5".  Only three pages, a little cited text, a jumble of code with arbitrary formatting, which guarantees an hour of analysis of the given examples.  No banners and fried news, the authors in their abilities are trying to convey to you their own development, offering at the end of 3-4 examples.  Compared with the news of the crowd of companies with advertising inserts - aerobatics of those disappearing low-rated un-errant pilots, sometimes making mistakes and disappearing one by one from the pages in the peak.  They can see the cutting edge of development, learn how technology lives, and not how they are presented by others.  If you need such information, but not - so you can bury yourself in watching everything in a row with your head.  And stumble upon articles that eluded your view of the main news feed, but look promising.  Resource - for those who love technology, and does not treat them as a source of wealth.  Reviews of new products, this modern fast food from the world of technology;  you resort to buy a new gadget, apply a new IDE, not understanding how it was built, but following the recommendations of a rating author or following a review from the company's blog.  Wandering through rating blogs is somehow silly, and not a single geek has such a habit, it makes no sense.  Drawing the analogy further, technology blogs are like boutiques, offering articles on developments for those who have learned to use them.  Of course, those who need to install the script from the example also run here and run further into the hustle and bustle of the working day.

The first bell rang in 2009, when the blogger came to the network, now periodically appearing in the first place, and the development rating clearly did not keep up with the rating of fried news, problems with mobile operators, laws and domain name registrars.  In the personal blogs, I did not find my favorite article for some reason, the remote author.  Instead of his articles, there were crowds of two-syllable news, retold by newsmen in their own words, as if there had never been any articles about developments.  A year later, I lost sight of another author, already in another blog.  A cozy series of articles in which it was possible to sit down for more than one hour, delving into the comments.  Now this world is undergoing destruction.  It's a pity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ffb/30a/ea7/ffb30aea7078087ccf9431dd19b40896.jpg"><br><br>  When I got my first rating, I often spent it on good authors.  I came to a large field of articles and read avidly.  I had enough of a daily rating of 5-6, sometimes ten pieces, and I had to choose them correctly in order to have enough for the main ones.  Careful analysis of the findings sometimes at the beginning of the article, sometime at the end.  Go through the eyes on the illustrations, remember the feeling.  Some articles look at them, and some do not respond at all, they are deaf.  Since then, the ritual has remained unchanged: receiving a new rating, I went to the pages of thematic blogs.  These were reckless crafts of small unknown authors with not always sharp syllables and with the same crutch code examples in which it is easy to find a bunch of errors.  Indescribable passions in the discussions, the shaft of old dogmas and the search in the heaps of texts of these pearls.  Large reviews of technologies, where in bulk or alphabetically were links to different scripts, and the most interesting was written at the beginning.  Then, in these bookmaking bastions, the authors mastered the system presentation, by topics, it became interesting to guess where you would find the link to the development you already know.  An article about the operating system could be put on the blog "Do it yourself", because the author tried to compile it independently.  The taxi call service with the ridiculous word "Startup" was attributed to business literature, where it hung for several hours, until the meticulous commentators discouraged me from transferring to the blog "I am promoting". <br><br>  My invited authors already, apparently, will not have to see such expanses of blogs.  Under the pressure of news and translations, these dinosaurs, with their imperfect mimicry, are dying out, and I also sometimes involuntarily vote against them.  It‚Äôs one thing to sort out the messy ideas of one living author, and quite another to instantly swallow a hamburger of a translation of a replicated and recognized foreign source, right there going to the library's demo page of a library.  We lose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe amount of work on the article, comparing it to a different example of licked translations, on which more than one well-paid author or team of developers of any browser worked.  Yielding to general hysteria, I also began to install libraries and plugins.  They have many opportunities.  My computer thought about them for a few seconds.  How much is this, what is the equivalent of the saved conclusions of my brain worth these seconds?  I learned to do more, but think less.  A good 800 KByte installation of the Dojo Toolkit with standard plugins.  It is huge, without any understatement.  This should be kept as a document controller instead of a Word on the desktop, and it is clearly not for development, but for irresponsible corporate portals.  Please note that the creators have played with our greed to letting dust in their eyes; they have imposed features that, in their opinion, suit us best.  Large libraries for developing diverse corporate portals.  Small articles on development - to enhance the developer‚Äôs own qualities.  Articles and reviews were different - but some popular articles almost destroyed this biosphere and continue to clog the minds. <br><br>  And articles?  The articles themselves are composed so that you understand that this is about technology.  Tags, design - it all said that - what is in front of you: the next couplet of the prolific newsman or a real report of the engineer.  Sometimes one was disguised as another, and it was also a kind of adaptability.  Articles, having lost their author‚Äôs hypostasis, have lost a lot.  But we lost even more.  I am sure that in the future they will come up with the equivalent of a cake - this technological article.  They will show on any future resource the weight, significance, smell and karma of one or another author, reflecting the rustling of his hair in time with the turns of the flow of thoughts.  Sometime in the distant future, if there remain those who remember the real articles of the cake and do not consider them the antediluvian waste of copyright talent.  But the cake will sink into oblivion and acquire the stamp of an anachronism. <br><br>  But my world of cake is rolling into the abyss.  I have to admit it.  In its corners there will be separate reservations for such old-fashioned geeks like me.  It will not happen all of a sudden, the old will move away for a long time, but already my invitees for invites will not find this world.  And this is sad because not only custom is leaving.  Read with the arrival of blogs of companies have become more, and all indicators of web analytics speak about it.  It is possible to surf our articles in a different way and learn news, learn new things, succumbing to the temptation to click on the blog where you are and discover the manifesto of the Free Internet.  It will be impossible.  Instead, the search string, coupled with Sphinx and autoshop, which interested the maximum group of readers, will lead to the most predictable results.  The search will be sophisticated, you can find newsletters by phrases, words and moods of people in your circle, specialty, and even a project.  A terrible picture that predetermines the fact that many related technologies will be left out, simply because the authors did not enter PPA in time, and the company did not renew the account.  And they will be interesting for small Old Believers' groups, who are not able to resist the shaft of new users with their pros and cons.  Moreover, this terrible world with a prompting search assumes that we ourselves will choose a search on the news, change our interests in an unimaginable way.  A newsman who writes commercial articles will follow the ideas of optimizing his couplets to the resonance of his readers.  And here they are already unmistakably - at the top of the rating.  Will they create truly worthwhile unique designs?  Not.  The old and almost forgotten word ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù has eclipsed the new rating and promoted word ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.  Let me say that this is not the same thing at all.  Of course, it is necessary to share commercial news with what is written on the development and development.  And today, reading some popular articles, you understand that the author wrote a rating presentation for his blog, without describing the development, but citing a couple of worthless examples, overshadowed the mind of readers with a brilliant wrapper and fashionable wrapper.  It was and will be.  But the basic idea that rules publication of articles today has changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/093/80e/a38/09380ea385fd95c3f9df8269ade68896.jpg"><br><br>  The need for censorship in this world will disappear by itself.  Why ban books and treatises, if their rating is 5 times lower than the news?  It is enough to set low marks or not to put them at all, what the readers themselves will do (and will not do) so that they will not be read by the majority.  They will not be able to get recognition and influence the world.  They are out of ratings, out of content, out of publications.  I suppose that other resources will arise, where a small group of readers will try to revive the development until companies, rating and content come to them again.  Sometimes decent books will pass to the general rating, but more often the crowd will choose fried content and crunch them in the comments, simply because it is ‚Äúfun.‚Äù  And this whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch ratings will be compromised. <br><br>  And again, as once, the recommendations of mentors and colleagues in the workshop will come to the fore.  Development blogs will lose their greatness, but they will again gain a narrow circle of those who will recommend them inside their small professional circle.  Will this system stand up to the unique content generation system that has already been created today?  Not sure.  I do not want to believe in the terrible outcome of the history of articles on developments, it is more pleasant for me to believe that we, as developers, will once again get out and figure out how to deal with this.  In the end, we successfully managed to do this until 2009, why not allow that in the future we will win in the struggle with ourselves.  Definitely, the chances of winning are great.  But thematic blogs will not return.  Development articles are a luxury in the age of simple unique content.  Therefore, our libraries become weightless compared to the only third-grade Blu-ray film, which is immediately forgotten when viewing a new frame of dull diversity.  Do we need such content monsters?  I'm sure not.  I feel sad for the outgoing world of articles for developers and about developments and I understand that in the future (in this system) there will be less and less of them.  The time is not far off when newsmen will cheerfully report that today their digital content occupied 98% of the blog‚Äôs volume and was unique, and the share of the rating for the first time exceeded the share of digital content and became equal to 98.01%, this is the matter of the next decade.  "Content is immortal" - as they said in Italy at the beginning of the century.  But he can kill and cripple technical thought beyond recognition.  This is what we do together, although we often don‚Äôt understand the consequences of rating.  Each time, typing in the search line of the Sphinx "news, adventures, opsos, 2012", you bring closer the world that I described.  Make it a little more real.  We already think differently, but tomorrow everything will change.  I am a mastodon from the old blogging system and will remain faithful to that rating system to the end, but my content is gone and I can see it today.  Let me still have in the reserve a rating of 20-30 units, which I will exhibit to favorite authors for articles.  Collect your "favorites" on a rainy day.  Tomorrow it may be too late. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288886/</a></p>
