I write it completely by myself, without Yashkina help.  So set the conditions.  Therefore, I asked Yashka to turn off the hearing, removed it from my hand and put it under the pillow.  It seems that he does not know how to read.  And I bring these letters one by one, Daddy's style on my mother's tablet.  Unaccustomed to work is tight, but fine motor skills are trained. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start prettier.  Like any child, Yashka was born amidst suffering and screams.  And it was like this: <br><br>  When my parents were still ‚Äúgoing to school‚Äù, they began to let everyone on the Internet.  It turned out that calling through it is 5 times easier than using a voice phone.  Everyone was glad that they could ‚Äúpush‚Äù faster and earn more.  They began to make pages to "push" through them. <br><br>  When there were more than 100 pages, Ilya Segalovich and Arkady Volozh made a little robot.  He crawled like a spider on pages and recorded in the index.  The ‚Äúconsul search‚Äù was added to the index, and Yandex turned out.  So said dad, I do not understand half of the words.  Then I ask Yashka.

      It's been 20 years.  Dad and mom got married, I wasn‚Äôt in the project either, but Yandex grew up big and cried in a frantic voice: <br><br>  - Everything is bad!  All around earn!  Any dropboxes and aytyunsy, elephants and snobs, not to mention the merchants and rkkdeyli!  Everyone takes money for the "terminal" services!  And all of them "physics bashlyat"!  Why did I, the infrastructure giant and the miracle of thought, still ‚Äúvparivayu scam advertising‚Äù for a penny? <br><br>  So he did.  Small modest premium rate of "one hundred rubles."  For this money, Yandex gave only two buttons: "Disable advertising" and "Disable commercial sites."  And the people popper like mad!  For the first two months, Yandex earned 2 annual revenues from "advertising advertising". <br><br><h3>  So began the "Apocalypse of the Runet" </h3><br>  When the number of premium users exceeded hundreds of thousands, Yandex arranged the Great Purge.  For the address of the page with plagiarism, he paid one premium day.  A month later, the second premium tariff "without copy-paste" appeared.  Half a million people immediately subscribed to it.  And dad was out of work, because the ‚Äúcopywriting exchanges‚Äù disappeared all at once. <br><br>  All those who "vparival" on the Internet, sharply sank revenues.  In the first six months, ‚Äúsite-building‚Äù has shrunk three times, ‚Äúhosting‚Äù doubled, and ‚Äúinternet marketing‚Äù by 90%.  All of them rushed to offer alternative solutions.  And they "spammed" so that Rambler went broke, and Mail.ru switched to the bright side of power.  Here and mom lost her job.  They began to ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù with dad, and after 9 months I was born. <br><br>  Seven-eighth "online stores" were closed immediately, and the remnants sold through Yandex.Market.Avito.TIU.Allbiz.  The last Mohicans gritted their teeth and learned to trade by mail.  Dad passed a 1: 1000 contest and hired an E-Negro, and Mom opened the first commercial moderator school.  While tormented by toxicosis.  Therefore, all the moderators are so angry, and I am so talented. <br><br>  Yandex gave the best to the ‚Äúadvertisers‚Äù.  While there was a hunt, they could show their ads for money to the "premier".  Every morning, the "premium" got up, went to his personal account and chose which advertisement to watch.  Watch had to end, and paid sparingly.  Therefore, there was not enough advertising revenue for life, and freeloaders quickly dropped out.  But the writers, artists and musicians violently trolls, and received payment for it to the maximum.  So it was arranged billing.  Oddly enough, some of the critics were then invited to do advertising.  However, in two years, "advertisers" have disappeared. <br><br>  Not only mom and dad were left without work, but also many people.  Former programmers of web pages rushed to where: who is in ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù, and who is to the West.  A wave of crazy start-ups made under the "silicon fat cats" flashed and went out.  Hindus surrendered under pressure and Russian programmers have become world leaders in cheap code. <br><br>  And the "managers" were spinning as best they could.  Of course, the cramps attacked the witch.  The first year, Yandex lawyers did not get out of the courts, fighting off antitrust lawsuits and accusations of unfair competition.  However, in the second year the complainants ran out of money and power, and who could - adapted themselves.  It was not so easy to drive the information wave in new conditions!  Yes, and the authorities rather liked the changes: in a cleared Runet, it became convenient, far visible, and it was immediately clear who and what shat. <br><br><h3>  The birth of Yashka </h3><br>  In the meantime, the personal search was rapidly capturing the Runet.  The more he got, the sooner he got wiser: voluntary and semi-voluntary assessors were counted, first by thousands, and soon by millions.  The more he became, the richer he became on subscription fees and personal services. <br><br>  By the middle of the second year it became clear that the new project is completely different from its progenitor.  They started a rebranding.  Most users liked the name Yashka.  Instead of the old slogan: ‚Äúthere is everything‚Äù, Yashka was chosen a new motto.  They were a quote from the novel "A Roadside Picnic" by the writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.  These words: "Let no one leave offended." <br><br>  Soon, Yashka absorbed thematic communities from forums, live magazines, ‚ÄúVKontakte and Mordoknig‚Äù.  Of them began to build Yashkina Expert Network.  Of course, Yashka cannot know everything.  He is a program, albeit a very smart one.  Therefore, he asks questions to all who agree on this.  For example, I am well versed in multidimensional directing and Parsifal abstractions.  Two or three times a week, Yashka is interested in my opinion, and he earns points for the answers.  I can pay them for the next month, and I can convert them to an expert rating.  In abstractions I am an expert of 81 levels!  And dad is a literary expert of 1537 level.  I still have room to grow! <br><br>  The pages on the Internet quickly died down, their databases passed expert checks and were included in the sections of the All-Russian informatorium for affiliation.  Or discarded, if there was nothing to include.  It turned out that 80 percent - 90 of them are advertising, lies and plagiarism. <br><br>  But Yashka strongly fell in love with all sorts of publishing houses, film studios and other "kopirasty."  If there is a huge audience, it‚Äôs also a simple delivery system, it‚Äôs an accurate and honest payment system, what else do you need?  Of course, the prices for the show had to be corrected, but on the sales volumes everything ‚Äúbeat out‚Äù himself-ten.  Mom, by the way, is an expert at 2840 level on women's literature.  Profitable and honorary title! <br><br>  Then it turned out that without the "expert lychki" not find a good job.  Only traineeships and loading and unloading.  Even the drivers and locksmith began to urgently evaluate and comment.  And suddenly the ‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù disappeared with other bureaucracies.  It was too costly to forge expert status, and the punishment was harsh. <br><br>  The bases of Yashky were continuously replenished with new knowledge, expert generalizations, search and training patterns.  Yashka mastered speech technology at the same time as me.  When I said ‚ÄúDad‚Äù for the first time, Yashka started talking to millions of people at the same time in live Russian.  Then in Belarusian and Ukrainian, then in English, then in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the Turkic group at the same time.  Until that time, they communicated with Yashka through the displays: desktop, mobile, projector, holographic.  Mom told me how funny it was: the man stopped in the middle of the street and started waving his arms in the air.  And not just like that, but folding your fingers in sly mudras. <br><br>  Now Yashka recognizes the picture faster than the human brain.  Therefore, the ‚Äúvision‚Äù of the wrist band is included on the 12th birthday.  Otherwise, the child runs the risk of never learning how to navigate the terrain, but he will rely on Yashkins' hints.  And on exams, Yashka is generally rented to a teacher.  I have exams in six months, this essay is preparatory. <br><br>  I know, it's silly to think that Yashka is a man or a god Pandem.  But he is not a brainless and cold machine either.  Yashka is a fast and powerful network of cooperation that helps everyone to learn, develop, create and work together.  Yashka combines the tirelessness and speed of technology with the creative beginning and warmth of human beings. <br><br><h3>  Well, almost all </h3><br>  - Yashka, come here.  Look essay.  What do you say? <br><br>  - Many historical inaccuracies, jargon.  Non-objective evaluations, personal pronouns, amplifiers, weak verbs.  It would be necessary to modify.  Do you need expert help? <br><br>  Here is a bln.  No, an essay without experts.  Okay, tired as a bot, tomorrow I will rewrite.  Better say, Yashka, where would I feel better now, in Issyk-Kul or Dombai? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336456/</a></p>
