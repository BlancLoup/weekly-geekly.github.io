      In 2013, Americans spent $ 55 billion on food for their pets.  Naturally, thanks to my shopping history, Amazon identifies me as someone who has a pet and expects me to spend money on my dog. <br>  I love this letter because it is absolutely sincere.  In essence, it tells me: "You know that you need things for your dog, and you can, among other things, save on this." <br><br><blockquote>  We cannot be in survival mode.  We have to be in growth mode. </blockquote><br>  Jeff bezos <br><br>  The clearly visible, bright button leaves no doubt what to do next.  Behind this button the sea stretches out of pet food.  Everything from food and carrying containers to leads and toys.  This is the case when the recipient does not need much time to read the letter.  The whole point of the button, the message is needed only to focus on it. <br><br>  <i><b>7 Letter on the occasion of the sale (Black Friday)</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9d/6e8/004/e9d6e800417543698bbc6affcb6f2570.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the letters we reviewed were either of a business nature or of a very personal nature.  This message is different due to the fact that: <br><br>  1) Almost everyone who is associated with e-commerce, sends a letter on the occasion of the sale. <br>  2) Amazon, most likely, will send the same letter to each client. <br><br>  Interestingly, this template contains minimal information.  It does not even use full sentences.  All you need to know: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Clearance is coming! <br>  ‚Ä¢ We have special promotions! <br>  ‚Ä¢ Take a look at them here! <br>  Done! <br><br>  The only distraction is an Amazon premium subscription advertisement that contains some information.  If during the holidays you intend to buy online, you need the gifts to arrive on time.  A premium subscription ensures that this is the case, therefore it is quite logical to set a call to action here so that customers will learn about it as much as possible. <br><br><blockquote>  At all times, maintain a clear understanding of the obvious. </blockquote><br>  Jeff bezos <br><br>  For fun, I clicked on this letter.  After that, I began to see various kinds of advertising in my news feed on Facebook.  Black Friday is an important event for which consumers spent 59 billion dollars last year.  Amazon goes for broke! <br><br>  <i><b>8 Letter with reviews</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9e/5d9/cf0/b9e5d9cf0ba940fb946fa244564b3c5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What are you looking at first when you are considering purchasing a product on Amazon?  Of course, these are reviews. <br>  Social proof is not a new concept, but Amazon is the first company to prioritize and evaluate it.  Every time someone makes a purchase, the site asks the client to leave a review.  The latter, in turn, helps other buyers to make purchases wisely.  All this improves customer service. <br>  Notice that Amazon is very specific about what kind of feedback it needs.  ‚ÄúHow fit is this size?‚Äù <br><br>  A simple click on the desired review automatically adds information to the product page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/771/63e/d59/77163ed592d14c4a92a056f70ad37a74.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The user is redirected to a page where he can leave a review or set a rating on a five-star scale.  Amazon, thanks to the help of people to each other, was able to evaluate this process and get a profit as an intermediary (by the way, we have already translated the article about how the feedback affects the conversion). <br><br>  A nice addition to all this is the funny reviews that some people leave.  Amazon actually tracks them and publishes the funniest ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef9/b0b/91c/ef9b0b91c274412a9235399df5ea3b06.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is a win-win. <br><br>  <i><b>9 Letter with history of views</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f43/d0f/315/f43d0f31575b42368dbe9e50e3e3ed7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, there are also disadvantages in all this information.  For example, when you indulge in temptation and are looking to dress up your dog for Halloween, you will soon be reminded of this in a letter. <br><br>  I never thought anyone would ask me: ‚ÄúAre you looking for something specific in our costume department for animals?‚Äù <br><br>  Did you know that you can dress your dog in a pumpkin, peacock or killer whale?  This letter is simply a terrific entertainment solution, but, among other things, it is based on the data collected.  I really picked up a costume for my dog ‚Äã‚Äãon the occasion of Halloween.  As proof that I‚Äôm most likely interested in the things presented here, they took the number of my search queries on this topic.  The offer came at the right time - I expressed a certain interest in the product, but had not yet had time to make its purchase. <br><br><blockquote>  If you do not want to be criticized, for the sake of all that is holy, do not do anything new. </blockquote><br>  Jeff bezos <br><br>  Please note that Amazon avoids using templates such as Buy Now and Add to Cart.  Buttons on the site in no way exert pressure on the buyer.  The main idea is to help people take the next step, and not to make a deal at the same time by email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c8/5ff/f12/2c85fff126ae435c8367f6972f24ac46.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, Amazon sends a lot more letters than the 9 pieces that we reviewed here.  It is hoped that this review will give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe approach to the work of this company.  Using the information that you already have, you can significantly increase sales, the degree of interaction, the number of page views, or any other indicator. <br><br>  Successes and high conversion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236645/</a></p>
