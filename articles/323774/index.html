In the magistracy, these figures are even higher - annually for future masters more than 2,400 budget places are available within 35-37 areas of training and more than 180 EP. <br><br>  At the same time, most of the incoming first-year students are not from St. Petersburg.  For example, for the third year in a bachelor‚Äôs degree 70% of nonresidents, in a magistracy - 51%.  The percentage of foreign students is growing year by year from 12% in 2015 to 17.2% in 2016. <br><br><h4>  Undergraduate </h4><br>  The number of applicants who submitted documents to ITMO University in 2016 is 25% more than in 2015.  Although in the past three years (2013-2015) there has been a decline in those wishing to participate in the competition.  This decrease was primarily due to the fact that in 2013 the University for the first time set the same and fairly high minimum points for the budget and contract forms - 55-60 points for each subject of the USE. <br><br>  Many people think that the higher the competition, the more prestigious the university.  But this is far from the case.  The number of applications to the university does not always show the quality of applicants.  It all depends on the minimum points. <br><br>  The university can set ministerial minimums for each discipline (an average of 30 points for each subject of the Unified State Exam) and thus create an artificial large competition of up to 50-100 people per place.  At the same time, it is important to understand that such statements are ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, since then they will all be eliminated as part of the competition. <br><br><blockquote>  As an example, in 2016 the minimum score in computer science and mathematics for the ‚ÄúApplied Mathematics and Computer Science‚Äù course of study was 75, the competition was less than 5 people per place, but the passing score was the highest in the university - 294 out of 300 points in the Unified State Exam in three subjects (budget form). </blockquote><br>  <b>The average competition for the university in 2016</b> is 5.0 people per place (in some competition groups it reaches up to 30.0). <br><br>  The most popular areas of undergraduate training: <br><br><ul><li>  03/01/02 "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science" </li><li>  09.03.02 "Information Systems and Technologies" </li><li>  09.03.03 "Applied Informatics" </li></ul><br>  <b>About new directions for future bachelors.</b>  In 2017, a new faculty was opened at ITMO University - a physico-technical department under the guidance of the famous scientist Pavel Belov ( <a href="http://kremlin.ru/supplement/456">Pavel Belov</a> is engaged in research in the field of metamaterial physics, in 2009 he became the winner of the President of the Russian Federation prize in science and innovation for young scientists).  It is this department that will train elite physicists at ITMO. <br><br><blockquote>  To begin with, a small set is planned - about 25 students, then we want to increase this number to 70-80 people.  Therefore, in the framework of the 2017 admission campaign, the stake was made not only on IT, but also on the areas of preparation where students come from the Unified State Exam in physics: 12.03.03 ‚ÄúPhotonics and optoinformatics‚Äù, 16.03.01 ‚ÄúTechnical Physics‚Äù and others. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/73/">The minimum score of the EGE</a> will remain the same and high enough for the budget and contractual form of education - 60. And in mathematics and computer science at the department of "Computer Technologies" at least 75 points. <br><br><h4>  Master's </h4><br>  Due to the fact that there are more than 2,400 budget places in the ITMO master course, there are quite a large number of educational programs that are highly specialized: from ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/7912/">Industrial Robotics</a> ‚Äù to ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/6172/">Scientific Communication</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  The ITMO University annually opens up areas that are already popular now, and specialties that are not yet widespread, but that in the future will become quite popular in the market, for example, the educational programs ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/7273/">Computational Biomedicine</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/7961/">Light Design</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/7918/">Technological Innovations and Technology Transfer</a> ". <br><br>  Competition in the magistracy is always lower than in the bachelor degree.  Graduates of universities, unlike graduates of schools, know in advance exactly which educational program to choose, which is why they submit a maximum of 1-2 applications to 1-2 universities. <br><br>  <b>The average competition for the university</b> - 1.8-2 people per place. <br><br>  The most popular areas of training in the magistracy: <br><br><ul><li>  IT (04/01/02 "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science" or 10.04.01 "Information Security") </li><li>  Innovations, marketing, management 27.04.05 "Innovation" </li><li>  Robotics 15.04.06 "Mechatronics and Robotics" </li></ul><br><h4>  Why prepare incoming in 2017 </h4><br>  Every year, the university plans its development strategy in such a way as to attract the most gifted, talented and motivated applicants.  The bachelor degree preserves high minimum points for applicants on a budget and a contract, the role of individual achievements, for which you can get up to 10 points for the EGE, is also revised: only the highest quality contests, competitions and projects are selected (more on this later). <br><br><blockquote>  Especially strictly in 2017 it will be with targeted admission (special target places within the general budget on order from companies): if earlier there could be students who overcame the university level, now we will be guided by at least 240 points in three subjects Unified State Exam. <br><br>  In the master's requirements for applicants also remain very high.  So, for example, if you want to enter without a competition, then the average score of your diploma should be at least 4.5. </blockquote><br><hr><br><h2>  About the University </h2><br>  In recent years, ITMO University has been admitting to more than 300 educational programs of undergraduate and graduate programs, in higher education institutions more than 100 departments, more than 10 faculties.  It was quite difficult for applicants to understand all this variety of names. <br><br>  Therefore, in 2016, within the framework of the Admissions <b>Office</b> , <b>Meganapointments</b> were introduced - five key specialized areas of the university, each of which thematically represented educational programs: <br><br><ul><li>  Internet technologies and programming </li><li>  Photonics </li><li>  Computer technology and management </li><li>  Biotechnologies and low-temperature systems </li><li>  Economics, Management, Innovation </li></ul><br>  Applicants are invited to start choosing meganapravlenie, and then decide on an educational program (EP).  This is the shortest way, just 2 steps.  Next, the incoming will know which department this EP is implemented and at what faculty. <br><br>  During 2016, the structure of the university has changed dramatically at the administrative level: mega-faculties were created, which were officially entrenched in the structure of the university.  To date, the ITMO University officially has four mega-faculties, administratively combining faculties, departments, educational programs: <br><br><ul><li>  MF Translational Information Technologies (Meganapravlenka Internet technologies and programming); </li><li>  MF Photonics; </li><li>  MF Computer Technology and Management; </li><li>  MF Biotechnology and low-temperature systems. </li></ul><br>  In 2017, it is planned to complete the creation of the fifth mega-faculty by profile - Economics, Management, Innovation. <br><br><h4>  Not only IT: what disciplines develop at mega-faculties </h4><br><blockquote>  We have our own clear scientific and educational profile: IT and photonics.  But then we transmit our competencies to new areas, thereby developing ourselves and strengthening those areas where our knowledge is lacking.  So appear: bioinformatics, quantum communications, IT-urbanistics, Art &amp; Science, Internet of things, Fintech, scientific communication, biotechnology, neurotechnology. </blockquote><br>  Such multidisciplinary mega-faculties in science and education is welcomed and supported by the university.  Such educational programs attract modern applicants, as they combine different competences and reveal the talent of the student from all sides. <br><br>  <b>Robotics</b> .  In 2016, the School of Robotics was created at ITMO University, which in the spring of last year won 2nd place on the WRO (World Robot Olympiad, World School Robotics Championship).  Now we are developing our robotic direction and are aiming to make ITMO the world champion in robotics - just as it happened with IT. <br><br>  <b>Physics</b>  Less than a year ago, the Faculty of Physics and Technology was opened, focused on the training of elite physicists.  The faculty is created in the structure of the mega-faculty of photonics, which is our scientific base.  It is on this MOF that most scientific laboratories, famous scientists, employees of this MOF write articles in the highest rated scientific journals.  And now physicist applicants have the opportunity to come here, learn from the best teachers and win their awards not in IT, but in physics, in science. <br><br>  <b>Biotechnology</b> .  At the beginning of 2017, the university established a mega-faculty ‚ÄúBiotechnologies and low-temperature systems‚Äù, focused on the following ‚Äútrendy‚Äù areas: healthy nutrition, functional foods, modern ways of preserving them.  Now there are literally 1-2 universities in the country that train specialists in this field and conduct scientific activities.  The development of this MOF at the very beginning of its journey.  But we have every reason to expect that very soon this direction will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Innovation</b> .  At the same time, ITMO University also trains technology managers, entrepreneurs, and innovators - for this, the established department of technology management and innovation has been responsible for 2 years. <br><br><blockquote>  When entering ITMO University for a specific educational program, you do not attach yourself only to it and you can transfer to another within one training area.  Next, you immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the university, work in laboratories, FabLabe, create your project in the Business Incubator - and here nobody restricts you to anything [including the chosen specialty].  The main thing is your desire. </blockquote><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c21/916/4ec/c219164ec79a4855ad466c41cd2f256d.jpg">  <i><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/92559412%40N08/">Yugank Singhal</a> / Flickr / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  How to figure it all out and make a choice </h2><br>  Now there are many <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/school/">areas</a> for children where they could show themselves and gain knowledge: from Preparatory courses to <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/117/">SPbCTF sports hacking seminars</a> .  The ITMO University holds a large number <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/50/">of Open Days</a> - in online and offline versions, as well as separately for mega-directions.  There are individual vocational guidance testing, excursions and just personal meetings with students and their parents. <br><br>  Very soon we will launch a single portal for schoolchildren who are interested in ITMO University - ITMO.START.  This is a project that will combine all the opportunities for students from 4 to 11 grades.  As for admission directly (to the bachelor's, master's and postgraduate), all the information can be found on our <a href="http://abit.ifmo.ru/">website for applicants</a> , where the most detailed about all educational programs. <br><br>  In the description of each educational program on the site, we placed the curriculum, which allows the entrant to see all the disciplines studied and what forms of control over them will be, and in which semester the student will have to pass something.  There you can see a brief description of the relevant disciplines.  In addition, the applicant has the opportunity to see the leading teachers, which is sometimes decisive when choosing a future specialty. <br><br>  Another opportunity to get closer to studying at ITMO University and decide on their future profession or field of study is mass online courses from the University.  For example, the online course ‚Äú <a href="https://www.lektorium.tv/mooc2/27830">Scientific Communication</a> ‚Äù, which ITMO University launched in 2016, can be easily used in preparation for admission to the magistracy of the same name.  This was one of the objectives of preparing the course, since the direction of the new and literature on it in Russia is very small. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  About applicants and "Olympiad" </h2><br>  For applicants <b>undergraduate</b> Olympiads play a huge role.  All-Russian Olympiad of schoolchildren and the Olympiad from the list of the Russian Council of Schoolchildren Olympiad (RSSS) allow applicants to use the right to enter the ITMO University "Without entrance examinations" (BVI), confirming the diploma of such an Olympiad with 75 USE marks in a specialized subject (this is mandatory). <br><br>  At the same time, the winners of such Olympiads receive a scholarship in ITMO for the first year from 7 to 15,000 rubles per month - this is called the <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/94/">‚ÄúGolden‚Äù, ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù and ‚ÄúBronze‚Äù student card</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  We consider these guys the most focused on further education and development.  These words are confirmed by the further progress of the winners and prize-winners of the Olympiad - it is always 50% higher than the progress of applicants who entered according to the results of the Unified State Exam. </blockquote><br>  Last year, the University received more than 200 winners and prize-winners of subject olympiads of schoolchildren (20% of the total number of budget places), which is the 4th result in Russia.  The University itself is also the organizer of 6 Olympiads from the list of RSPPs. <br><br>  ITMO University accepts classic Olympiads in such subjects as: <br><br><ul><li>  Informatics and ICT </li><li>  Maths </li><li>  Physics </li><li>  Chemistry </li></ul><br>  As well as diplomas of complex Olympiads, such as the Olympiad NTI. <br><br>  All these olympiads set themselves the task of uncovering the creative potential of the applicant, to see a non-standard approach to solving problems among schoolchildren. <br><br>  In February 2017, we combined all the University‚Äôs own subject Olympiads and launched the first <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/trend/news/6367/">ITMO VKontakte</a> online Olympiad in the social network itself, increasing the number of participants 10 times.  For her, for example, we give 10 points to the exam on the subject. <br><br>  At the end of March, we will also launch the online game ‚ÄúPhysics: the game of light‚Äù, aimed at attracting physicists to ITMO.  The game will go on for 5 weeks on the educational portal <a href="https://newtonew.com/">newtonew.com</a> , the winners will also be guaranteed 10 points to the exam. <br><br>  In the <b>magistracy, the</b> winners or awardees of the <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/93/">Olympiad, which is taken into account by the university upon receipt,</a> receive 100 points on the exam (by the profile of the Olympiad).  But the applicant must still take part in the general competition for admission, where, with equal points on the exam, the average grade of the diploma will be taken into account. <br><br>  Often, winners and prize-winners of student Olympiads are awarded with monetary incentives, as well as various bonuses from universities-organizers and partners of the Olympiad.  Also diplomas of such Olympiads can be presented in your "Portfolio" for admission to the university. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Scientific projects and personal achievements: what else can an applicant differ </h2><br>  In the <b>bachelor's program</b> applicants can get up to 10 additional points to the Unified State Exam for <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/69/">individual achievements (ID)</a> .  Among them are scientific and creative contests, sporting achievements, volunteer activities, etc.  Each university has the right to determine for itself, for what and how many points it charges the applicant. <br><br>  Our University singled out the most significant criteria and assigned corresponding points for them.  So, we highly appreciate the victory in engineering competitions, scientific competitions and other projects, which allow determining the motivation and abilities of children. <br><br>  In addition, we give extra points for language certificates.  Applicants who graduated with honors from school or secondary vocational education, also receive up to 5 points to the results of the Unified State Exam.  In general, last year about 50% of applicants took the opportunity to indicate their individual achievements in order to get additional points. <br><br>  Many <b>graduate</b> students prepare for admission <b>in</b> advance and can take part in special competitions and projects of ITMO University, which give the right to enroll without examinations.  In April, you can speak at the <a href="http://kmu.ifmo.ru/">All-Russian Congress of Young Scientists</a> , the winners of which receive the right to enter the ITMO University without a competition. <br><br>  Those who have already written scientific articles and participated in student competitions, who have significant victories and awards, can take part in the <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/53/">Portfolio</a> competition, but it is worth noting that only those graduates of the bachelor degree, whose average score at the university not lower than 4.5. <br><br>  From 2016, the master's degree at ITMO University can also be enrolled <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/92/">remotely</a> , using online exams, which is a very convenient way for non-city applicants.  As mentioned above - 51% of those who did not come from St. Petersburg.  The largest number of students enrolled at ITMO from: St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg State University of Economics, TUSUR, UrFU.  By the way, the share of foreigners in the magistracy in 2016 increased by 2 times: from 8% in 2015 to 16.2% in 2016. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  How to "get ready for ITMO students" </h2><br>  A large number of children enrolled at ITMO University, previously engaged in any career guidance structures or participated in scientific or engineering competitions.  The participation of schoolchildren in such projects allows them to feel in advance what their soul is for and come to a higher educational institution with a more informed choice.  Such students in the future achieve much greater success, including also because they do not spend time adapting to the university world. <br><br><blockquote>  It is very important for us that the students are satisfied with both the education and the atmosphere of the university.  Therefore, we rely on our career guidance structures, which with the help of modern technologies and methods can more quickly convey information about the university, about the specialty, about interesting projects to future students who are now 16-17 years old. <br><br>  Now they [applicants] should choose what will be relevant and popular after 6 years, when they graduate from the university master's program.  But today this choice is very difficult to make - professions disappear or even become unnecessary, but at the same time new markets and new opportunities appear, to which those who are now 16-17, and maybe only 12 years old, should be ready. </blockquote><br>  We trust young students of departments and faculties of the university to work with schoolchildren and parents - they tell about the intricacies of their future profession, about the features of education and independent living, which makes them closer to schoolchildren and allows them to communicate in the same language. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323774/</a></p>
