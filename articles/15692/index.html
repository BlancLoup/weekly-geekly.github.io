  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much profit does Apple bring to Macintosh¬Æ computers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my previous post, I offered to discuss and comment on the article by Oleg Svirgstin published on the DeepApple website.  I have great respect for the author of this article, because I regularly read his work on the DeepApple website.  But unfortunately, after reading the latest work <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/articles/25207.html"><b>‚ÄúIs Apple Worth Selling Windows?‚Äù</b></a> , I could not resist not commenting on it. <br>  Apparently this article was written in a hurry and in my opinion the arguments challenging the western text published by ZDNet were obviously outdated and not convincing.  Unfortunately, in this article there were arguments usually expressed by the Apple community. <br>  And I think you should pay attention to fans of Apple, the fact that in 2007, Apple Inc.  this is not at all the company of which it was in 2001, and even then it was called Apple Computer Inc.  The most important thing that has changed is that Apple, today is no longer just a Computer Company, another article by the same author testifies to this: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/articles/25188.html"><b>‚ÄúApple TV: Or‚Äú another reason to change the name ‚Äù</b></a> <br>  And as a result of this fact, it has changed, and the percentage of sales that companies today bring Mac ªi. <br>  If we analyze the figures published by Apple in the report for the IV quarter of 2007: <a href="http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q407data_sum.pdf"><b>see the quarterly report of Apple</b></a> .  Then we find that by selling 2,164,000 Macintosh¬Æ computers, Apple earned = $ 3,103 million.  Apple's total sales were $ 6,217 million.  But from everything else Apple does, it received: $ 6,217 - $ 3,103 = $ 3,114 million. <br>  Those.  Today, the Mac business brings Apple only 49.9% of the total money.  Less than 50% and this is the quarter that has become the most record-breaking number of Macs sold. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And if you count the% of Mac's business for the third quarter of 2007 ( <a href="http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q407data_sum.pdf"><b>see Apple's quarterly report</b></a> ), then we will be even more surprised: only 46.8% of sales are Mac sales.  But a year ago, in the fourth quarter of 2006, this figure was even lower: only 45.7% of sales were Mac ªi. <br>  And if today's percentage of Mac's business is compared, for example, with the year 2001 (when MacOS X first appeared), then we would be very surprised that the Mac business of iron was really the main business and certainly brought no less than 90% of revenue. the company.  But as a consequence of this: then Apple was a loss-making company. <br>  Since then, Apple has done everything possible to keep the computer business devouring a lot of money and resources (a very expensive enterprise) to a minimum.  It was for this purpose that the actual transition was taken to the Intel processors, which made the cost price of Apple computers the same as usual PCs, which Apple could not achieve before.  And most importantly, Apple took up other businesses.  For example, Internet-business and SoftWare-business, and Music-business, which are less costly and respond to a nested dollar with a large percentage of net profit. <br><br>  These my conclusions, well, if they are not a refutation of the final argument of the article: "... And sales of iron, due to which the company lives (Macs bring 56% of its income), would have fallen sharply and irreparably ...", then they clearly say that The iron business of Mac `s today is no longer the main one and this trend will continue in the future. <br>  I think that in 2008 from the sale of the iPhone, Apple will earn even more profit, and, moreover, it will reduce the earnings it receives from Macintosh¬Æ computers. <br>  The world is changing steadily, it's time for Mac users to understand: Apple is not only and not so much the iron Macs, and today the main thing for Apple, as I see it, is MacOS X. <br>  It is MacOS X that runs inside the Apple Mac, Apple TV, Apple iPhone, Apple iPod touch, Apple SoftWare is developed for MacOS X, and it is under MacOS X &amp; Safari that all Apple Internet services are sharpened today! <br>  Yes`healthy Apple MacOS X! </div>
