  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPod: programs for every day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main difference between iPod'a and its competitors is that a lot of programs and utilities have been created for this player, which facilitate the work with the device.  The range of their actions is huge - from the banal "filling up" with music to a change in the player's firmware itself.  And that step will be wrong if you pass by all these soft side.  So, here is a set of the most useful programs for working with Apple iPod! <br><br>  Since some of the programs work with the player, while others do not, and still others only with iTunes, I will speak in three directions.  I will begin, of course, with utilities for the player. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>IPod Utilities</strong>

      Most programs created for iPod Video.  Of course, these are video converters.  There are a lot of them in the network, and therefore I will present only a few of them - the most interesting ones.  In addition, a lot of good things are created exclusively for MacOS, and therefore I will mention them not in the quantity in which they are.  Well, in the end, there is a small set of utilities for Linux, which also deserve your attention! <br><br>  <em><a href="">Transipod</a></em> (MacOS) <br>  A small utility for converting video only to formats <strong>mov</strong> and <strong>mpeg</strong> .  You ask: "Why convert those formats that the iPod itself can play?".  The fact is that the program is designed to scale the image in the resolution of <strong>320 * 240</strong> pixels, that is, in the resolution of iPod Video.  As a result, the player itself does not scale the picture and this makes it possible not to lose in details and save battery! <br><br>  <em><a href="">iFeedPod</a></em> (MacOS) <br>  A simple program for reading RSS feeds and transferring them to iPod.  Create the necessary RSS feeds, download, then opposite those that you want to transfer to your iPod, put a tick, click Sync, and send news to your iPod!  Easy and convenient! <br><br>  <em><a href="">Free iPod Video Converter</a></em> (Windows) <br>  Supports most popular video formats, among which are the most famous: <strong>DVD, VCD, AVI, MPEG, WMV, RM, RMVB, DivX, ASF and VOB</strong> .  The program conveniently implemented preview and batch conversion of video data.  In the settings you can set the quality of encoding audio / video tracks, set the image resolution. <br><br>  <em><a href="">PodPlus v1.2</a></em> (Windows, paid - 15 USD) <br>  Very convenient manager for working with iPod.  Easily copy media files to your hard drive.  Allows you to fully sync iPod with Microsoft Outlook, downloads RSS feeds and podcasts.  <em>Remarks:</em> it is necessary to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx%3Fdisplaylang%3Dru%26FamilyID%3D262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3">Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1</a> - it is version 1.1 not later, otherwise it will not work. <br><br>  <em><a href="http://www.pc-magazin.de/datatip/common/dtt/downloadQQ/Anapod_Explorer_8.9.5a/QQareaidZ105ZfileidZ3495/anapod.exe.html">Anapod Explorer</a></em> (Windows, license - 25 USD) <br>  One of the most interesting and useful utilities.  Built in Explorer.  Allows you to copy music and other files with an item from the context menu.  One of the most useful features of the software is that it allows you to convert .ogg and other formats that are not available to the player in .mp3 and .aac! <br><br>  <em><a href="http://www.yamipod.com/main/modules/downloads/">YamiPod</a></em> (Windows, MacOS, Linux) <br>  Our answer to Chamberlain, i.e.  iYunes'y.  The program is written in Java, i.e.  works under all OS: Windows, MacOS, Linux and does not require (!!!) installation.  Those.  It turns the player into a USB drive!  The main advantages of the program include the ability to restore accidentally erased tracks, work with RSS and podcasts, import, export and manage playlists m3u / pls! <br><br>  <em><a href="">A-one iPod Convertor</a></em> (Windows) <br>  Another iPod video converter.  In combination with support for <strong>AVI, MPG, MPEG, ASF, WMV, MOV, 3GP, AMR, FLV, FLIC, SWF</strong> and other video formats, batch conversion, select and adjust the quality of converting audio and video streams separately, preview the result, High speed and high quality and simple interface make this utility simply indispensable! <br><br>  <em><a href="http://gopod.free-go.net/">goPod</a></em> (Windows, MacOS, Linux) <br>  Free utility that works under all operating systems.  Designed to remove audio restrictions from the European version of the player.  We start the program, we wait for the answer about synchronization, and we press on the Go button!  That's it, the lock is off! <br><br>  <em><a href="http://syncwrangler.softonic.com/">SyncWrangler</a></em> (Windows, license - $ 29.99) <br>  A program for sharing files between iTunes and iPod.  Simple as two and two!  In the two drop-down lists, select the desired playlists or other files and synchronize! <br><br>  <em><a href="http://wordpod.berlios.de/download/">WordPod</a></em> (Windows, MacOS) <br>  WordPod is an intuitive and simple program that will help you read books on your iPod.  WordPod software converts plain text e-books to iPod compatible formats and copies them to the player. <br><br>  <strong>ITunes Utilities</strong> <br><br>  The mediacomb itself is very functional.  And therefore, little that may still need this "beast."  But I suggest paying attention to a couple of useful utilities, such as Volume Logic and Album Cover Finder. <br><br>  <em>Volume Logic</em> ( <a href="">Windows</a> , <a href="">Mac OS</a> ) <br>  Very useful and simple utility, more precisely, a plug-in to iTunes which significantly improves the sound quality of songs.  Volume Logic adjusts the volume and balance of the sound in the music played in iTunes.  To adjust the sound, he uses a 5-band processor.  Volume Logic adjusts the sound on the fly, and does not make any changes to the file. <br><br>  <em>Album Cover Finder</em> ( <a href="">Windows</a> , <a href="">MacOS</a> ) <br>  The program for those who love order in their media library.  The program searches for Amazon'e and Google Images album art, set by you.  Excellent integration with iTunes. <br><br>  <strong>Epilogue</strong> <br><br>  In fact, there are many more programs.  I have indicated only the most interesting and important, in my opinion, for a person who loves his player!  Look, if you have not found the right, and the works will not be fruitless! <br><br>  Good luck;) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11243/</a></p>
