It is quite convenient - you can follow the change in weight, weighing before and after exercise, or before and after the party (but it‚Äôs better not to do so, the mood falls :)). <br><br>  However, it is possible to follow the weight change in this case for 2-3 days.  If you do not keep a log of measurements, all numbers are forgotten.  Smart scales, which are becoming more and more popular, will show dynamics for at least a year without any problems, plus such devices can monitor the implementation of the goal to lose weight by a couple of kilograms.  What smart scales can the smart device market offer now?

Fitbit Aria WI-FI Smart Scale scales do not only allow to determine weight, but also to track detailed dynamics, with analysis and long-term forecast of changes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErZx-FpFKSw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjc_De6kPNfJ4pH_JOJJD-HYpPqnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Scales are synchronized with the Fitbit cloud service, where measurement data is sent.  After analysis, the information is displayed in a convenient form for viewing, graphs and charts.  You can view data from any mobile device connected to the web.  A review of the results is another useful function that motivates a person to achieve the set task. <br><br>  The watch is equipped with its own display, which, in addition to the measurement results, displays the battery charge level and the signal level of the wireless network. <br><br>  For each family member, you can create your own profile, and when measuring the weight, Fitbit Aria will automatically recognize the person, fixing the data in his profile. <br><br>  The price of smart scales from Fitbit in the Russian Federation is 7,000 rubles. <br><br><h3>  iHealth HS3 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/003/b92/9bf/003b929bf4474476a947a413eae4d0fa.jpg"><br><br>  These smart scales - the most inexpensive device of all specified.  Price iHealth HS3 is only 2600 rubles. <br><br>  Scales are equipped with a wireless Bluetooth communication module, through which measurement data is transmitted to a mobile device (Android, iOS).  In addition, the data is recorded in the iHealth cloud service. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zhAlk5klh0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgw0E5-ShmtQrPeQAesYez6Gh-wA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If the user has any other devices from iHealth, then the general measurement data can be viewed and compared in your account. <br><br>  The maximum load on <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-vesy-ihealth-hs3-ihealth-wireless-scales-hs3.html">iHealth HS3</a> is 150 kilograms. <br><br><h3>  Withings WS-50 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfe/e2b/831/dfee2b83145f442892eb3191852dc9c3.jpg"><br><br>  The developer positions this device as a body analyzer.  Scales not only measure the weight of the wearer's body, but also know how to determine the pulse and even monitor the quality of the air in the room, with an assessment of the ambient temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcF-a-ovc9I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrYAAs6LwU9Sczaw04z2Tykof6rw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Measurement data is transmitted via the wireless Wi-Fi module to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù and the application on a mobile phone.  In the "cloud" a detailed analysis of the measurements is carried out, with the derivation of the results of the analysis in an easy-to-understand form.  It is worth noting that third-party developers are releasing applications for scales.  By the way, these scales also have a Bluetooth module, which is used to configure the device. <br><br>  As usual, scales can determine the body mass index with the percentage of adipose tissue. <br><br>  The maximum measurement limit is 180 kilograms. <br><br>  The price of the device in the Russian Federation is 7999 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Smart Diet Scales </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/e57/881/6fce5788193d4150a5b79c9e5688d065.png"><br><br>  This is a new device for the market of smart scales, designed not to weigh a person, but to control the mass and caloric content of food consumed.  In addition, the device (or rather, its application, assesses the nutritional value of the product). <br><br>  The balance is divided into four parts, each of which has its own weight detector.  On the scales, you can weigh four different dishes or products (vegetables, meat, etc.) at the same time.  The principle of operation of the device <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/umnyj-dom/umnye-vesy-smart-food-scale-obzor-ot-medgadgets.html%3Fpreview%3Dtrue">is explained in the review Medgadgets</a> . <br><br>  In the device database - 210 thousand different products and dishes, plus 80 thousand restaurant dishes.  ON allows you to control the course of the diet and the achievement of established goals.  In addition, there is a software module that allows to estimate the amount of sugar in foods, which is useful for diabetics. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the developer has not yet announced the price of the device. <br><br><h3>  Withings Smart Kid Scale WS-40 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/658/552/fa2/658552fa283040cab3852692d22ec488.jpg"><br><br>  These are children's scales that can be used to measure the weight of a child from birth to the moment when the weight reaches 25 kg.  And then you‚Äôll have to use adult weights :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZjewfWfhzg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXlnWa35gARScwNVYp9E83MMUAFw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For these scales, the company also developed the Withings Baby Companion software.  The minimum step of the scale is 10 grams, which is enough for the most accurate measurement. <br><br>  The device has a built-in wireless module WiFi and Bluetooth, so that the device can transfer data to the cloud storage, and directly to the mobile device.  There is also the possibility of maintaining several profiles at once, up to 4. Of course, each child in the family receives their own profile, to which the data from the scales are transmitted. <br><br>  Price in the Russian Federation - 8999 rubles. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><br>  As we see, in the market of wearable devices there are a large number of various models of wireless smart scales capable of coping with the most unusual task.  Now scales can not only measure weight as it should be, but also monitor air quality, and even measure pulse.  I wonder when manufacturers will teach their scales to make coffee in the morning? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363747/</a></p>
