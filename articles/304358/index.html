System x servers broke (attention!) Six world records in various disciplines.  Which ones?  Details under the cut. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/a52/d12/26ea52d12997f9265a0e94768ff4eab0.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year, Rio de Janeiro hosts the Summer Olympics.  The best athletes from all over the world will represent their countries and fight for the title of the fastest, dexterous and enduring.  Victories, as is known, are achieved only through grueling workouts.  The same can be said about the competition of computer "hardware" - here, in fact, there are their own Olympic Games.  Systems compete in benchmark tests from SPEC, SAP and TPC. <br><br>  We present you the Lenovo System x3650 M5 dual-socket server with an Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4 processor, which set a new bar for such solutions.  The server set records in six categories.  In short, the Lenovo X3650 M5 showed the best results in virtualization, HPC, data processing and speed of work under load.

      Comparative testing of servers proved the variety of methods by which the Lenovo System x3650 M5 improves the performance and energy efficiency of the platform when working with corporate applications, virtualized environments.  And after performing the TPC-E test, it is safe to say that these systems are not only the most powerful servers in the world, but also have the best price / performance ratio. <br><br>  Compare best performance through industry standard tests. <br>  During this test, new records were set.  They show a multitude of work assignments that allow you to consolidate applications and reduce operating costs using X3650 M5 systems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Virtualization Platform: More Virtual Machines, Higher Speed</font> </h2><br>  <b>World record among virtualization x86 processors.</b>  The test, passed in the benchmark SPECvirt_sc * 2013, showed the superiority of the rack mount server Lenovo System x3650 M5 in virtualization.  Excellent results, including, were demonstrated at critical loads in SMP databases using virtual machines.  The SPECvirt_sc2013 test from the non-profit organization Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) quantifies the performance of data center servers that support a specific virtual environment, analyzes the performance of all system components, from hardware elements and virtualization platforms, to guest operating systems and application software. <br><br>  Lenovo System x3650 M5 servers lead the industry in virtualization performance, which, in turn, allows consumers to reduce complexity and more effectively support virtual IT environments. <br><br>  Server Lenovo System x3650 M5 showed <a href="http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/results/res2016q2/virt_sc2013-20160419-00049-perf.html">record performance</a> among x86 <a href="http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/results/specvirt_sc2013_perf.html">dvuhsoketnyh</a> platforms - <a href="http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/results/specvirt_sc2013_perf.html">SPECvirt_sc2013</a> 2343 @ 132 VM.  The world record in benchmark tests that measure virtualization performance in data centers confirms that the server is the market leader in terms of performance.  The newest benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the Lenovo virtualization platform, which provides high flexibility, performance and density of virtual machines, and is the optimal foundation for virtual environments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Energy efficiency - the basis of savings</font> </h2><br>  With high performance and high capacity integrated storage combined with an energy-efficient architecture, the Lenovo System x3650 M5 server has set two energy-efficiency records for the server platform.  The Lenovo System x3650 M5 system achieved a <a href="http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/results/res2016q2/virt_sc2013-20160419-00049-ppws.htm">record performance per watt</a> and <a href="http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/results/res2016q2/virt_sc2013-20160419-00049-ppw.htm">overall performance (including the storage subsystem) per watt</a> : SPECvirt_sc2013_ServerPPW 4.196 @ 132 VM and SPECvirt_sc2013_PPW 4.196 @ 132 VM. <br><br>  <b>Record storage performance in relation to watts of energy consumed for virtualized workloads</b> .  The benchmark based on SPECvirt_sc2013_PPW showed better energy efficiency.  The Lenovo System x3650 M5 server showed the lowest power consumption among all x86 systems.  Lenovo has achieved impressive results with internal storage and without a storage area network (SAN), making it possible for customers to achieve significant energy savings and reduce the cost of paying electricity bills and cooling the data center. <br><br>  Note that 4 large fans in x3650 M5 were replaced with six ‚Äúhot plug‚Äù modules with twin rotors.  The guided cooling system breaks them into two zones, combining with a 750-watt "titanium" power supply, which allows the server to operate at higher ambient temperatures. <br><br>  <b>Record in terms of processor performance per watt of energy among all virtualized solutions</b> .  Benchmark SPECvirt_sc2013_PPW revealed the most efficient power consumption for servers and showed the superiority of Lenovo in a virtualized environment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Application support: a wide range of tasks</font> </h2><br>  <b>Record among dual-processor databases and transactional workloads (OLTP)</b> .  According to the TPC-E test results, Lenovo‚Äôs server turned out to be 30% faster and 9% better at a price / performance ratio than the Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX2540 M1.  Benchmark TPC-E is designed to give a real assessment of server performance and to identify the best price and performance offers among databases and OLTP. <br><br>  TPC Benchmark E benchmark performance test (TPC-E), developed by TPC, simulates workloads during online transaction processing (On-Line Transaction Processing, OLTP).  The TPC-E test simulates the OLTP load in a brokerage company.  In the process of testing, the central database performs transactions related to the personal accounts of the company's customers.  Despite the fact that the TPC-E test is built on the business model of a brokerage company, the logical data structure used, data volumes, transaction types and implementation rules are widely used in modern online transaction processing systems. <br><br>  From the point of view of business processes, TPC-C simulates a computer environment in which many users perform transactions using data stored in a DBMS.  Such business activity is characteristic of order entry systems, regardless of the field of activity, whether it is an enterprise management system or a ticket order.  This test includes a simulation of entering orders, issuing invoices, entering payment information, checking order status and tracking warehouse status.  The load on the system and database structure are chosen so that they do not carry the specifics of a particular industry, but reflect the average business associated with the management, sales or distribution of certain goods or services. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fe/441/03d/8fe44103d5b50fb5b93443293eeb3b94.png"></div><br>  <b>Better workload bandwidth</b> .  Test benchmark SPECfp_rate_base2006, measuring the bandwidth of technical calculations, showed another achievement of the Lenovo System x3650 M5.  The server has excellent results when working with multi-threaded computing applications. <br><br>  <b>Record high-frequency trading.</b>  The benchmark based SPECfp_rate_base2006 test showed that single-threaded operations that are used in the financial sector on the Lenovo System x3650 M5 are more efficient and faster than on other servers. <br><br>  The following configuration of the Lenovo System x3650 M5 was used in these tests: <br><br><ul><li>  Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 (2.2 GHz, 44 cores). </li><li>  512 GB of DDR4 memory. </li><li>  Two ServeRAID M5210 SAS / SATA adapters. </li><li>  Two network adapters Intel X520 Dual Port 10GbE SFP + Ethernet. </li><li>  OS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 with hypervisor Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). </li></ul><br>  This server is optimized for big data and analytics, cloud computing, business critical applications. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92f/959/7f7/92f9597f7d4c8445ee7f6902fd80d761.png"></div>  Server Lenovo System x3650 M5 showed excellent test results, setting six world records.  But this is not the only model of Lenovo, known for its achievements.  <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/systems/servers/">Here</a> you can get acquainted with the other applicants for a medal. <br><br>  Demonstration of high achievements among x86 platforms - has long been the prerogative of Lenovo servers.  Predictive Failure Analysis and Diagnostic Analysis features reduce system downtime and make it easier to maintain, and Lenovo XClarity tools simplify monitoring, configuration, and other management functions throughout the entire life cycle of servers. <br><br>  In addition, they support open standards, including operating systems, network factories, virtualization tools and control protocols, and therefore will easily fit into an existing or future data center environment. <br><br>  <sup><font color="#999999">* Test results are relevant as of March 31, 2016.</font></sup> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304358/</a></p>
