Today, millions of people around the world congratulate each other on the holiday of ... Public Domain Day!  Exactly at midnight <b>on this day thousands and thousands of works of</b> our culture are set free, in accordance with the laws they are <b>freed from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">copyright</a></b> and transferred into the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">public domain</a> , i.e.  become available to the whole society without copyright restrictions.  With works in the public domain, you can do anything you want - copy, edit, translate into other languages, commercially use, take as a basis for new works that you create.  This is a great celebration for all opponents of prohibitive copyright.  Right holders can no longer obstruct the way of copying and using thousands of movies, songs, photos, texts.  You can, for example, publicly perform a song or take a poem and create your own song based on it, or you can shoot a film based on a book.  You can also put the text of the book on your website or independently publish the work in the form of a book and take money for it.  Everything is absolutely legal!  It is only necessary to specify the authorship, but in the US you can and do not. <br><br>  In most countries of the world, copyright expires 70 years after the author‚Äôs death, i.e.  the works of which the author died before January 1, 1941, or works published anonymously before January 1, 1941, are now in the public domain.  That is, specifically in 2011, we recall the authors who died in 1940.  The list of the most famous authors can be found on <a href="http://www.publicdomainworks.net/stats/year/2011">publicdomainworks.net</a> or on Wikipedia in Russian ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B2_1940_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583">short list</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2_1940_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583">full list</a> ) or in English ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940">short list</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1940_deaths">full list</a> ). <br><br>  In Russia, there is also a 70-year term, but in addition there is another border - <b>if the author * died before January 1, 1943, or the work was published anonymously before January 1, 1943, then the work is in the public domain</b> .  That is, while 70 term is not so useful for us, but still not completely useless.  <b>On January 1, 2011, cinema, television and cartoons, television and radio programs, made public before January 1, 1941, are in the public domain</b> .  So, in 1940, the <a href="http://s.kinopoisk.ru/level/7/type/film/list/1/m_act%255Byear%255D/1940/m_act%255Bcountry%255D/13/">following films</a> were released.
