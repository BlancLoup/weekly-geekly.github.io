Then I will find something better ‚Äù- and you heard this more than once?  My peers understand that it‚Äôs time to think about making money, but they make a mistake that keeps them away from their desired work more than idleness. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Forced" work takes away almost all the free time and effort.  In the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24084/">last article</a> I wrote that it is the time that the younger generation should cherish.  In the above case, time is wasted.  Of course, nobody will take away the money earned, but in the long term they will not play a big role when the right investment of time can change life. <br><br>  <b>"All that is popular - worthless" - Oscar Wilde</b>

      After the first course, when many went to earn some money in trendy shops, cinemas or restaurants, I decided to do differently.  Having thrust the greedy part of my ego away, I decided to devote my free few months to studying programming.  As a result, by the end of the year I found my first job in the specialty, while many students by the end of the university did not have the skills of even an intern.  (Oh, that part of my ego spoke up). <br><br>  Think about what you get by staying in a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù job.  A high probability that this is where you will remain, having developed a habit and finding friends.  Changing jobs is not easy, especially when you do not know what you want. <br><br>  I understand that it is difficult to refuse money and begin to plow in being unsure that it will bring income in the future.  It's like in roulette: come and put the entire resource (time) on zero.  But if nothing depends on you in roulette, then in life you determine the outcome. <br><br>  Have you made a bold move?  Then try to do everything to justify it.  Do not stop until you are sure that this was a mistake.  If so, drop and look for something new. <br><br>  In the comments to my <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24084/">previous article</a> it was written that it is useless, because many do not know what they want.  It genuinely surprised me, and I immediately remembered the words of a famous innovator: <br><br>  <i>"Keep looking and don't settle ..." - Steve Jobs</i> <br><br>  Keep looking and don't stop until you find your passion.  This applies to work and personal life. <br><br>  Neither I, nor successful people, whose biographies I have read very much, do not know a better recipe for becoming successful than this one. <br><br>  <b>Opinions</b> <br><br>  It is difficult to act "differently" and ignore opinions.  Sometimes you want to quit and choose the standard path written by the system and made for the system.  It's easier.  It's true.  But choosing this path, you will not be able to feel the excitement and all the fullness of freedom, which is felt only after being freed from invented shackles and envious reproaches. <br><br>  Being born free, we lose an important skill that allows us to sincerely believe that anything is possible.  Do you know why adults ask children what they want to become?  Because adults do not have enough imagination.  When a child responds that he wants to become an artist, the only reason for this choice is the love of creativity.  The child does not think about fame and money.  He just likes to draw. <br><br>  <b>The last word</b> <br><br>  When you understand what you need, education will no longer be necessary and the future will be in your hands.  If you are not ready to take such responsibility in your hands, forget this article.  So it will be easier, it's true ... <br><br>  ... but if you want to change your life, do the following: <br><br>  1. Forget about money for a while (If possible, some of you have to pay bills when you are young) and think about what skills you can earn.  You may not have the skills right now, but you can learn.  I get all my current income thanks to a hobby that I have mastered on my own. <br><br>  2. Bring the selected skill to a high level (so that you can earn).  The best step towards development will be to find an erudite person and ask him for advice on how to achieve the desired results.  Go to the site, write to mail, facebook and twitter.  I made many acquaintances in this way.  Do not forget to read books and constantly practice. <br><br>  3. Find a job.  Write to mail companies or directly to people.  So I met the chief editor of JORNL, and we have been successfully cooperating for half a year.  Ask your friends about whom I spoke in the last paragraph.  Even people from large companies did not refuse me.  This does not mean that you get a pull.  Well, if only a little.  You will be directly linked to the HR agent and given a test task. <br><br>  A few more tips: <br><br>  - Do not strive for workaholism.  Do important things, and devote the rest of the time to self-development, health and relaxation.  PS But know that the first time will have to work. <br><br>  - Read a couple of books on networking (communication skills).  This will help you make the right contacts and impress your colleagues or clients. <br><br>  - Do not take close advice and reproaches of those who do not live the way you want.  And in general, question everything, even this article.  Consider each incoming information, understand the reasons for the change of mood and think about the future.  But not for long.  The present is more important. <br><br>  By tradition, I will finish the article with the lines of the song: <br><br>  <i>"You could be the greatest</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can be the best</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can be the King Kong banging on your chest</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You could beat the world</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You could beat the war</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You could talk to God, go banging on his door</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can throw your hands up</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can be the clock</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can move a mountain</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can break rocks</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can be a master</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Don't wait for luck</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Dedicate yourself and you can find yourself</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The Script - Hall of Fame ft.</i>  <i>will.i.am</i> <br><br>  I will translate the last lines: <br><br>  <i>"Do not expect good luck, set a goal for yourself - and you will find yourself."</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298914/</a></p>
