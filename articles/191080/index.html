I myself recently moved to California and want to share my impressions with you. <br><br>  Many people know that EPAM is one of the largest IT companies in the CIS, and there are offices in many large cities of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  Several of our offices are open in Europe.  The main European office is in Budapest;  Several times I visited Hungarian colleagues with training on clauses and was able to assess how good people work there.

      Well, in the USA, the main engineering forces of EPAM are ‚Äúon-site‚Äù employees who can work throughout the US: from California and Massachusetts, from Seattle to Miami. <br><br>  The point of attraction of <b>all American IT people</b> is <i>Silicon Valley</i> .  ‚ÄúIf you do not have an office in Silicon Valley, it means that your company is not very successful,‚Äù - many people have heard this opinion more than once.  This is very similar to the <i>truth</i> , since here - really - an incredible number of offices are concentrated, from small desks to giant corporations.  In some of these offices, our guys work - IT people of all stripes: devy, testers and ‚ÄúO_o‚Äù dminy.  As a rule, these are <b>former employees of</b> some of the CIS offices, who showed their reliability in battle and were sent <i>to the front</i> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Moving </h4><br>  In <b>EPAM, there are</b> enough ‚Äúon-site‚Äù positions in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Gulf of the Federation Council, and all of them are in companies with very big names.  If you can subscribe to the following items (except experience, experience and experience again), then you can safely talk with the managers about the transfer here: <br><ul><li>  of course, good english </li><li>  desire to try to live and work in the States </li><li>  little adventurous character </li><li>  thirst for travel </li></ul><br>  After various interviews and interviews, during which it becomes clear whether the employee is suitable for a new place, when all procedures have been completed and admissions are received, the transfer begins.  EPAM pays for the flight for the employee and his family, as well as provides housing and transportation for the first time - so that the ‚Äúnewcomer‚Äù can get used to the local way of life.  There are other buns that greatly simplify the new life.  For example, it is worth saying that the relocation of each employee is handled by a whole relocation-team, which helps throughout the journey. <br><br>  Here are a couple of pictures of corporate apartments that are provided by EPAM: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f7/d1e/2c2/9f7d1e2c2aa45104181cce14d97f9d39.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e85/afd/c9e/e85afdc9eae52633d29458134eaf1a02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Work on the client side </h4><br>  ‚ÄúFrom this place in more detail,‚Äù you say ... But, unfortunately, here I can only keep silent.  And we in particular, and EPAM in general, are signing non-disclosure documents.  So, we cannot officially talk about cooperation, and even more so about the on-site working conditions.  However, even a general description of work in one of the companies of the Federation Council will be enough: <br><ul><li>  spacious office </li><li>  newest devices </li><li>  3 meals a day (0_o free!) </li><li>  bicycles on the territory, buses to different parts of the region </li><li>  snacks, drinks, fruit </li><li>  concerts, events </li><li>  fusbol, billiards, bowling, volleyball </li><li>  and many, many, many other things </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Eram staff and team </h4><br>  In addition to corporate chips and buns of the companies in which we operate ‚Äúon-site‚Äù, ERAM also does not forget about its employees and periodically arranges something interesting for them.  For example, like in all our offices around the world, we recently held the traditional summer corporate party EPAM Summer Party - a picnic in nature with a pool, competitions, volleyball and just a good mood, which could be attended by all the guys from EPAM working in SF . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/360/b00/a63/360b00a639e766fb608aed85612ffe36.jpg"><br><br>  On Fridays (though not all) we organize TGIF-events (Thank you, God, today is Friday!).  Besides the fact that here again we can communicate with the whole team, during these events, the managers tell us what's new in the company and the world, and also bring interesting comrades to talk about equally interesting things.  After that, the informal Friday party begins. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da0/7bd/eef/da07bdeeffa31a087499ee54ed9aa6c8.jpg"><br><br>  No cost and no other surprises.  For example, for the Independence Day of Ukraine, in the cafe, where we sometimes all gather, we have a real Ukrainian dinner prepared.  Here are a couple of instagram photos: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ef/418/160/5ef418160d12a21e49ba02a450e8d838.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/287/0c7/638/2870c7638b165d37c43a9fb9b3a60f3f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The Eram Community near San Francisco </h4><br>  According to my data, now in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Gulf of the Northern Fleet there are about one hundred twenty people from different offices of the CIS.  The company is actively increasing momentum, and therefore the number of new employees is growing.  It was common for me to see someone from Kharkov in a nearby park or supermarket. <br><br><h4>  My impressions </h4><br>  Despite the rather busy work schedule, I always try to find time to see the country.  Fortunately, in <b>California</b> itself a lot of interesting places that are <i>definitely worth a look</i> .  And, in principle, this is an unusual country and unusual projects - all this cannot but please, and I do not regret that I agreed to the offer and came here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5b/aca/586/e5baca5862518a0892e862f00bd6fa6b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b0/432/80e/3b043280e9209af1fa211c83e2325b50.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/911/312/e2e/911312e2ebab854ef1c0b8894b3a8a9b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/216/290/0be/2162900be2b72a5be02a4d0935178fb8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/048/8fe/3d1/0488fe3d12200a66cc1c51bc48d8b8c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f04/69c/08e/f0469c08e99ca3c89c9a15591012a6e1.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191080/</a></p>
