This thing connects to the 4G network and distributes WiFi, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/122614/">great review</a> about Habr√© has already been written about it.  The connection speed in my home was quite sufficient, so I bought a whole year of Internet for 9 thousand.  Nothing foreshadowed trouble ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Less than a month later, my modem began to lose connection and hang, sending me every time for a few minutes into the darkness of offline.  At first it happened a couple of times a day, but soon the hangs began to happen every ten minutes.  I took the phone and called Yota tech support, thinking that I would simply be replaced with a modem.

      I was very wrong.  The courteous girl said that the warranty service of Yota Many is not dealt with by Yota, but by the valiant company <a href="http://www.mtservice.ru/">MT SERVICE</a> , whose office (on Baumanskaya, at the other end of the city!), I should contact.  There I have to replace the modem or take it for repair. <br><br>  Bauman, so Bauman.  With all my determination, I set off on a long journey.  In the MT SERVICE company, a no less pleasant girl accepted my modem and said that they did not repair them, but simply replaced them with new ones.  As if by chance, she noted that the delivery of a new modem takes one to two weeks.  My frustrations had no limits!  How so, because the new Yota Many can be bought in a store in 5 minutes?  However, the excellent representative of valiant MT SERVICE had no idea about those mysterious business processes that are happening in the dark bowels of her company, so she could not help me.  I left the office, trying not to think about the upcoming weeks of the Internet. <br><br>  How long, shortly, passed two weeks.  From MT SERVICE neither hearing, nor spirit, and I decided to call them.  A courteous girl number 3 in a soothing voice told me that two weeks is a minimum, and in general up to 45 days.  And by the way, I‚Äôm calling to St. Petersburg, so you shouldn‚Äôt particularly get carried away with a conversation with her. <br><br>  Should I describe the horror that I experienced?  The long beeps in the tube sounded like a funeral march.  No longer experiencing any illusions, I went to the Yota site through the phone to take a last look at it.  And then I saw the inscription "Week to try."  Yota kindly offers the opportunity to return any of their devices within a week without giving a reason.  "Excellent!" - I decided - "I will try exactly as many weeks as MT SERVICE will repair."  I ordered the delivery and waited, the picture from their site inspired great reliable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e2dc3e7d/9447384f/f8253933/9ac42693.png"><br><br>  Stirlitz waited for the modem exactly 59 minutes.  It was not there!  After a few chimes, I realized that they also outsource this business function.  I made the order at 4 pm, I didn‚Äôt wait until the evening for delivery.  But the next day they woke me up at 8 in the morning to clarify the address for the third time.  At 11, I had a modem, within 24 hours.  I am writing this post with his direct help. <br><br>  Curtain, happy ending. <br><br>  What conclusions can we draw from this whole story?  I think the following: <br><ul><li>  If Yota immediately took the broken modem and gave me a new one, it would be no more expensive for them, but rather cheaper.  About the impact of such torment on loyalty and can not speak. </li><li>  If any function is outsourced, this should not obviate the need to monitor its performance. </li><li>  To ensure good service, it is not enough to teach employees to smile and be courteous, you still need to adjust the necessary business processes. </li><li>  On Yota Many, it is not casual that ‚ÄúBuilt in China‚Äù is written. </li></ul><br>  I wish that you do not have to deal with such services. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br><br>  On Monday, two days after writing the post, a representative of Yota contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience.  A day later, I was given a refund for the modem, which I took in return for the broken one, and was kindly given two months of free internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134317/</a></p>
