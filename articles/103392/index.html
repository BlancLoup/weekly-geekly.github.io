  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life in the clouds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More recently, the problem of synchronization of everything and everyone worried me a little, somehow I lived without it, because I worked constantly on the same computer, I had a browser with the Internet on my laptop, I simply remembered or stored the basic passwords or stored the encrypted base on a flash drive. <br>  Later, the need to work more in different places on a laptop or second computer led to thoughts about the organization of affairs.  Options considered the following: <br>  <b>1.</b> put on the main computer <b>TeamViewer</b> , so that it is always available. <br>  <b>2.</b> use <b>Dropbox</b> to synchronize all the necessary files. <br>  <b>3.</b> find <b>online services</b> to transfer activity to them.  This solution will allow: <br>  ‚Ä¢ work from any computer and any OS (I want to switch to Linux as the main OS, leaving Windu for Starcraft). <br>  ‚Ä¢ do not carry flash drives with you and generally gives you maximum comfort and independence. <br>  I stopped at this decision, although I am still in the process of searching, I would like to share what I found and listen to tips on how to proceed. <br><h4>  So what is transferable online? </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Mail.</b>  The easiest.  Ever since 2004, I switched to Gmail's web interface, abandoning desktop clients.  Recently there <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/100890/">appeared the</a> launch of multiple accounts, which is very convenient.  It is inconvenient that it is impossible to switch between accounts on your domains in the same way, but I didn‚Äôt understand much about the function of linking accounts. <br><br>  <b>2. Contacts.</b>  Google Contacts is quite convenient and allows you to sync with the iPhone.  Actually, more is needed.  Reminders of birthdays in the calendar is just as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/101768/">easy to</a> set up. <br><br>  <b>3. GTD-organizer.</b>  Go to the more interesting.  Tried Google Tasks, too primitive.  I tried Rermber the milk, thn.gs, todoist, vitalist and something else.  He stopped at nirvanahq.com, which appeared recently.  The service is not overloaded and combines sufficient functionality with simplicity and convenience.  Perhaps, only the subtasks and subprojects are missing, the percentage of task completion, and of synchronization with the Google calendar.

      <b>4. Mind maps.</b>  I tried different online options, the same comapping.com is quite good.  But it was sent to XMind + Dropbox.  Responsiveness of the program compared with the online service is much higher and more pleasant work. <br><br>  <b>5. Storing passwords.</b>  I tried passpack.com and other online options, but stopped at KeePass (/ KeePassX) + Dropbox as one of the most well-known and subjectively most convenient.  If you don't trust online servs, you can use KeePass + Dropbox. <br><br>  <b>6. Documents, RSS.</b>  Since I do not edit documents as often, I did not even look at Zoho and others, Google Docs is quite happy.  But when choosing the RSS reader there were no questions at all, Google Reader is very good.  Since even the statement of this fact is too casual for Habr, we will limit ourselves to this. <br><br>  <b>7. Easy access to everything.</b>  I set up the iGoogle homepage, which, in addition to various garbage, made an RSS reader and links to the most visited sites and services. <br><br>  <b>8. Hosting and storing files online.</b>  Here, too, everything is simple, but my solution is not suitable for everyone.  Own server on colocation allows not to think about disk space and other trifles and it is not planned to refuse it in favor of cloud hosting.  Although, of course, if you are not the owner of a popular site (sites), paying 6 thousand per month for online storage is not very reasonable and you should look for another solution (even the same Dropbox or regular hosting).  For work files and synchronization, 2 Gb of Dropbox is enough. <br><br>  <b>9. Synchronization of bookmarks</b> and other browser management.  In Chrome, you just need to enable this option and specify the mail, in general, everything is simple.  Surely, in other browsers there are no problems with synchronization either.  So I do not even know what sense to use delicious and similar services if sociality is not needed. <br><br>  <b>10. Social networks.</b>  I practically do not use it: occasionally I write on Twitter, occasionally I look at Facebook.  You need to meet with friends for a beer and no Internet will replace this.  Geo-social services are more interesting, but so far neither Foursquare, nor Google Latitude, nor Facebook Places are very popular in your social circle, you will have to find out the location of your friends by phone in the old manner. <br><br>  PS Yes, there are a lot of Gugloservices in the list, which everyone already uses.  Therefore, I would like to hear about adequate replacements, if any.  Also interested in the tree editor to replace Mars Notebook. <br><br>  PPS Update, March 2016. 5.5 years have passed.  What has changed? <br><br>  Linux became the main OS just a month ago and accidentally: Win 10 refused to install itself on an SSD.  Now the choice of OS does not seem to be a matter of principle. <br><br>  Instead NirvanaHQ is now ToODist as a Chrome app. <br>  Keepaas + Dropbox - and remained. <br>  Google Docs, especially spreadsheets have become the main tool. <br>  fnpaste is an analogue of pastebin <br>  joxy - in the absence of Yandex.Disk screenshots <br>  Yandex.Music has replaced desktop players and mp3 collections <br><br>  Many chome applications have been added: <br>  - already mentioned ToDoist <br>  - WatsApp (when just the web version appeared, it was inconvenient, the application simplifies everything) <br>  - Facbook messenger <br>  - Telegram (yes, 1 more messenger, something of their own) <br>  - Googe Keep - it is very convenient to make uniform notes on different devices (laptop, smartphone, tablet, laptop) <br>  - Gismeteo <br><br>  The Dropbox subfolder is displayed on the desktop. <br><br>  In general, the trend that began many years ago continues to develop, albeit rather slowly.  And largely due to Chrome applications, cloud services are seamlessly replacing desktop applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103392/</a></p>
