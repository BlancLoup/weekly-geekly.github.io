Well, the breathalyzer will help you to determine this state in numbers, for example - DrinkMate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/8b1/fc3/4948b1fc342c4f378910cb79ccf98bb8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In life, anything happens.  And the evening celebration can be delayed, and in the morning you feel good, but there is still a high level of alcohol in the blood.  Or on the contrary, you do not want to stay long and have already drank a glass of wine.  For such controversial moments, there are portable breathalyzers.

      What is good with DrinkMate and what is its advantage?  The first and one of the main advantages is size.  It is almost like a finger-type battery, takes up very little space.  The second is that it does not require any batteries.  Power is supplied by the smartphone.  There are 2 versions for the most common operating systems: for iOs and Android.  We will consider under iOs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/153/da0/1c4/153da01c4e3d4070a64948d87d4b19cc.jpg"><br><br>  The packaging is a kind of elongated tube with a square cross section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e7/8cb/166/1e78cb166a8d42d18fd0d05f09e07abf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0d/db9/d5c/d0ddb9d5c5bb477e817e5fc2353e4d95.jpg"><br><br>  Decorated well.  The developers have tried.  In essence, this product comes from a crowdfunding company with KickStarter, so the developers made enough effort to create a pleasant appearance, both to the device itself and to the packaging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c2/963/5ae/4c29635ae5db4c2e92a69d24681de4a1.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the package is the breathalyzer itself, a protective cap, a neoprene shell with a carabiner and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/a5f/ac0/c08a5fac007d444980256ee4dcfb8843.jpg"><br><br>  The neoprene envelope evokes some diving motifs, although they didn‚Äôt stand close here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ac/997/75e/5ac99775ed694f87be17b262c423de07.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget is very compact and light.  And although the manual states that it has been working with the Iphone since version 5, it worked fine for me in both iPad mini and iPod. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a8/a9e/245/7a8a9e245a6141d98e2200c59190eb8c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way with regards to ergonomics.  In DrinkMate, the connector is slightly offset from the center and, depending on how it is plugged in, it can either protrude in one direction or the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8f/601/4a6/a8f6014a61ca440b89557ccf6dced5d8.jpg"><br><br>  This can interfere a little when the phone is lying on a flat surface with it, on the other hand it is not worth keeping it constantly stuck.  I checked the blood alcohol level and hid it in my pocket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bf/419/5dc/5bf4195dc9134e1e8c0a13581666f735.jpg"><br><br>  Well, let's proceed to the measurements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcc/350/525/dcc35052537d4ff79aed21fdee6ac741.jpg"><br><br>  When you first turn on the program, you are informed that you are now in the family.  Welcome to the club of anonymous alcoholics, as they say. <br><br>  Immediately, you are told that if suddenly you do not have a device, then you can buy it and offer to go to the developer‚Äôs store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/a88/f1a/264a88f1a0954a32883afb9c423b9414.jpg"><br><br>  This is followed by a small instruction, or rather a couple of tips.  It is reported that you should not immediately blow into the breathalyzer, after drinking.  This will lead to severely high readings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66d/0a4/7ec/66d0a47ec05e402498fca86992bac689.jpg"><br><br>  It is also not recommended to lean the breathalyzer against your lips, the recommended measuring distance is 2.5 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/314/89c/7ef/31489c7efd4e4ae5b07dff5604a23b09.jpg"><br><br>  Well, do not blow as if blowing out the candles on the cake, blowing lightly enough as if blowing out a candle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ec/aa6/69a/5ecaa669abdd4b4799dc90b771b4a92a.jpg"><br><br>  In general, sit back and enjoy the flight, or rather use.  At the same time and agree with the security policy on data transfer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfd/f4b/4fc/dfdf4b4fcf8d4bbc835d33f338c0e598.jpg"><br><br>  All is ready.  Now we set up a profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/736/23b/d38/73623bd38c7c4ccda28ad53788f1757d.jpg"><br><br>  Fill in the registration data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/268/567/62f/26856762f4d240b7a9c5dcdb41141154.jpg"><br><br>  Specify weight, gender and age.  This affects the readings, since the higher the body weight, the more alcohol is needed for intoxication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fa/6cf/c2e/5fa6cfc2e87e4290aa152ce460968fb4.jpg"><br><br>  Profile is ready.  Now we set up in what we measure our degree of intoxication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c69/aa7/eb8/c69aa7eb82e648588ee14f1fc48854f2.jpg"><br><br>  Here you need to draw on the line "Nastroki SAK" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e6/b13/f87/8e6b13f876a84d8e8ba7e77a255406c4.jpg"><br><br>  We have adopted a system for calculating the level of alcohol in the blood - ppm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a55/2e9/af1/a552e9af144a4b61b90b0410cd1b0007.jpg"><br><br>  And choosing a country, the program itself will indicate the permissible level in the blood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8e/fb8/643/f8efb8643b27482496263939096ebf45.jpg"><br><br>  For Russia, it is now 0.3 ppm.  Calibration point is an interesting item.  but the program does not advise you to calibrate yourself.  We will not break anything there ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44c/b81/21b/44cb8121b3af409286dfaa5aa772f6d6.jpg"><br><br>  So everything is set up.  Go to the measurements.  When measuring, the device needs 10 seconds to heat the sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/047/e63/69b/047e6369b3954e15a4a6c5b9b63b306c.jpg"><br><br>  Control measurement, showed 0.000, that's right.  Here you can take a photo for memory in order to remember in the morning what you drank and where.  The map below offers to put the mark of the location of the measurement, it is also a place of drinking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39b/9e1/60c/39b9e160cd2547aab7980472615bee34.jpg"><br><br>  With several measurements in a row, the sensor goes into the vapor cleaning mode of previous measurements.  Cleaning time 1.5 minutes.  To speed up this process, you need to wave the device, winding the sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ad/ac7/878/2adac7878e054b509ef2d8a7c399a384.jpg"><br><br>  And here the breathalyzer shows a very high alcohol content.  The fact is that I produced this measured immediately after the "adoption on the chest."  That's why it is advised to wait 15 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/258/232/771/2582327715ee4b9e9071beef6d066a4f.jpg"><br><br>  After 15 minutes, the level goes down to 0.2, which is more like the truth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcf/087/e3b/bcf087e3b1a74b60b61ccb53a549debc.jpg"><br><br>  DrinkMate keeps statistics of your alcohol history, as well as allows you to use it also in guest mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/913/e3f/499/913e3f499c3d4c8e982b18e77191c269.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the gadget will be interesting to those who love bar life and miss a couple of strong glasses on Friday after work.  Also, he can help you in the morning after a hectic fun to understand whether to get behind the wheel or not, but this is less common.  So for alcogists, this is an indispensable gadget, for everyone else, it can be useful as a gift when everything is presented and you don‚Äôt know what to choose for your friend. <br><br>  If you are interested in this device, then you can purchase it at a 10% discount for 14 days from today on the promotional code: <b>GEEKT-ALCO</b> <br><br>  The breathalyzer DrinkMate itself is here: <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/alkotester-drinkmate-ios/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios%26utm_content%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios%26utm_campaign%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios_315">djadget</a> <br><br>  <b>As well as information for bloggers and authors:</b> <br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
