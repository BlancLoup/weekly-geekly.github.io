Where to get money for the realization of your dreams?  Recently, the method of raising funds at the expense of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù financing has become increasingly popular.  Leader in fundraising through crafunding today is of course <br>  Kickstarter is a platform for financing a variety of creative projects, from traditional art to sophisticated modern technological devices.  However, not all projects are allowed to raise funds on this site, so before starting to prepare your project for placement, check if it has any chances to be allowed to participate in the program.  What rules should be met by the project itself, which is prohibited, which rules should be followed in the process of publishing and promoting the project?  I tried to answer all these questions in this article. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/370/370/9fc370370d7ce42b0891e5c203f1541a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To provide funding, a project must have a clearly formulated goal, for example, to create a music album, a book, or a work of art.  It can not be indefinite.  At the end of the project you get a tangible result.  Starting a business cannot be considered a project. <br>  Projects must comply with Kickstarter categories. <br>  Currently, projects related to such categories as visual arts, comics, dance, fashion, cinema, cooking, games, music, photography, books, technology and theater are supported. <br>  Design and engineering projects have additional limitations.  If your project does not fit into any of the above categories, you should review it. <br><br><h4>  Requirements for design and engineering projects: </h4><br>  Not all design and engineering projects can be placed on Kickstarter.  The rules for placing such projects are partly subjective, the creators of Kistarter introduced them in order not to deviate from the creative focus of their service.

    <h5>  Good chances are projects that fit into the concept of "do it yourself" </h5><br>  We love projects from creative communities or start-ups that sponsors can spend their free time on weekends, such as 3D printers or CNC machines, as well as open source projects.  Software development projects should be managed by the developers themselves. <br><br><h5>  Appearance is no less important, as is the internal content. </h5><br>  Kickstarter is a place for unusual and modern projects.  Create something designer, and not something that we see every day on TV. <br><br><h5>  Projects, projects, projects‚Ä¶. </h5><br>  Kickstarter for those projects that have an end goal in a short time, and not for those that require long-term funding.  No online shopping or social networking sites.  (Yes, yes, this means that Kickstarter cannot be launched as a project on Kickstarter. Very funny.) <br><br><h5>  One reward option </h5><br>  Projects in the field of engineering and design allow only one reward per bid. <br>  The reward consists of either a single item or a set of items (for example, salt shakers and pepper shakers, or a greenhouse collection kit).  Providing a reward simultaneously as a single element and a group of elements is not possible. <br>  Plus, similar projects for the development of new computer equipment should be accompanied by functional prototypes, that is, prototypes that can already perform the functions declared by the creator, as well as detailed instructions on their use.  Also, when working with these projects, it is prohibited to use imitation products, photo-realistic imitations, as well as a large number of products as a reward. <br><br><h4>  Projects prohibited on Kickstarter </h4><br>  No charity funds <br>  It is forbidden to raise funds for organizations like the Red Cross and other charitable organizations, as well as for informational and educational campaigns. <br>  No projects ‚Äúfor personal needs‚Äù <br>  Prohibited projects to pay for your tuition or bills, collect money for a vacation or a new video camera <br><br><h4>  List of prohibited items on Kickstarter: </h4><br><br>  Alcohol (as a reward) <br>  Automotive products <br>  Products for children <br>  Shower and bath products <br>  Competitions (entry fee, prize fund, as part of your project, to stimulate funding) <br>  Decorative cosmetics <br>  Coupons, discounts, gift cards <br>  Drugs and attributes for taking drugs, tobacco, etc. <br>  Electronic surveillance <br>  Energy drinks <br>  Means to build weight or to drop weight <br>  Sunglasses (sun glasses or corrective) <br>  Material incentives (property, part of profits, return of money / loans, etc.) <br>  Firearms and knives <br>  Health and Personal Care Products <br>  Products for heating or cooling <br>  Building products <br>  Promotional videos <br>  Medical or safety related products <br>  Multi-level marketing or financial pyramid projects <br>  Nutritional supplements <br>  Materials offensive content (speeches of inappropriate content, etc.) <br>  Pet Products <br>  Pornography <br>  Projects containing propaganda or vice versa anti-propaganda of political figures <br>  Projects promoting rudeness and violence <br>  Projects launched to sell an existing product <br>  Lottery and sweepstakes <br>  The property <br>  Rewards in large quantities (more than 10 pieces) <br>  Rewards that were not made directly by the creator of the project (no gizmos from the garage, repacked existing products or weekends at the resort) <br>  Books, CDs, DVDs on self-improvement problems <br><br><h4>  Community principles </h4><br>  Engage in the promotion of the project, but do not spam! <br>  Sharing your project with friends, fans or subscribers is one thing, and throwing letters on the Internet of users or visitors to other social networks is completely different.  Spam will do you a disservice; your project can be dropped.  Should not be engaged in such things. <br>  What is spam in terms of kickstarter? <br>  Send emails or messages with information about your project to strangers <br>  Using email sheets of third parties or other kickstarter users <br>  Sending a non-requested response on twitter <br>  Likbombing forums <br>  Promotion of your project on the pages of other projects <br>  Not sure what is spam?  If you have such suspicions, then this is spam. <br><br><h4>  Last recommendation.  Be polite and attentive </h4><br>  Do not bother people and do not insult them <br>  Do not post obscene, malicious, or incorrect messages. <br>  Do not submit copyrighted material without permission.  Only those materials to which you have rights. <br>  If you do not like the project, do not support it. <br>  Do not behave arrogantly. <br>  If you violate any of the above rules, your project will be dropped and your account will be deleted. <br>  It's not just fun, so please follow the prescribed rules.  Agreed? <br><br>  It should be noted that, looking through the site, you can see projects that are partially contrary to these rules.  No wonder, creating a project for a project, people gain experience and go to some tricks.  Personally, I am most surprised at how the Death Star construction project came to Kickstar. <br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461687407/kickstarter-open-source-death-star">www.kickstarter.com/projects/461687407/kickstarter-open-source-death-star</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd4/0f7/a5a/cd40f7a5a7c2a9f0e1257a58036193a5.jpg"><br>  How it fits with the official rules is a mystery to me. <br>  I hope the article was useful to someone.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170475/</a></p>
