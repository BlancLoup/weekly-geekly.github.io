For a long time, it was used as file storage, then a little, as a development server.  Like any fan of computer equipment, the number of all sorts of accessories at home has grown - necessary and not so much.  The number of wires began to depress.  Imagine a mini-ITX case wired like a spider's web.  It is time to end this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="310"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/41/4d/414dd18e6e6360ea3b2ea2c3b6857eab.jpg" alt="image" width="304" height="300"></a> <br>  Fig.  one

Having unscrewed the full-size CD-ROM drive, I found that there was enough room in the case for a wide range of devices.  By the way, I used to worry that the body is huge and clumsy, but if it had not been so, this article would not have taken place. <br><br>  There are two hard drives installed in the case: 3.5 and 2.5 inches, placed on regular places - inside and outside of the removable basket (lower right corner in Fig. 1). <br><br>  Three devices were selected as the first candidates for implantation: <br><ul><li>  Zyxel P-330W EE router (about it separately a little later) </li><li>  Radio module from an old but very comfortable Logitech mouse </li><li>  Pinnacle External TV Tuner </li></ul><br>  The devices were removed from the standard cases.  It is worth noting that all the manipulations on the additional equipment were made with the condition that they could be returned to their original state in terms of appearance and functionality. <br><br>  The only thing that had to work with a knife and file was the radio module for the mouse.  I really wanted to somehow gracefully strengthen it in the case, for which the standard (not clear the truth for what intended) latches inside the case cover were used.  The processed corner of the board did not contain foil sections and was undoubtedly neatly removed (the lower right corner of the upper right board in Fig. 2). <br><br>  The third picture shows the used wires, from left to right: the standard wire of the mouse‚Äôs radio module (not modified, but only intercepted by a tie), the wire from the USB output strip on the rear panel (one of the connectors is replaced with the necessary plug for the TV tuner), TV extension cable to output the antenna connector to the back of the case and the network jumper to connect the network card of the motherboard to the socket on the router. <br><br>  Now the main thing - the completion of the case.  The result is shown in Figure 4. Armed with pliers, I bit out the extra jumpers in the grille on the back of the case.  Under the number 1 will be located socket power supply router.  At the moment, it is not used, but access to it is provided in case it will be necessary to supply power only to the network component of the center, and to keep the computer off.  In normal mode, the power to the router is supplied from the computer's power supply unit - by luck, Zyxel is powered by 12V.  In the place indicated by 4, a toggle switch is installed to switch the power supply (a standard power supply unit of a router or a power supply unit of a computer), which is also used to reset the router. <br><br>  The router used has one unpleasant feature: a wi-fi connection often hangs, and you have to reset it periodically.  I talked for two weeks with the support of Zyxel, as a result of which they sent me a new firmware, on which the router does not hang yet.  That is a definite plus for me and for the reputation of the company. <br><br>  At the place marked with number 2, access to the network connectors of the router is provided.  Hole 3 on the case has already been and is great for installing the antenna.  Hole 5, made in the same way as hole 1, is used to fasten the plug of the TV antenna (I did not unscrew it at the time of shooting). <br><br>  The radio module of the mouse, as I said, is located in the front cover of the case (Fig. 5) and during assembly is shifted with a small piece of foam rubber for sealing and insulation.  The TV tuner is still near the hard drives and is held in this position by hard wires. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  For fixing the router, homemade wooden slides installed in the CD-ROM drive basket, as well as the simplest pressing mechanism made from a piece of board, are used. <br><br>  After assembly, we have the appearance, as in Figure 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/21/26/21263f960ce0891d135e971905ff253e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  6 <br><br>  As a result, received a combine, as they say, from what was.  Ubuntu is installed on the media center, a web server, a file server, a torrent client are raised.  I checked the TV tuner and I'm currently streaming streaming. <br><br>  There is an extra (albeit only) nineteen-inch LCD monitor at home, which is planned to be used as a ‚ÄúTV‚Äù in the bedroom or in the kitchen. <br><br>  There are still many thoughts on how to continue the job.  From the nearest plans: output to the front panel of the input case of the TV tuner and IR sensor to control the center from the console, as well as replacing the motherboard and processor with more productive ones. <br><br>  Photos separately (clickable): <br> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6f/df/6fdfeda5fbbf6af64575b1df561623c7.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9b/3d/9b3d110469275c84cb8297df4883b85b.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bf/5b/bf5b3675302762384e3ceabdd6e0abad.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/76/027693fbb33dc40d8a956372f8312a31.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cc/f4/ccf437c22ed3a267ac6801edbb8a7eeb.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/78/93/7893955445d976a7f14ed40cec17c34e.jpg"></a> <a href="" title="Zoom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c2/c2/c2c2726933c06431fc0f637120aef8c6.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98712/</a></p>
