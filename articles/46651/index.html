It's about 3M. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Story</b> <br>  3M was founded in the town of Two Harbors, Minnesota in 1902, initially as a mining company, and later created processing plants.  Currently, 3M has grown into a diversified tech company with a wide geography of activity, with headquarters in the USA in Saint Paul, Minnesota <br><br>  <b>What is famous for</b> <br>  Among the most notable inventions of the company can be identified appearance in the early 1920s.  the world's first waterproof sandpaper, which reduced the dust content in the air of automaker's workshops.  In 1925, masking tape was invented ‚Äî an innovative step towards diversifying production and the first of many self-adhesive tapes with the Scotch¬Æ trademark.  In subsequent years, technical progress led to the emergence of Scotch¬Æ cellophane tape for sealing boxes, and the 1980s were marked by the invention of sticky note pads for Post-it¬Æ Notes. <br><br>  <b>Interesting Facts</b> <br>  At the dawn of activity, attempts to create sandpaper with anorthosite mineral were not successful, so it was decided to purchase another mineral, the Spanish garnet, after which the sales of sandpaper went uphill. <br>  However, not everything was so smooth with sandpaper.  After a while, a complaint came from the customer, saying that spraying is pouring from your sandpaper!  As a result of the investigation, it turned out that he had been soaked with oil when importing the mineral, so he did not stick on paper.  In order not to cancel the order and not to lose money, it was decided to fry the mineral so that the oil evaporated, which was successfully done. <br>  This fact is considered the starting point in the development of 3M R &amp; D directions.
