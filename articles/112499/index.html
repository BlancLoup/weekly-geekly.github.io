Being patriots, we would be happy to work for the good of our country, but in Russia it is simply not in demand.  According to the 2009 data, the Ministry of Health and Social Development spent <b>692.3</b> million rubles on the introduction and development of information technologies in medicine, that is only <b>1.31% of the</b> annual budget.

      We continuously compare ourselves with America: we plant maize, or we change the system of final exams.  But successful initiatives skip past.  With the general computerization of public institutions and the availability of the Internet, we have neither electronic cards, nor a single database of medicines with detailed information.  Therefore, our specialists work ‚Äúto the west‚Äù, and in Russia money from the budget of the city and country is ‚Äúsettled in‚Äù and is deposited in someone's large pockets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In terms of IT language does not turn to say the words of our popular satirist, " <i>Well, stupid these Americans</i> ."  After health care reform in the United States, an extensive computer program was developed that allows you to maintain not just an electronic card for each person who requested help, but to create a huge database of patients.  Innovation has benefited both patients and staff.  Each nurse had a personal electronic signature, according to which, when he came to work and opened the program, all tasks for the day were visible: what medicines are necessary for each patient, what appointments are from the doctor, besides, there are details on each client of the clinic.  For example, if it is a psychiatric hospital, the program will warn the nurse that the patient Smith should not be given medicine in green tubes, because he considers them life-threatening. <br><br>  Moreover, in the American hospitals every injection, taking pills, droppers are scanned and recorded in the already mentioned program.  It is impossible to make a mistake, the scanner reads the name and dosage, if the set and the read are not the same - the system gives an error.  After giving the medicine, the nurse notes the patient's reaction to the drug in the program, and this helps the doctor to adjust the therapy in a timely manner.  The records are extremely punctual, you can track the actions of any of the nurses for all the time, you can find out what medicine was injected to a person 5 years ago on September 14 at 9 am.  In case of any problems with the central server of the program, it starts to work offline, retaining all the data and settings - a very high degree of reliability ensures that patients will be provided with everything they need in time no matter what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="vBulletin tracker"><br>  A person‚Äôs electronic card records all data about him: what diseases he suffered, at what age, what pulse and what pressure was at admission to the hospital three years ago, what medicines were prescribed in the hospital, which should be taken continuously, doses for outpatient treatment, and the like intelligence.  If necessary, the documents are instantly sent between clinics and hospitals in the country.  There is also the largest database distributed throughout the country: it collects data from other databases and may be useful for all medical professionals.  It describes in detail all the diseases, methods of treatment, the experience of using certain drugs for a similar disease, the patient‚Äôs response, and for controversial points, the percentage ratio of doctors who acted in one way or another in similar cases is given. <br><br>  We in Russia can only dream about such a thing, well, if we were placed in hospital through an acquaintance or lucky with a nurse.  And if not, lie down - be patient.  It is not surprising that compatriots prefer to self-medicate, seek advice on the Internet, and as soon as there is a financial opportunity to go to a paid clinic or even improve their health abroad. <br><br><img src="http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/7250/medwc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Repair in some of our clinics is such that without the scenery you can safely make a horror movie.  In the queue you can stand as much as in the Moscow traffic jam, boorish nurses in the windows of the registry and paper cards with glued leaves, falling apart from time aesthetically complement the general chaos.  And also doctors, who were presented by representatives of pharmaceutical companies from all sides, doctors, who often prescribe drugs, without thinking about how they suit a particular patient on the basis of his history, doctors who try to get rid of patients as soon as possible. <br><br>  And after all, the Russians, too, could count on at least partial automation of processes in hospitals.  There are funds for such developments - this confirms that, despite the global crisis, the budget of the national project ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù has practically not been cut.  But what's the point?  The official media shouts about the successes, the massive discoveries of various "health centers", but in St. Petersburg the usual visit to the doctor in the clinic or even more so getting into the hospital immediately shows all the successes of the domestic health care. <br><br>  Moreover, the Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development recently published an application for competitive creation of a social network for medical staff, where <b>55 million rubles</b> would go to <b>unique content</b> , and companies that won the tender would be given only <b>16 days</b> to implement.  Thank God, they didn‚Äôt manage to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù the budget, as the competition was canceled due to mass public discontent in the blogosphere. <br><br>  The only sign of informatization now is self-recording kiosks, as well as a <a href="http://samosapis.ru/">website</a> that, at the request of patients, provides remote preliminary reservation of medical techniques in municipal clinics and at home, in regional hospitals in the direction of medical institutions, as well as in commercial clinics. <br><br><img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/9140/medd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For five years, 590 billion rubles were invested in the project, specifically in 2010 - 142 billion.  In 2010, the money was supposed to be spent on the prevention and control of such infections as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, HIV.  When will the informatization of health care facilities get into the priority directions?  After all, this would significantly reduce costs in the future: a large staff of the registry will not be needed, a huge amount of paper for keeping all bureaucratic records, the number of medical errors will decrease, the loss of cards and case histories will stop.  In general, on the scale of our vast country, the transition to the full computerization of medical institutions is the only way to provide decent medical care to people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112499/</a></p>
