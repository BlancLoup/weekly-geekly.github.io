  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Documents in the wires: EDO from MegaFon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the world's automakers considered that printing and delivery by courier to the dealership center of one package of documents costs about 580 rubles.  In the central office of the mobile operator of the big four, they conducted research and it turned out that they use about 420 packs of paper per month.  At the same time, even the most common Internet startup spends about 11 packs per month.  It is not difficult to calculate that the cost of document flow for any company is a significant amount that any manager would gladly have reduced. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/12a/e88/f2512ae88b314c63aa094e132b2b3561.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this case, no one took into account the time spent by employees in searching for documents required for work.  This problem is relevant even if only one person is involved in the document flow.  With the collective use of documents, it is aggravated many times and, finally, becomes practically unsolvable if the organization is geographically distributed.  Meanwhile, according to AIIM (Association for Information &amp; Image Management) calculations, an enterprise that produces an average of 100 document folders per week spends $ 18.7 thousand per year to recover lost documents.  Also, according to AIIM statistics, the average executor spends 2.5 hours a week searching for the necessary documents, and for clerks it takes 20-30% of working time. <br><br>  We should not forget that every year the Russian government introduces more and more improvements to its work, legislatively fixing the standards for the transfer of reports in electronic form using a digital signature.  For example, by order of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation of October 14, 2015 No. MMB-7-11 / 450 @, a new mandatory reporting form was introduced for organizations and individual entrepreneurs - 6-NDFL.  Moreover, to provide in paper form 6-NDFL can only those organizations and individual entrepreneurs who paid income to no more than 25 employees.  The rest is in electronic form only.  This means that electronic digital signatures (EDS) are now available in almost all serious organizations.  We did a survey in our previous article ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/306698/">What is a signature. From a drop of blood to an EDS</a> ) and more than half of our readers have already worked with a digital signature.

The growth of IT-technologies and ubiquitous computerization made it possible to reflect on the transition to fundamentally new management methods.  In some countries, the introduction of EDS has become a national task.  Thus, the e-government program was launched in the Estonian government already in 2002, when the Internet access in Estonia as a whole did not exceed 30% of the population.  To date, 98% of Estonian citizens use EDI when communicating with government agencies.  You can even vote in the parliamentary and presidential elections using a digital electronic signature.  You can also get an "electronic residency" and, for example, if you are a co-founder of a Russian-Estonian company, you can remotely receive an EDS and legally-signify documents all documents.  This is not only a convenience and time saving people, but also a significant reduction in costs for the government.  By average, the savings from the introduction of the SED in a more or less large organization can reach 95-97%.  For example, sending a document via EDI costs only a few rubles. <br><br>  Despite the significant lag of Russia from Western companies in this matter, the annual growth rate of the Russian market for SED, <a href="http://citforum.ru/consulting/docflow/market/article1.8.2002265.html">according to analysts</a> , is at least 30%.  The adoption of the law on electronic digital signature has created the legal basis for the widespread distribution of electronic document circulation.  According to Forrester Research, 38% of Fortune 500 companies consider the acquisition of an SED is critical to successful business. <br><br>  In Russia, SED systems have long existed, but these are mainly large-scale operators, such as ZAO PF SKB Kontur, which support the work of federal structures and large enterprises and with which it is difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to work.  Given the current realities, MegaFon has developed its <a href="http://doc.megafon.ru/">Electronic Document</a> Management Service (EDM) for the formation, signing and exchange of accounting and other documents within the company and between legal entities.  With the help of EDT, you can simplify the workflow of documents in the enterprise and increase the efficiency of the departments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2a/b41/f74/c2ab41f7476752223e731f0270ff2488.png"><br><br>  The Electronic Document Flow (EDM) service of PJSC MegaFon was launched in 2015 for corporate clients in the Stolichny and Central branches of the operator, and any client of the company could use it later.  Today, any legal entity can work with the cloud service, which was used by more than 500 organizations.  Previously, due to the cost and technical requirements, electronic signatures and legally significant document circulation were available only to large companies.  With the help of EDT, you can generate electronic acts, invoices and invoices in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the Federal Tax Service, as well as sign them with EDS and exchange them with other user companies. <br><br>  In Russia there are standards for all necessary operations for the use of EDM: encryption, hashing, electronic signature. <br><br>  1. Electronic signature and hashing are used to ensure the legal value of electronic documents through the use of electronic signature (ES): <br><br><ul><li>  GOST R 34.10-2012: Processes of formation and verification of electronic digital signature <br></li><li>  GOST R 34.11-2012: Hash function <br></li></ul><br>  The cryptographic strength of the encryption algorithm is based on the problem of discrete logarithm in a group of points of an elliptic curve.  At the moment there is no method for solving this problem at least with subexponential complexity.  For us it is important that the state recognizes it to be sufficiently robust. <br><br>  2. Encryption.  Ensuring confidentiality and integrity control of information through its encryption: <br><br><ul><li>  GOST 28147-89: Algorithm of cryptographic transformation <br></li></ul><br>  This is a block cipher with a simple Feistel structure, with a block size of 64 bits, a 256-bit key and 32 rounds, which was developed in the Soviet Union.  The algorithm has been extensively researched by leading experts in the field of cryptography, and all researchers have expressed that everything looks like it can be or should be safe.  There are a number of comments on his performance, Nicolas Courtois even reported successful attacks on this algorithm, but experts from CryptoPro rehabilitated him in the public eye. <br><br>  3. Protection of data transmission channels on the Internet.  For this task, TLS is used - the transport level security protocol, in which the GOST 28147-89 GOST algorithms described above and the hash according to GOST 34.11-2012 can be used.  This combination allows you to certify it in the FSB and FSTECK, which was done by the companies CryptoPro, Cryptocom, and VipNet in their SKPI. <br><br>  We actively develop Electronic document management only in the WEB interface, because the web is protected by security certificates and file sharing through these protocols is (relatively) safe.  Requirements for operators of electronic document management are very high and each company must have an appropriate license from the Federal Security Service, which gives the right to develop information systems and provide data encryption services.  A separate license is issued for the provision of communication services and data transmission.  Our basic operator is Kaluga Astral, it is used to provide a legally relevant EDI.  All data is stored inside the MegaFon network (not on the Internet), encryption is used throughout the site, which guarantees the security of your personal data.  Our security technologies meet all requirements, all data is backed up and we guarantee the uninterrupted operation of the service 24/7.  The maximum inaccessibility of the service in case of very serious accidents does not exceed 15 minutes. <br><br><h2>  EDS </h2><br>  To use the EDM, you need to have a qualified electronic signature and configure your computer to work with it.  The electronic signature is the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature, is governed by the law N63-FZ and is intended to determine the person who signed the electronic document.  It is possible to obtain a certificate of EDS in Russia at any of the Certification Authorities.  They are in every city.  <a href="http://www.minsvyaz.ru/ru/activity/govservices/2/">The current list of CA can be found on the website of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia</a> . <br><br>  After receiving the EDS, you need to purchase and install software that implements the information protection algorithms described above.  We recommend Crypto Pro.  This means cryptographic protection, through which the signing of documents on computers. <br><br>  CryptoPro is the leader in the distribution of cryptographic information protection and electronic signature tools in Russia.  The main products of the company are cryptographic information protection (CRPD) of CryptoPro CSP and the certification center of CryptoPro Pro TC.  Due to the support of the majority of mobile platforms and carriers of electronic signature, the majority of mobile solutions based on iOS, Android, and Windows8 using cryptography are embedded. <br><br>  Prices for the license can be found on the <a href="https://www.cryptopro.ru/">official website</a> .  Install and configure CryptoPro, as well as register your EDS in it is not difficult.  This has already been written a lot of instructions.  By the way, MegaFon continues to modify its SIM-cards by equipping them with a digital signature, which will allow them to quickly sign documents of any kind. <br><br>  In our interface, any qualified certificates are accepted, regardless of which certification authority issued them. <br><br><h2>  Problems of using EDS </h2><br>  Fraud when working with EDS is mainly related to the theft or physical use of the certificate by others.  This is most often due to improper storage of the token with the certificate and password from it.  Also, attackers often use the introduction of viruses on the PC of EDM users, for example, they substitute on the screen the text of the document that the user wants to sign. <br><br>  However, all these factors depend on the security of the interface in which the user works, and on whether the user himself complies with basic security measures when working with digital signature. <br><br><h1>  Work with EDI </h1><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  To register with the EDO (doc.megafon.ru) you need to fill out a form and get a confirmation to your email address.  It takes five minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75d/863/2af/75d8632afe46e44fdce49994d2a531dd.png"><br><br>  You can use the test period and try the service for 14 days. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4e/c2d/d61/e4ec2dd61f228767b5aec91671c70472.png"><br><br>  After installing the EDS you need to register it.  To do this, go to "Documents" and click "Receive and send" or in the "Settings" and "Service Management". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f54/a46/885/f54a4688599a1b9e55a64e04728f1c47.png"><br><br>  Choose your e-signature: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00b/68f/9f8/00b68f9f89734803e2164a636c89102e.png"><br><br>  And fill in the details of your company: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/539/d3d/cd0/539d3dcd020893e547caf2fb2765b041.png"><br><br><h3>  Add users and assign roles </h3><br>  After registering an EDS certificate, bring all the employees of the organization to the service through the ‚ÄúMy Company‚Äù menu, and also there you can add already known contractors who work in electronic document management. <br><br>  There are three user roles in EDM: Administrator, Operator, and Signer.  You can make sure that some of the employees can only create the necessary documents, and only sign to sign them and send counterparties to authorized persons.  For example, the chief accountant or business director. <br><br>  The administrator fills and edits the Company's details on the Portal, assigns roles and creates invitations between employees and contractors, manages electronic signature certificates in the company, as well as tariffs and a set of services. <br><br>  The operator generates and signs notices and notifications on receipt of documents. <br><br>  The signatory signs the documents to be sent or rejects them.  Also, the signatory may delete erroneously signed documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04c/057/af6/04c057af630a023c699279c2edcd6c1e.png"><br><br>  The administrator can invite the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab6/29a/577/ab629a57704671bdd1281980d5475311.png"><br><br>  Or find it among the already added to the EDM system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/9ef/59e/9de9ef59e2900fe8ebe573c30c1905ba.png"><br><br><h3>  Creating documents </h3><br>  Consider the process of creating an exchange of documents, for which, in fact, you and get yourself an EDM system.  There are two options for sending documents to the counterparty: either upload them or create them yourself in the interface.  The system itself will tell you if you do something wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b57/575/403/b575754038404ebf192e9da2bbb0a3e6.png"><br><br>  Let's try to create an invoice, invoice or act in the interface.  From the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù menu, you can also attach a contract and any other accompanying document to send it to the counterparty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/7ab/ead/7457abead4301150bda6f20c163f071f.png"><br><br>  If the system does not yet have your counterparty, then you can add it from the corresponding menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7f/a9b/34f/f7fa9b34f9d8a80f904e609764efdf0f.png"><br><br>  After preparing the document, it looks like this.  If everything is correct, then you can send through the operator EDM.  To start the process of signing a company, it is necessary to activate the EDM special operator service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e47/bd4/2ec/e47bd42ecc93b7df682913644d03e766.png"><br><br>  In addition, you can view and print the paper version of the document, as well as see its entire history.  Useful option for the manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89a/83c/d00/89a83cd008c14e498a403ee103500521.png"><br><br>  If you are working in an organization with the 1C system, then you can use a special automation module for processing formalized documents (TORG-12, acts of completed work and invoices) received or issued electronically. <br><br><h3>  Contacts </h3><br>  In the Contacts menu, all your contractors, employees and just contacts of people who work in the EDM system and with whom you exchange documents are collected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96c/535/234/96c535234f2409e1c2e048c0493ba79b.png"><br><br><h2>  Total: </h2><br>  We have tried to make the Electronic Document Management system of PJSC MegaFon as simple and understandable for users.  You will only need to carry out the initial setup and start working with it.  Of course, all your counterparties must also connect to the EDI. <br><br>  The advantages of using EDI include: <br><br><ul><li>  rejection of paper carriers and the associated savings in time and money for consumables and the maintenance of office equipment; <br></li><li>  secure way to exchange and store information, as well as organizing multi-level access for any of the company's employees; <br></li><li>  An operational way to find the right data, which is especially important for organizations working with large volumes of documentation. </li></ul><br>  In the ‚Äú <strong>Electronic Document Management</strong> ‚Äù system, you can quickly and free receive reporting documents for communication services. <br><br><ol><li>  No need to go monthly to MegaFon‚Äôs office. <br><br></li><li>  No interaction with the mail is required. <br><br></li><li>  No need to spend money on courier delivery. </li></ol><br>  What hinders the development of electronic document management in the organization: <br><br><ul><li>  well-established opinion on greater security of a paper document <br></li><li>  backdating of documents <br></li><li>  the need to train staff in electronic work. <br></li><li>  unavailability of other counterparties <br></li></ul><br>  EDO operators are trying to push companies, offering a convenient tool for finding contractors who are already ready to exchange documents electronically.  MegaFon is not lagging behind and we continue to work on improving the service and simplifying the interface.  Already today, the process of sending a document is quite simple, but we do not stop at what has been achieved and continue our research, striving to make our product as simple and convenient as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306696/</a></p>
