  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia 700 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  Today we would like to present you our new smartphone - <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/700%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-700-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtb9d850">Nokia 700</a> .  First of all, I would like to note that this device is the smallest smartphone on the market.  But, despite its diminutiveness, the Nokia 700 has a high-quality ‚Äúiron‚Äù component, which, coupled with the Nokia Belle system (and this is the first official smartphone with this OS in Russia), gives the device high performance.  However, first things first!  :) <br><br><h4>  Device design </h4><br>  The slim body is equipped with a 3.2-inch touchscreen, a rear camera and an external speaker located on the bottom of the smartphone. 
      <br>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/987/543/3c7/9875433c7a185c1fd5aa324f8518c46b.jpg"><br><br>  The screen, made by technology AMOLED ClearBlack, shows a juicy and bright picture even in the sun.  The display has a resolution of 640x360 pixels, which, with a diagonal of 3.2 inches, shows an excellent density of dots per inch (229), so simple mathematics also confirms the quality of the image (and against science, as they say, you can‚Äôt pause).  Protected display glass, created by technology Gorilla Glass. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The speaker is designed as a ledge and looks quite interesting.  From a practical point of view, this means that in whatever position the smartphone is located, the sound from the speakers will not overlap - and almost all mobile phones suffer from this.  Above the speakers there are three hardware keys: to accept and reject the call, and another one to call the navigation menu.  The thickness of the body is 9.7 millimeters, and the entire smartphone weighs only 92 grams.  It's funny going to the Nokia 700 to understand that in the pocket of jeans it is just imperceptible. <br><br>  The back cover of the smartphone, which hides the battery and the slots for SIM-cards and MicroSD-cards, is made of worn anodized aluminum: this surface leaves pleasant tactile sensations.  On the back cover is a 5-megapixel LED-flash, slightly recessed into the case - so as not to scratch the surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4e/37a/452/b4e37a452d9d5398de436203317cad89.jpg"><br><br>  In the right side of the case there are quite thin volume control keys, the lock key of the smartphone, as well as a key for quick activation of the camera.  The lock key has a nice feature: if you hold it down for three to four seconds, the LED flash is activated, thus acting as a flashlight.  :) <br><br>  On top of the case are the micro USB port, a standard 3.5 mm mini-jack for headphones, and a charger connector (while the smartphone also charges perfectly from the micro USB). <br><br><h4>  Nokia belle </h4><br>  Of course, the operating system is one of the most important parts of a smartphone.  Nokia Belle, installed on the Nokia 700, is the successor to Symbian Anna OS.  However, instead of the next Symbian ^ 3 update, due to a number of fundamental changes, Nokia Belle is sometimes perceived as a completely new OS. <br><br>  If you have previously been familiar with Symbian Anna smartphones, by launching the Nokia 700 you will first notice the difference in widgets - they have changed in Nokia Belle.  Having listened to the comments of users and following the general development of technologies, in the new OS the number of widgets has been increased, and their sizes have ceased to be fixed.  Thanks to the various sizes of widgets, it has become much easier to customize desktops to fit your needs, raising the bar for ease of use with your smartphone.  Compared to Symbian Anna, the number of desktops has doubled to six.  And now for each desktop, you can set your background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dde/e9b/06d/ddee9b06d08158ecc2a400456177df10.png"><br><br>  Switching between desktops is as smooth as possible.  Also multitasking works perfectly, all thanks to the good optimization of the Nokia Belle OS and the gigahertz processor. <br><br>  The main screen has a drop-down menu that appears when you slide down from the status bar (this is the same panel with the clock and signal reception level).  This menu provides access to the most important communication functions of the phone, such as managing WiFi and Bluetooth connections, as well as notifications of missed calls and unread messages. <br><br><h5>  Mail client </h5><br>  The email client at Nokia Belle has predefined settings for accounts on Gmail, Yandex, Mail.ru, Rambler and a number of other, less common in Russia, mail services.  In the client settings there is an opportunity for each account to customize the schedule and frequency of downloading letters.  That is, the mail can be configured so that it does not disturb you at night or on weekends - not all of us are workaholics. <br><br><h5>  Microsoft Office </h5><br>  At the beginning of next year, a package of business applications from Microsoft will be available for Nokia Belle.  It will include a collective Lync messenger for quick meeting organization, OneNote electronic notes, a client for accessing SharePoint files called Document Connection and PowerPoint Broadcaster - an application for viewing presentations stored on a PC.  After some time, the native Word, Excel and Powerpoint applications will be released exclusively for Belle. <br><br><h5>  Navigation </h5><br>  As with all Nokia smartphones with GPS, this model has free pedestrian and car navigation.  Traditionally, all maps can be downloaded to the device‚Äôs memory, so navigation can work offline.  But if you want to receive up-to-date information about traffic jams and plan a route taking them into account (this functionality is currently available only in Moscow), you will still need access to the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/077/d22/4dc/077d224dc837c94d3eeeb3c96666e314.jpg"><br><br>  Nokia Navigator has inherited the functions of a full-fledged car navigator.  It has step-by-step voice prompts, you can customize the map view by choosing between the top view, 3D, satellite.  Maps are superimposed with public transport lines and subway maps. <br><br>  The smartphone uses A-GPS, so the current location is determined very quickly.  For more accurate positioning, the built-in compass is used. <br><br><h5>  Camera </h5><br>  Due to the change in the OS concept in Nokia Belle, the camera interface has been significantly updated.  The buttons for activating the flash and selecting modes were brought to the screen, so that Nokia 700 owners will not have to open an additional menu to activate these functions. <br><br>  Due to the small size of the smartphone, a conventional 5 MP module without autofocus, made using the EDOF technology, is used as a camera.  Such a camera is ideal for recording video: Nokia 700 shoots HD movies with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels and a frequency of 30 fps of excellent quality, and image stabilization is used.  Such videos are not ashamed to look not only on the smartphone itself, but also on the computer.  The sound of the video is also at a height: thanks to the hardware noise suppressor, the sound track of the footage shot even in very noisy places does not turn into incoherent noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/669/b07/ac3/669b07ac3424236859595d52bd762ac2.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Multimedia </h5><br>  The Nokia 700 has a music player and video player that has been transformed since Symbian Anna, as well as an FM radio with support for RDS stations. <br><br>  The music player interface has changed in accordance with the Nokia Belle guides, so below now the buttons ‚Äúrepeat tracks‚Äù and ‚Äúplay tracks in random order‚Äù have been added to the two standard buttons ‚Äúback‚Äù and ‚Äúmenu‚Äù.  The player can show large album covers, sorts tracks by title, artist, album.  There is a horizontal version of the display of covers - all this is already familiar. <br><br>  The radio, when first started, scans the FM band.  Of course, you can put names on the found radio stations.  There is no opportunity to add your favorite radio stations to your favorites, but you can move the necessary stations up the list. <br><br>  To control the music player and FM-radio there are built-in widgets that can be brought to the main screen. <br><br><h5>  Other communications and memory </h5><br>  As mentioned above, the Nokia 700 has a traditional Wi-Fi module that supports b / g / n standards, which is traditional for all smartphones, and you can manage connections via the drop-down menu in the status bar on top of the screen. <br><br>  The Nokia 700 uses Bluetooth 3.0 + EDR, which provides a higher data transfer rate if the receiving device supports the same technology - and most modern devices, fortunately, support it. <br><br>  The smartphone is equipped with micro-USB 2.0 Full Speed, when connected to other devices, you can choose one of several usage modes: PC Suite, Image Print, Media Player, USB Flash drive.  When connected to a computer in USB mode, the flash drive will be available to both the internal memory of the device with a capacity of 2 GB and the microSD card connected to the phone.  Using the USB to micro-USB adapter to the Nokia 700, you can connect other USB-devices: USB flash drives and even hard drives formatted in FAT32. <br><br>  The amount of RAM in the Nokia 700 is 512 MB. <br><br><h5>  NFC support </h5><br>  The Nokia 700 has an embedded NFC chip that is supported at the operating system level.  Despite the fact that this technology has just started to gain momentum, now you can send photos, videos and contacts from one smartphone to another via NFC.  In addition, Nokia has <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/700/accessories%3Faction%3Daccessorysearch%26category%3Dheadsets%26cid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-headset700-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtd23dd6">a number of</a> <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/700/accessories%3Faction%3Daccessorysearch%26category%3Dentertainment%26cid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-accent700-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmt45b035">accessories</a> with NFC support: these are headsets and an external Nokia Play 360 speaker with very high-quality sound.  Thanks to the new technology, these accessories mate with the Nokia 700 in just a fifth of a second, significantly ahead of Bluetooth connectivity. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  By virtue of its miniature and attractiveness caused by the non-standard design of the device, the Nokia 700 seems to be a female smartphone (perhaps because the smartphone in the red case was used for the review).  However, the more you work with it, the more you realize that this is still quite a serious device that meets a variety of user requests - just very stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9e/2f9/dc2/d9e2f9dc2d4465b5c8805cd3ee279cb4.jpg"><br><br>  Geeks, of course, are unlikely to suit such a smartphone, if only because of a small display.  But a lot of people who need the phone mainly for calls and performing other typical functions, this smartphone will delight with new discoveries every day: the little <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/700%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-700-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtb9d850">Nokia 700</a> has a lot of various possibilities thanks to the Nokia Belle OS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135524/</a></p>
