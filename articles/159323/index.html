Once I had the idea to buy a USB flash drive, from which it would not be scary to climb into the fire or into the water, or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/storelab/blog/150413/">rub off</a> with it in a washing machine.  Found on the Internet and things for a thousand rubles and two.  It is not enough money, the toad strangled, it was necessary to invent something. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I only have a soldering station for the tools, although an ordinary Soviet soldering iron is enough in an amicable way.  And more, <b>under the cut a lot of pictures</b> ! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  We are buying </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6d/be0/26b/d6dbe026b76199f325620efa7af2a89d.jpg" align="right">  For a start, I bought such a <a href="http://www.splav.ru/goodsdetail.aspx%3Fgid%3D20120516133543049590">container</a> in Alloy.  It is made of aluminum and, supposedly, quite durable.  The walls are a millimeter thick on the shiny side and a half millimeter with blue.  It costs <b>55</b> rubles.

      For sealing in the store Fix-Price, a 20-watt thermogun was bought, which, though low-powered and very fragile, is enough for our tasks.  He cost me <b>37</b> rubles.  In the radio shop near the house were also bought several rods for a pistol.  It took only a quarter of a rod, you can not even be considered, but to be honest, we say that it costs <b>10</b> rubles. <br><br>  On the inside, we disassembled a <a href="">Transcend JetFlash T5</a> flash drive for 2 GB.  Specially took not very big, so it was not a pity.  For the connector, I also purchased a usb-plug for <b>20</b> with a compression on the cable. <br><br>  As a result, I got <b>350</b> rubles. <br><br><h1>  Putting it all together </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b1/f7a/714/9b1f7a714a2b8eaa7815b1e5914538dd.jpg"><br>  I apologize in advance for the pictures, but there was nothing near the phone. <br><br>  For a start we deal with the flash drive.  We disassemble it in any accessible way, it is all held up with glue.  When you take it off the plate with a lever-button, be careful.  It rests on gum.  As a result, we have an almost monolithic construction in our hands: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68b/63f/cfb/68b63fcfb5bfa172b7f09a6ba860cf79.jpg"><br><br>  These four contacts are a rather fragile design, I had a sad experience when they broke off, taking with them half of the flash drive.  That is why we will strengthen them with a full usb-plug. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/748/c5e/3e3/748c5e3e3e27031c80d4b57a4685770b.jpg"><br><br>  We take any four wiring (for example, two pairs from the power cord) and solder them on one side to the USB flash drive, on the other to the back of the usb-plug with glue to make something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/53d/117/5fa/53d1175fac88bbcc68291d9f5a445f24.jpg"><br><br>  Then we warm the gun thoroughly and fill the entire sealed container with glue and quickly insert the USB flash drive into it.  If something did not work with hot melt, then it can be melted even with a soldering iron.  He stink and will not burn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb9/6be/da5/cb96beda573af409f5ea8578015494db.jpg"><br><br>  The flash drive is ready! <br><br><h1>  Now tests </h1><br>  We will conduct the reading test as follows: we will write an archive on the flash drive with the latest Linux samples and we will compare md5 after each experiment. <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">gamepad@GamePad-C1L:/media/gamepad/Transcend$ md5sum * 7c959e3e0b6559ca3f1b7bf86fdc6370 linux-3.6.7.tar.bz2 gamepad@GamePad-C1L:/media/gamepad/Transcend$</code> </pre> <br><br><h3>  Glass of water </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04f/3ae/3f0/04f3ae3f0ab773873915ad0cbe3cad45.jpg"><br><br>  Well, so not interesting.  It is written that the container itself is sealed.  Let's do this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d1/dab/9ae/0d1dab9aed2090e233b2cfc4d51c09de.jpg"><br><br>  So, take out, test ... Everything works!  Already good. <br><br><h3>  Microwave </h3><br>  One of the conditions for passing the tests was resistance to short-term, but rather powerful electromagnetic radiation.  So we put it in the microwave: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a36/8e3/1d3/a368e31d36ec5b56e151d37e4ca25e58.jpg"><br>  The time is 30 seconds.  Honestly, I thought my kilowatt chef would explode.  The steel ring on the case of the flash drive sparks not childish.  Got a media in the kitchen gloves.  As soon as it is cold, we insert it into the computer, the usb hub blinks happily with a light bulb.  Everything is working.  The reading test passes with a bang! <br><br><h3>  Drop out the window </h3><br>  Yes, we collected this flash drive, tortured with water and terrible rays and now just took it thrown out the window ... from the 15th floor.  I hit the grass (I had to throw it in the asphalt). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/897/959/d3a/897959d3a437fd05b9166844606a0bcb.jpg"><br><br>  I go downstairs, I find the poor fellow in the grass, I carry him home.  I connect - it works.  MD5 is correct. <br><br>  After that I decided to test for recording.  I wrote down the ubuntu boot image on it.  On another computer I boot from it.  Successfully. <br><br><h3>  UPD: Boil </h3><br>  After the publication, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ravmos/" class="user_link">Ravmos</a> suggested a brilliant idea: boil a flash drive.  This is what I do.  Poured hot water into the saucepan, brought to a boil, threw the device, and cooked for 5 minutes.  It turned out a wonderful soup that has not lost a single gram of its information value: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5cc/b52/0bf/5ccb520bfa21b3a486644b3701fbf6f4.jpg"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to get it with my hands, I threw it into the sink and under cold water, like macaroni.  After connecting to a computer, it turned out that the flash drive is in a good condition, all the tests go perfectly well (already put it on a laptop ubuntu). <br>  Here is such a small experience in the sterilization of drives (unfortunately, it helps only from real non-computer viruses :-)). <br><br><h3>  UPD2: Cooling-heating </h3><br>  A small simulation of the winter mode of operation, when we bring the device home, and quickly heat it up to room temperature. <br>  The flash drive lay for 20 minutes in the freezer in freezing mode, then it was quickly heated in a basin of hot water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfb/672/997/bfb6729975cf7c89aaec7032a6e31215.jpg"><br><br>  After this experiment, no one was hurt, the data as read, and continued to read.  Record also no complaints. <br><br>  That's all!  Thus, we collected a protected USB flash drive for 350 rubles and as a bonus we have a penny glue gun.  Now our data will be safe.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159323/</a></p>
