  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shop-Proxy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I, like many of you, often use the services of various online stores.  Conveniently, when you do not have to lose your time in traffic jams to buy some little thing - they will bring everything straight into your hands.  For the time being we will leave alone the quality of services and goods in (some, fortunately) similar establishments.  I constantly encounter another problem, and today I got the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to solve it ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that I live in the Moscow suburbs.  Only 5 km from the Great Ring.  And this for most stores is enough not to treat me as a customer.  I can understand them - as long as there are so many unrequited clients inside the Moscow Ring Road, there is no point in spending money on servicing the Moscow region.  If for Moscow it is enough to buy a single courier and this will end the transportation costs, then for departure, for example, to my city, you need to buy an additional ticket for a suburban bus.  Already extra costs.  By the way, this situation is more true for small purchases (computer hardware, portable photo-video-audio, etc.) Because, if you carry, say, a washing machine, you still have to load it into a car, and without it the difference, go to the other end of Moscow or drive a few more kilometers to the suburbs.  Just shipping will be more expensive, not by the way.  Once again, this is important - this is not about the rise in prices for delivery of small equipment outside the Moscow Ring Road, but about <i>its absence in principle</i> . <br><br>  How is this problem usually solved?  That's right - looking for the opportunity to be inside the "service area" during the delivery period.  If you work in Moscow - excellent.  Courier will arrive to you during business hours.  If you have a relative, acquaintance, ... in the same place - this is worse, because  it is better to buy the thing personally (see, check, and in general ‚Äúif you want to do something well, do it yourself‚Äù), but also an option.  Otherwise, you have to either refuse to buy, or look for extreme options (for example, meeting in the subway at exactly the stipulated time - haha, when did the courier come somewhere at exactly the stipulated time?).  Even for the regions there is a solution - most of the stores use transport companies - serious organizations that will pick up the goods from the warehouse, draw up the documents, then load-take-bring-unload right at your feet.  Everything is very solid, but expensive (how many people, and everyone wants to eat) and for a long time (bureaucracy, s). <br><br>  It occurred to me that the problem has a fairly simple solution.  Imagine that there is a certain mini-warehouse (proxy) that is located inside the Moscow Ring Road, where regular courier delivery operates (usually the next day and often for free), where a person sits who will receive the goods and pay with a courier, and where you can drive at a convenient time for you and pick up your goods.  Firstly, it is simple, and therefore reliable.  If there are several such warehouses, competition will arise between them, and those who mow will soon die.  Secondly, it is fast and convenient for the end user.  Thirdly, it is much cheaper than other options. <br>  Speaking of money.  I think that for maximum security, it makes sense to work on a 50% prepayment.  Those.  you place an order, notify the proxy and transfer to it (electronic money, for example) 50% of the cost.  From a legal point of view, by this you accept an offer with a number of items on the reimbursement of the costs of services rendered for the purchase of goods, etc.  Upon receipt, if everything is OK, you pay the balance amount.  Naturally, the cost of this whole process is increased by the proxy commission.  But it will not be very great.  Why?

      This is the highlight of the idea :) If you think who could be such a proxy?  It is rather troublesome for a private person (to keep in his apartment a warehouse of other people's, sometimes expensive things, not everyone agrees) and it is difficult from a financial point of view - you need to look for a 50% balance over and above the advance payment received.  Creating a separate business will not pay off, or the commission will be so high that no one will use it.  The ideal solution, in my opinion, is to provide a proxy service by another online store, which firstly has its own available office warehouse (i.e., it works with the Pickup delivery method), on the other hand, there are enough competent employees who are able to receive goods and evaluate its quality and efficiency, and on the third - the necessary financial and legal resources to ensure this activity.  Such a service can be an additional bonus for the store itself, giving it not so much additional profit as popularity and popularity in the eyes of customers. <br><br>  It may seem that this service is already there and it is called ‚Äúgoods for order‚Äù.  But this is not exactly for several reasons.  First: the store has a certain range of categories of goods with which it works.  For example, a computer store will not deliver kitchen equipment to you, even under the order.  The second: in order to sell something, even under the order, you need to fill the catalog with all possible goods that can only occur to the buyer, which is unrealistic.  And third: when you choose the product in the original online store, you pay attention to its price (if you transfer this task to the proxy manager, then the price is unlikely to be the best in the market), a set of options, warranty conditions and much more.  All these nuances, making, on the one hand, a difficult choice, on the other hand, allow to take into account your specific tastes and needs, which is almost impossible to achieve by transferring the choice to another person. <br><br>  I look forward to constructive criticism and your suggestions, especially from people "in the subject." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42526/</a></p>
