On the Internet, this problem has already been discussed, and was apparently connected with an incorrect version of the update, which got on some phones.  Specifically, he stopped seeing WiFi, a cellular network and an SD card, and rebooted every 3 minutes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  HTC service </h4><br>  In the HTC support service, I was rightly recommended to contact the service center, where I had warranty service, as my phone turned out to be ‚Äúfor sale in Tanzania‚Äù, and, as explained to me by HTC support service, the engineers of the Russian HTC HTC would still not They were able to correctly reflash it back.  This is where my interaction with HTC support has been completed.

      At the same time, I very well appreciate the work of the employee with whom I communicated, I could see the desire to help solve my problem. <br><br><h4>  Servicephone </h4><br>  But the guarantee center, to which I had the misfortune to be attributed, causes and causes in me a stormy indignation by their methods of work, and especially by evading it. <br><br><h5>  Connection </h5><br>  Over the past 2 weeks I managed to feel well the degree of accessibility of communication with this service center.  Namely: <br><br>  To the address <a href="http://www.servicephone.ru/">www.servicephone.ru</a> , as well as on the warranty card, the telephone number (only) is indicated, which is ‚ÄúOFF or out of the access zone‚Äù <b>on all</b> business days <b>during the whole day</b> .  This happens 1-2 times a week.  On other working days, the telephone is in such a state about a third of the working time, and with due diligence it is still possible to call. <br><br><h5>  The history of my conversion: </h5><br>  On August 11, I took the phone to Servicephone.  There I passed it to the girl (she is also a telephone operator, in general, the entire external interface of the company), indicating that the reason for the appeal is ‚Äúupdate to 2.2‚Äù, and that they are required to simply return the phone to the previous OS version, or upgrade to 2.2 correctly, additionally saying that I have already saved all my personal data. <br><br>  She went with him upstairs to the master, and when she returned, she said that "this is a software problem, and the <b>master cannot do this.</b> "  That is, by this I was denied warranty service, apparently, in the calculation that I would say ‚Äúokay‚Äù, and leave.  <i>And, by the way, it would be better for me to do that then :)</i> But then I thought otherwise. <br><br>  I had to press her, indicating that they are the guarantee center, and I have a guarantee case, and they are obliged to take the phone, after which she agreed to take it.  Despite my request to indicate in the acceptance sheet that the cause of the problem (‚Äúthe phone restarts‚Äù) was ‚ÄúOS update‚Äù, and all I need from them is ‚Äúreinstall the correct version of OS on the phone‚Äù, <b>this was not done</b> .  But she found a scratch on the corner of the case, which I would only see under a good magnifying glass, and brought it under the proud name ‚Äúchip in the lower part of the case‚Äù.  Well, okay, her right. <br><br>  Within 2 (two!) Weeks, I called the ‚ÄúServicephone‚Äù every 2 days and received the answer ‚Äúcall back in 2-3 days‚Äù, although, as it turned out later, no one worked with my phone until August 25. <br><br><h6>  Climax </h6><br>  On August 25 (yesterday), I once again got through to Servicefon.  I was told that ‚Äúthey are engaged in it, but they don‚Äôt know what to do with it (the phone), since you asked to save your data,‚Äù although I was just the opposite, I clearly said that the data had long been stored. <br><br>  In the end, they recommended that I call back in a couple of hours, explaining that everything will probably be ready.  But neither yesterday throughout the rest of the day, nor today, August 26, from the very morning their phone is again in the ‚ÄúDISABLED OR OUTSIDE ACCESS‚Äù state. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  I am deeply convinced that many of the problems of Russia and of humanity in general are caused by such an attitude to their work and to people, as in the center ‚ÄúServicephone‚Äù.  I hope I‚Äôll get my Desire back soon, but how many more people can run into them like that? <br><br>  I think maybe HTC could do something about it?  At least in the information key, to protect people from this danger. <br><br>  What do you think, what else can you do to <br><br>  a) act on Servicephone, maybe they can learn from mistakes? <br>  b) warn people against contacting them (I, for example, bought Desire from an online store, and did not know which center would be the guarantee) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102714/</a></p>
