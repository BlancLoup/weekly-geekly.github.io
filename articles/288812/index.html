  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Before the publication of secret correspondence of US diplomats, Wikileaks were hacked.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several days now, the hype around the Wikileaks resource, which regularly publishes secret and not-so-state US documents that hardly any of the authorities of this country would like to see published, does not abate.  The fact is that Julian Essendzh, the permanent project manager, promised to publish something that should "change history."  This was done - the resource posted online more than a quarter of a million letters from US diplomats working in different countries. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This correspondence, according to those who have already looked at the documents, concerns data on US policy towards many countries, including the leaders of these countries (some CIS countries, including Russia, are involved here).  Before you publish the documentation on your website, the Wikileaks management contacted the editors of such famous newspapers as El Pais, Le Monde, Speigel, Guardian and The New York Times, providing the most important of the published documents.  As a result, the latter, besides the site Wikileaks, were also on the sites of these newspapers. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that the US government has repeatedly called upon Essenge to think again and not publish all these documents.  The last attempt to change something was followed by representatives of the US government just a few hours before online documents appeared.  In addition, the United States warned the diplomatic services of countries friendly to this country about the proposed publication of secret correspondence of diplomats.  It was repeatedly stated that the actions of the head of Wikileaks endanger many lives, to which Essendj responded that the United States is simply afraid of public disclosure because it will have to be responsible for its actions.

      In addition to the United States, the published documents relate to the UK, Russia, Canada, Israel and Turkey.  In total, the Web was posted 251,287 documents, of which 16,652 are secret. <br><br>  Shortly before the publication of documents, Essendzh reported that Wikileaks carried out a large-scale DDOS attack, as a result of which the site was for some time inaccessible to users of the resource.  Among other things, the head of Wikileaks said that, in his opinion, this attack was carried out by the US government, but DDOS does not change anything, since many of the documents planned for publication were sent to the editorial offices of the world's largest newspapers.  Wikileaks is currently unavailable, at least for me. <br><br>  Well, we are waiting for the development of events, all interested can stock up on popcorn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288812/</a></p>
