The last six months, the LinguaLeo team has analyzed user behavior and preferences in learning English.  Based on this data, we have improved the product and developed several new features.  As a result, today we are ready to announce three cool tools that will be useful both for self-study and for those who learn English in groups.  Each of them takes into account the needs of the user and aims to achieve tangible results in a short time.  So what are these tools? <br><br>  Firstly, now each user can <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/glossary/wordSets">create</a> and publish themed word sets on LinguaLeo.  You can share them with everyone or send a link to the set to someone alone.  Secondly, now all studied sets of words can be conducted through training the <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/training">brainstorm</a> .  It is designed so that the user quickly remembers the meaning and spelling of words.  Third, you can now learn English in LinguaLeo in a <a href="http://lingualeo.com/ru/partnership/corporate">group</a> .

      Under the cut, we will tell you what happened and how it works. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Create and publish themed word sets on LinguaLeo </h2><br><br>  <i>Situation one:</i> you are a fan of an English-language series, any fashion movement or your profession.  What are you interested in?  Perhaps street racing, zoology or makapom.  Create a set of words with the appropriate name and words.  For example, one of our users can now retell the storyline of the series ‚ÄúThe Game of Thrones‚Äù without any problems, after creating such a thematic set: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06c/333/149/06c33314946516cd51f29aa24e4a0210.png"><br><h6>  Thematic set of words from the user of the service </h6><br><br>  <i>Situation two:</i> you attend language courses or English is your core subject.  On the threshold of vocabulary dictation or test, create a set of words in the service, go through a brainstorm-training and feel like a god!  How to do it: select the ‚ÄúMy Words‚Äù tab in the ‚Äú <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/glossary/learn">Words and Phrases</a> ‚Äù section and create a set of words on a specific topic.  About the training will tell separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68a/93c/8be/68a93c8be9d0be044705952c72b58a6d.png"><br><h6>  Personal Account: word sets </h6><br><br>  Now everyone can create a set of words on the subject of interest to him and share it with friends.  In the future, it will be possible to send a set for moderation, after which it will be available to all existing 8,000,000 users!  Then we plan to automatically publish these sets with the possibility of user voting and navigation on topics. <br><br><h2>  Learn words in brainstorm training </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/cd9/91b/0d1cd991b0b0c1b24ae8fc260076848a.png"><br><h6>  Workout Page </h6><br><br>  The best result in the study of new words gives an integrated approach.  You need to remember the meaning, spelling and sound, and then repeat the exercise after a while.  With this approach, words are remembered quickly and permanently.  Given this, we created a special training <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/training/wordMix">brainstorm</a> .  In fact, this is an exercise program that gives a tangible result after its first passing.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2a/c20/88f/f2ac2088fdfdc5ea3b959e6ee77d991d.png"><br><h6>  The process of learning new words </h6><br><br>  The secret of quick memorization is simple.  It consists in intensive study of small groups of words.  In one session, you will learn 6 words.  First you memorize the translation, then the spelling and on the last exercise you recognize it by ear.  Training continues until you succeed, having correctly completed all the exercises with each word.  We will keep the cases in which there were mistakes so that you can return to them the next day.  This is the first implementation of interval repetition, which will soon be developed. <br><br>  The plans are to improve the user error correction algorithm, as well as train the memory.  In other words, the service will take into account the incorrect execution and consistently explain the spelling or value with hints.  There will also be taken into account the moment when you ‚Äúforget‚Äù the word: in a three-day, weekly or three-weekly time period.  All data will be analyzed during the construction of the algorithm, and the user will eventually receive the most suitable program for him. <br><br><h2>  We create our group on LinguaLeo and add colleagues and brothers in the workshop </h2><br><br>  The third tool is aimed at simultaneously improving the language skills of several users.  Ideal for training company employees and group course students.  In the group version, you can assign an administrator who sets tasks and monitors the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ece/c28/3d9/ecec283d92bcab22dd003e2484fba500.png"><br><h6>  Group Admin page on LinguaLeo </h6><br><br>  <i>Situation one: the</i> company enters the international market, and its employees need to learn phrases and expressions of business correspondence and terms related to the company profile.  In this case, you can assign the HR-manager as an administrator, and he will assign tasks in accordance with the objectives of the company, for example, taking a <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/course/busenglish">business English</a> <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/course/grammar">course</a> and a <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/course/grammar">grammar course for the advanced</a> . <br><br>  <i>Situation two:</i> an English teacher who teaches several students at the same level.  Ask your teacher to create a group for you on LinguaLeo.  You can receive and perform tasks remotely.  The teacher, in turn, will be able to monitor your progress and adjust the program. <br><br>  Now the group version is at the <a href="http://lingualeo.com/ru/partnership/corporate">beta</a> stage.  We are waiting for your feedback and recommendations for improving the product. <br><br>  <b>An important announcement:</b> just in the new separate team of the group version, which will also deal with many aspects of sociality on LinguaLeo, we are looking for two talented developers: a backend developer and a frontend developer.  Requirements for candidates and description of other vacancies <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/ru/job">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Start pumping English with new tools! </h2><br><br>  Today such news.  We hope that you will like everything and will be useful in the study and practice of the language.  We tried very hard.  In the near future, new items will be announced for users of LinguaLeo mobile apps on iOS, Android and WP.  There are also some interesting tools for upgrading English on the go, traveling or on the way to work.  Follow us on twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/LinguaLeo">lingualeo</a> , <a href="">facebook</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/lingualeo">vkontakte</a> .  We are waiting for your feedback and suggestions on improving the tools.  And yes, recommend us to your fellow developers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219769/</a></p>
