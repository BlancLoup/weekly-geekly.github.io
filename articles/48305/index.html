  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The absolute minimum for a new life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Psychologists say that a young, energetic and ambitious person (and others are unlikely to be considered for the position of project manager) ‚Äúendures‚Äù in one workplace for no more than 5-6 years.  And for some psychological types, this period is 2-3 years.  Practical experience most often confirms this position.  Further, the project manager needs new perspectives, and not only financial ones. <br><br>  The transition of a manager to a new job is a serious act that requires a well-considered decision and careful preparation.  After all, as a rule, there is something to lose in the place where you are already working.  At the same time, a risk always awaits at a new place.  The job of a project manager is akin to a football coach.  Just like in football, in the failure of the project his manager will be guilty, no matter how ‚Äúobjective‚Äù the circumstances of the defeat would be.  Circumstances should be studied in advance and discussed with their, yet future guidance. <br><br>  The main thing you need to understand before agreeing to do the project is what they want from you and what you can do.  Understand everything is 100% unlikely, but you need to understand.  In the end, representing the amount of work, it is easier to bargain because of salaries and bonuses.  I offer my list, the ‚ÄúAbsolute minimum‚Äù of the steps that must be taken before you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and go to work in a new team.  Answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to the following questions:

      1. Do you imagine the structure of the company? <br>  <b>2. Do you know who you will obey and with whom you will interact within the company?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3. Do you understand the role of the project manager with your future management?</b> <br>  4. Does your future leadership see prospects for your projects in a year? <br>  5. Do you know the methods and tools of project management that are used in the company? <br>  6. Do you know how to document a project in a company? <br>  7. Is there documentation for every project you are assigned to? <br>  8. For each project assigned to you there is a work plan? <br>  9. Is there a quality control department? <br>  10. Have you read the list of errors for your projects in the bugtracking system? <br>  11. Have you read the resume of each member of your future team? <br>  12. Do you know the leader of your team? <br>  <b>13. Have you read the list of project requirements?</b> <br>  14. Have you become familiar with the overall architecture of each of your future projects? <br>  <b>15. Do you know the customer of your project?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>16. Is there a customer representative?</b> <br>  17. Do you know who the previous project manager was? <br>  18. Do you know who should refer you to the project case? <br><br>  The list turned out to be long, but I would rather agree to add more points than to throw out something.  All questions can be answered "yes" or "no" and count the number of positive answers.  How many positive answers do you need to agree to new projects - choose for yourself.  Much depends on the individual temperament and on the proposed compensation.  Yes, a lot more depends on what. <br>  To answer all the questions, you need to work hard and spend a fair amount of time.  This time is not always there, especially when you have to go to negotiations in another city.  If you get an affirmative answer to all 18 questions, you have an excellent chance of success.  Questions 2,3, 13, 15, 16 are the most critical, and, in the event of a negative answer to at least one of them, you must very carefully agree to a new job.  In this case, you are extremely at risk. <br><br>  Have a good start! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48305/</a></p>
