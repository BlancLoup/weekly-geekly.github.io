  <section class="page js-page"><h1>what should be the service!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long ago I was going to write about my impressions of the work of those.  Logitech support, but somehow did not reach out.  But after reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/59092/">article about the Samsung service, I</a> realized that the time had come. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started pretty sad - my wireless kit mouse + keyboard stopped working for me.  I tried a lot of ways to fix it, but nothing helped.  After the keyboard successfully connected via Bluetooth to the Nokia phone, I realized that the problem was most likely in the BT receiver and scored - there was no time to sort it out, so I took out the old wired devices from the bins and calmed down. <br><br>  After some time, I got sick and when I tried to work from home, I found that the keys on the old wired keyboard hit the key, which greatly hinders the process.  I decided to call those.  Logitek support and find out where to contact my problem.  The statement of the TP specialist plunged me into shock: ‚ÄúWe do not have a single service center in any country in the world.  All questions are solved through the store. "  However, our conversation did not end there.  For half an hour we found out that the problem was really in the receiver, after which I heard something and could not believe my ears!  I was told that a new transmitter would be sent to me via UPS.  True, unfortunately, I will have to wait a long time, since there are no such receivers in the Russian warehouse and they will issue it for me from a warehouse in Germany. <br><br>  I left my contacts (phone, address and mail), wrote down some tricky number of my appeal, which, as I was told, could be useful, hung up and waited.  After 10 days, I received a message on the soap, that since, in my address, there is no reaction from me, it automatically goes into the ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù status.  I honestly did not understand what it meant, but I thought that, apparently, the new receiver can no longer wait.  I was upset that there is no fairy tale in this world with a happy ending and relaxed, trying to forget about it.

      Another two weeks passed and I received a message from UPS with the delivery status of correspondence to me.  Two days later they called me and said - "I have a small letter for you here from Germany, when can I get there?"  I answered, waited, received, signed, closed the door, and still continued to doubt that all this was really worth a penny to me. <br><br>  By the way, at the time of the technical support conversation, the guarantee for my set-up seemed to be over ... <br><br>  After this story, I began to love and respect Logitech even more.  When the company is SO related to its customers, I personally do not mind overpaying for the brand! <br><br>  PS I just do not know if I guessed the blog: - [Can you advise any more suitable? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59111/</a></p>
