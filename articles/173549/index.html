      In China, this generation, which has captured all the attention and all the resources of its parents, is viewed with suspicion.  But since the ‚Äúlittle emperors‚Äù entered adult life (it is worth recalling that they are now less than 34 years old), they can afford to close their eyes to the caustic views of the older generation.  Western researchers show that lonely children - as demographers call them - are no more selfish, lazy or incapacitated than their peers who have brothers and sisters.  But the Chinese older generation seems to be right. <br><br>  The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258C%25D1%258F_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">‚ÄúOne Family - One Child‚Äù</a> policy, initiated by the government in 1979, had the greatest effect on densely populated cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai.  The population of these cities is the vanguard of the country's future - the political and economic elite, because of their psychological and behavioral attributes, this is a matter of national and international importance. <br><br>  Since the ‚Äúlittle emperors‚Äù have matured, researchers have largely failed to document what grandparents, teachers, and, ultimately, employers have an absolute conviction: the children of the ‚ÄúOne Family - One Child‚Äù policy are spoiled, selfish and lazy. <br><br>  At the city job fairs, current employers are trying not to hire "loners".  A group of delegates to the China People‚Äôs Political Conference called on the government to review the ‚ÄúOne Family - One Child‚Äù policy, citing social problems and personality disorders of young people back in 2007. <br><br>  Researchers, economists Lisa Cameron and Xin Meng, tried to reflect the changes brought about by the ‚Äúone child‚Äù policy, using economic games designed to identify the tendency to altruism, trust, competitiveness and risk. <br><br>  Cameron and Xin interviewed 215 people who were born between 1975 and 1978, and 208 people who were born between 1980 and 1983.  Among the older group, 55% of the participants had at least one brother or sister, compared with 15% of the younger group. <br><br>  Each participant was interviewed on the 44th points of the personal questionnaire to assess such character traits as extroversion, pliability, stability, tendency to negative.  In the study, volunteers also played games that revealed true behavioral inclinations, and not fleeting emotions or values ‚Äã‚Äãthat they themselves defined.  According to the researchers, the contrast of the two groups was striking. <br><br>  The ‚Äúyounger‚Äù group was less inclined to display altruism in a game in which the player has the opportunity to split money.  "Single children" showed less confidence and confidence in the reliability of a partner in another game, which reveals a willingness to rely on an invisible person to achieve justice. <br><br>  They were more prone to reinsurance than to high-risk, high-reward actions.  And when a chance was offered to enter into competition with an unknown player or to introduce a condition that a novice set the reward himself, ‚Äúlittle emperors‚Äù more often refused to compete. <br><br>  The personal questionnaire showed that ‚Äúlittle emperors‚Äù described themselves as less conscious as conscious, compared with people who were born before the adoption of the law, and more prone to negative assessment of events. <br><br>  When interviewing estimates of the likelihood of sunny weather the next day, ‚Äúloners‚Äù more often assumed that it would be overcast. <br>  "The two groups have fairly clear differences," Cameron said - and almost all of them confirm the established stereotypes. <br>  The study authors noted that the link between risk taking and entrepreneurship was demonstrated - a new meaning for China.  Trust and altruism are qualities that contribute to the strength and sustainability of social institutions. <br><br>  In their report, Cameron and Xin were cautious in evaluating "loners" outside of China.  But when stereotypes are similar in different cultures, the results of the study are most often applicable to reality, despite the state and cultural boundaries. <br><br>  And now we will evaluate ourselves with the help of two resources.
