The important point is that we are not offered them for rent (they cannot be shackled even for shares or an option, as they are already working on building their own businesses).  They are ready to work remotely, on a project basis. <br><br>  <b>Today we will publish the first startup programmers team:</b>

Ready to work remotely for several months.  The cost of a team per month varies from 200,000 to 400,000 rubles, depending on the size and complexity of the tasks. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why are teams sold?</b>  Good teams have technological breaks when they are waiting for an investment or they have time between projects.  Therefore, they turn to us, and we offer them an employer. <br><br>  <b>How does our service differ from regular freelance or outsource?</b>  The teams confirm their skills to the experts of PRUFFI.  As an online recruiting agency, we guarantee the quality of the team and recommend it to work.  And, in turn, we guarantee the quality and reliability of the employer teams. <br><br>  <b>How do teams evaluate?</b>  Based on the special methodology PRUFFI developed with the participation of Ph.D., Ph.D., Professor of the State University Higher School of Economics Ilya Kiriy  The technique assumes expert evaluation of startups not from the point of view of business, but from the point of view of professionalism, stability, cohesion and activity of the team. <br><br>  <b>Quality and reliability tests are carried out in several stages:</b> <br><br>  1. <b>Professionalism.</b>  The team provides a portfolio of completed projects, which confirms the high quality of work.  And if it is not, we start with the second paragraph. <br><br>  2. <b>Definition of technological skills.</b>  It takes place on tests of various subjects, created by experts of the RuNet specially for the order of PRUFFI.  If the candidates are in Moscow, then it passes in person, if not - an interview via Skype. <br><br>  3. <b>Market evaluation teams.</b>  As in the pool of our clients, the leaders of the Internet market, we ask them to give references to start-ups and their specialists. <br><br>  4. <b>Determined cohesion and reliability.</b>  A separate interview takes place with team leaders and teams. <br><br>  At the moment, in the constantly updated database of PRUFFI there are more than three hundred startups and about four thousand estimated specialist teams.  Participants of start-up teams were evaluated at Internet industry events (Harvest, Start, StartupPoint), as well as at leading universities in the country at an assessment organized for the Skolkovo Innovation Center (HSE, MGTU, MFTI, MGU, MIFI and MISiS). <br><br>  <i>If you are a team and want to work on a temporary project - write to us at alenavl@pruffi.ru mail and PRUFFI experts will come to you with certification and make a professional assessment of your team.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120433/</a></p>
