  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MS SharePoint as a mirror of the evolution of 21st century IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Stephen Elop - Head of the Business Systems Division at Microsoft is firmly convinced that over the next five years, their office on-line systems with Dynamic CRM Online will provide at least half of all of its department‚Äôs revenues (the total income of this branch today make about $ 20 billion).  SharePoint Online alone, a couple of weeks ago, presented to the general public, according to Stephen Elop, is already bringing in $ 1 billion, with an expected annual increase of around 35%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>These recent events and forecasts have pushed me to a new series of notes on the ideology, state and prospects of the development of SharePoint, the rising star of Microsoft.</i>  <i>In the concept of this family of technologies, products and services, it seems to me, a whole range of current trends in the development of information technologies have really met.</i> <br><br>  These trends include desktop virtualization embedded in the SharePoint Smart Client.  This is the SOA technology with its WOA (web-oriented architecture) and mash-ups, implemented in SharePoint products, in particular, through Web Parts (as Microsoft calls its technology widgets).  This is the orientation of social networking services with their UGC (user-generated content) towards joint production activities (collaboration), peculiar to (Enterprise 2.0).

      This is a symbiosis of Web 2.0 features used in Enterprise 2.0, with the tools traditionally used to manage companies and organizations (Enterprise Software) and, above all, in ECM (production content management system).  Some, in general, <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/content_management/showArticle.jhtml%3FarticleID%3D212400488%26cid%3DRSSfeed_IWK_All">believe</a> that SharePoint expects the fate of the center (hub) of the entire world of business-oriented software.  And, of course, these are cloud computing with their SaaS combined with Microsoft's Software + Service strategy. <br><br>  Here, with some (yet) stretch, I would attribute the latest social network resources from Microsoft Live Lab: TownSquare (the so-called Facebook for business) and Thumbtack (obviously, to the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBusiness Intelligence) - a kind of ‚Äúgun‚Äù that Microsoft ‚Äúhung on wall. "  Whether and when no one knows these ‚Äúguns‚Äù today will shoot, but the effect of this may be very interesting ... <br><br>  <i>I intend to tell all this in the series of notes opened in iTechBridge, which, in essence, is a kind of introduction to the SharePoint theme.</i>  <i>But do not worry, all this is not for "dummies."</i>  <i>This type of introduction is well represented in the ‚ÄúSpring into ...‚Äù series published in America (dive and ... deeply dive, emerge very quickly).</i>  <i>Taking into account the complexity of the products, as well as some confusion with the names and assignments of the components of the family, which everyone who wants to deal with SharePoint faces, such a quick ‚Äúdive‚Äù can be especially useful for decision makers and IT professionals they are prepared for these solutions.</i>  <i>For all those (both developers and service personnel) who want to understand what kind of a SharePoint beast it is, and with what it can be eaten.</i> <br><br>  The MS SharePoint series includes: <br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D129764">The latest events with the first estimates and forecasts</a></i> - as in the other notes of the series, with an extended list of sources <br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D130204">Years, products, names - a</a></i> brief history of the development of SharePoint and some specificity of its products, services and their names associated with it, causing serious misunderstandings in almost everyone who first encounters this Microsoft product. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D131688"><i>SharePoint through the eyes of the regular Web 2.0 user</i></a> - some features of structuring a target system created on the basis of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server-2007, as well as building collective and personal SharePoint sites that make them multifunctional workplaces oriented to work with a wide variety of ‚Äúproduction‚Äù content. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133269">SharePoint Online vs.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133269">LotusLive</a></i> - a conceptual comparison of the two main competitors in the cloud Enterprise 2.0 market <br><br>  <i>Meeting place ...</i>  - what unites and disconnects SharePoint and traditional ECM / CMS (content management systems) <br><br>  <i>In the center of the Enterprise Software Universe?</i>  - the reasons why SharePoint claims to become an integrating part of what was once called the enterprise's ACS, and that this can prevent <br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133157">Only ‚Äúold men‚Äù go into battle</a></i> - a general chronicle of the battle of giants on the front of cloud-based Enterprise 2.0 <br><br>  <i>The composition, names and contents of the listed notes are subject to change.</i>  <i>I will try in this article to keep track of new publications and / or separately give them Habra annotations.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So let's <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D129764">go ...</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47620/</a></p>
