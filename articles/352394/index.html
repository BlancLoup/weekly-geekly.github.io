It was necessary to urgently refactor and become back effective.  Below - what we did in retail.  I must say, for many, the post will cause a desire to argue, because I will be extremely cynical. <br><br>  Let's start here with this picture.  On Kurskaya near a point bums were got.  And they became for several days the face of the company.  The elder did not know what to do, and wanted to consult with a lawyer.  In our "good old" model, he would first do something with them, and then he would tell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/iv/rf/psivrf7emsslbcbot9nu9gfqu4k.jpeg">

      <br>
      Homeless people lived around the store for a couple of weeks.  This is a direct exit from the subway, so they were warm and comfortable there.  It was decided that as soon as the door opened, the employee took thick rubber gloves, and either directly carried them out onto the street, or spoke with him about why they interfere.  If they had time to lie down for at least 2 minutes - that was fine with them.  And when they did not give even 10 seconds - well, the migration direction shifted. <br><br>  In fact, of course, it was the lesser of problems.  And the most easy to solve. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Components </h2><br>  For the store to work, you need to do three basic things: <br><br>  <b>A. Choose a place.</b>  A good place is when the store goes to zero due to the conversion of the flow, and everything else depends on how you attract new people.  In terms of our competence is good, but there were problems with franchisee partners.  Specifically, despite the described methodology and testing by formal criteria, several times at the beginning of 2017 they managed to choose places where we ourselves would never get up.  These are either really sweet spots with too high rent, or places in shopping centers, where everything is good in the numbers of forecasts, and in practice there is some dead end at the end of the floor.  Each place is now checked by the new procedure with special care. <br><br>  <b>B. Track assortment.</b>  In short, there were two hypotheses: <br><br><ol><li>  The first is that if there is no product, then the sellers replace it with some probability.  That is, in the absence of goods by N thousand rubles a year in revenue, we lose (N * k), where k &lt;1, for example, 0.8N. </li><li>  The second is that if there is no product, then we lose the same amount, plus we still lose all check items that are not purchased with this product, plus we lose the next purchases.  Plus the reputation of a place where there is everything at once.  My score was about 2N losses. </li></ol><br>  The first works great in consumer demand such as grocery.  Or when the same washing powder is replaced.  The problem is that we only had data sets of this type.  Now we know that the second scenario works for us.  So, in 2017 it was necessary to restore the range, and do it pretty quickly. <br><br>  And the assortment was a mess.  Previously, the buyer simply took the goods and dragged him to the company, conducting some kind of input filtering.  During the crisis, the purchasers have acquired an excellent skill to take everything that they believe will be profitable to sell.  As a result, we even got electric scooters.  In the top sales for one of the months came fidzhet-cub.  It became unclear what we are selling.  At the same time, many positions of hardcore nastolks were not purchased, because suppliers, for example, put priority on the mark-up, and not on the quality of the goods.  And this is not the only reason. <br><br>  Normal guys have an assortment manager - a person who decides what to buy exactly, even if there is no advantageous position in the market, and what exactly can not be taken, even if it is three times gold.  There was such a post.  About this, I would have told separately, there is a whole world with its own special atmosphere. <br><br>  We have quite a few competitors on the Internet with low prices.  We could oppose them with effectiveness on huge volumes - we strictly have the same taxes.  The result is a revision of prices for key products for which there are additional purchases in the same check - on Monopoly, for example, we do not earn almost anything. <br><br>  <b>B. The third component of the store is normal service.</b>  Normal is when you left the store in a better mood than you entered.  Even if not bought.  This is when the seller is not poher.  This is when you open freaking boxes.  This is when a person is helped and not pushed.  This is the basis of the basics. <br><br><h2>  And now cynicism </h2><br>  And we hired Inessa to manage retail.  Inessa is a human terminator.  She was hated by all sellers.  Why?  Because she began to restore order.  From her, we learned the scale of that fluffy polar fox that worked in retail. <br><br>  One of the episodes: Karina and Inessa hired a man who had figured out casino and bar schemes all his life.  He could tell by 10 minutes of observing the bartender how much he steals a shift.  And this wonderful guy drove through all our points for the purpose of economic intelligence.  The report was impressive: after it, you could safely lose faith in people.  From the examples - once the sellers scored on the client and sat in the back of the crowd at rush hour.  Someone stole.  In Yekaterinburg, there were signals that sellers are leaving before the end of the shift.  We put video surveillance.  Here the senior and three sellers quit.  We were in cognitive dissonance, because the scale of the operations and the number of people employed in them were amazing.  Assessing the scale of what is happening, we started a big cleaning. <br><br>  It was impossible to take and pass back to the labor market those who pierced.  But such micromanagement smacks of dangerous idiocy and nepotism.  It was much better to build an ecosystem that will automatically select the right sellers.  Since we still changed the leadership of retail and processes (remember, we shared from one big company to a group of companies by areas), it was possible to change the scheme of the stores.  Specifically - motivation. <br><br>  People generally go to work either for money to eat, or because it's cool.  "Cool" is of three types and rests on the Maslow pyramid, already concretely battered from frequent use.  Well, or the theory of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/176801/">player characters</a> from gamification. <br><br>  The old scheme of payment was this: 2/3 of the salary - a salary, about a third more - bonuses for sales (collective, in shifts).  It worked fine as long as the chain of management was short and we could visit our stores at least once a month.  A few years later it turned out that very few people understood how salary is generally considered.  And if it is not clear how the salary is considered - it is not clear how work affects it.  Therefore, the new scheme is as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Fixed salary for actually hours worked. </li><li>  Bonuses from 1 to 7% of the final price of the goods.  All items in the store sold during the day are counted.  All bonuses earned per day are divided between all store employees in proportion to the time worked. </li><li>  Increase or decrease factor to bonuses, depending on the development plan for the store.  For example, when selling from 80 to 90 percent of the plan, the ratio is 1, and when selling more than 110% of the plan - 1.7.  At a rate of 1, bonuses are about 25-40% of the salary of the seller. </li><li>  There is also a block of awards for specific goals, about them below. </li></ul><br>  So far it is important that if you are a seller, then your salary depends directly on how effectively the store works as a whole and the change of seller. <br><br>  After two weeks of screams and groans and chains of dismissals on our own, we were surprised to find out that they were stealing from us.  And not only goods, but also time.  Specifically - it often happened that the senior "chekinil" the seller in the schedule, but he did not go out.  But received during this time the salary. <br><br>  Our decision then was extremely banal - the coordination of schedules on the central retail site.  So, as we know from the network architecture, this idea becomes a complete garbage as the network grows.  We have become.  The new scheme made it possible to shift the decision to the senior seller points, and in such a way that he simply could not choose an ineffective solution - this is his money!  This automatically meant that if 4 sellers would come out on Monday, all of them would suck their paw, because there were very few buyers at that time.  And if 2 sellers will be replaced on Saturday, then again everyone will suck their paw, because the store could have made more sales on the stream, but did not reach the percentage of the plan.  At first, this ecological balance seemed to be very fragile, but tests showed that people very quickly learn to count their money. <br><br>  There could be another problem - the tendency to tactics instead of strategy.  That is, the desire to push, it seems, was blocked by the understanding that the client returns in 2-3 months anyway.  But it was all the same necessary to control especially greedy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xm/zy/ag/xmzyaguncn6oiyc24afsotjpvcq.png"><br>  <sup>Omniprecision Scheme</sup> <br><br>  The second aspect - it was necessary to fix the standards of the network and bring them to everyone.  If earlier it was ‚Äúit is necessary to clean the store, because it's cool when the store glitters‚Äù, now it has become difficult to explain.  Therefore, there was a standard - "shop glitters."  The explanation is simple: if it glitters during the test, you personally receive an award.  If it doesn't shine, you don't get it.  The choice is yours. <br><br>  We wrote checklists for stores (extremely simple, checking only unambiguous facts, for example, ‚Äúhere's a photo of a check‚Äù, ‚Äúthere was a price tag on the chosen game‚Äù, ‚Äúa door handle is clean‚Äù).  And they gave them to secret buyers - they are such people (each time are different) who enter the store, make or do not make a purchase as a real buyer, but all this time they check what and how.  And they write a dialogue with the seller on the recorder.  The same ‚ÄúAudiomania‚Äù, it seems, uses the recording of all the dialogues in the store with a system of microphones, but personally I would not go to such a point.  Therefore, only secret buyers. <br><br>  The senior seller (manager points) and cashiers-sellers received their achivki.  Every achivka is a bonus.  ‚ÄúThe amount of losses according to the results of inventories does not exceed 0.5% of the amount of turnover‚Äù - hold a thousand to the head and 500 rubles premium to cashiers.  All checks are clean - keep a premium.  There were no violations on TC (such as being late), buyers did not complain about slow return curves, and so on - keep the premium. <br><br>  The store manager receives a premium of 15% for the company's financial savings (difficult conditions there), 15% for low turnover (also difficult conditions, the script counts), there are awards for all the documents delivered on time, optimal schedules, compliance with display standards, uniforms and so on, for the safety of depreciable assets. <br><br>  At the same time, for shoals in the TK and in cash discipline, they began to be dismissed under the article.  If earlier we were limited in light cases ‚Äúon our own‚Äù, now now only hardcore.  Because this is the best explanation, that is not so. <br><br>  Has the seller started to get more or less?  On average - about 15% more (results for 4 months).  There are costs for secret buyers.  Decreased management costs due to the variance of decision-making.  There are costs for the introduction of new systems for automating the calculation of all this (now a part is still reduced by hand).  Final efficiency - we won from 10 to 20% of profit depending on the point.  As we wrote in a negative review, "you can earn here only if you really work."  Thanks for the compliment, or rather not say. <br><br><h2>  More things </h2><br>  They singled out one senior point, who went shopping and taught the elders to live - the deputy head of retail would turn out.  He wrote a huge cart, how to work as a salesman, who is now at the heart of the training.  If interested, I can lay out the analysis of specific stores, so that it would be clear how we straightened the whole story step by step. <br><br>  A couple of times we are faced with cases of slave thinking.  ‚ÄúEverything is bad on my point, because ...‚Äù - and then the reasons.  The office does not give money to fix the air conditioner, the office does not give money for the right outdoor advertising, another reason, another reason and so on.  Older stores really did not understand that if they are responsible for the point, then there are no decent external reasons for working poorly.  Internal rule - you cant see - say.  Not decided - say louder. <br><br>  If you have a job site - there are no external circumstances.  As in the army - the fighter is obliged to achieve the execution of the order by any available means.  The elders continued to whine that they had bad traffic, a country in crisis and in general.  A couple of times changed the senior points in some places.  The result is obvious - strong elders argued that in 1-2 weeks you can increase sales by 30% just by working inside the store and with sellers.  They organized a contest among the stores - who shows the best results for the month (in terms of sales composition and performance ratings) - it takes a day to relax, and full-time retail sales managers take their place. <br><br>  The results are very pleased.  The theory of "we have a special place" was broken. <br><br>  Further, the introduction of motivation with ‚Äúeverything depends on you‚Äù and the implementation of the plan made the elders seriously think about where the plan comes from and how to implement it.  When it became their prize, suddenly there was an opportunity to kick the office every morning with letters and calls "where is our sign, what are you ALL AT THERE?" eyes. <br><br>  There were problems with the fact that we partially lost the culture of games in the store.  I traveled around the points and watched the same picture - the person is explained the game by box (and the box is in the hands of the seller) instead of opening it and showing it.  Retrained sellers, and set tables for games.  Now, almost all points can go just to sit and play (there is a pair without tables, for example, on Tula).  It was especially difficult to agree on such a thing in Mega.  In two shopping centers, the administration almost immediately called us and said that your salespeople are playing at work.  Open the game and play.  They asked to stop this mess. <br><br>  For now.  Refactor other parts of the company.  Yes, and in the retail there is still a lot of things left to do, it is not even early to rest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352394/</a></p>
