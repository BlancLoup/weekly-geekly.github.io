  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will Opera be aggressive?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably many already know the slogan ‚ÄúBe a Real Internet explorer?  Opera.com, recently recently vigorously debated in both the foreign and Russian Internet press.  Moreover, the company Opera Software began to receive letters asking to clarify the situation.  Well, apparently, it's time to clarify this curious story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all began on February 3 with an article in the online version of the Washington Post entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/03/AR2009020300751.html">‚ÄúCan Opera Beat Microsoft In The Browser Wars?‚Äù</a> .  It said that the company Opera Software plans to launch an aggressive and very expensive marketing campaign in order to press the main competitor on the market - the Internet Explorer browser.  It was also reported that, within the framework of this promotion, the above-mentioned slogan could decorate an advertising poster in front of Microsoft‚Äôs Redmond office.  As a source of information appeared Vice President of Opera Software for sales and marketing in the US market - Rod Hamlin ( <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rhamlin">Rod Hamlin</a> ). <br><br>  Naturally, in a matter of hours, this news spread through foreign publications, and then appeared in RuNet (for example, at the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/367669.php">Security Lab</a> ).  True, it was not without ordinary journalistic incidents.  For example, in an article on the same Security Lab it says that the beginning of an aggressive advertising campaign is reported in the official press release of Opera Software (not existing), and the notorious advertising poster with a funny slogan is <b>already installed</b> near the Microsoft campus in Redmond.  Meanwhile, in addition to the article in the Washington Post, no other information was received from official sources, and Microsoft employees do not post pictures of a competitor‚Äôs advertising poster on the Internet.  What was really? <br><br>  And in fact it is difficult to say what happened.  It is safe to say that Rod Rodlin‚Äôs conversation was with the Washington Post journalist.  And then - as usual: either a representative of Opera Software shared his <b>only</b> ideas, or the journalist decided to add a scandalous zest to his article, or both, and the same thing happened - the result was a published article with, to put it mildly, inaccurate information.

      In fact, I will not reveal a big secret if I say that the Opera Software company every time discusses the most varied options of the advertising strategy for the next year, and one of the options is always considered ‚Äúaggressive style‚Äù.  But, as we see further, something else is almost always chosen.  And there are objective reasons for this.  Firstly, it is practically useless to fight Microsoft with their own methods (with large expenses for advertising): too different weight categories.  Secondly, the business models of the two companies are too different, which dictates the need to use different ways of advertising themselves.  The main criterion here is not the amount of money spent, but the result you want to receive.  So the conclusion, I think, you can already do yourself: there is no aggressive advertising company on the part of Opera Software and it is not expected in the near future. <br><br>  However, this does not mean that we will not do anything at all.  Many projects are already being implemented, and there will be even more of them during the year.  I can only advise to closely follow the news - for Russia users are also preparing some interesting events.  Well, the main advertisement is, of course, the new versions of Opera browsers.  I can say that the upcoming releases will include some rather unusual novelties - Opera is not going to give anyone the title of the most innovative browser.  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52859/</a></p>
