  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Use head</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is the main tool of IT job?  Computer?  I think otherwise.  First of all, we work head.  And how does the brain work?  For some reason, we are not told about this at school, university and at work, or they say very little.  To work effectively, you need not only to be able to perfectly use the necessary software, but also to know how to tune your brain to work. <br><br>  Especially for Habr (for people with a technical mindset), I prepared a short version of an article about the brain, which describes what is good for the brain and what is not.  Welcome under cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Brain loves </h3><br>  1. The <b>specific goal</b> .  As soon as you formulate for yourself a specific goal, a task, miracles will begin immediately.  There will be funds, opportunities and time for its implementation. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      <br>
      And if you, having set the main goal, are able to divide it into components, and calmly, gradually, constantly, step by step, you will fulfill them - not a single problem will resist you. <br><br>  2. <b>Positive emotions</b> .  Emotions are short-term subjective reactions of a person to the world around him (joy, anger, shame, etc.).  Feelings - a stable emotional relationship to other people, phenomena.  Feelings are associated with consciousness and can develop and improve. <br><br>  Emotions are exciting - that increase the vital activity of a person, and depressing - that is, suppressing life processes.  Positive emotions encourage people to take action.  They arise with satisfaction.  Start looking for simple pleasures of life - and stimulation begins in the brain - the release of large doses of endorphins, pleasure hormones, and therefore satisfaction, and therefore positive emotions, which excite and increase your livelihoods, and allow you to calmly think processes, create a good mood and positive mood to the world.  It is human nature to seek joy - this is not the instinct of self-preservation. <br><br>  3. <b>Movement and fresh air</b> .  In fresh air, the blood is more actively saturated with oxygen, carries oxygen and nutrition to the brain cells faster, oxidation and metabolism intensifies, the energy we need is released, new biochemical compounds are born.  The brain makes us move to save ourselves and us, of course.  To give pleasure to think, create, solve complex problems, have memories. <br><br>  There is no movement of fresh air, the blood turns sour - brains "sour." <br><br>  4. <b>Simple food in moderation</b> .  Simple food is easier to get, cook, and digest.  The brain says (if you want to hear it): my friend, 50% of all energy received by the body is spent on vision, 40% on digestion and disinfection of food toxins, and only 10% remains on movement, mental and nervous systems, fighting billions microbes.  If you eat all the time, when we think? <br><br>  It is useful to eat soups - they improve digestion, metabolism, fill the stomach faster, which gives a feeling of satiety with a smaller amount of food. <br><br>  5. <b>Sleep, rest</b> .  The brain, like the rest of the human body, needs rest.  With exercise, rest is a mental exercise, with intellectual exercise, from moral fatigue, a change of place. <br><br>  Full rest - sleep.  Sleep is the most mysterious state of a person; a person cannot live without sleep, although sleep is called a ‚Äúlittle death‚Äù. <br><br>  In a dream, consciousness is turned off, but the person continues to think, his thinking changes and obeys other laws.  This is due to the fact that the subconscious comes to the fore in a dream.  The brain analyzes what happened over the past day, structures it in a new way and gives the most likely outcome.  This result may have been predicted a long time ago, but his consciousness did not accept him, he was ousted into the subconscious and extracted from there in a dream. <br><br>  It is assumed that the brain at night can be given a setting: to make a forecast, decision, exit, conclusion, just a pleasant dream.  Unnecessary impressions, an obsessive state ‚Äúare washed away by the nightly protective wave‚Äù of the brain.  People who constantly have prophetic dreams are likely good analysts. <br><br>  6. The <b>addiction</b> .  The brain can not instantly adapt to the dramatically changed alien circumstances: new living conditions, new work, study place of residence, company, food, new people.  Enter any activity gradually, calmly, getting used to it.  Every day, doing the maximum possible, you will achieve the impossible.  The habit of learning, work is being developed gradually and constantly.  Sudden understanding and insight always presupposes knowledge, it may not always be fully realized. <br><br>  Often parents, teachers, bosses, loved ones (and even ourselves sometimes), without understanding the whole complexity of addiction, demand from us (and we from others) an instant result.  It does not happen.  It‚Äôs best not to wind up, calm down, tell yourself or others good-naturedly - not all at once, ‚Äúwait a minute, give only a deadline, you will have protein, there will be a whistle‚Äù.  And slowly start moving, accelerating as you get used to it. <br><br>  The brain itself creates stereotypes (habits, skills, conditioned reflexes).  Stereotypical thinking significantly helps to live - no need to re-solve standard tasks.  Every day, performing the same actions, we turn them into a habit, skill, skill, conditioned reflex.  Do not turn on the brain to salivate at the sight of a lemon, close the front door, tap, wash the dishes, shudder from the sharp beep of the car, click the cross when you need to close the program window. <br><br>  The instinct and small life experience make us from childhood create stereotypes of friends, foes, and lovers.  It still helps to choose someone in the ‚Äúsea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople‚Äù, gather your team and stop at that, freeing up time and energy for other life goals.  Stereotypes help to communicate with strangers, get along with parents, raise their children. <br><br>  6. <b>Freedom</b> .  Let it be limited by the instinct of self-preservation and social rules that are useful primarily to ourselves.  Freedom is independence from fear and stereotypes.  Of course, we need stereotypes in the form of unconditioned and conditioned reflexes - we will not, having burned ourselves, to put our hand into the fire a second time - it hurts!  But if circumstances require you to show your contempt for pain and death, burn your right hand, like the Roman "military" Muzio Scotseola.  And do not be afraid to think in their own way and in a new way;  defend your way of thinking, your life, your appearance, your loved ones.  And do not blame the whole world for not understanding and not recognizing you as ‚Äúall that extraordinary‚Äù.  And to allow others to be different from you, to have your own way of thinking, a view of life. <br><br>  7. <b>Creativity</b> is the ability of the brain, using and relying on the old, to create a new, his own, unlike.  Creativity is the favorite work of the brain, kin us to the god, making us gods.  Creativity in the form of science studies, describes, explains the world around us and a person, puts forward ideas, finds ways and means to translate them into life, looks into the future and is ready to change it for the better. <br><br>  Creativity in the form of art - combining work and emotion displays reality with artistic images.  Art unites people: a writer, sharing his life, feelings, describing other people, shows that we are not alone in our experiences.  The artist offers to see how the environment, we ourselves can be beautiful or ugly.  The musician makes our soul respond with the sounds of his heart. <br><br>  Art awakens our imagination, enriches our inner world, helps to see the world in a different light.  Art creates ideals. <br><br>  8. <b>Dividing, sitting, chatting, hugging</b> .  Life is a constant cell division, constant metabolism and distribution of information.  The work of neuronal brain nerve cells is ‚Äúlove.‚Äù  They constantly ‚Äúembrace‚Äù, touching the dendrites (processes, ‚Äúhands‚Äù) to each other, constantly transmit energy (nerve impulses) information about everything (biochemical compounds).  It is harmful not to share, it cannot be demanded, it is confusing.  You have to be friends with your head, you have to be friends with people. <br><br>  This is the essence of the brain - it is constantly necessary for it to receive information and give it away. <br><br><h3>  Brain doesn't like </h3><br>  1. <b>Fear</b> .  A depressing, overwhelming emotion.  When we feel fear, the instinct of self-preservation prevails, brain zones, groups of nerve cells cannot engage in mental activity.  Man loses creative thought. <br><br>  We constantly worry about food, about loved ones, about pain (illness, betrayal, death) about life (war, tsunami, fool chief, revolution, dollar rate, meeting with a terminator) - i.e.  are under stress.  How to deal with it: <ul><li>  Pain and death must be despised. </li><li>  Difficulties, if not avoided, must temper.  In overcoming difficulties, you lose something, but you definitely gain something. </li><li>  Cultivate courage, pride and resilience. </li><li>  We must boldly admit to ourselves that problems and troubles are inevitable companions of human life.  They are neither the first nor the last to be solved. </li><li>  Believe in yourself and in your bright future, you are the problem, not you! </li></ul><br>  Fear is dangerous for mental health and for life.  But we need one adaptive form of fear - caution! <br><br>  2. <b>Strong emotions of any kind</b> .  Strong emotions dramatically inhibit the mental ability of the brain.  Great joy and great sorrow can temporarily deprive the ability to think.  Prolonged this condition leads to painful helplessness of the brain. <br><br>  Girls, this is for you.  When you are "hysteria" (too emotional), your brain turns off.  This made it possible to say ‚ÄúBaba are fools!‚Äù But it has already been proven that the female and male brains are equally capable of education, social adaptation, and politics. <br><br>  Different hormones affect neurology - men are more likely to have dyslexia, schizophrenia, autism.  And representatives of the fair sex suffer from anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.  Therefore, do not impose this state on your men - it literally makes them fools. <br><br>  In men, logical thinking, not including the parts of the brain responsible for emotions, men calmly solve the problem.  In women, on the contrary, the cathimism of thinking, i.  they solve the problem through the prism of conflicting emotions.  This is their physiology, they can not otherwise.  Guys, you got it too?  There is a way out: help them calm down: ‚Äúsmack-smack‚Äù, ‚Äúhold the ice-cream‚Äù, ‚Äúlet the seagulls warm‚Äù, ‚Äúmay you calm down!  I will solve your problem, let's go, walk, think ¬ª, etc.  etc.  The basic idea: "I love you, but we will solve the problem when you calm down."  And you wonder how a woman perfectly cope with everything. <br><br>  The mechanism of emotions - first understanding (situations, phenomena), then emotions.  And do we always correctly understand the situation, the other person, if in the three pines we wander, we do not really understand ourselves.  First, you should calmly figure it out, and only then ‚Äúemotionally‚Äù. <br><br>  3. <b>Darkness, loneliness</b> .  Such conditions include the instinct of self-preservation.  The usual sources of cerebral tonus are reduced and the ‚Äúdark forces‚Äù of negative emotions walk freely around the unprotected brain (the enemy lurks in the dark; the person is a herd being, it is dangerous and scary to him alone). <br><br>  Loneliness - a severe mental state associated with negative emotions and discomfort.  But loneliness will be beneficial to the person, if perceived as a voluntary solitude.  A lack of communication cannot be a misfortune, if a person has at least someone to have contact and understanding.  Perhaps in this world you are just a man, but for someone you are the whole world. <br><br>  Discard unnecessary stereotypes, give any of your conditions the correct names that support you, soothing, carrying the energy you need. <br><br>  4. <b>Stereotypes</b> .  The brain creates stereotypes, but also ‚Äúmisses‚Äù from them.  The brain fights stereotypes for self-preservation ‚ÄúI want to think!‚Äù The brain responds to every change in the external and internal environment. <br><br>  There are people who, having spent some time developing basic life skills or professional skills (ideally getting them all in childhood and adolescence), bring them to automatism, can carry them out, allowing the brain to solve more complex or creative tasks at that time (cook - culinary specialist, driver - ace, draftsman - artist, engineer - inventor, coder - designer) <br><br>  Stereotypes destroy our relationships with people: with friends, with colleagues, with children, parents, lovers, when they behave contrary to our stereotypes.  Do not be afraid to abandon the old ideas about people.  Create new stereotypes with new data (‚Äúdo not persist in stupidity!‚Äù).  Allow people to change, be different.  And calmly and firmly do not let others impose stereotypes about you, if you do not need it. <br><br>  Never be afraid of anything, with you your treasure, your most reliable friend is your brain! <br><br>  Take care of your treasure, study it, remember, the brain has reserves - but these are reserves.  You can make the brain work in an extreme mode, but the adaptation capabilities will be exhausted.  This also explains the overly early and intensive development of children and their subsequent problems of adaptation in society. <br><br><hr>  <sup>The article was prepared on the basis of various sources, among which I especially want to highlight the book of our contemporaries, our compatriot, the great woman and the great scientist, academician, creator of the Brain Institute, Natalia Petrovna Bekhtereva.</sup>  <sup>The book is called "The Magic of the Brain and the Mazes of Life."</sup> <sup><br><br></sup>  <sup>The article does not pretend to the completeness of information, but is intended to spur your interest in the brain.</sup>  <sup>I felt the things described (what the brain likes and what doesn't), and when I started reading about the brain, I was convinced that science was on my side :).</sup>  <sup>Spend your time reading about the brain.</sup>  <sup>This time will pay off when you can properly configure your main work tool.</sup> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94595/</a></p>
