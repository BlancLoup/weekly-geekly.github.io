In general, 6466 units were sold (20.8% increase compared with October 2017).  It is also noted that there is a shift in buyers' preferences from hybrids towards electric vehicles on rechargeable batteries:

The newcomer of the market the Jaguar I-PACE (441 registration) took the 5th place.  After Nissan LEAF go such cars Volkswagen e-Golf, BMW i3 and Volvo XC60. <br><br>  Last month, Tesla delivered 201 cars, although a month earlier there was 2016 (the so-called Tesla jerk at the end of the quarter and the subsequent rest at the beginning of the next). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/184/553/de4/184553de42d9ff760e46ea4c8253cc0a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Registration of new cars in Norway (top 20 models), from the beginning of 2018 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a17/abf/e39/a17abfe39094e9505e85a8d380aa4de3.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br>  In addition to this article, we would like to note separately September this month.  Data again with <a href="https://insideevs.com/norway-60-new-vehicle-sales-plug-in-cars/">InsideEVs</a> .  That month, there was just a record for the ratio of sold electric vehicles to cars on the engine, and amounted to 60.1%.  Yes, there was a general decline in car sales compared with last year by 22.3%, but sales of electric cars fell only by 2.1%. <br><br>  Also, the chart below shows the dynamics of the car market in Norway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77d/ad0/ca1/77dad0ca1678ff339f26a13726b11b63.png" alt="image"><br><br>  5 years ago - 60% of all sold, it is cars on the engine with diesel fuel.  Just unthinkable.  Yes, in terms of GDP per capita, Norway is among the top ten world leaders and can afford it.  But, not every country will want.  However, it should be understood that the number of the country is just over 5 million people, and against this background it stands out. <br><br>  This is how I summarize why the translation of the article was made.  <a href="https://insideevs.com/norway-6-5-registered-cars-are-electric/amp/">According to InsideEVs</a> , according to official data of this country, as of September 2018, about 178.5 thousand electric vehicles were registered - which is 6.5% of the total number of cars, 2.7 million units.  In addition to this - 3% of plug-in hybrids (approximately 80 thousand units).  Almost 10% of all cars are electro.  For some countries, this is not even a month.  For example, among the leaders of total sales, according to data for September, the United States is 3.1% (total registrations are <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20181002/RETAIL01/181009920/car-light-truck-monthly-sales-data">1.441</a> ( <a href="http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2018/10/u-s-auto-sales-brand-rankings-september-2018-ytd/">1.44</a> ) million units, and total sales and electricity <a href="https://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/">44,589</a> are a record number of total sales for the month) and China are <a href="https://insideevs.com/september-2018-record-plug-in-cars-china/">5. 2%</a> due to the general decline in car sales in the country, but the total number was 104,900 (also a record number of total sales for the month for China). <br><br>  * Update <br>  <a href="https://elbil.no/english/norwegian-ev-policy/">Norwegian electric cars policy</a> <br>  The main provisions to stimulate the development of electric transport (year of introduction): <br><ul><li>  no taxes on purchases or imports (1990); </li><li>  exemption from 25% VAT (2001); </li><li>  low tolls (1996); </li><li>  there is no charge on toll roads and in case of a ferry (1997 and 2009); </li><li>  free parking in municipal parking lots (1999); </li><li>  the ability to drive on roads for public transport (2005); </li><li>  50% tax reduction for transport companies (2000); </li><li>  exemption from 25% VAT on leasing (2015). </li></ul><br>  This incentive program will be reviewed and updated depending on market development.  Tax breaks will be until 2018, after which they will be revised.  From 2017, the local authorities are reviewing the following issues: access to roads for public transport and free parking in municipal parking lots.  Free access to toll roads is likely to be replaced by a new discount system with differentiated prices based on CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions. <br><br>  Policies also set economic incentives for low-emission and low-emission vehicles through low taxes, and high-emission vehicles for high-emission vehicles. <br><br>  The Norwegian Parliament has set a goal - all new cars sold from 2025 must be electric cars without (rechargeable batteries or fuel cells) or low (plug-in hybrids) emissions.  This is an ambitious goal, but reachable, if you pursue the right policy.  This goal will be achieved by increasing taxes for cars with emissions, rather than a complete ban. <br><br>  Not unimportant economic component of the rejection of the internal combustion engine, <a href="https://autotraveler.ru/en/spravka/fuel-price-in-europe.html">fuel prices</a> - the highest in the world.  On the other hand, the relative low price of electricity is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics">16 euro cents per 1 kW * h</a> .  In addition, <a href="https://www.ssb.no/en/energi-og-industri/statistikker/elektrisitet/aar">96% of the</a> energy generated came from hydroelectric power plants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428834/</a></p>
