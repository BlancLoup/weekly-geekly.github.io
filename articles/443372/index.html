And how she does it!  As with the rest of the backend, balancing between bloody hardcore and practical applicability.  As many as 8 reports on Java / JVM on a variety of topics from top speakers.

      Separately, we note that most of the reports are premieres that have never been heard before, and you will be able to hear them first.  In the world. <br><br>  But enough common words, let's talk sightingly. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  About hardcore </h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/b77/680/75ab7768015aad24724e53b1af850664.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Last time Mikhail Yariichuk's report <a href="https://2018.codefest.ru/lecture/1244/">about GC</a> gathered a full house and received excellent marks, so this time we decided to continue the subject of hardcore under.  NET and <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1392">tell you</a> about debugging complex cases in production using Memory dumps, and how to use WinDBG debugger. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/2e5/5df/21d2e55df1771b0bb8986f4e8ee51348.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  For those who prefer linux, we have prepared a report on the evolution and configuration of the TCP / IP network stack in linux and android, <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1458">from Alexander Tobol</a> .  If you are one of those who heard about the seven-level OSI model at the institute - come, it will be interesting. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ec/1cc/f8c/8ec1ccf8c9ea0f788c2bc82370dc8249.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  We are all used to the fact that if C ++ is required, then quickly, and if Python, then not faster than C ++.  But Anton Kochepasov <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1500">in his report</a> will show that everything is not so simple.  Let's compare the speed of development and execution of Python vs C ++ and find out how to reduce the program in size and make it many times faster in speed of execution. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><h2>  Functionalism </h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef8/2a7/2a7/ef82a72a7558219f77e8580ba01e40cf.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  One of the trends of the current time is the application of the functional approach in programming.

We are sure that everyone had fakapi on the sale.  In his report, Alexey will tell about the process of working on the bugs and how to organize a systematic approach to parsing fakap with the sale. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><h2>  Java  I was waiting for you for so long! </h2><br><h3>  About sweet Spring Boot put in a word </h3>  Immediately go with trumps, i.e.  from one of the most popular Java-frameworks of our days.  Of course, it will be about the Spring framework and microservices on the Spring Boot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/eeb/589/1ceeeb58948eaeef2e1729b9acd78fe8.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Vladimir Plizga from CFT <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1433">will share his experience in translating Spring Boot microservices from Java 8 to 11</a> .

Then come to Nikita Lipsky's report from Excelsior about the adventures and difficulties of compiling AOT Spring Boot applications.  During the report, Nikita will <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1394">sort through</a> all the subtleties of the internal device of the Boot, and also explain how it is possible (and can it be?) To cross its dynamic properties with static compilation. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><h3>  But not a single boot! </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b9/a5e/99f/1b9a5e99f372c7db20d1649f97c1a148.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Java champion Dmitry Alexandrov from T-Systems <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1395">will talk about an alternative framework for developing microservices</a> : Microprofile.  io.

Come to Dmitry's report. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a3/f9f/b3f/7a3f9fb3f6fdc72f9d3d2255a54d54bc.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Another story of success and pain <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1398">will tell Grigory Koshelev</a> from Kontur.  The report will be devoted to their experience with Kafka in the framework of the project East.  You will find out where Kafka is good, what limitations she has, and what pitfalls and crutches are worth waiting for. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><h3>  Are the guts ordered? </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e48/7ed/3db/e487ed3dbb3d240a1d8fa857f246a498.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Andrei Pangin from Odnoklassniki will talk about <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1460">how to write your own plugin for JVM</a> .  The conversation will be about JVM Tool Interface - the standard API for the development of various tools: profilers, debuggers and diagnostic tools for JVM.  Why would a regular Java developer need to invade the internal structure of a JVM?  How to do it and what are the difficulties?  What has changed in Java 9-11?  All this you will learn from the report of Andrew. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90a/bf5/beb/90abf5beb3b40534b921ad1f1857e346.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Tagir Valeev from JetBrains <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1388">will reveal the javac internal kitchen</a> , using the example of how the switch statement translation has changed from Java 1 to Java 12.

Then this report is for you. <br><br>  PS During the preparation of the report Tagir zareportal packs of bugs in javac and other compilers, so that interesting provided. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><h3>  And # Of course, the Kotlin </h3>  Yes, the Java section, but you need to look ahead.  Therefore, how could we not touch on the topic of the rapidly gaining popularity of the Kotlin language! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a4/e95/604/8a4e956048e17ecbc0f6d8cd4031854c.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Outraged reader can exclaim: ‚ÄúHey, Kotlin - this is for mobile workers!‚Äù But we know that the backend on Kotlin is to write a nice thing.  Pavel Finkelstein from Lamoda will tell about this at CodeFest in the report ‚Äú <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1393">Kotlin: 2 years in prode and not a single gap</a> ‚Äù, describing his experience, concrete examples of advantages or problems of Kotlin in the backend. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64f/c23/bc9/64fc23bc952d688434a4e316ecba5663.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Digging deeper.  One of Kotlin's coolest features is the Korutinas, which have stabilized in version 1.3.  Vsevolod Fatheads from JetBrains - one of the library developers around Korutin - tells <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1441">how the Korutins are arranged under the hood</a> . <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  As you see, we tried to select the reports so that everyone could find something interesting for themselves.  Do you like hardcore or Enterprise?  Are you a fan of SpringBoot or are you looking for alternatives?  Do you sit tight on the eight, or are you already looking at 11?  CodeFest - what the doctor ordered. <br><br>  Registration is required.
