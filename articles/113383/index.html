This is a free VPN service running on OpenVPN technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b6/ef/b6efd0170687b53abd82fce932884456.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The essence of the service is one offer - you can use Wi-Fi anywhere in the world without the risk of losing cookies and passwords.  Of course, if you really want to, then at work you can use a blocked contact and YouTube, or even watch a strawberry without the administrator's knowledge, but the service first solves the security issue of public Wi-Fi or a curtailed Internet on business trips.  I‚Äôll say right away that there will be clients for Mac and Linux, but later (a month or two).  At the time of connection, antiviruses may be scolded by the client, due to the fact that it requires administrative rights (it curses the portable version of OpenVPN's driver).  Well, let's try what happened (unfortunately, so far only Windows users).  Hint: UDP is fast and sometimes does not work, TCP is twice as slow, but I wanted to spit on any restrictions. <br><br>  While the windows users ran away trying freebies, I‚Äôll tell you a little more about what has been done and what is planned <a href="https://kebrum.com/ru/">for our main service</a> . <br><br>  As you can see, we combed the site, made an English version, provided a web panel with configs files for those who want to use their software, added an IP change feature <i>without reconnecting</i> (if they are on the server) and made a schedule of what needs to be done.  We were temporarily distracted from the development (in the name of another development), so we didn‚Äôt do everything we had promised, nevertheless, time went on and accumulated experience, the son of difficult mistakes.  Gradually, an image of what was to be done was forming in our heads.  How does it all start?  With a problem. <br><br>  As you know, your provider is not only able to observe, he is <b>obliged</b> by law to maintain your activity logs.  Similar laws operate in almost all countries of Russia, Belarus, almost all of Europe, America - the systems have different names, but the essence is the same.  Further - more ( <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704545004575352983850463108.html">tyn</a> , <a href="http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/747241-echo.html">tynts</a> ).  If earlier a typical user had an antivirus and firewall on his computer, now we are entering an era when a mandatory attribute of an advanced user is connecting to a VPN server, preferably outside his country.  If before the Internet was nothing more than a toy, now it is an integral part of life.  By connecting directly you share this part with the provider, which means with the state.  You yourself put everything on a platter, it remains just to come and pick it up.  Of course, I am exaggerating, but in Europe, for example, they are already quite noticeably fined for torrents (clients told) and based on the fact that money is always a priority now, and there are A LOT of them on the Internet now, uncles will systematically divide and milk their territory.  As it was done in China, where the authorities do not particularly stand on ceremony (there is nothing special to take from the poor Chinese, therefore they just protected their flock from the destructive influence of freedom).  It sounds very pessimistic, nevertheless the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/112158/">facts speak for themselves</a> . <br><br>  Well, here we are in all white, on a white horse in the rays of the setting sun.  No, it's really nice to do something useful.  I would not like to work as a marketing director in a tobacco or alcohol company, for example.  Because ask me who, what I do, then the honest answer would be - "I kill people for money."  And so we help people.  Actually, what is the plan of salvation? <br><br>  At the moment, our task is to make a beautiful and convenient client, which would allow the person farthest from IT in three clicks to ensure their privacy.  The client that is now at least copes with its functions, but we ourselves are not enthusiastic about its design and usability, so I will immediately show the client‚Äôs layout, which is now in development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/27/8727324e14df26ebdfdd606dd6a11f5f.png"><br><br>  For MacOS X, an interface with native elements will be developed.  In general, this time we approached the version for Macs more thoroughly, since some principles common to Windows and Linux turned out to be poorly applicable to these Macs, as a result of which the current client harbors a couple of bad crutches. <br><br>  The priority is the possibility of blocking traffic in case of loss of connection.  To do this, have to sweat with the drivers.  Internet providers very often abruptly cut off the traffic flow, the connection with our servers is broken and when the traffic starts to go again - IP light occurs.  Now there is software that solves this problem, but it is necessary to install the original OpenVPN and additional program + setting, and as you remember, ‚Äúease of use‚Äù is a necessary condition for us. <br><br>  You ask, ‚ÄúWhen will there be unlimited traffic?‚Äù Well, firstly, there‚Äôs no limitless anything but human greed, and secondly, we thought about it.  As soon as the number of users is sufficient, we will be able to enter the conditional unlimited for all (200 GB per month).  Terms not yet determined. <br><br>  And in connection with the end of the IPv4 era, it was decided to add to the task list such a feature as IPv6 tunneling through IPv4 and vice versa.  So that a user with a provider who cannot into IPv6 could solve this problem for himself. <br><br>  Okay, for now that's enough.  We have many plans and ideas, as well as goodies for Habr, but this is all later.  For now questions, offers and, of course, criticism.  And most importantly, tell me if you need a dedicated IP address and for what purposes.  Realization of purchase by the user of the selected address is thought out, but requires man-hours.  Therefore, if someone is interested, then provide arguments in favor of entering such a service. <br><br>  PS <br><ol><li>  Thor is slow and anyone can pick up a node, and then sniff it. </li><li>  If you can raise a VPN yourself - well done, do not convince others that this is the only correct way, many people value their time expensively (for example, I don‚Äôt watch TV shows via turbo film at all because I don‚Äôt know where to download and I have slow internet). </li><li>  Yes, we will not protect from the state if it <b>wants</b> to find you.  No one will protect.  To do this you must have at least an island and your own army with missile defense.  Our service is designed for the average person who wants more privacy, security and goodies in the form of foreign resources. </li></ol><br>  I hope this way I was able to answer a third of the questions in advance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113383/</a></p>
