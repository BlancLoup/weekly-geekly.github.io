According to the estimates of consulting agencies, in the next 5 years in Eastern Europe, the share of Internet sales in the electronics market and related products will rise from the current 1% to 15-30%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Not surprisingly</b> , Internet marketing is under the scrutiny of wholesale and retail distributors and manufacturers.  AT <br>  the development of such network resources are invested significant material resources, and their payback does not cause any special doubts.  Web agencies claim that the development of this promising (as <br>  shows the experience of Western companies) branches of business is hampered by the extremely low penetration of Internet technologies into the interior.  In small cities and villages in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Russia, very few people use the Internet, and the main consumers are traditionally located in large cities. <br>  Fortunately, this situation is changing for the better - the Internet is almost the only window into the world: <br>  news and valuable information come from the Internet, <br>  small purchases of books, gifts and other inexpensive <br>  Things are also done through the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Many companies</b> reached out to virtual space and successfully settled there.  The following points contribute to the development in Eastern Europe: <br>  1 / Low costs for the creation and support of a virtual store: most often a similar store is a regular wholesale base with a virtual office.  This state of affairs significantly reduces staff costs, <br>  room rental, etc. <br>  2 / The rapid increase in the number of Internet users associated with an increase in the general welfare of consumers, as well as accelerating the penetration of technology in the daily consumers; <br>  3 / Development of electronic payment systems such as Paypal, E-gold, Yandex. Money, WebMoney (in Russia and the CIS).

      <b>The key</b> to opening a virtual store is to increase the number of consumers who prefer to shop in <br>  online mode.  It is with the increase in the number of the latter that the success of their business is connected by the majority of entrepreneurs who have looked at the means of the Internet.  But there are also serious obstacles: <br>  1 / Usually, a virtual store causes less trust in a buyer than a regular one, and so far very few potential buyers are willing to pay for the purchase before it is delivered.  And payment of goods in fact <br>  receipt is a high risk for the seller. <br>  2 / Due to the high cost of postal delivery, the price for a buyer living, for example, in another country may be 1.5‚Äì2 times higher than for residents of the seller‚Äôs country.  As a rule, most of the actual virtual stores are limited to selling in one region. <br><br>  <b>However</b> , there are already many shops and services in the network that are focused on the sale of printing equipment and consumables for it.  In general, the structure of an electronic store can be divided into four components: a web server (the site through which a visitor receives information about products, can get acquainted with their characteristics and price, as well as payment methods and delivery), incoming orders and payments processing service, courier postal service, information and technical support service. <br><br>  <b>Of particular success</b> with companies selling on the Internet was the concept of a virtual supermarket - visitors are invited to go through the virtual series, where products of various assortment are laid out.  Shops selling various types of electronics (computers, mobile phones, etc.) and related products, including consumables for office equipment, such as toners and cartridges, are very popular. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rashodka.net/">Source consumables</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7504/</a></p>
