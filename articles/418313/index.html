A survey conducted by Smartbear in 2017 among 5,000 software development professionals showed that over 50% of respondents use automatic API testing tools, and their number is expected to grow by 30% (from 59% to 77%) over the next two years, with 80% of survey participants indicated that they are responsible for testing API. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having the right processes, tools, and technical solutions for automated API testing becomes more important than ever.  And with the shift-left trend, API testing is becoming more than just a quality control solution; now it is a critical component of successful continuous integration and software deployment. <br><br>  This article provides an overview of the best API testing tools, both with open access and commercial solutions, from which teams of testers can choose the most suitable for themselves.

No solution can combine all the tools. <br>  It is painful to realize, however, it is true! <br><br>  We believe that the above list represents the best solutions currently available if you decide to use the automated testing API.  However, as is the case with most products in this area, finding one tool that combines all of these functions is almost impossible. <br><br>  Some may find that the properties of commercial products (Postman, Tricentis Tosca, ...) will be enough, but the price of the issue will serve as a serious deterrent.  Free and open-source solutions (Rest-Assured, Karate DSL, ...) are fairly acceptable, but require skilled skills and a lot of effort to implement the right platform.  Tools that keep a balance between price and other factors (Katalon Studio, Postman) may have flaws for some types of projects, and these flaws require close evaluation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/oj/z_/tsojz_7r_0f2yqwkodopktqbwie.png"><br><br>  Testing The API has created its own trend in the field of automated testing, and the further, the more tools will be created to meet the growing demands from software development teams.  Finding the perfect tool is still difficult, but we have some good news - now your choice has become much wider than it was before.  Consider your requirements carefully, weigh the pros and cons of each decision - try not to be too picky in the early stages and try the 5 best candidates from our list.  When you create a list of all the pros and cons for these decisions, you will get a more adequate picture of the critical factors of your project and will be able to edit the list of tools.  This approach will provide you with a good opportunity to identify the appropriate tool for the current stage and information about the next tool when your projects become more complex, complex and experienced. <br><br>  I would be very pleased to hear your feedback, so - if you know other tools that can be used for similar purposes - I would appreciate your contribution to the research topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418313/</a></p>
