Disappointment - this is how one can say the reaction of users to a new representative of the wearable device market  First of all, the price is disappointing, the battery life (the battery lasts no more than a day) and the need for an iPhone. <br><br>  Not only users, but also investors are disappointed: in the morning, the company's shares fell by more than 2%.  Analysts from Pacific Crest Securities believe that Apple will be able to sell the first few batches of watches to fans of the brand, but there is no great success in the market.  And in the investment company Piper Jaffray, they suggested that the Apple Watch, given the design and brand, would rather compete with regular watches than wearable devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The situation was aggravated by the immediate and accurate response of competitors, who immediately offered several alternative smart watches.  Google responded with a 15-second video, hinting at the variety of forms and capabilities of wearable devices for Android.

The watches will be produced in three lines: <br>  -Watch Sport for $ 350-400; <br>  - base model for $ 550-1100; <br>  - premium model Watch Edition for $ 10,000-17,000. <br><br>  In the meantime, the whole world, with bated breath, waiting for the release of smart watches, we offer you to get acquainted with collections of what can be bought instead of the <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2015/03/11/applewatchdorogo/">Apple Watch</a> and <a href="http://app2top.ru/main/chto-kupit-vmesto-apple-watch-edition-52283.html">Apple Watch Edition</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  Unity 5 is not for sale! </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50a/5c6/d5a/50a5c6d5a6da4f37b05455834fef6a5a.png"><br><br>  Under this heading, two news at once: Unity 5 Personal Edition <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/237853/Unity_5_released_with_upgrades_fullfeatured_free_version.php">is available for free</a> , although under certain conditions, and Unity has officially denied rumors about its sale. <br><br>  The rumors appeared after it became aware of a serious expansion of the list of free features that will be available in the new version of the engine. <br><br>  Although the rumors were partially true, or rather, Unity will provide almost the entire package of new engine features for developers for free, but only if the investment in the company or its earnings were less than $ 100,000 in the previous year.  Otherwise, you will have to buy a license, for which you must pay either $ 1,500 or $ 75 per month. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis version offers all the powerful functionality of the Unity engine and editor, including profiler, Occlusion Culling, render textures, full-screen special effects, physically correct shading, powerful graphics with a new set of tools for creating realistic lighting and stunning visual effects, a new system for working with audio "- stated in the official press release of the company. <br><br>  As for the features that are available only in the paid version: <br><ul><li>  Unity Cloud Build Pro; </li><li>  Team License Team License; </li><li>  service for monitoring the game performance Game Performance Reporting; </li><li>  access to Asset Store Level 11; </li><li>  Unity Analytics Pro analytics service; </li><li>  access to previews and beta versions of the engine. </li></ul><br>  It is important to note that in both the paid and free versions, no interest on sales will be charged to companies! <br><br><br><h3>  Unreal 4 became free! </h3><br>  Not a week, but simply an attraction of generosity, but this is how to look.  Unreal 4 <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">became free</a> for developers, and only one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: as soon as your project on the Unreal 4 engine earns more than $ 3000, you will be obliged to give Epic Games 5% of the turnover of your project every quarter. <br><br>  Although the old subscription of $ 19 for the month was not something very heavy even for beginners, but the more developers have more features and available engines, the better for the industry as a whole. <br><br>  Two popular engines and two very similar "moves" - Unity 5 or Unreal 4 ?!  Only time will tell who the developers will give more preference.  And which option would you prefer? <br><br><br><h3>  Anonymous Login from Facebook </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02a/d78/d13/02ad78d13328457eaf6785c418d5087d.jpg"><br><br>  Facebook announced the possibility of anonymous authorization in applications.  Developers can now leave a request to participate in beta testing features on a special <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/products/anonymous-login/">page</a> .  The new functionality, according to the social network, will increase conversions and help people start using the application faster, while maintaining their anonymity. <br><br>  Whether Facebook will give any data about the user in this mode is still unknown.  But such authorization through Facebook will allow users to log in to applications through different devices.  In addition, users will have the opportunity to quite simply replace ‚ÄúAnonymous Login‚Äù with a regular ‚ÄúFacebook Login‚Äù. <br><br>  This move by Facebook looks very interesting.  More and more people are trying not to distribute their personal data to the right and left, so they will certainly like this opportunity. <br><br><br><h3>  Paris Hilton will be the heroine of the mobile game </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d0/39c/8e9/2d039c8e9f9f429bbaff7d007a3317a8.jpg"><br><br>  The success of Kim Kardashian deprived many of sleep and appetite.  Lindsay Lohan and even the aging Malibu rescuer David Hasselhoff have already joined the ranks of those who decided to repeat this glorious path (I confess, I had to google to ‚Äúremember‚Äù who this is).  And here - they were <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/anonsirovana-igra-s-pe-ris-hilton-v-glavnoj-roli-52021.html">joined by</a> Paris Hilton. <br><br>  No details yet, we only know that the game will be about "celebrities, fashion and style."  Well, let's say, not surprised.  Judging by the conclusions of Venturebeat, the success of such projects is positively correlated with the popularity of the selected star. <br><br>  In the case of Kim Kardashian, the game definitely managed to make money, but in the case of Lindsay Lohan, it was possible only to raise the number of mentions about her on Twitter.  I will not even talk about Hasselhoff, it‚Äôs more like a joke.  Interestingly, it coincided with the expectations of the creators? <br><br>  Let's see what happens at Paris Hilton.  I did not have to google her name, but this is not an indicator at all.  :) <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
