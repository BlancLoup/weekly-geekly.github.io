Today, as we promised in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/277206/">previous thematic article</a> , we would like to provide you with a publication devoted to this topic, taking into account the opinions of diversified specialists studying the phenomenon of IW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/646/dc9/58b/646dc958b5c9c0ce66cb731989685281.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The future is here</b> <br><br>  The history of technology development has always inextricably linked a person with optimistic, and often utopian, expectations of a healthier, happier, and free from the routine work of the future.  With each new technological wave rolling on us, numerous changes are inevitable.  Some of them influence our life positively, some negatively, and the consequences of some of them for the modern man are simply impossible to predict today.  And the Internet of Things (IW), which is rapidly bursting into our life, is no exception.

      No one will deny that the connected devices and systems stimulate an increase in the automation of processes, bring a new level of comfort to a person and, in some cases, contribute to an increase in efficiency.  The ability to delve into data streams can transform every industry, from transport systems and law enforcement to agriculture and manufacturing. <br><br>  WI, developing and improving the level of security and knowledge, also promises cheaper and more advanced goods and services.  So, for example, by integrating sensors into objects familiar to us ‚Äî clothes, food packaging, household appliances or medical devices, manufacturers create for us a completely different and potentially much more perfect level of reality. <br><br>  Undeniable advantages are opening up in the sales industry, where the possibilities of the producer and the seller will be able to flexibly and dynamically adapt to the needs of the consumer.  One of the opening advantages in this case is the ability to quickly and efficiently find defects and problems and withdraw such products from the goods turnover.  A system connected to the data flow and analytics in real-time mode will allow you to quickly adjust the delivery schedule, production volumes and nomenclature, pricing and other criteria that allow you to maintain sales and consumption dynamics at an optimal level. <br><br>  <b>IV - soft penetration</b> <br><br>  You must admit that this is wonderful: the irrigation system equipped with touch sensors optimizes the irrigation process and in real time saves energy and the homeowner's budget.  When connecting to the Internet, the system monitors weather data to adjust the intensity of irrigation, taking into account whether rain is expected in the near future.  Further, if such a system works on a city or eco-settlement scale, this will have a positive effect on water resources management and savings already at the level of the city budget.  Performance indicators will increase even more if homes, commercial and municipal organizations are linked within the same information system.  But already at this stage the question arises: what happens if someone wants to hack the system and deplete the water resources?  And what will happen if, for example, attackers hack and stop the entire system of urban autonomous transport? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/923/144/fb6/923144fb6b9a3376364346bd4ad6481c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Very attractive in terms of cyber espionage and to cause damage of various kinds and scale in the world of total IW, drones turn out to be.  Acquiring for this purpose even an inexpensive drone with a certain upgrade of software and hardware will allow you to hack a video camera or a Google Glass headset connected without any problems, dive into the microcosm of the privacy of their owners or take possession of personal confidential data.  So at risk, for example, there may be an important document left on the kitchen table, etc., etc. Another persuasive example of the existence of the reverse side of the Internet of things was shown by computer security specialist from New Zealand Jack Barnaby back in 2011.  During the McAfee FOCUS 11 conference, he demonstrated how, via Wi-Fi from a distance of 90 meters, to make an insulin pump inject 100% of its contents into the pancreas and thereby cause the death of the patient.  The second example, which threw the public into a state of shock, was the demonstration of their ability to control and, if desired, stop the pacemaker from 9-15 meters using a tablet. <br><br>  Are such scenarios realistic at the current level of protection for wired and wireless communications and IW in general?  - Completely. <br><br>  On the other hand, what will happen if any of the monopolists of the Io software and hardware or the government block access to certain electronic content by any of their resolutions?  Very eloquent and ironic in this respect is an example from the foreseeable past, when in 2009, after a difference of opinion on a number of issues with the publisher, the IT giant Amazon temporarily and without any notice restricted access to George Orwell's 1984 novel.  Copies of the electronic version of the book in one day suddenly disappeared from Kindle readers from users all over the world. <br><br>  Already today it is absolutely clear that, in addition to the obvious advantages of IW, at least at the stage of its formation, will inevitably bring new difficulties related to security and confidentiality, and, of course, will fill our life in the new digital world of hitherto unfamiliar challenges.  IW, without any doubt, will become the subject of disputes and disagreements of the general public, will force you to take a fresh look at issues related to wealth and poverty, and will fundamentally transform the existing legislation. <br><br>  <b>Smart systems or stupid people?</b> <br><br>  One of the main issues of concern to researchers of IW is far from idle, and is this: are people becoming stupid (literally) using smart devices?  How do smart devices affect our intelligence?  Tens of thousands of contacts are stored in the memory of modern smartphones, GPS navigators are laying routes for us, bracelets on wrists monitor the level of consumed calories and physical activity.  All this was impossible to imagine ten years ago.  But what does the other side of the coin look like in this case? <br><br>  As a result, people free themselves from having to memorize even the most important phone numbers, paper atlases with maps gather dust on the shelves of storerooms, or send out unnecessary garbage dumps, and despite unprecedentedly easy access to tools for fitness, obesity and other diseases associated with a progressive tendency to a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet, they turn into one of the most acute global social problems for society.  It‚Äôs a paradox, but every day a causal relationship is more clearly seen: the more smart devices do things for us, the less we are in contact with the natural environment, the less we are in harmony with our natural rhythm and the less we are inclined to fully train our body and your brain.  And this is confirmed by stubborn statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71b/864/a3c/71b864a3c95cf85cca809b358fc6ab59.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Psychologist and writer Douglas Lyle called this phenomenon a "pleasure trap."  According to him, it is quite natural for the human brain to choose the simplest and most pleasant way to perform actions, which requires a minimum of energy expenditures from it.  But the easiest way here is not always the best and safest.  Nicholas Carr, author of the book "Dummy.  What the Internet does with our brains ‚Äùraises the question of the‚Äú instant information culture of the Internet ‚Äùas something that will certainly progress in its development with the advent and development of IOT.  ‚ÄúNow my mind has adapted to perceive information exactly as it is presented to us by the network: in the form of a rapidly moving stream of individual particles <i>.</i>  <i>Once I plunged into the abyss of words and meanings.</i>  <i>Now, as if on water skis, I easily glide over their surface,</i> ‚Äùhe expressed this conviction based on personal experience in 2008 in his article for The Atlantic. <br><br>  Although researchers are only taking the first steps in studying the processes of cognitive thinking and how and to what extent it formats and reformats the developing digital world, one thing is clear today: our brain is adapting and increasingly adapting to new technologies and ways of presenting information.  The logical continuation is the question: will we voluntarily develop our intelligence or will our natural abilities fade away in the foreseeable future against the backdrop of dynamically progressive artificial intelligence? <br><br>  <b>Internet of Things and Informational Inequality</b> <br><br>  In the 1990s, when the Internet began to take on the shape of modern outlines, the problem of the digital barrier became one of the most serious problems.  A manifested so-called.  ‚ÄúInformation inequality‚Äù as a consequence of economic and social inequality.  At the most basic level, the benefits of digital technology have been able, as they are today, to benefit those who have access to data, information and knowledge.  Those who did not have, and in the future there will not be available digital tools, including access to the Internet itself, will lose educational opportunities, the benefits of career growth and other aspects of life that determine its quality in the modern world.  The fee for a place in the digital world in the "era of IoT" will increase significantly. <br><br>  Although network-connected refrigerators, which automatically generate shopping lists and are equipped with touch-sensitive lighting systems, are not capable of changing someone‚Äôs life radically, in the end, the technology will still exclude those who are not connected to the network.  Someone will be forced to deprive themselves of the most basic tools and functions to simplify their own lives, and someone will be forced to work harder to get a decent salary.  And here, probably, the analogy between digital technologies and their absence and cultivation of land on the farm with the help of hand tools or a combine will be appropriate. <br><br>  Strategically, the consequences can be very serious.  For example, in health care, microscopic sensors and wearable devices connected to the wrist or clothing that are connected inside the body can produce an enormous amount of information about our health.  Doctors will be able to determine the patient's condition, monitor the development of the disease in real time, prescribe and adjust the optimal dose of drugs.  Such sensors will be able to assess the risks of a heart attack or the onset of a cancer in the early stages and help prevent a stroke.  But it is obvious that those people who will not use the connected systems, and in general whole regions and countries in which such technologies will be inaccessible, will not receive these advantages.  At best, only outdated and much less effective techniques and procedures will remain their property. <br><br>  Similar problems are seen in the field of education.  Today, schools and teachers are just starting to master the possibilities of IW.  Connected devices and tagged systems open up a lot of new possibilities, including research using RFID tags (Radio-frequency identification, radio frequency identification), the world of augmented reality and other practical possibilities of using sensors, tablets and other devices that can qualitatively change the effectiveness of the learning process .  Will digitally richer people prosper at the expense of those who are poorer?  Will knowledge in the digital world in the future provide access to the best jobs?  And here is not so simple.  Some researchers (for example, Marcel Bulling, a writer and futurologist) are of the opinion that IW may accelerate the ‚Äúloss of qualification‚Äù trend.  According to the forecasts of the writer, "children will learn less, but at the short-term stage" to achieve "more."  Already in the near future, according to Bulling, the need will be lost, and over time, the ability to establish facts from memory, because the facts of interest at the moment will be available in real time. <br><br>  <b>Digital absentmindedness, what is it like?</b> <br><br>  It is hard to disagree with the fact that smartphones today have become the main means of communication.  But already expressed certain concerns about the use of these devices in cars, restaurants, medical facilities and other situations and places.  Of course, they are changing the nature of social interaction, but, according to a number of researchers, the problems of human integration into the high-tech society change for the worse.  Sherry Turkle, a professor of social research in science and technology at MIT, author of the book ‚ÄúLoneliness together: why we expect more from technology than from each other,‚Äù believes that there are also serious reasons for concern.  ‚ÄúAdvanced technology shamelessly invades our lives, replacing real relationships with people,‚Äù she says. <br><br>  The fact that the consequences of ‚Äúdigital metastasis‚Äù do not always promise a man of good is confirmed by uncompromising statistics.  According to recent studies, the time and energy spent on the concentration of attention in modern man is reduced.  At the same time, our interactive world, consisting of countless hyperlinks, besides our will, forms an outlook that implies instant reward for your efforts.  More than 64% of respondents interviewed during the experiments claim that modern technologies ‚Äúdistract students more than help them with their studies‚Äù.  Alternative studies have shown that many of them, like many of the representatives of the office staff, spend a significant part of their useful time wandering around on Facebook or Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/015/6f0/180/0156f0180f8461f2440496f60a83a4f9.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The abundance of information coming simultaneously from everywhere and in different forms reduces our ability to critical thinking.  Patricia Greenfield, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at UCLA and Director of the Center for Digital Multimedia for Children in Los Angeles, drew attention to the following fact.  College students from her group, tracking CNN news bulletins, accompanied by scrolling text, advertising and weather information, remembered key information provided by the moderator, much worse than those who watched the same issue with the same moderator, but without the creeping line and other related information.  Research conducted by Greenfield indicates that multitasking clearly "prevents people from qualitatively and deeply perceive information." <br><br>  Pedestrians with motorists also cause some concern: about a third of all collisions, according to statistics, occur as a result of the carelessness of a driver talking on the phone or typing a text message.  According to researchers of the problem, about 8% of pedestrians and cyclists in New York during the period from 2008 to 2011 were injured on the roadway during the use of mobile phones, music players and other personal gadgets.  In connection with the development of IW, the question under consideration here can be formulated as follows: will developers and engineers be able and interested to create integrated software systems for tightly managing potentially complex and unsafe processes, or will a person be ‚Äúredeemed‚Äù by continuously progressive digital systems that will absorb it attention over time more and more? <br><br>  <b>IW and legal field</b> <br><br>  Revolutionary changes in digital integration will inevitably affect the legal framework around the world.  More and more disputes today are connected with the issues of legal ownership, distribution of responsibility and resources in such areas as intellectual property, copyright, slander, trademarks, Internet crime, cyber espionage.  Jonathan Bick, associate professor of Internet law at Rutgers University Law School, explains: ‚ÄúThe legal system is struggling to keep up with modern technology.  And the fundamental problem is that such a concept as international law is very, very blurry and relative.  There are bilateral agreements, conventions and agreements that try to resolve the conflict between the parties.  But, as a rule, the letter of the law is valid only when its observance is ensured by force. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/999/f4b/d81/999f4bd81fab3400866f101a6457f3e2.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The most important obstacle, according to Paulina Reich, director of the Computer Security Institute of the Asia-Pacific Region in Tokyo and co-author of the book ‚ÄúLaw, Politics and Technology: Cyber-terrorism, Information War, and Internet Immobilization‚Äù, is: ‚ÄúWhat is in one country beyond the law, may be legal in another. ‚Äù<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, this situation is the reason why it is often impossible to figure out matters relating to jurisdiction and enforcement of obligations. The number of controversial situations related to the absence of a unified legal legislation is aggravated by the fact that data runs freely across servers, devices, and cloud services. As a result, it is almost impossible to determine at any given time where the data that has become the subject of controversy are stored, and who exactly can sue them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many leading experts are united in their opinion: the existing legislative base is no longer able to counteract the risks that are being discovered by intruders of all stripes thanks to modern computers and communication technologies.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of IW in the existing realities will turn the international (and not only) legal field into a field for countless experiments. The absence of basic data monitoring tools to date, especially given the possibility of their repeated changes on the fly, will create a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãadditional problems. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, the notion of distribution of responsibility between private property and organizations acquires a special status, because the more houses and organizations are connected to the network, the more acutely several key questions will appear: who is responsible for the problem, breakdown, possible malfunctions, especially in case they become serious material damage, injury or death?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happens if one of the countries and its legislative bodies at some point refuses to cooperate with the international community? What to do if personal information becomes available to the general public as a result of an unsuccessful combination of a number of events, none of which in itself can be recognized as the main reason? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">* * * * *</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As we can see, not a few accumulated issues related to the reverse side of the technological model, but we only visited the tip of the iceberg. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the path alternative to man-made in humanity in the short and long term, it seems, is not visible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the only way out of the situation today is to find and integrate solutions that allow a person to intelligently learn to balance between risks and methods of protection against them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it is the technologies that should, in the long run, help a person ensure that they can remain free from the problems that they create in their development, and at the practical, individual and legislative levels. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9d/d24/ce2/a9dd24ce2aa8beccbac6678565cd382f.gif" alt="image"><br><br> <i><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to </font></font><a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">T &amp; P</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and the book of Samuel Gringard </font></font><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/internet-things"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet of things</font></font></a></sub></i> <br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
