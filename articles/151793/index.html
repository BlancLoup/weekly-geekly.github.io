Perhaps one of the reasons for this is shame.  We are ashamed for our companies, for our roads, for our laws, for our laziness, for our disgusting and much for what else.  We are afraid to say it as it is, because we know that everyone knows that we know.  So what then to discuss? <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> (I moved UPD to the beginning, since there is a lot of excess in the text) I apologize for superficial and subjective judgments.  The topic was planned as a question about the reasons for the ‚Äúsecond-rate‚Äù content in RuNet.  It was found out in the comments that 1) there are reasons for this 2) second-term is very conditional and subjective 3) The author did not have the necessary information.

      Why is the social network Vkontakte - the most popular in Russia?  Because there is free music and video for every taste (yes, at any one), and the crowds, and the crowds of children who are ‚Äúsitting‚Äù on Vkontakte are much more interesting than reading Wikipedia. <br><br>  Why is Odnoklassniki not looking for Odnoklassniki?  Because this social network is made for flirting and adultery, and not to look for classmates.  And most users go there for exactly this. <br><br>  Why dating sites, forgotten all over the world, still attract thousands of new users every day?  Because famous people make very good money on this and they are not to blame.  They are entrepreneurs and they are right. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  They are right because people need it.  As you know, demand creates supply - it is an immutable law.  This is where the saddest things begin.  Why is the demand for illegal content and service constantly growing?  And most importantly, why is it growing only in Russia? <br><br>  Facebook has never had any video, audio, or related applications, until they entered the Russian market.  At the same time, advanced features appeared on the placement of photos.  At the same time, applications for flirting and dating appeared in Facebook. <br><br>  If everything is very simplified, then personally it tells me that when entering the Russian market, the largest social network in the world understands the rules of the game in this market in the same way - the key to success: more students, and more lust.  And appreciating the success of their main competitors in this market - Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, it is difficult not to agree with them. <br><br>  By the way, a few facts, perhaps known to the distinguished reader, but perhaps not. <br><br>  Vkontakte website is simply closed on the territory of several countries for violating the law. <br><br>  According to experts, Twitter does not take root in Russia in the same way as in the west (still, it‚Äôs impossible to download anything in the same place and it‚Äôs very difficult to remove someone). <br><br>  The most popular query on Yandex on LinkedIn is ‚ÄúLinkedIn what it is‚Äù, this is despite the fact that the most famous professional social network in the world has had a Russian-language interface for several years.  There is simply no demand for professionals in Russia - but there is a demand for schoolchildren, for sex, for free video, music, and so on. <br><br>  On the largest video hosting in the world YouTube.com there is less porn than in the videos of one Vkontakte user. <br><br>  According to unofficial data, the reason for every tenth divorce in Russia is social networks and dating sites (even if every 100th is no good either). <br><br>  There are so many facts confirming the general trend that I simply don‚Äôt want to go further than Google.  If anyone has a desire, you can try. <br><br>  What can this tell us about our society, and about our country and about ourselves?  In general, obviously nothing good.  Only two options come to my mind: 1. We are just an order of magnitude behind Europe and the United States in matters of personal culture.  2. We are so unhappy in life, so crammed and loaded that we don‚Äôt need anything except bread and circuses.  And we don‚Äôt care about the quality of these shows and this bread. <br><br>  And no matter how many iPhones we buy, no matter how much our presidents fly to California, no matter how many Silicon Valleys are built in the Moscow region, this will not change anything until the people themselves change, that is, we are with you. <br><br>  I apologize in advance if there are few facts in the article, conclusions are made unreasonable or too much water.  In conclusion, I want to say that I am an absolutely apolitical person and was not going to express any protest against anything.  I was only going to express my assumption that we all will have to try hard to change our attitude to ourselves all over the world.  That is, of course, if we do not plan to capture it in the near future.  The last sentence was supposed to be a joke. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> In no case do I consider it necessary or possible to either prohibit or restrict anything on the Runet.  Quite the contrary - any attempts to prohibit or restrict anything (especially from the state) will only lead to a worsening of the situation. <br><br>  <b>UPD2: I</b> apologize for superficial and subjective judgments.  The topic was planned as a question about the reasons for the ‚Äúsecond-rate‚Äù content in RuNet.  It was found out in the comments that 1) there are reasons for this 2) second-term is very conditional and subjective 3) The author did not have the necessary information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151793/</a></p>
