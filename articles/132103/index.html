The results of the weekly operation of this gadget, and I will tell in this review.  But first - two words about what it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/65376a26/3cedbfb6/8a2996e4/5cadaa93.jpg"><br><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia active, one of the last representatives of the Xperia line introduced this year, opened for Sony Ericsson a niche of smart phones for an active lifestyle or simply smart phones of increased strength.  Compact, waterproof and dustproof, with a powerful processor and Android 2.3.4.  Shockproof and unsinkable phones are a rarity, among Androids in our market, and at all, "it is such a one."  Xperia active is not the case when "gouging is not a pity," but rather, "gouging is not easy."  Extreme in my daily life is not enough, and therefore, having received it for a test, I took it to the dacha in the well to drown and chop with an ax.  In the rural surroundings, a brand new smartphone has been inscribed as a native one.

The same 3 "screen, the weight is exactly in the middle (a little heavier than mini and a bit easier for mini pro). The engineers' idea is clear: the phone for jogging or trips outside the city should be compact. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Active surprised: in the usual, almost cubic-shaped box, the richest set of accessories from all the Sony Ericsson that I have visited in the last year was hidden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4a25f568/580c1583/a8680729/5ab8ded5.jpg"><br><br>  The complete list is as follows: <br><ul><li>  the phone itself, the battery and microSD memory card 2 GB </li><li>  headphones with a regular 3 mm plug, a clip for attaching wires to clothes and ear hooks (special rubber arms for attaching headphones ‚Äî in them, ordinary earbuds sit firmly on the ear like a good headset) </li><li>  carrying case on shoulder or wrist </li><li>  clip strap </li><li>  replaceable white cap </li></ul><br><h4>  Armor </h4><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia active - the phone is bright in every sense.  First, it is orange.  Secondly, it has an original silhouette - due to the hypertrophied ‚Äúear‚Äù for attaching the strap.  It's hard not to notice and hard not to find out.  At the same time, the image was complete and harmonious.  With a replaceable white lid, it looks no less interesting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b16d906/515be97a/44fb0e4e/3e851247.jpg"><br><br>  But the most important thing in its design is functionality. <br><br>  Xperia active is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_(%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8)">IP67</a> protected (Ingress Protection Rating 67).  The numbers denote the degree of protection from the penetration of foreign objects (dustproofness) and water (moisture resistance).  The first number 6, according to Wikpedia, says that ‚Äúsome amount of dust can penetrate inside, but this does not disrupt the operation of the device.  Full protection against contact.  The next 7 means that ‚Äúduring short-term immersion the water does not fall in quantities that disrupt the operation of the device.  Permanent work in immersed mode is not expected. " <br><br>  The protection of this level Xperia active provides the hull design. <br><br>  First, all connectors (both two are microUSB and a 3.5 mm headphone jack) are closed with thick plastic plugs.  Rubber mounts look quite thoroughly and reliably: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/48e0b1c1/6ff8ab15/810aa924/fa025417.jpg"><br><br>  The lid itself is not waterproof at all - water drops under it flow.  The real protection of the ‚Äúinternal organs‚Äù of the phone is the shell, which is an internal cover, under which, in fact, the usual stuff is hidden - the battery, connectors for SIM and microSD-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e91f5c97/06683c67/01c3eed2/13c139e5.jpg"><br><br>  The tightness of the recess under the nail, which opens the lid, is provided by an elegant solution - it is located on the protruding fastener for the strap: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fa4f3453/6ef04406/40530b97/db1c5901.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the frame of genuine aluminum encircling the phone ensures that, in which case, the strap will not be easy to tear off.  Well, just symbolizes the strength of this device. <br><br>  In the details of the protection of the phone provide: <br><br>  - the frontal surface of the phone is almost completely hidden under one piece of mineral, scratch-resistant glass, which, like all other Sony Ericsson models of this year's release, is also sealed with a protective film preinstalled at the factory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b8bd3870/7213fed5/196ffa4c/94aff379.jpg"><br><br>  - Search buttons, menu and Home - touch.  The integrity of the coating violate only the auditory speaker and microphone, which, for obvious reasons, you will not thrust under the glass.  But they, as well as the LED flash on the rear panel, are protected by special membranes. <br><br>  - the power button, camera, volume rocker protrude from the body quite a bit and fit tightly.  Feeling when you press "loose", without pronounced mechanical feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/503ef632/886f38fa/45f69088/9b7ee9c0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Exploitation </h4><br>  When it comes to niche products, one of the most important issues is usage scenarios.  That is, situations in which, in fact, the usefulness of its features and manifests itself. <br><br>  So, in what situations and due to what is Xperia active superior to regular phones / smartphones? <br><ul><li>  Going to the gym, training on simulators - a comfortable mount on your arm </li><li>  Jogging / sports walking - pedometer, monitoring heart rate and heart rate, there is also an imapmyfitness app for tracking workout results. </li><li>  Fighting overweight (control of calories burned) </li></ul><br>  Which of these is suitable for me?  Morning jogging or going to the gym is practically fantastic for me.  The bike has already been removed until next spring.  I do not lose weight, but I am gaining more and more.  It remains only to go for a walk.  Our actions? <br><br>  <b>We push the phone into the case and fasten it onto the arm with the help of the strap</b> <br>  The case is very thick, almost a centimeter, foam lining - probably so that the hand does not rub and so that the phone does not drown if it suddenly falls into the case in the water.  Because of it, pushing the phone in is not very convenient, but it also sits tightly.  A thing that is absolutely necessary when running is fixed on the hand, it is guaranteed that it will not fall out and will not interfere. <br><br>  The strap is wide, but short - it sits well on the arm, but you can‚Äôt put it on your hip anymore.  The cover can be fixed on the shoulder or forearm - as it is more convenient for someone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4b6a689d/560d3d22/445e5650/7cfb89ae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/35fe67d7/92b072a4/9119a47f/c9dfbdf5.jpg"><br><br>  You need to shove the phone with an eye on the lock icon printed on the case - then on the go it will be easy to press a button and see, for example, the time and missed calls / SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1c5c6831/bcc66422/d4500faa/a50d3f4d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Wear headphones</b> <br>  Headphones with a case get along well - but a regular headset without a remote control doesn‚Äôt allow more than start / stop playback or accept / reset a call on the go.  You can rewind tracks by double-clicking on the track forward and triple-back. <br><br>  The temples in the kit - a thing completely awesome.  First, they fit into any headphones.  Secondly, they sit perfectly on the ears - no worse than other bluetooth headsets.  And thirdly, they can and should be worn in any situation - I was always irritated by the habit of inserts to fly out, for example, in a flea market in public transport or just on the go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/918f8fae/7187ca2e/d0b29c6a/f4fd5f16.jpg"><br><br>  <b>You can also insert the strap</b> <br>  The thing is simple and elegant, made well - worn plump, will not fly off.  The size of the node is controlled by a slider.  For the lace, it is convenient to quickly get the phone out of your pocket, or simply fasten it on your hand if there are no pockets during the workout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dcf97fe1/32cf6419/5ea69e8a/0e82d33f.jpg"><br><br>  So, we equipped.  You can run, you can work out on simulators, you can just walk around the city or through the woods.  In addition to accessories, special software is also responsible for the ‚Äúactive‚Äù orientation of the smartphone. <br><br>  <b>On the run</b> <br>  A pedometer is useful - it counts how many steps you have done, the average for the week and looms before you to go through 10,000 steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8975f88b/b6a322b3/03f49cc9/1053495c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In the woods</b> <br>  The digital compass, which is able to determine its relative position in the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field, will help orient yourself on the ground.  You can also add tags, notes, or choose a direction to a previously noted object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7c2cbb6e/f56ff2b3/2795f856/4c678274.png"><br><br>  <b>In the gym and on the street</b> <br>  On Xperia active iMapMyFITNESS for Android is preinstalled.  With it, the owner of the smartphone can track the route, time, distance, speed, pace and calories in real time for their activities using their fitness GPS mobile devices.  Your sync results with <a href="http://www.mapmyfitness.com/">www.MapMyFitness.com</a> !  As they write on the application developers website, iMapMyFITNESS is great for fitness, cycling, running, or to monitor weight loss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7d690887/34bf5435/9cd9bb2c/758d4a31.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/36f6cf4c/da28247e/18d6d3a0/1a4eb176.png"><br><br>  And the built-in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT%2B">ANT +</a> chip allows you to monitor your heart rate and read the pulse.  He does it not literally - you will not attach it to your heart - just with his help, a smartphone can interact with sensors of various types, including heart rate meters. <br><br>  <b>In the dark</b> <br>  Also extreme, in a sense, the situation.  In this case, Xperia active has a built-in flashlight (I immediately recall the classic <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/398070">quote from the bash</a> ).  More precisely, the LED, which is able to fulfill its role and managed - and what about - by a whole special application.  With it, you can select the backlight mode or turn the screen into a light bulb: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/935aa408/34de3b1c/7a4dd107/1504636b.png"><br><br><h4>  Unsinkable </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6e03f745/dd98080b/6564b930/66c4a9fc.jpg"><br><br>  Generally, this phone is not for swimming.  Its water resistance guarantees 100% protection in most domestic situations - splashing, falling into water.  Xperia active can withstand immersion in water to a depth of 1 m (0.1 atmosphere, then) for up to half an hour.  Boil it, for example, is not recommended.  It is probably possible to swim with him at such TTX.  True, the music in ordinary headphones while listening to it will not work - to ensure the waterproof headphones and MicroUSB connectors must be closed, as the phone itself periodically warns: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1e6857a4/f5d6f0d1/ae681a8e/c680b3fc.png"><br><br>  In the well, I did not drown him, although there was a thought in his bucket to dip it to the recommended meter depth.  Only if the bucket, for example, turned upside down, would the smartphone float away from the last amps of the depths of the Moscow underground waters.  Therefore, I limited myself to slightly helping him in the bath - in conditions for Xperia active almost resort ones. <br><br>  A telephone under water receives calls, calls itself and can even take a photo.  Thanks to the wet fingers technology (‚Äúwet fingers‚Äù - hussars, be silent!), The capacitive touchscreen Xperia active normally perceives pressing, even when wet, when it was just taken out of the water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b9b62b36/79c64aa8/5b6d6835/a2ed8cd5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/37933cf3/c69e61c6/3a6f266e/f84d0d4f.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover of black soft-touch plastic, by the way, not only feels ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù, but also does not allow the phone to slide in wet hands.  And scratches are almost imperceptible on this coating.  But if without fanaticism, it‚Äôs better not to chop it with an ax. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a4bc7659/5fa67a72/c257cde8/e9bd3ef4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7223ce09/7bd9ad55/f01d211d/663e3e7f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Platform </h4><br>  The Xperia active is the same as the other models of this year, including the top Xperia arc: a Qualcomm MSM 8255 processor with 1 GHz frequency and an Adreno 205 graphics accelerator, 512 MB RAM, 1 GB of internal memory, of which 320 MB is free for information storage user and application. <br><br><h4>  Interface </h4><br>  The ‚Äúfour-angle interface‚Äù used is already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/126949/">familiar with Xperia mini</a> .  Briefly, in the corners of the screen in the desktop display mode (or rather, there are only five tables), there are buttons for quick access to applications.  In each corner, you can group up to four buttons - total by organizing quick access to 16 applications.  This interface is the original development of Sony Ericsson, which allows you to efficiently manage the relatively small space of a 3-inch screen and is optimized for control with just one thumb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/23346de5/ee385348/fc46b0cf/5f70057d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8e5e0411/b689682b/6e32c115/5d101eb6.png"><br><br>  On the Xperia active instance I visited on the test, the latest <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/131547/">Android 2.3.4 update</a> was already installed, containing a number of original Sony Ericsson solutions. <br><br>  Of the interesting ones, I noticed a new type of folders on the desktop - now they contain previews of the applications placed in them (up to 4 icons), which also simplifies navigation by phone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c06030c/17b3b153/0b80e249/5ecffd63.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b877e7e7/16dade88/a3454055/b9fdbd3a.png"><br><br>  - and new camera features. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The main characteristics of the camera - 5 MP, flash, autofocus, smile and face recognition, panoramic <br>  shooting and 3D panorama: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/214dda4e/1dce44bd/667d2dcb/cad760fb.png"><br><br>  - as well as shooting video at up to 720p resolution at 30 frames per second: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f6dc36c3/528c9cf6/6114915d/bbeb6c64.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/album/172345/%3Fp%3D0">Photo examples</a> : <br><br> <a href="http://img.fotki.yandex.ru/get/4524/26255633.7/2_0PMN4NJz8uc2jvyMpIFPIIbpa2U%3D_862b0_9ca8073c_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/85ca5ca7/0d8a3fcb/253a60c5/dcfae8ed.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img.fotki.yandex.ru/get/5818/26255633.7/2_.655l9UVWMEXSaWh.kUDdAmxcjA%3D_862ae_98dc5adc_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4185c1f4/6c416595/5803e059/c9bf1dd0.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img.fotki.yandex.ru/get/4614/26255633.7/2_LGqszg1ChLB2b7v9DFwo.Nmpl3c%3D_862ad_2794ca91_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4cc7a7c4/5ad2eea7/ed9e0f98/a66d9993.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The possibility of panoramic shooting appeared in the latest firmware.  You need to select the shooting direction (from left to right, right to left, top to bottom or bottom to top), then follow the instructions on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5d38d4f4/b634b09c/56b89748/2a1951e1.png"><br><br>  Panoramic photos are saved in the usual .JPG resolution, 3D panoramas still save the file with the resolution .MPO, in which, I think, everything is 3D. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ef433714/238c4c87/fb965652/210d3f50.jpg"><br><br>  On the rating scale, I decided to mark the features of Xperia active, omitting the characteristics inherent in other Xperia types like a powerful processor, etc.).  So: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Dimensions and weight <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Rich equipment <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  ANT + chip <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Moisture and dustproofness <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Standard battery capacity <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Extravagant appearance <br><br>  The creators of the Sony Ericsson Xperia active position the device as a model for surfers, snowboarders, and other extreme comrades.  Indeed, it is great for water skiing in the summer or on the board in the winter while staying in touch and controlling your body - up to the pulse and calories burned.  This is a phone that should not be left on the beach. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> To read Sony Ericsson news and reviews in your habrant, simply click the heart <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/17c8075b/48a5234a/f495477b/720cd287.png"></a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/">in our profile</a> and tick our blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/%3Ffl%3Dhl">in the ribbon settings</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> In 2012, the successor to Xperia active was released - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/148835/"><b>Sony Xperia go</b> :</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/148835/"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9f/bc7/52c/c9fbc752cbc3d8d2e14a86d8de595fdb.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132103/</a></p>
