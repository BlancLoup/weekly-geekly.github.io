Where the line between absurdity and genius is difficult to say, but decided to "do it!".  I publish on my own, because  he has no karma yet. <br><br>  I quote the project description.  Word to Andrew: <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Maybe from envy or most likely from it, or maybe because of fear and misunderstanding of what is happening in the minds of modern people, I did not like Twitter.  And this dislike began to show itself sharply when another wave of news about Twitter went.  In particular, where enthusiastically, and even with some hooting, it was told about the new feat of twitter, which consisted in the fact that they began to post to the twitter the works of the classics, cutting them into SMS.  All this scares me and in all this I see postmodern intrigues in order to quickly clarify any links with the author and reduce everything to collaging and quoting.

      But since this idiocy is in full swing and the mass hysteria about microblogging has not yet died away, you can use the opportunity and bring this case to complete absurdity.  What could be less micro?  That's right - nano!  Nanoblogging to the masses! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, nanoblogging, as a phenomenon, is a step beyond microbogging.  But as in my post about blue cheese, which is still the last frontier of the impudent sellers of spoiled milk, the blogosphere has a definite limit to the amount of text, less than which there is almost nowhere to reduce.  Sms-ka is one of two sentences and if you make the volume even smaller, then it becomes like a haiku contest. <br><br>  But there is a way out - these are smiles!  Why do we need words when you can write a sentence of 4-5 smiles.  Quickly recruit, all clearly, internationally, for all ages.  A motley textured porridge of smiles, like no other, is best suited for written communication within the framework of the postmodern paradigm. <br><br>  Eloch cannibal did some three dozen words and she missed.  I used to have something like a hundred or even more animated emoticons in Miranda.  Sometimes you look at them and you can see half of your life in it.  There are nouns, verbs, there are phrases with one smile and even sentences.  According to the information density, the language of smiles can be brought closer to Chinese with Japanese.  They write smiles all their life, only they are very Chinese and black and white.  In general, the concept is clear and understandable.  Sasha, for example, suggested that the license agreement also be written in the language of smiles during registration.  But there are quite understandable limitations that will have to be circumvented due to additional features. <br><br><h4>  Personification and time </h4><br>  Well, in the first place, everything is good in smiles, as in the dictionary of a language, except for the fact that smiles are symbols impersonal and devoid of context and personification.  Simply put, we can show a running football player or a tired character, but we cannot write the name of the person in question.  We cannot do the same thing in a simple, clear way, whether it is a smile in the present tense, future or past. <br><br>  But there is a salvation - these are hyperlinks!  In short, hypersmile is a symbol to which content is attached that describes the person, object or phenomenon that is indicated by this smile.  By hovering the hypersmile with a mouse, we can see either a pop-up photo of the character with a link to its page in LiveJournal, or a link to a YouTube clip, or a link to another nano-blog post.  In general, as for ordinary hyperlinks, you can use the favicon of the sites themselves as their emoticons - this will be their face in the smiley space. <br><br>  The issue over time can be solved as follows.  Since time is a characteristic of space, the background color can be used to render it.  For example, the usual white background is the present, the red-brown-gray is the past, and the pale blue passing into the ultraviolet will be the future.  I hope that by the time the project gains strength, the monitors will be LED and there will be an ultraviolet LED in the matrix.  It will be possible to check bucks with a regular monitor, bringing them to the "black" screen. <br><br><h4>  Fantasize on </h4><br>  It is terrible to think what possibilities open up on the part of customization.  Personal smiles of Alla Pugacheva, Putin and other famous people.  A bottle of heinichen, a pot of borshch ... Google translator will translate from all languages ‚Äã‚Äãavailable to him into the language of smiles and back, taking into account national specifics.  Because it is obvious if your friend is Korean, then his smile will be understandably different from those born in Russia.  I have already seen one Japanese forum in which smiles with slanted eyes. <br><br>  And when in a year will smiles in HD quality?  This is not an old 16x16 icons.  There is already 48x48 or 96x96.  Wide format emoticons with a width greater than height.  There you can almost see the number of the machine written in 4x6 pixels.  For completely marginal, as well as connoisseurs of teletype oldfesh communication will have to raise the version on text smiles.  Full words prisoners between two asterisks will not be considered words and will be called smiles.  All other words must be either removed from the text or replaced with smiles.  For example, * ANDREY * :) is not my name, but a smile with my smiling face. <br><br>  Many more questions with smiles will have to be solved, and on this topic you can write a PhD thesis.  Therefore, completing this post, I want to look into the future.  Look at how nanoblogging will affect the blogosphere as a whole, and how people's lives will change.  And it is logical to assume that after the miniaturization stage, there will be a rollback to the previous format, but the language will remain hypersmile.  People will write memoirs with the help of tools resembling 3D-studio max, but only very simplified and not requiring special skills.  Hypermails will come out of a linear two-dimensional flat format and will become voluminous as the space around them.  There will be no more gaps between sentences of one paragraph - they will be glued together by video morphing into a continuous action. <br><br>  So there will be a return to rock art as a preservation of social experience.  Only this time it will be multblogs in the world wide web. <br><br>  Ps.  I guess I almost managed to reach the degree of absurdity worthy of Twitter and a new project.  Now we are looking for investors :) Send your suggestions and wishes through the <a href="http://www.twinscom.ru/offer/">form on our website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Retreat </h4><br>  If you try, you can knock out government funding for this.  How does the word "nano" - is now synonymous with cultural high-tech legal and government-encouraged good cause;). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77102/</a></p>
