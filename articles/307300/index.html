  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cambium cnPilot - inexpensive WiFi, which surprised us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It‚Äôs no secret that there are a lot of WiFi solutions on the market right now.  You can even say that too much - his eyes run.  And now it‚Äôs not just about "consumer" home "deertrist", which under any brand in any building you can buy, probably, a thousand and never repeat it: talking about systems that are positioned as equipment for building large WiFi networks with centralized management .  This means that we do not just put dozens of APs in one place (hereinafter - an access point), but also set them up in such a way that either they all know about each other and take into account each other‚Äôs frequencies in radio planning, they carry out customer handover, or a separate network node controls everything at once as one large network. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/7ab/d02/4e47abd02c04472e91272269a6a30b57.jpg"></div><br>  Otherwise, the installation of a large number of access points within the visibility of each other will not improve, but rather worsen the situation due to mutual interference and loss of communication by customers when switching between points. <br>  If you take a closer look at the whole variety of corporate solutions, you can conditionally divide them into two large groups: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Productive enterprise-solutions from well-known manufacturers, first division players: Cisco, Ruckus, Aruba.  These systems have excellent performance, scalability, allow you to build networks on thousands of access points, support seamless handover, 3G-offload, can be integrated with all sorts of registration systems via SMS ... and another, many more functions.  Alas, the cost of making this tier starts from values ‚Äã‚Äãof about $ 500 for a ‚Äúpoint-to-place‚Äù (access point plus space and license on the controller).  Naturally, in many projects, especially constrained by the budget framework, even after the application of all discounts, such a price is denoted, frankly, barrage. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> Something very cheap: Ubiquiti, MikroTik and hundreds of others.  They bribe their price in the range of 80 - 200 dollars for a modern access point, but the cheapness carries many unpleasant surprises - limited packet performance, problems with a large number of subscribers on the AP (more than 15, that is, quite a bit).  The controller of such a network actually turns out to be actually a system of monitoring and application of settings, there is no really working handover (often what is, can be called a handover, only if you register this word as a technology name), there is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISPr">WISPr</a> .  Scalability of solutions in practice is limited to a hundred or two TDs (and even substantially less than a hundred), and high-dense-implementation (yes generally a little bit loaded network with demanding, like voice transmission, services) is better not to think.  Checked by many of our partners.

      Is it possible to combine the best of both worlds and get the functionality for an affordable price?  Why not. <br><br>  We already have publications about Cambium products in our blog, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/213151">for example,</a> we tested the Cambridge 650 RRL at that time. Cambium, the proud heirs of the famous Motorola Canopy, started building new equipment based on time-tested solutions and gradually upgrading and cheapening them, deliberately moving from expensive point-to-point links of the PTP 650 and 8xx series and the expensive point-to-multipoint systems of the PMP 450 on proprietary transport protocols in the direction of not so cheap, but much more functional and reliable than the point-to-multipoint ePMP systems than Ubiquiti .  This series, which was codenamed Avenger in development, has come a long way in its development and several software revisions back had the opportunity to work with clients not only on "their" transport protocols, but also on the usual and understandable 802.11.  We see the result of this work in a serious increase in ePMP sales volumes - operators, having played enough cheap solutions and having tried Cambium, make their choice. <br><br>  It is logical that, by developing product lines for operators, Cambium now also offers a WiFi solution.  And with the same features that the operators already liked in the EPMP, that is, scalable, manageable, productive and inexpensive.  On the one hand, there are few models, but on the other hand, it is enough for any applications. <br><br><h3>  Home routers </h3><br>  First of all, these are so-called home routers - devices, in addition to APs, that include an Ethernet cable switch and ports for connecting telephone lines.  Why on this saturated, before precipitation, the market needs more players?  And then, since it is this device that can be controlled by the operator, this same operator can now see the network connectivity and link status directly to the subscriber devices, and not to the port of his <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Premises_Equipment">CPE</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/763/117/57c/76311757c44945ca93935d12613a5acb.png"><br><br>  In fact, the 200/201 index hides several models that differ in support of 802.11ac (201) or simpler 802.11n (200), the presence or absence of PoE Out for ePMP and RJ-11 ports. <br><br><h3>  WiFi for offices </h3><br>  Secondly, for offices, Cambium offers a modern 802.11ac wave 1 access point with two channels that fits into the power consumption of the 802.3af standard.  The device is compact, with support for 16 SSIDs, workable (unlike Ubiquiti) traffic prioritization and, which is not very typical for this price segment, seamless roaming (IEEE 802.11r). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/872/c3d/5bb/872c3d5bbf194f4bb336886f5b2e706b.png"><br><br><h3>  Street wifi </h3><br>  Thirdly, this is the new all-weather dual-band 802.11ac access points with integrated antennas in a compact IP67 package.  It seems nothing special, a typical Enterprise solution of the middle class: two gigabit ports with 802.3af support, two dual-channel 802.11ac Wave 1 radio modules. Only the prices were surprised - see the table at the end of the article ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a41/1e8/000/a411e8000dad402e98ada8478145f8d6.png"><br><br><h3>  Comparison with competitors </h3><br>  Consider the overall functionality of the solution easier and more visually in comparison: <br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Manufacturer</b> </td><td>  <b>Ubiquiti</b> </td><td>  <b>Cambium</b> </td><td>  <b>Ruckus</b> </td><td>  <b>Cisco</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Model </td><td>  UAP-AC-PRO / Outdoor </td><td>  E400 / E500 </td><td>  R310 / T300 </td><td>  1700/1562 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of radio modules </td><td>  2, 802.11ac W1 </td><td>  2, 802.11ac W1 </td><td>  2, 802.11ac W1 </td><td>  2, 802.11ac W1 / 2 </td></tr><tr><td>  MIMO </td><td>  3x3 </td><td>  2x2 </td><td>  2x2 </td><td>  3x3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition </td><td>  802.3af </td><td>  802.3af </td><td>  802.3af </td><td>  802.3at </td></tr><tr><td>  Seamless roaming </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Yes, 802.11r and OKC </td><td>  Yes, 802.11r and OKC </td><td>  Yes, 802.11r and OKC </td></tr><tr><td>  SSID </td><td>  4 on the radio </td><td>  16 on the radio </td><td>  8 on the radio </td><td>  16 on the radio </td></tr><tr><td>  VLAN </td><td>  On SSID </td><td>  Per ssid or client </td><td>  Per ssid or client </td><td>  Per ssid or client </td></tr><tr><td>  Controller </td><td>  Software x86, cloudy, arm </td><td>  Software x86, cloud </td><td>  Software x86, hardware </td><td>  Software x86, hardware </td></tr><tr><td>  Hotspot 2.0 </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Conclusions about the functionality </h3><br>  The general conclusion that can be made on these several comparison parameters - Cambium is significantly closer to recognized enterprise solutions than the UniFi we are used to.  First of all, of course, striking support for seamless roaming - something that was never enough for Ubiquiti and that they tried unsuccessfully to add with the Zero Handoff function (the actual inoperability of which forced the manufacturer to refuse it).  The second important point is the HotSpot 2.0 service, which eliminates the need for Web authentication in each new network ‚Äî pay a subscription to one operator, and connect to the networks of all its partners: that is, regardless of SSID, it allows you to organize an analogue of roaming in cellular networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a0/196/44b/3a019644bb69466f848767dd8e7fa7ee.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Network management system </h3><br>  A few words must be said about the network management system.  It is called cnMaesto, and a full review of it will take a whole separate article, or even a small training course.  First of all, this system is not just a simple utility for applying settings to a selected group of APs, but a powerful complex of monitoring and configuration of a large heterogeneous wireless network into which you can access and from which you can control all types of Cambium equipment - from a radio relay link to a home router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f7/a56/95e/8f7a5695e45e4fe49dc72b59df33581f.png"><br>  In short, cnMaestro is able to simultaneously create thousands of objects (that is, to enter into the system at once whole ‚Äúbushes‚Äù of the last mile, for example, on the ePMP1000, and hundreds of home routers connected to subscriber households), using their flexible settings using the flexible templates, (and also immediately call them by templates, group, tune radio modules, and so on - the syntax of templates is already quite flexible at this stage to automate almost any task arising at the stage of putting equipment into operation).  Software update by groups of devices on a schedule, monitoring of all key parameters of radio connections at any stage - the system is designed to ensure comfortable control of large radio networks.  Unlike other solutions, for example, from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/114722">Ubiquiti</a> or <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306658">Xclaim</a> , cnMaestro leaves it possible to distribute its own network settings to all points, that is, not only controls the use of radio settings, but also allows you to configure, for example, a tunnel to the provider at each point. <br><br>  cnMaestro is available both as a cloud and as a local image, which is especially nice for our operators who do not trust the clouds.  It is located at the address and currently requires a single Cambium support login for registration (obtained free of charge in the Support section of the site).  At the time of publication of the article for the controller in its free version, there is one restriction: the number of managed items cannot be more than 2500, this number includes both ePMP bases and subscriber modules, as well as subscriber TDs.  Obviously, the system resource requirements for the cloud version are limited by the browser requirement, which will display the system interface, the local installation requirements (the virtual machine is available for download in the corresponding support section on <a href="http://www.cambiumnetworks.com/">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> as follows: <br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Number of devices</b> </td><td>  <b>The required amount of vCPU</b> </td><td>  <b>The required amount of RAM, in GB</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  From 1 to 100 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  From 101 to 1000 </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  From 1001 </td><td>  four </td><td>  eight </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Price comparison </h3><br>  Thus, Cambium now provides an opportunity to build a relatively inexpensive WiFi carrier-level with sufficient functionality and, most importantly, flexible and convenient monitoring and management.  Alerting the question ‚ÄúHow inexpensive?‚Äù, We will voice the recommended prices: <br><br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  Manufacturer </td><td>  Indoor model </td><td>  Price </td><td>  Outdoor model </td><td>  Price </td></tr><tr><td>  Ubiquiti </td><td>  UAP AC PRO </td><td>  $ 149 </td><td>  UAP AC outdoor </td><td>  $ 489 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Cambium</b> </td><td>  <b>E400</b> </td><td>  <b>$ 269</b> </td><td>  <b>E500</b> </td><td>  <b>$ 469</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Ruckus </td><td>  R310 </td><td>  $ 670 </td><td>  T300 </td><td>  $ 1900 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cisco </td><td>  1702 </td><td>  $ 695 </td><td>  1562 </td><td>  $ 1695 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Access points are already in stock, you can try.  <a href="http://www.comptek.ru/">We ourselves</a> have already checked, were surprised and are already preparing an article with the results of comparative testing of Ruckus, Cambium and Ubiquiti.
