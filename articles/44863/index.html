Everyone-everybody feels on their own that this is not at all useful for the body ... <br><br>  This is one side of my observations. <br><br>  The second side: the last few months among friends spread information about the five exercises, the so-called ‚ÄúEye of the rebirth‚Äù, many began to practice.

      1) There is very little time to practice; <br>  2) The exercises are fairly light (especially the first is to spin around its axis clockwise); <br>  3) Sensations in the body immediately, after a few days (which gives support for further practice); <br>  4) Not only the body improves, but somehow the spiritual and mental strength increases, confidence is added, good mood appears more often ... <br><br>  I decided to write, because today my husband was surprised to say that after five days of practice he began to feel that when he goes to bed, the body needs to struggle with all his strength, raise his hands up (you know - babies always do that after sleep) - and such a small thing changed life, it became a more conscious attitude towards yourself, your body. <br><br>  Maybe someone has long thought of something like: ‚ÄúI can do a little charge in the morning ...‚Äù, but there was not enough of the last drop of determination ... I‚Äôm sharing information and supporting myself with all my soul!  Work out  You will lose nothing, and you will probably find a lot. <br><br>  Alternatively, a file with a description of the exercises can be found here: <br>  <a href="http://vsoznanii.ru/load/0-0-0-5-20">vsoznanii.ru/load/0-0-0-5-20</a> <br><br>  Visual performance of exercises by moving men (gif-pictures): <br>  <a href="http://russznahar.narod.ru/Oko/gif_test.htm">russznahar.narod.ru/Oko/gif_test.htm</a> <br><br>  A full description of the ‚ÄúEye of the Revival‚Äù plus the recommendations of A. Sydersky can be found here: <br>  <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/3844676000/Oko.zip.html">narod.ru/disk/3844676000/Oko.zip.html</a> <br><br>  (thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/myther/" class="user_link">myther</a> for the tip!) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Stand straight, arms spread out so that they are parallel to the floor, palms facing down.  You should not slouch or strain your shoulders; your arms should be at shoulder level. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mentally imagine the dial on the floor, in the center of which you are facing the number 12. When you begin to rotate, turn in the same direction as the hands of the clock. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rotate from left to right, describing a full circle.  Start and finish the rotation should be at a slow pace, gradually picking up and reducing speed.  This will help you protect your body from unwanted stress.  During rotation, breathe slowly and evenly. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You may feel a little dizzy.  To avoid this, focus your gaze on a fixed point straight ahead before starting the rotation.  Starting to turn, try as long as possible not to take your eyes off this point.  When this point again comes into your view, focus on it again. <br>  ‚Ä¢ At the end of the rotation, take a few deep breaths and exhalations through the nose.  Relax your body.  Lie down and get ready to move on to exercise II.  Wait until even the slightest dizziness disappears.  Do not start the next exercise until you are completely normal. <br><br>  Tips <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Let your legs simply follow your hands. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Try not to leave the place during rotation.  End the rotation at about the same place where you started. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Make sure the chin does not drop down and the shoulders remain relaxed. <br><br><h4>  II </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Lie on the floor, face up, legs extended.  It is best to perform this exercise on a thick carpet or exercise mat - this will help avoid injury to the spine and contact with the cold floor. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Extend the arms parallel to the body, palms facing down, fingers tight. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Inhale with your nose, lifting your head from the floor and pressing your chin against the sternum.  At the same time lift straight legs vertically upwards, being careful not to tear the pelvis off the floor. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is very important to keep your legs completely straight.  If you are unable to achieve this, you can bend them at the knees just as much as necessary.  In the future, you will learn to raise the legs without bending their knees. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Slowly lower your head and legs back to the floor at the same time, while keeping your legs as straight as possible.  At the same time make a smooth exhalation nose. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Let all your muscles relax for a moment, and then repeat this movement. <br><br>  Tips <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ When you lift your legs, press firmly on the floor with your palms, forearms, elbows, and shoulders. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hold the stomach in and mentally focus on it.  When you raise your head, it should remain relaxed, and it should be lowered slowly and synchronously to the movements of the legs. <br><br><h4>  III </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Kneel on the floor, bend your toes so that their pads touch the floor, straighten the rest of your body. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Clasp the back of the thighs with your palms, so that your thumb is facing forward, breathe with your nose. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Exhale with your nose and gently tilt your head forward, pressing your chin against the sternum. <br>  ‚Ä¢ With a slow and deep breath, bend back, arching the spine and gently tilting the head back as far as possible. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Exhale and return to the starting position.  Inhale and repeat the exercise. <br><br>  Tips <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ For support and balance, you can rest your hands on your hips during the deflection and return. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keep your head and neck relaxed. <br><br><h4>  IV </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sit on the floor, straighten your back and stretch your legs in front of you so that your feet are shoulder-width apart. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Place your palms on the floor near the buttocks, keep your arms straight, fingers pointing forward.  Inhale. <br>  ‚Ä¢ As you exhale, press your chin against the sternum.  Then take a slow breath again, tilt your head back as far as possible and lift your torso forward to a horizontal position.  Your torso will rest on the arms and legs bent at the knees.  Hands should be straight and perpendicular to the floor, chest, abdomen and thighs - parallel to the floor.  Feet should not come off the floor. <br>  ‚Ä¢ While in this position, tighten every muscle in your body and hold your breath.  Then slowly exhale, completely emptying the lungs, relax all your muscles and return to the starting position. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pause, inhale and repeat the movement. <br><br>  Tips <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ When you lift the torso, push down hard on the floor with your palms and heels. <br>  ‚Ä¢ When you raise the pelvis, you can mentally focus on this movement. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tighten the buttocks to help lower back movement. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Imagine that you hold a basketball between your knees, this will help you not to push them apart. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keep your head in line with your spine.  Start the movement by pressing your chin against the sternum.  Then return your head to its natural position while lifting your torso upwards.  Make sure that the head is on a line parallel to the floor and does not deviate from it downwards. <br><br><h4>  V </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Assist the prone position by stooping.  The body rests on the palms and pads of the toes.  Shoulders should be directly above the palms, feet shoulder-width apart. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Raise the torso so that the legs and pelvis do not touch the floor.  You must bend backwards, the chest is above the pelvis. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Take a slow breath with your nose and gently tilt your head back as far as possible. <br>  ‚Ä¢ While continuing to inhale, lift the buttocks upward so that your body is a regular triangle.  When you assume this position, your head will naturally lean forward.  Press your chin against the sternum so that you can see your feet.  The heels can be slightly raised, and the rest of the foot is pressed to the floor. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Exhale fully and return to the prone position with your arms and legs straight and your head thrown back.  Inhale and repeat the movement. <br><br>  Tips <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Remember that you do not need to return to the starting position while lying on the floor until you complete the entire series of repetitions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hold the stomach in and the buttocks up while moving up. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mentally focus on the shoulders and back of the legs.  Imagine that you pull out the tailbone in the direction of the sky. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keep your head and neck relaxed to avoid unnecessary tension in the neck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44863/</a></p>
