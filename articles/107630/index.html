  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wikileaks CEO intends to live and work in Switzerland</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, users of Habr will remember that not so long ago, Julian Essendzha, the founder and leader of the Wikileaks project, was tried by the Swedish authorities to accuse him of rape.  Even for people who were not particularly advanced in terms of knowledge of the laws, it was clear that the accusation, as they say, is ‚Äúsewn with white threads‚Äù.  Interestingly, the case on him tried to start after Essendzh tried to obtain a residence permit in this country.  In general, it did not work out.  Now he will try to ask the Swiss authorities to shelter him (and, possibly, the service itself). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Apparently, a real hunt, of a political nature, really began after Essendge, since he was seriously concerned about personal security.  No wonder - as it was already written on Habr√©, some quite official officials, high-ranking US officials, have expressed the view that the service itself needs to be ‚Äúthundered‚Äù, and in some way or another can neutralize Essendge itself.  In general, we all know how the United States can find ways to achieve its own goals. <br><br>  Essenge is often called the No. 1 threat in the United States, putting him even ahead of such a dangerous organization as al-Qaeda and other enemies of the country.  He himself believes that the persecution by the United States is a violation of democratic norms, since the United States is not only not trying to investigate flagrant cases of violation of various laws by the military of this country in different countries, but also trying to neutralize those who are going to do it in some way or another.

      So, after the publication of documents about the US campaign in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States really tried and is trying to remove published documents from public access, trying to prevent the situation from recurring.  Apparently, it was not without the USA in Sweden, which tried to ‚Äúpin‚Äù Essendz, who sought the help of the authorities of this country. <br><br>  Well, let's see now how Switzerland will behave, a country that has long been famous for its ability to maintain neutrality in the most difficult cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107630/</a></p>
