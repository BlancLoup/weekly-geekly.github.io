That's right, turn it into a portable machine to search for all sorts of vulnerabilities!  In the report, we will look at tools that will help create a machine for reversing binaries, server testing and searching for web vulnerabilities from an ordinary Android phone.  We will try to do without root, honestly, honestly!

      <b>Anna Shtyrkina, Anastasia Yarmak: ‚ÄúDivide and conquer, or why we need secret sharing schemes‚Äù</b> <br>  Imagine that there is information whose knowledge gives a person unlimited power.  These may be: launch codes for ballistic missiles, <s>evidence of the existence of reptilians</s> , the origin of John Snow. <br>  Would you, username, trust access to this information to one person?  And if not, how to divide the key to such data between a group of trusted people without the risk of leakage? <br>  The answer to this question was independently proposed by Shamir and Blackley in 1979.  The report will talk about the concept of a secret sharing scheme, as well as its most interesting applications. <br><br>  <b>Ilya Petrov: ‚ÄúVulnerabilities are not toys for you!‚Äù</b> <br>  What is inherent in the gaming code and gaming equipment?  What problems can you encounter if you have these vulnerabilities?  In the report we will consider critical vulnerabilities in the gaming industry and will tell interesting facts about their exploitation. <br><br>  <b>Timur Yalymov: ‚ÄúBIOS under protection?‚Äù</b> <br>  Have you decided to turn a computer into a brick?  No problem, flash BIOS!  In the report we will look at possible options for changing the firmware BIOS of the motherboard, including from the OS.  And most importantly, we will analyze the existing protection systems, which are implemented by various manufacturers.  You will learn how lazy the BIOS developers are, and how to properly make your protected BIOS! <br><br>  <b>Ilya Shaposhnikov: ‚ÄúOne Day in the Life of a Receiver‚Äù</b> <br>  What is common between OracleDB SQL injection and reverse engineering Transcend USB-SD adapter?  Absolutely nothing.  Our invited speaker will tell two completely unrelated interesting stories from the life of an information security specialist. <br><br>  <b>Vadim Shmatov: ‚ÄúIs a quantum computer so terrible as it is painted?‚Äù</b> <br>  The report will tell about the principles of the quantum computer and the progress of modern companies in the creation of this computing device.  Then, the threats that a quantum computer represents modern asymmetric and symmetric cryptosystems (Shor‚Äôs algorithm, Grover‚Äôs algorithm) will be considered.  Finally, let us analyze the results of the work of our own implementation of these algorithms running on the ibmqx4 quantum computer (IBM Q 5 Tenerife) and draw conclusions about the possibility of conducting quantum attacks now and in the near future. <br><br><h2>  And show </h2><br>  <b>Ilya Petrov: "Developing a Home VirusTotal"</b> <br>  This workshop will be devoted to the development of a pocket antivirus complex operating in the LiveCD mode directly from a flash drive!  We will teach you to scan files using various antiviruses, poke the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a> hypervisor, learn the <a href="https://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a> software interface and write some Python code. <br><br>  <b>Vadim Shmatov: "Shoot down the drone!"</b> <br>  Participants of the workshop will be able to assemble their own powerful directional jammer!  First, we will assemble and program a conventional omnidirectional silencer using an Arduino board and a radio module.  And then we connect a directional antenna and verify the performance of this noise generator, disabling the experimental drone! <br><br>  <b>Maxim Votchenikov: ‚ÄúHello ma ## facturer!‚Äù</b> <br>  The workshop will be devoted to an overview of how to define network devices, when the notorious nmap does not give the desired result.  Let us tell you how to determine the manufacturer of the device, its model and the version of the installed firmware.  In addition, we will prepare a special stand, through which participants in the workshop will be able to test their knowledge in practice. <br><br><h2>  And what else? </h2><br>  All of the above - only a small part of the planned!  As always, there will be entertainment and contests for which you can receive gifts.  Each participant will also be able to compete for the main prize of Twitter quiz! <br><br>  And this year Sberbank is the general sponsor of NeoQUEST, who also prepared something interesting for the guests! <br><br>  Like last year, in parallel with NeoQUEST the MITSOBY scientific and technical conference will be held.  NeoQUEST guests are highly recommended to visit - science in infobox is necessary and important! <br><br>  <b>Entry for all is free, you first need to register</b> <a href="https://neoconf.ru/"><b>HERE</b></a> ! <br><br>  So, the <b>‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù NeoQUEST-2019</b> will be held <b>on June 26</b> , at the address - St. Petersburg, the Parkline Resort and Spa hotel (metro Krestovsky Island, Ryukhina St., 9 a). <br>  Beginning at <b>11 00</b> ! <br><br>  See you at NeoQUEST! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456026/</a></p>
