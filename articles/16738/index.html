      Devices unlocked (i.e., with the possibility of using any cellular operators; most often already Russified, with a set of necessary third-party software) and, accordingly, original (tied to sometime AT &amp; T or O2).  So what to choose?  As a person who is technically more or less developed (still an engineer), I thought that I would buy a locked one ‚Äúfor inexpensive‚Äù and do everything myself, since I already had experience with firmware and its restoration on Siemens (up to cutting testpoints at home).  But not everything is so simple ... <br><br>  The possibility of unlocking the iPhone was due to an error in the bootloader code (version 3.x), which allows you to replace the Apple cryptographic key and execute arbitrary code.  Under pressure from Apple, Infineon (on whose logic the iPhone nodes were assembled) closed the gap, releasing a new version of the bootloader (with index 4).  Starting from this moment, devices with firmware 1.1.2 are being released.  At the moment, you can not unlock them.  A few days ago, it was possible to get the bootloader code and work is already underway to find vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Please note that on a phone with factory firmware less than 1.1.2 you can put it and you can octate.  But devices with factory 1.1.2 can not be unlocked by the new bootloader. <br><br>  Those who have already bought an iPhone with firmware version 1.1.2 or a 4.x bootloader (the week number in the serial number older than 38 is numbers after 7v7 and 7s7) can be used as an iPod Touch (instructions for activating on the web), or make Multisim with images of your SIM card and SIM card operator, which is locked to a specific version of the phone. <br><br>  A few days ago in America it was possible to buy devices with the firmware version 1.1.1 and the old bootloader version in retail, but apparently the stocks in the warehouses are coming to an end, and people are increasingly finding the firmware 1.1.2 and the bootloader version 4 in the purchased phones. x <br><br>  And here we come to the main thing.  If you decide to buy an unmounted machine in Russia, then with a probability of 99% you will be sold a phone with a factory firmware version 1.1.2.  After all, they have to go somewhere.  Prices for "Russified", in both senses, the iPhone is kept at a fairly high level - an average of 20 thousand rubles.  With the release of the ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù for firmware 1.1.2, the price will certainly fall, but even people who have found vulnerability in previous versions of the iPhone can‚Äôt name the deadline. <br><br>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://docs.google.com/View%3Fdocid%3Ddgzw9xs_0gfhxns%26pli%3D1" title="iPhone Status Ticker">iPhone Status Ticker</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/forum/" title="iPhone forum">iPhone forum</a> <br>  <a href="http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/1.1.2_Bootloader" title="Information about the new loader">Information about the new loader</a> <br><br>  UPD: Minus, - comments in the studio. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16738/</a></p>
