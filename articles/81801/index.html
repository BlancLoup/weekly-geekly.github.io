  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless happiness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Oddly enough, I‚Äôm not going to talk about Wi-Fi, or even Wi-Max, in this topic.  It's about wireless headphones, quite a handy thing in everyday use.  Are you tired of winding on the wire?  Cursing, stumbling over a long cord, stretched like a cunning trap from the TV or curling a snake on the floor from the computer?  Then I invite you to get acquainted with my successful purchase of headphones <b>Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã110</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f43/2e2/60a/f432e260a7ce6c4e02368c39c1ef38e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I made this purchase, hoping to find the optimal price / quality ratio, and it seems I found it.  Headphones are suitable for both TV and laptop, phone, tape recorder and any other device.  The main thing is that he had a 3.5 mm jack (6.5 mm adapter included), and you have an outlet on hand.  In my opinion not bad, but let's take a closer look at the characteristics.

    <h4>  Specifications </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Title</b> </td><td>  Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã110 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Type of</b> </td><td>  Open, dynamic </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Frequency range</b> </td><td>  22 - 19500 Hz </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Sensitivity</b> </td><td>  106 dB </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Data link</b> </td><td>  Radio channel </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Broadcast Range</b> </td><td>  150 m </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Duration of work</b> </td><td>  25 hours </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Headphone weight</b> </td><td>  230 g </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  I want to separately note that the range of broadcasting depends on the number of walls and various obstacles, as is the case with Wi-Fi.  However, the signal covers the entire apartment.  You can even walk on the landing, if you wish.  I did not move away from the transmitter for longer distances. <br>  Another important point is the duration of the work.  It depends very much on what you use.  Ordinary batteries are dying pretty quickly, so I recommend immediately buy rechargeable batteries.  They hold much longer and can always be recharged.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt think of it right away, after having killed a couple of packages of ordinary batteries ... I am very pleased that immediately, complete with headphones, there are already batteries, which for the first time eliminates shopping.  By the way, about the kit. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Considering the price of the device (we'll talk about it later), the package is pretty ordinary.  It includes a transmitter and receiver (actually, the headphones themselves), an adapter, an adapter for 6.5 mm, 2 AAA batteries and several instructions in Russian, which is good news. <br><br>  The transmitter is quite compact and not heavy (230 g).  He easily found a place near the laptop and now stands there, and if necessary, he easily hides in a small drawer / cabinet.  On the transmitter itself, you can choose one of three radio channels. <br><br>  As for the headphones themselves, the sound quality completely satisfies me.  It is much higher than the quality of all those headphones that I used before.  However, I am not an audiophile or audiophile, so I will not write about ‚Äúlow frequencies fall through‚Äù, ‚Äúpoorly heard the bass‚Äù.  One thing I can say for sure is that the headphones do not hiss, and if they still do, it is enough to simply turn the wheel to adjust the frequencies or change the frequency. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Immediately make a reservation, buying a new DSLR is still an unrealized item of my shopping plan, so please take photos as they are.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adf/7dc/c74/adf7dcc7440717a93db87658936da7a5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Despite the impressive weight, absolutely no pressure and very comfortable to sit on his head</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a7/ad9/2ac/3a7ad92ac9c714a4b5fc9c0fa03cfa85.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the left earpiece is a power button, and inside it has two AAA batteries <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e87/19a/8a7/e8719a8a74ee6d2d850a8f34e5afeaa0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>On the right are the volume controls and frequency settings, the main thing is not to accidentally mix them up</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/508/d8f/93a/508d8f93a37de3e1f969669357add310.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Actually, the transmitter itself.  When the signal is transmitted, the light is on.  Bottom switch between 3 radio channels <br><br><h4>  Price, totals </h4><br>  <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> from 2 485 to 3 955 rubles <br>  On <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/i.html%3F_kw%3Dsennheiser%2520rs%2520110%26_fcid%3D168%26_localstpos%3D%26_sticky%3D1%26_stpos%3D%26gbr%3D1">Ebay</a> from $ 85 with delivery <br><br>  By the way, taking this opportunity, I recommend <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hpodcasts/72733/">learning how to buy on Ebay</a> , if you do not know how.  I myself, bought these headphones for 2590 rubles, at that time it was the best price in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  If you want a better sound or a longer work without recharging the batteries, then you can pay attention to the older models of the line ( <a href="">RS 120</a> , <a href="">RS 130</a> and <a href="">RS 140</a> ). <br><br>  If you, like me, are satisfied with such a model, then I suggest weighing its pros and cons: <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Price <br>  - Duration of work <br>  - The presence of three radio channels <br>  - Headphones are very comfortable to sit on your head. <br>  - Batteries included <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Perhaps not enough sound quality, compared with other models <br>  - The proximity of the wheel sound and adjust the frequency, the first time they can be confused <br>  - If you lower your head down, the headphones roll off the head :) <br><br>  Let me remind once again that it is better to immediately buy rechargeable batteries in order not to translate the usual ones. <br>  Well that's all.  Always happy to answer questions in the comments, if something is not enough illuminated. <br><br>  <b>Have a good sound without wires!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81801/</a></p>
