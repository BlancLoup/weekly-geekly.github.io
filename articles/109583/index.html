About what it is and why it was necessary described here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oktell/blog/108726/">http://habrahabr.ru/company/oktell/blog/108726/</a> .  That is, we had four working call-center servers, equally configured and with approximately the same configuration of external and internal lines, users and setting up the internal database.  For each of the servers, the operator received a uniform call load, but the servers reacted differently! <br><br>  N Server configuration and operating system <br>  1 T1300 @ 1.66 1 GB of RAM, Windows 2003 Standard Ed.  R2 SP1 32 bit <br>  2 Intel Core Duo E8400 @ 3000 4 GB of RAM, Windows 2003 Standard Ed.SP1 32 bit <br>  3 Intel Pentium 4 3GHz 2 GB of RAM, Windows 2003 Standard Ed.  SP2 32 bit <br>  4 E3400 @ 2.60 2 GB of RAM, Windows 2003 Standard Ed.  R2 SP2 32 bit <br><br>  Faced complaints about the quality of communication.  Moreover, they complained not about every call, but about ‚Äúsome‚Äù.  They complained about the "quicks", which are very characteristic of VoIP telephony. <a name="habracut"></a>  Quite quickly it was found that the cause of the appearance of the "Quacks" was an unpredictable increase in processor utilization in one (first) of the call-center servers as the load increased.  And all this despite the fact that other servers did not notice such a load at all, and there was no increase in the load on the processor with the same number of calls.  Even in spite of the fact that the first server was significantly weaker than all the others, such a picture - the growth of processor utilization to 100% - should not have been observed.

      You probably shouldn‚Äôt say that we have gone through the standard path of ‚Äúwiping headlights‚Äù, ‚Äúkicking wheels‚Äù, etc. In the end, we came to the conclusion that neither the settings of the call-center itself, nor its DBMS, influence the server‚Äôs behavior.  The starting point for understanding the essence of the problem was the fact that in the task manager in the process list, none of the processes occupied processor time, while at the monitoring of speed, the CPU load history showed a continuous load of the core processor at 20%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a10/265/949/a10265949d0252696b7b6712f2615f60.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59f/1ec/36b/59f1ec36b9a3ec751020f35ec2d5c226.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The goal was to get an answer to the question of what the core is busy in when there is no load on all other services.  Process Explorer - a regular utility from Microsoft - suggested that the main consumer of resources is ‚ÄúHardware Interrupts‚Äù.  For further analysis of the reasons for such consumption, another regular Microsoft utility, ‚ÄúKernrate View‚Äù, was downloaded.  As described in the recommendations for use, the command line was ‚ÄúC: \ Program Files \ KrView \ Kernrates \ Kernrate_i386_XP.exe &gt;&gt; log.txt‚Äù and, after a while, pressing Ctrl-C stopped.  Received the log.txt file containing information of the form: <br><br>  / ============================== \ <br>  \ ============================== / <br>  Date: 2010/12/08 Time: 1:09:14 <br>  Machine Name: RESERVCC <br>  Number of Processors: 1 <br>  PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE: x86 <br>  PROCESSOR_LEVEL: 6 <br>  PROCESSOR_REVISION: 0e08 <br>  Physical Memory: 1015 MB <br>  Pagefile Total: 2450 MB <br>  Virtual Total: 2047 MB <br>  PageFile1: \ ?? \ C: \ pagefile.sys, 1524MB <br>  OS Version: 5.2 Build 3790 Service-Pack: 1.0 <br>  WinDir: C: \ WINDOWS <br><br>  Kernrate User-Specified Command Line: <br>  Kernrate_i386_XP.exe <br><br>  Kernel Profile (PID = 0): Source = Time, <br>  Using Kernrate Default Rate of 25000 events / hit <br><br>  ------------ Overall Summary: -------------- <br><br>  P0 K 0: 00: 36.671 (28.5%) U 0: 00: 09.671 (7.5%) I 0: 01: 22.343 (64.0%) DPC 0: 00: 29.484 (22.9%) Interrupt 0: 00: 00.281 (0.2% ) <br>  Interrupts = 136809, Interrupt Rate = 1063 / sec. <br><br>  Total Profile Time = 128687 msec <br><br>  BytesStart BytesStop BytesDiff. <br>  Available Physical Memory, 443772928, 407339008, -36433920 <br>  Available Pagefile (s), 2104172544, 2093707264, -10465280 <br>  Available Virtual, 2132660224, 2131611648, -1048576 <br>  Available Extended Virtual, 0, 0, 0 <br><br>  Total Avg.

In the list of the Kernrate View log, it will be the top one, and its percentage of kernel occupancy will be shown next in percent.  Here it is worth noting that the percentages do not show the total percentage of the system load, but the percentage of the load on the server core drivers. <br>  Determined that this driver is Intelppm (Intel processor power manager).  Further - google to help us.  The Internet is great, powerful and limitless.  Pretty quickly realized that the problem with Intelppm arises, not so often, however, we were not alone confronted with such a disaster.  The result was not slow to detect itself; an article was found that not only describes the problem itself, but also indicates the way to solve it (The permanent address of the original article is here: <a href="http://www.osp.ru/text/print/302/5818429.html">http://www.osp.ru/text/print/302/5818429.html</a> ) <br>  Further, following the recommendations of Stephen Dougherty, we understand that intelppm is a processor power management driver that is not needed on a server where the battery power is not used at all.  Several solutions have been proposed: reinstalling, updating or stopping a faulty driver.  What options you choose - see for yourself, it is quite logical here to follow the original recommendations of Dougherty. <br>  We got into the registry.  Intel processor driver data is located in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SYSTEM / Current Control Set / Services / intelppm registry key.  To disable intelverm draver, we changed the value of the Start parameter from 1 to 4. Microsoft experts, of course, recommend making a backup of the registry, but we are with you Russian people, and that there is one parameter to change from 1 to 4. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/890/159/d96/890159d96b2d29dd6ee77b3318aed9fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The restart helped make sure that the processor load is on average between 60-70% even with a full (!) Server call-center call load. <br>  The device manager looks very interesting with this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/556/b41/691/556b41691bd80743616409c1cb7c5f61.jpg" alt="image"><br>  She complains, sneers, cries: ‚ÄúThe driver for this device has been disabled.  Perhaps, the necessary functions are performed by another driver.  (Code 32), Click the "Diagnostics" button to start the diagnostics wizard for this device. "But this does not affect flight safety ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109583/</a></p>
