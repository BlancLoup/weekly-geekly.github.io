  <section class="page js-page"><h1>is the internet business entry threshold getting higher?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, one of the leading Russian marketers turned to me for advice.  One big-big company investigated the possibility of creating an online media company with a fabulous investment budget for Russia.  Although the project was supposed to be international and mainly intended for growing markets, it became obvious to me that the model has practically no future.  My personal opinion was that of course you can take risks, but not sure what you need. <br>  The Internet is just a carrier.  What does it mean?  People are increasingly starting to use the Internet, because: <br>  - completely new methods of communication between people are created in it (first ICQ, now Skype video conferences, or first there were geek home pages, now Twitter) <br>  - The development of technology has allowed to provide content that previously could only be obtained through other channels. <br>  - Internet access is getting cheaper, i.e.  Telecoms increase the availability of Internet services. <br><br>  Find out what I think about this next? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  By and large, after all, there is a quiet, until the covert intrigue about who should rule the Internet content operators or telecom operators?  they have never been united before; they have completely different business models, different competencies, different economies, goals. <br><br>  But here we are finding out that Google with their services now generates 6% of the traffic on the network (including YouTube).  Only 30 companies are responsible for 30% of the traffic.  Among them are Facebook, Microsoft and Google.  here <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/software-news/piringovie_seti_prihodyat_v_upadok_a_google_generiruet_6_trafika/">pruflink</a> . <br>  <b>The number of services from which we receive information does not grow anymore on the Internet, on the contrary!</b>  <b>It is declining every year, losing in unequal competitive large companies.</b>

      Why do geek-based companies win on the Internet?  Because they think not quite business categories.  More precisely, their vision of the organization is very technocratic.  This allows them to create innovative products that make people's lives better, more convenient, more practical. <br><br>  Buying black optics across the US by Google, launching our own satellites, participating in the construction of backbone networks, and most importantly, handing out your service to people makes Google the absolute leader not in terms of technology, but in terms of the fact that people cannot effectively exist without its services already in 5-7. <br>  This is not bad, and not good, this is the future, how his science fiction writers painted.  What does it mean? <br>  Google no longer only knows what and whom we love with the help of gmail, not only what we think about, if we use blogspot and other social networks, not only what worries us right now, analyzing our twitter.  Google will now know what we are talking about, what we are doing, where we are and with whom.  He will give us the most useful advertising.  And advertisers will be with him.  And if so, then there is no point in doing a big-big media project. <br>  <b>And what makes sense to do?</b> <br><br>  From my point of view, if you figure out how people communicate and make friends with each other even easier than on facebook and twitter, then you have a good chance to kill them in 3-4 years.  But we must begin now. <br>  If you come up with a new way to deliver rich-media information to a person and he prefers it to current methods of obtaining information, this should immediately be of interest. <br>  If you figured out what else to raise money from small and medium businesses on the Internet - he is only waiting for this. <br><br>  All of this can gradually grow into a very big business.  Or maybe not grow.  Is that a risk?  Yes! <br>  Any business is a risk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81903/</a></p>
