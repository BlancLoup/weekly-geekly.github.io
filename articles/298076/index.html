Yandex encourages thieves.  Or Yandex encourages sites, garbage.  But let's be correct. <br>  In fact, now in the search results of Yandex to find the source, the first publication is virtually impossible.  Instead of the first publication, in the issuance of Yandex copies. <br><br>  This happens despite Yandex‚Äôs assertion that it punishes ‚ÄúExclusion from search pages on the site, decrease in search results, cancellation of TCI‚Äù sites ‚Äúthat contain non-original, secondary ... content‚Äù <br><br>  In reality, in search results, more than 60% are pages with non-original and secondary content. <br>  Once Yandex formulated this rule more clearly and simply - the site with the original text, the first publication, is always higher than the copy in issue.  So it was in 2011. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since that time, Yandex has lost all its knowledge regarding primipublications, and at the same time lost its share in the search. <br>  In 2011, Yandex accounted for approximately 75% of search traffic.  Now only 50%.  Those.  loss of 5% of the market per year.  I round for clarity.

      In my opinion, this is a terrific inefficiency. <br><br>  By the way.  In 2011, Yandex was looking much better than Google.  Now ... I have not been looking for anything through Yandex for a long time.  issue is completely irrelevant to the request.  All looking through Google.  Clear and fast. <br><br>  In principle, this is logical.  If Yandex can not cope with the banal definition of the original source, the first publication, then in its issuance of secondary sites created by the ‚Äúcopy-paste‚Äù method.  Sites created for anything, but not for the reader.  Copipaster thinks about optimization and teaser ads.  He does not think about the meaning, nor about the essence, nor about the reader.  And the text does not read much.  What for?  And spends on save-paste seconds.  It turns out - a big dump, and not the site. <br><br>  This trash Yandex and shows the user, instead of the site with the first publication, which, as a rule, the author, which invested a lot more power, knowledge, meaning. <br><br>  The text seems to be identical, but the feeling that you are reading a book found in the garbage remains. <br><br>  It's a mystery to me why Yandex needs this.  Why encourage copy-paste, why create an anti-incentive for normal authors and webmasters.  Maybe Yandex wants the entire Internet turned into one huge copy-paste - then there‚Äôs no need to search for anything - which village you‚Äôll find, it‚Äôs the same text. <br><br>  I do not ask for sanctions.  AGS and other filters are the initiative and the right of Yandex. <br><br>  I only ask that the page where the text was first published (any text) was higher in output than the page where this text was copied. <br><br>  Such a provision will comply with the rule of Yandex "to be a mirror", i.e.  reflect what is online. <br><br>  If the text appeared for the first time on page A, and then on page B, then it is logical to reflect in the search results, first page A, and then page B. <br><br>  This will contribute to the creation of pages with original and interesting content. <br>  Sites will compete in creating useful content, and not in optimization, as now. <br>  And, if it‚Äôs really easy ... It would be fair. <br><br>  The creation of the original text takes a lot of time.  1 good big popular article is 2 hours of hard work, not to mention the necessary intellectual potential for its writing. <br><br>  Copying an article written is a question of 10 seconds.  And no brains are required. <br><br>  So  Now the issuance algorithm encourages copy-paste and optimizers (in fact, thieves), instead of encouraging first publishers and authors (i.e. creators). <br><br>  In this case, the copied articles may contain errors, they may be misprints, changes that may damage the text, the reader, because  will be made unprofessional.  The original source, the author's text, the author has the opportunity to correct, improve, etc.  Professionally and competently. <br><br>  By the way ... there are several articles on my site that were previously published on other sites.  True, I did not steal them, but each time I agreed on permission to publish.  Sometimes it is very beneficial for the author.  And I always have a link to the source.  And I understand that these pages may fall in the issue.  But if the initial publication is above, from above, it will be fair and will create an additional incentive for me to waste time and energy not on negotiating with the author, but on creating my own unique content. <br><br>  Even when it comes to first publishing other people's texts (book chapters, articles of off-line journals, off-line authors), this still requires considerable efforts (negotiations), and sometimes costs (money or another type of compensation), as opposed to the banal copying prints. <br><br>  Therefore, for the development and quality of content in the network, it is extremely important that the first publication is higher in its issue than the second, third, tenth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298076/</a></p>
