Dozens of companies have organized and successfully developed, promoting only this product.  Hundreds of online marketing companies have introduced this service in addition to the existing business and this has become their new driver for growth.  And we at <a href="http://callbackrating.ru/">CallBckRating.ru</a> decided to figure out what reasons lead to the fact that for some companies this service increases profits by several times, while others regret the loss of money and time.  And how to choose a quality company whose services are best suited for a particular user? <br><br>  The essence of this service is very simple: A widget, based on the client‚Äôs behavior on the site, determines his level of interest and at the moment the visitor is about to leave, a pop-up appears with a field for entering the phone and an inscription like: ‚ÄúDo you have time to search for the necessary information on the site?  Enter your phone number in the box and we will contact you within 20 seconds. ‚Äù  The bottom line is that 20 seconds, during which communication with the client takes place, several times increase the number of callers compared to the usual form of a callback from the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><cut>  Good service, do not say anything!  So where do dissatisfied customers come from?  Let's figure it out! <br><br>  Well, firstly, not all companies provide quality service! <br><h3>  1. Bugs, "creeping" layout and other technical problems can lead to the loss of customers! </h3><br>  And the connection with those.  the support of the company - provider may be difficult or absent altogether!  As a result, correcting the problem can be very problematic. <br>  Tip: choose from a <a href="http://callbackrating.ru/">list of</a> quality companies, or check the company yourself, having previously spoken at least a couple of times with customer support.

A poor-quality algorithm for determining customer interest (especially just in time) can lead to scaring away customers! </h3>  Tip: choose only the widget with the analytical machine determining the interest of the client, and the function of setting the frequency of the widget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fde/1a5/d89/fde1a5d8976f47d0917ddb5b62b7562b.png" alt="Advantages of the feedback form" width="150" height="150" align="right"><h3>  3. Deceiving a customer is not the best way to cause customer loyalty! </h3>  The client called at the time when you were not in the office, the widget offered him to contact you, he conscientiously used the service, and you didn‚Äôt call him back.  All this happened during non-working hours and you were simply not in the office.  Advice: use only the service with the function ‚Äúcustomer generator after hours!‚Äù, It‚Äôs good that most services have this function and you don‚Äôt need to search for a long time. <br><cut><br><cut><h3>  4. The cost of communication services may be higher than the profits! </h3>  Well, well, suppose before choosing a company, you called the company several times, read reviews, and in the end you chose a large company, whose name is widely known and at the height of service!  Installed the widget and cheers!  customers began to call! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/f71/6e3/6f6f716e314c441ba6e1a2a5ba0dabb9.png" alt="Comparison of profits and expenses when choosing CallBackHunter" width="150" align="right">  And at the end of the month you received an invoice for the Service for an amount exceeding the profit from the clients attracted with its help.  In order not to get into this situation, calculate whether its tariffs are suitable for you, for you it is equal to the cost of attracting a client. <br><br>  Example: You are selling DVD discs.  The average conversation you have lasts 3 minutes.  Out of 100 calls, 30 orders are received.  Profit from one disk is 200 rubles.  This means that you spend more than 3 calls or 9 minutes on attracting 1 client.  This means that the cost per minute cannot be more than 200/9 = 21 rubles.  per minute payment, or not more than 63 rubles.  for the call. <br><cut><br><cut><h3>  5. Often you can hear negative reviews from companies with a small number of calls per month! </h3>  Do you have less than 150 calls per month?  Tariffs with a monthly payment can lead to payment of unspoken minutes.  Tip: look for a company with the rate of "how much he said, and paid so much." <br><br><h3>  6. Is the rough pop-up window negatively affecting the client, spoiling the image of the site? </h3>  This problem is typical for beauty salons, design studios, etc.  Tip: choose a company with the ability to change the style of pop-up windows and even better, with the ability to insert employee photos. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/1e4/1a1/a561e41a18a24e44be0e1c65d57cae45.png" alt="Comparison of profits and expenses when choosing CallBackHunter" width="250" align="right"><br><h3>  7. And yes!  If you are not going to answer all, or almost all calls, then you simply do not need this service.  But! </h3>  Read our 2nd article and you will learn how to increase profits and reduce advertising costs with the help of other functions offered by the company‚Äôs service providers. <br><br>  These are probably the main reasons for the negative feedback from the use of services " <a href="http://callbackratung.ru/">callback from the site</a> "! <br>  If you need customers and you are ready to spend a little more time on increasing the number of sales and reducing advertising costs due to these services, then read the following publication, in which we will describe some simple ways how this can be done.
