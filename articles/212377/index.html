  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fujitsu Extended Product Support Services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Those of you who follow our blog on Habrahabr surely know that Fujitsu is not only a manufacturer of equipment, but also a supplier of ready-made solutions, so-called appliance, or, in Russian, ready-made software and hardware systems.  Obviously, every purchased solution, every product, whether they are familiar to all laptops or tablets or such elements of an enterprise's IT infrastructure as servers or data storage systems, should have a standard warranty, which implies their repair in the service center.  But in cases where the minimization of equipment downtime becomes a critical parameter, organizations are interested in servicing the equipment they have acquired or already existing directly at the place of its installation and operation, with strict requirements for troubleshooting. <br><br>  For such organizations, Fujitsu offers a wide range of maintenance and support services.  In this case, it is possible to purchase complex packages of services, i.e.  when the service will apply not only to Fujitsu solutions, but also to other vendors, which helps reduce the cost of servicing a piece of equipment and ensures that the whole solution works, and not its individual elements.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves and tell you everything in order. <br><br><h4>  Installation and configuration of purchased equipment </h4><br>  Any purchased equipment needs at least the initial setup.  For its servers and storage systems, Fujitsu offers InstallationPacks service packages that will ensure their installation and initial setup at the customer site.  Depending on the package, only installation of equipment in the rack can be carried out with testing of its functionality (Basic InstallationPack), or (in the Advanced Installation Pack) installation includes installation of the operating system, its basic configuration, and installation and configuration of the remote control software. (see, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/203008/">Fujitsu ServerView Suite</a> ).  By purchasing such packages together with the equipment, its customer can be sure that the server or storage system will work smoothly from the very beginning of operation, and his own IT specialists will not be distracted from the main business processes.

The list of services provided includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Failure identification and user support <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúHot line‚Äù by phone, fax and e-mail <br>  ‚Ä¢ Diagnostics of equipment failures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Repair or replace defective item <br>  ‚Ä¢ Verification functional testing <br>  ‚Ä¢ The work of a specialist, the necessary spare parts and materials <br><br>  In addition, for some products, for example, such as Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers or Fujitsu ETERNUS storage systems, the standard warranty already includes on-site service with an engineer‚Äôs departure for 2 working days. <br><br>  As for warranty periods, they depend on the type of equipment purchased and range from 1 to 3 years.  Thus, almost all Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers and ETRNUS storage systems have a warranty period of 3 years, with the exception of only some entry-level systems, the guarantee for which is 1 year.  In this case, all of these systems, as well as some other Fujitsu equipment, can be purchased so-called Prolongation Packs, which extend the warranty for another 2 years.  Naturally, it is possible to activate the extension of the guarantee only during the validity period of the main warranty period. <br><br>  In addition to the standard Fujitsu hardware warranty, special hardware support service packages are available - HW Support Packs.  Thanks to them, you can acquire the necessary level of equipment maintenance for your business.  There are three main ways of maintenance: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Bring-In - service with the delivery of equipment by the customer in the SC <br>  ‚Ä¢ Collect &amp; Return - service delivered to the SC at the expense of Fujitsu <br>  ‚Ä¢ On-site - on-site service <br><br>  When providing on-site service, it is possible to select different levels of service, including reaction time and / or recovery time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f4/821/644/8f48216447086582264f7feeda186f53.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  Separately, we note this service as non-returnable hard drives (HDD Service Pack).  The fact is that many organizations are concerned about the confidentiality of data that remain on the failed storage media, whether it is a HDD or SSD, and are not ready to return faulty drives.  For such companies, Fujitsu offers for an additional fee to replace defective drives without the need to return the failed ones.  Thus, confidential data does not leave the company, thereby ensuring their safety. <br><br><h4>  Software support </h4><br>  Hardware support may be enhanced with software support.  To do this, it is enough to purchase one or another package of services for its support (SW Support Packs), which includes telephone consultations, software updates, and the provision of its new versions.  At the same time, two options of services are available: ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù and ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/977/179/daa/977179daaaa912ee101aa4706de4e172.jpg"><habracut><br><br><h4>  Decision support </h4><br>  If the support packages discussed above are not enough, or support is needed for a specific solution that includes not only Fujitsu equipment, but also third-party vendors, Fujitsu proposes to enter into a customized Service Contract.  In this case, all the contracts for a more convenient perception of both our engineers and customers, we try to fit into the matrix of standard service levels: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/7b7/aa3/0837b7aa31a7a599e6f3e3af2f3fc90b.png"><habracut><br><br>  In the matrix for 24x7 service contracts, the NBD value should not be counted as the next working day, but as simply the next day.  More complex support levels add dedicated support manager and regular maintenance: monitoring, availability control and patch provision.  The support is provided by the expert support line in Moscow; in case of difficult problems, engineers based in Germany are involved in the support.  Support in the regions is carried out through a network of our partners. <br><br>  These contracts are for the maintenance of Fujitsu solutions such as FlexFrame, HANA, DI Block, ETERNUS CS Hi-End, solutions supplied under the Oracle brand and a few others.  When making a contact, Fujitsu is responsible for the performance of all components of the turnkey solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af4/fbf/79f/af4fbf79f4a1db7dab0f42a0b7e3d90e.png"><habracut><br><br>  Having concluded such a contract, you will be sure that we will accept a request from you not only on our elements as part of our solution, but also on the equipment of other vendors.  We will conduct a performance analysis and, if necessary, redirect the request to the manufacturer so that the performance of the entire serviced solution is restored within the specified period. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  The support packs discussed above allow the flexibility to approach the maintenance of purchased equipment depending on the requirements and desires of the customer.  However, they can also be purchased as Top-Up, i.e.  in the form of pre-activated packages as part of the new equipment (standard Support Packs require activation through a <a href="https://ts.fujitsu.com/servicepack/ServicePackRegistration.aspx%3Flang%3DRU">special Fujitsu web service</a> ).  And the ability to enter into service contracts actually allows you to find an individual solution to problems of any level of complexity. </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212377/</a></p>
