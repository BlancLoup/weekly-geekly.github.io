  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Typical questions at the interview and recommendations to the candidate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  (I continue to share my experience in finding a job from here to there) <br><br>  As you know, job search is a job in itself, a complex and multi-step process.  In order to successfully go through to the very end and get the desired job, you should understand each of the steps well: from searching for vacancies, writing resumes and cover letters to salary negotiations.  Understanding, in turn, will allow you to prepare well, and therefore work more efficiently.  As they say, it is difficult to heal - it is easy in a coffin. <br><br>  Certainly the culmination and defining moment of the process is the interview, or, as it is now called in the Western manner, - the <i>interview</i> .  I still see the term ‚Äúinterview‚Äù more appropriate, since this type of communication involves questions from <i>both</i> sides: the employer and the applicant for the vacancy.  I will talk about questions for the employer that should be prepared for the position some other time, and here I would like to give examples of real questions that my recruiting agent recommended me to prepare before meeting with my future (already present) employer.

      Just want to say that these questions are not on the subject, but, shall we say, common.  It is clear that they are asked by personnel officers, and no matter how silly these questions may sound, they need to be answered in order to go to the next level.  In one form or another, they came across to me at all of my meetings about employment.  Below are the questions themselves, as well as <a name="habracut"></a>  The agent‚Äôs recommendations are translated from French. <br><br>  ================================================= =========== <br><ul><li>  What do you know about our company?  (Check the company's website and collect key information such as history, size, business profile, corporate values, etc.) </li><li>  Why do you want to work in our company, and not at one of our competitors or some other company? </li><li>  Tell us briefly what the job is for the position you are applying for. </li><li>  Why do you consider yourself an ideal candidate for this position? </li><li>  What are your strengths and weaknesses? </li><li>  What are your professional career goals?  Who do you see yourself in 5 years? </li></ul><br><br>  I recommend that you consider these questions and prepare examples from your personal and professional experience that could support your answers to these questions.  Examples are SPECIFIC when you have to deal with problematic situations, difficult customers, or when you have had the opportunity to solve technical issues in a short time, etc. <br><br>  Try to give clear and precise, most informative answers. <br><br>  It is very important that they (company representatives) feel that you are able to communicate with others - colleagues and clients, to convey information to them;  that you are versatile, flexible, motivated, dynamic;  that you can solve problems in a stressful environment;  that you are an honest, serious employee and that you are determined to work in the company for a long time. <br><br>  During the interview, SMILE and BE DYNAMIC and INTERESTED.  Do not forget to turn off your mobile phone, be at the place 10 minutes before the start of the interview, follow your appearance (suit, tie), take your resume with you, as well as a pen and paper. <br>  ================================================= =========== <br><br>  All these questions are as clear as day, but the recommendations are obvious, and we heard them more than once, but they didn‚Äôt stop being relevant.  A good friend of mine, a pot-bellied and bald Jew, who now works as the general director of a regional branch of a large Russian company, at an interview asked the question ‚ÄúWhat do you see yourself in five years?‚Äù Answered: ‚Äúslender blond‚Äù.  So do not forget to be yourself!  Good luck on your job interview! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86254/</a></p>
