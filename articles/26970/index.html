  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About portfolio investment, TIKR.ru and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the course of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/42653.html">first discussion on Habr√©,</a> I received many useful comments, comments, reasonable and not very suggestions.  Something will never be possible to implement, much remains to be done, and some of the <a href="http://tikr.ru/">issues</a> discussed have already been implemented on <a href="http://tikr.ru/">TIKR.ru.</a>  For example, we continued to ‚Äúclone‚Äù the site that we liked the most and created a section on technical analysis.  Today we launched a new version of investment portfolio management. <br><br>  In this post I would like to tell for those who are just beginning to be interested in investments, that <br>  - such investment portfolio <br>  - made in the new version of TIKR.ru <br>  Well, the most valuable thing for me is to collect new wishes, discuss them with a respected audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So what is a ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù?  This is a collection of assets - usually, but not always - securities.  From the point of view of an investor, a portfolio of different securities minimizes the risk of losing all the money invested at once.  With relatively common economic assumptions, it can be shown algebraically that each of two stocks with a dispersion of similar size will have a variance greater than a portfolio of the same stocks. <br><br>  In the broadest sense of the word, an investment portfolio may involve very different assets, far beyond just the shares traded on the stock exchange.  For example - debt bonds, various derivatives of stocks and bonds, and so-called ‚Äúdepositary receipts‚Äù - global (‚ÄúGDR‚Äù) or - preferred by Russian companies in the past - American (‚ÄúADR‚Äù).  The investment portfolio may include and (so far) non-tradable shares of your startup, apartment, money in an account with Sberbank, a football club, a yacht, etc.  Earlier in history, some continued this list of captured women;  but I am against it, because then it is necessary to add men, raise themes of slavery and serfs, and other things that we forgot about in our habr-civilization.

      Many efficient people intuitively manage their time as an investment portfolio.  For example, investing in education is also, as a rule, an asset that differentiates my investment portfolio.  A company can diversify by investing in equipment and technology, as well as in people, research, culture, etc.  In general, I simply urge to consider portfolio investment more broadly than popular wisdom about laying eggs in different baskets. <br><br>  Another example, not alien to startups, is a (professional) venture capitalist.  Far-sighted, he lays his eggs (money) in different baskets in the hope that at least one of them will hatch good luck chicks, one of which will pay for all the other tales with a less happy ending.  At the same time, the capitalist saves 25% -40% for the so-called subsequent (‚Äúfollow-on‚Äù) investments in those chicks whom he considers the most likely success at a later stage.  But professional history shows that the real bird of luck almost never emerges from a risk-free project.  In other words, in order to increase the likelihood of the emergence of only one bird of luck, you must first take very big risks and then minimize them.  So, portfolio diversification is one of the ways to minimize investment risks.  By the way, by itself, the diversification of investments, for example, in mutants does not guarantee the appearance of a bird of luck.  But about this - like some other time. <br><br>  What does TIKR.ru offer in its implementation of the Investment Portfolio?  No miracles in the form of yachts or horoscopic predictions about the following successes.  Focus - only on stocks, and so far only on those that are traded on the MICEX.  But we have put a lot of effort into making the interface simple and understandable even for newbies in the field of investments.  If in the first version we focused on the experience of Google / Yahoo Finance, then in the current release it is much more than our own developments optimized for Russian realities. <br><br>  The example below presents an example of a retail portfolio.  This portfolio was created on the simple assumption of an idealist that companies whose services I like and use are likely to be more successful over the long term than a randomly chosen stock basket or a basket of oil-gas, which I simply do not understand.  From here, the names of the Seventh Continent, Pharmacy 36.6, Magnit, RBC, Dixie and GUM appeared in the basket;  their weight in the cake is proportional to the monetary equivalent in the portfolio.  The yield of this portfolio over the past six weeks is 8.48%.  For good, it should be compared, at least with the MICEX index.  This exercise can be done on the site.  TIKR.ru provides opportunities for changing the portfolio, tracking the cost and profitability over time using interactive graphics (yes, again on flash!).  You can also edit portfolios in time, take into account commissions in profitability, or simply keep track of your favorite stocks, without pretending that you bought them. <br>  &lt;img src = " <a href="">habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2d3/79f/a40/2d379fa4063cce96a4f9ebd16ff8317e.png</a> " width = 450 height = 353 border = 0 alt = "Retail Portfolio" hspace = 10 vspace = 10&gt; <br><br>  As usual - I am waiting for your comments, suggestions and critics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26970/</a></p>
