  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Something about Velukhost, Nikhost and Site5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I used to be hosted on a value trip.  With the project "Russian streets".  I was annoyed by the fact that after a month remained before the expiration of the domain or hosting payment, the reminders were sent every day.  And even if I paid on the same day and sent them a soap scan of the receipt, the reminders still fell for another week and a half.  I called them, wrote, but they assured me that they could not turn it off, that until the payment went through, reminders would still go.  It ended with the fact that I simply forgot to make the next payment for a domain.  I do not know what happened to them.  Maybe it broke, or maybe it was so radically heeded by my pleas that they decided not to send me reminders at all.  So the project "Russian streets" ceased to exist.  Like my collaboration with Valuehost. <br><br>  Memories, however, about the value for sale were normal.  Particularly pleased with the operational (within 20 minutes) support answers, if you left a question through the form on the site, and round-the-clock support on the phone. <br><br>  But when we in the family got together to start a couple more domains and buy hosting for them, for some reason (I don‚Äôt remember why), we chose the Roucenter (RU-CENTER, <a href="http://www.nic.ru/">www.nic.ru</a> ).

      Well, what to say?  As a registrar to the RTC no complaints.  But as a hoster - one continuous claim. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Home - sites are constantly unavailable.  Even the contract states that the site may be unavailable due to the hoster‚Äôs fault up to two hours per month.  It's a lot.  But we thought that they were insured for an emergency, that in normal mode everything will be in order.  Hell no.  Sites lay much longer than two hours a month.  They disappeared for two hours a week, for three or more.  When this happened for the first time, we were surprised to find out that telephone support for the center is only available on weekdays, from 10 to 19 hours.  That is, imagine, at 19.01 Fridays, you find out that the database of your site is not available, and the support will answer you only on Monday morning.  Beauty.  You hope that the admins will do something there themselves (is someone following the servers working there?), But the site is unavailable after an hour or four, and an answering machine offering to call during working hours answers you on the phone.  You write a letter in support, wait a few more hours, get tired and go to bed.  On Sunday, the site works, and support on Wednesday responds to your request: ‚ÄúCurrently, everything works, there are no problems.  Write if the problem persists. ‚Äù <br><br>  Sites were unavailable inadmissibly often.  When this happened during business hours, we called or wrote in support and received an explanation: ‚ÄúA DDoS attack is being conducted on another website of <a href="http://nic.ru/dns/contract-zao/sup2_price.html">tariff 201</a> .  Therefore, there are problems in the work of all sites of the tariff 201 ". <br><br>  In the end, I got tired of it and I wrote a detailed letter in which I tried to explain that further work in this mode was unacceptable, and asked if they could guarantee that switching to a more expensive tariff (301) would solve this problem?  Because if not, I will have to look for another hosting.  I did not answer.  That is, in general.  I waited a few days and repeated the question, adding to his request: ‚ÄúIf you cannot answer my question, please find someone who can.‚Äù  I was not answered again.  Then I wrote another great letter with a history of the problem and the same question: ‚ÄúYour employees, they say, constantly focus on the fact that problems with ddos ‚Äã‚Äãattacks are observed on tariff sites 201, does this mean that if I switch to tariff 301 , will the problems stop? ‚ÄùI sent this letter to all addresses that I found on the site of the center.  No answer, no greeting. <br><br>  After waiting a few more days, I called for support, told the whole story and asked me to reply.  An employee on the other side of the phone said, "I see your letter."  ‚ÄúAnd what do you say?‚Äù I asked.  "You will be answered."  "When?" "In the near future."  And never answered. <br><br>  After that, the DDoS attacks, the inaccessibility of the base, and the situation when the host‚Äôs support states that ‚Äúeverything works, these are problems with your provider,‚Äù and the traceout through various services from various points of the globe, including my apartment connected via Corbin, shows that the site is unavailable.  And what is more, all my sites and in general all sites about which I know are hosted are hosted on a nikhost.  It also happened that the site seems to be accessible, and friends from St. Petersburg report that they do not see it.  Friends from Germany said that the clients of the largest German provider Alice could not see my sites at all. <br><br>  In general, I despaired of achieving something from the nickhost and began to look after the new hosting provider.  But while the sites lay with them and then and then were unavailable.  This annoyed my wife, with whom we conduct our projects together.  Now she began to correspond with the support of nikhost.  In the process of correspondence I learned a lot of new things.  For example, that if the site is unavailable due to DDoS attacks or due to hardware problems, this does not mean that it is unavailable due to the hoster.  In addition, various employees in letters and telephone conversations often simply contradicted each other, which led to unpleasant thoughts about their integrity.  Having received a completely inadmissible feedback from the support several times, Alexandra repeated my reception and wrote to several addresses found on the site ‚Äî not to the support.  I don‚Äôt know why, but they answered her - the PR employee became worried that the support by his stupid actions created a bad image for the company and tried to help.  At the very least, he promised to conduct an official inspection and find out.  Asked to send details.  I will quote most of the letter we wrote in response to his request, since  it just describes some problems (I‚Äôll omit the names of the employees and the numbers of the tickets and contracts): <br><br>  <i>Good day.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Unfortunately, the staff responsible for the phone are not presented, so I can not tell you their names.</i>  <i>But everything related to the correspondence, I have saved.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Ticket ...:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Letter: ‚ÄúExplain, please, the reasons for the inaccessibility of the database of my sites located on your sites, February 11, 2009 in the period from approximately 15-50 to 16-28.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Answer from ...: ‚ÄúAt the time you indicated there were technical problems with the operation of the database server serving your hosting.</i>  <i>Currently, issues are resolved.</i>  <i>We apologize for any inconvenience caused".</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This answer did not explain to me the causes of breakdowns.</i>  <i>Within the framework of the same correspondence, my second appeal was recorded (after 2 weeks) about problems with the same database server.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In one of the conversations with a support service employee (on another issue, which will be discussed below) I was informed that there were problems with a specific north database, and that if I wish, I can write a statement and transfer my site to another database server.</i>  <i>I did it today, March 19, because in the morning from 8 to 8-45 in the morning the database was again inaccessible (ticket ...).</i>  <i>But when the server is out of order, and the client (me) is offered to write statements to get a normally working server, it seems wild to me.</i>  <i>Moreover, I was not informed about the problem at once, in the first two letters they were assured that everything is in order.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Visitors very often complain about the inaccessibility of my sites.</i>  <i>When there were a lot of complaints (and after 2 drops of the database, recorded by me personally), I decided to urgently deal with the problem.</i>  <i>The support service regularly reminded me that under the contract the sites may be unavailable due to the hoster‚Äôs fault up to 2 hours per month.</i>  <i>But I had suspicions that they were inaccessible longer.</i>  <i>To understand and find the true reason for the inaccessibility of my sites (I admit the likelihood that this fault is not a nickname as a hoster - there are many other factors), I called the support service, where I was told that I could write an application for receiving the report about the amount of time that the sites on my site were unavailable due to the hoster‚Äôs fault.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Ticket ...:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Letter: ‚ÄúWith this letter I declare my desire to receive a report on the amount of time that the sites of my site (...) were inaccessible due to the hoster‚Äôs fault‚Äù.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Answer from ..., March 11, 2009: ‚ÄúToday at 15:50 there were problems with access to the sites hosted on the virtual hosting server.</i>  <i>The problems were resolved by our specialists by 16:19 Moscow time.</i>  <i>Currently, all services are working correctly.</i>  <i>We apologize for any inconvenience caused".</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is hard to believe that the support service officer read and understood my letter - there is not a word about the application.</i>  <i>I wrote another letter (in the framework of the same correspondence), and then, having decided that my explanations about the application were not understood by the support service for some reason, I called.</i>  <i>I was caught by a polite employee who listened to me (he also advised to move the sites to another server database).</i>  <i>In 23 minutes of conversation, I managed to convince him that I really needed a report.</i>  <i>He promised that the report would be sent to me.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A few days later I received a letter (the same ticket):</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>"Date Time Unavailability</i> <i><br></i>  <i>01.14.2009 16:40 - 16:43</i> <i><br></i>  <i>01/19/2009 3:22 - 15:35</i> <i><br></i>  <i>02/25/2009 8:29 PM - 20:31</i> <i><br></i>  <i>03/11/2009 4:05 pm - 4:19 pm "</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I do not know where this data came from.</i>  <i>They are wrong.</i>  <i>There are not even those periods of inaccessibility of sites, about which I wrote to the support service earlier, and the period about which I was informed before by an employee of the company (the fragment is given above) is reduced by 15 minutes.</i>  <i>Not to mention that I may not be aware of some periods of inaccessibility, since I‚Äôm not checking my sites every hour.</i>  <i>This ‚Äúreport‚Äù has greatly shaken my already weak confidence that I can get hosting at an acceptable quality in my nickname.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Within the framework of the same ticket, we exchanged a few more letters with the support service, but I did not receive an explanation for sending me incorrect data or the report itself.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Today, March 19, 2009, after all my sites were again unavailable for at least 45 minutes (again, the ticket ...), I had to call support service several times.</i>  <i>As a result, I was lucky to get on - as it seemed - a good support staff member.</i>  <i>The employee politely and in detail explained to me the reason for the inaccessibility of the sites, and at the same time I asked him about the possibility of receiving reports.</i>  <i>The employee assured me that there should be no difficulties with this, that he would take my application for a report (written on March 11, 2009, the ticket ...) and send me this report.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It remains a mystery to me why other employees could not read my letters carefully, listen to my questions and just send me this long-suffering report.</i>  <i>I don‚Äôt really want to play roulette with every call to the support service: is it lucky to get a good specialist, or not lucky (in my experience - in most cases), and you have to spend a lot of time and effort on letters and calls.</i> <br><br>  The employee of the PR department politely and promptly replied to this letter, thanked and promised to conduct an internal investigation.  Stopped after that sites fall?  Not.  We also did not receive any intelligible explanation of the reasons for their regular inaccessibility. <br><br>  Soon we, meticulously comparing the conditions offered by the companies Masterhost, McHost and Valuehost, chose <a href="http://www.site5.com/hosting/">an American hosting provider Site5.com</a> .  We bought the hostPro tariff from him and soon transferred one site to them.  In the process of transferring a couple of questions.  They wrote to support - they received the answer almost instantly.  True, in English, but here - what can you do - they are Americans, they do not know Russian.  Another site has remained with nikhost.  For the sake of interest, I <a href="http://basicstate.com/">added</a> both sites to the <a href="http://basicstate.com/">basicstate.com</a> system, which every 15 minutes checks the availability of the resources registered in it.  Here are her reports for the few days during which one of our projects was already responsible from site 5, and the second from the center: <br><br> <code>hrenovina.net (site5) <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> date uptime dns connect request ttfb ttlb <br> 2009-04-16 100.00 0.068 0.129 0.129 0.626 1.029 <br> 2009-04-15 100.00 0.080 0.142 0.142 0.631 1.027 <br> 2009-04-14 100.00 0.102 0.165 0.165 0.713 1.144 <br> 2009-04-13 100.00 0.149 0.212 0.212 0.705 1.117 <br> 2009-04-12 100.00 0.123 0.183 0.183 0.654 1.049 <br> <br> yatsutko.net (hosting.nic.ru) <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> date uptime dns connect request ttfb ttlb <br> 2009-04-16 100.00 0.008 0.155 0.155 0.960 1.572 <br> 2009-04-15 100.00 0.008 0.194 0.194 0.843 1.327 <br> 2009-04-14 96.74 0.008 0.150 0.150 0.691 1.254 <br> 2009-04-13 55.43 0.014 0.091 0.091 0.492 0.719 <br> 2009-04-12 0.00 0.025 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000</code> <br> <br>  That is, out of five days, the site lying on the nikhost was normally available only for two days.  One day - not a single answer at all.  Well, see for yourself, in general. <br><br>  Sites on Site5.com so far, pah-pah, work without problems. <br><br>  Summarize.  Host on nik.ru not wish even the enemy.  For the sake of justice, I repeat, however, that as a registrar, I have no complaints about them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57895/</a></p>
