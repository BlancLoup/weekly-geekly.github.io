I highly recommend! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Work your head!</strong> <br>  This is the most important tool for a blogger.

Read these tips!">  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/somemixedstuff/2403249501/">¬©</a> <br>  <strong>Change the situation.</strong> <br>  If you have a laptop, or even a PDA, then try to write a post in a cafe (with headphones), or in the park early in the morning.  You will probably be surprised at how many thoughts, ideas and how clearly the head works. <br><br>  <em>A cafe, an apartment of friends who left for the weekend or a dacha - I tried it - it really helps - the creativity flows like a river.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Answer some important questions.</strong> <br>  The best posts for a blogger are those that touch on either a rare topic or a hot topic.  In either case, you need to know the topic, if not thoroughly, but very well.  There are a lot of ways to find a way to solve the issue that you are covering: <br>  * Ask readers to ask a question on the topic you are going to write about; <br>  * ask other bloggers to ask questions about the topic you are going to write about; <br>  * go to the thematic, for example, forum, and read - what questions they ask there; <br>  * be sure to check the comments of readers for questions on the topic; <br>  * Similarly, check out comments on other thematic blogs; <br>  * climb into the skin of the reader, who doesn‚Äôt understand the question at all - and answer the most relevant questions yourself; <br><br>  As a bonus: add a questionnaire to your blog, in which your readers can ask questions.  This will save offtopic in other posts, and partially motivates a person to leave the question. <br><br>  <strong>Start with a headline.</strong> <br>  The title is what in the modern world allows to attract attention.  If you have three times an interesting article.  but a rotten headline - you will not be read in the amount in which you could read, if you had a headline shouting ‚Äúread me !!‚Äù.  Unfortunately, the overwhelming number of bloggers do not understand this. <br><br>  <em>I just began to come to this way of writing posts - it does not always work, but all the same.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Take a break.</strong> <br>  If you have stopped in mid-word - go for a walk, get distracted. <br><br>  <em>Just do not drink alcohol - it often hinders.</em>  <em>Writing posts in a drunken state is a guarantee that you will blush tomorrow.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Set yourself the term of writing a post.</strong> <br>  This is extremely motivating, but you must have a strong willpower to comply with the deadlines set. <br><br>  <em>I am motivated by a slightly different moment - if I don‚Äôt write for a few days - the number of subscribers slowly begins to fall.</em>  <em>Not that I would chase puzomerki - just a shame that they stop reading me.</em>  <em>Although for sure the decline is due to the search engines and news feed robots.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Do not be distructed.</strong> <br>  Another serious challenge for a blogger.  Turn off all clients that you can turn off without serious consequences.  Do not be distructed. <br><br>  Alternatively, you can deploy the reactor to the entire monitor, for example, DarkRoom will help you - it closes the entire system behind it - extremely conducive to a relaxed blog writing process. <br><br>  <em>I do this translation like this - I unfolded the original on one monitor - on the second I write this text.</em>  <em>Nothing distracts.</em>  <em>Once in a while I check my mail or ICQ, for example, to collect my thoughts or have some rest.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Write a post based on the previous successful post.</strong> <br>  For example, you have a post, written by you several months ago, and caused a considerable resonance, a bunch of comments and a surge of growth of subscribers.  Write a post based on his motives, develop a topic, indicate the reverse side of the medal, but you never know - answer the questions of commentators not in the comments, but systematize into a separate post. <br><br>  <em>Personally, I do it from time to time.</em>  <em>After some time, you with your posts in the style of "based on" will learn from afar.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Start from afar.</strong> <br>  Do not start writing a post right off the bat - carefully approach the topic of the post, for example, with your own thoughts and your own opinion.  It is appreciated. <br><br>  <strong>Write in your own words.</strong> <br>  Do not invent refined turns of speech - write in your own words - for sure you will be able to convey the idea more accurately.  Many bloggers record their thoughts on paper, or even altogether - on a voice recorder. <br><br>  <strong>Change your writing style.</strong> <br>  Looking at the previous paragraph, you probably thought - the author drives, but no - he is right - you do not need to lock yourself in the frame, if you want to write posts about sports in one style, and about cooking in another, then why not? <br><br>  <strong>Ideas around you!</strong> <br>  Many everyday things and actions keep a lot of ideas for a good post.  Work, random thought in the subway, on the way home - but how little - how do I know what your everyday life is? <br><br>  <em>I regularly find thoughts and ideas for posts in this way.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Read a lot on topics.</strong> <br>  How to do it?  To surf the web a lot, read blogs of people who write on the same subject, read forums and articles in online journals, do not disdain to use a translator to translate an article of interest from another language. <br><br>  <strong>Look for information in the offline literature.</strong> <br>  For example, go to the magazine stall and see what they are writing about.  Surely on the subject of journals (especially if they are specific), search engine queries will temporarily increase - why not add on and make a post on the topic? <br><br>  <em>I, for example, hurry up with a post on IETester - as a result, I am the first to issue Yandex at the IETester request.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Change the point of view.</strong> <br>  Did you write a posh post some time ago?  Excellent - create movement and resonance - write on the same topic, but take the opposite position, make black white and vice versa.  This will argue with readers. <br><br>  If you are exhausted, squeezed like a lemon and have no thoughts at all - ask your friends, other bloggers or read comments on previous posts, looking for an interesting topic for posting. <br><br>  <strong>Find your time.</strong> <br>  Experienced, find the time when you are most comfortable writing in a blog, really do not overdo it - study or work is more important than a blog, of course, if you are not a professional blogger;). <br>  In your most golden time, completely disconnect from the surrounding world - and voila - create a printed word masterpiece. <br><br>  <strong>Big pictures against small pictures.</strong> <br>  Many bloggers try to compensate for the meager post with a large number of pictures, illustrations, or one or two large pictures.  I will not teach to live - just be guided by common sense. <br><br>  I sometimes have a desire to shove a big picture - though I hit my hands in time and I limit myself to a wide picture, but not for a tall or heavy one. <br><br>  <strong>Ask your readers questions.</strong> <br>  This allows you to develop a conversation in the comments.  Sometimes the comments are more valuable than the post itself, due to the fact that they contain a lot of opinions, often well-reasoned. <br><br>  <em>Do you ask questions to your readers?</em>  <em>;)</em> <br><br>  <strong>Keep track of your interests.</strong> <br>  Subscribe to RSS, follow the blogs that you reprint or cite.  This is useful for expanding horizons. <br><br>  <em>I have over a hundred tapes in my reader, which I regularly read.</em> <br><br>  <strong>Sum up what others are writing about.</strong> <br>  The recipe is simple - choose a topic, read a pack of posts on it, then write your post, which includes all opinions, all aspects and facts.  This is a very useful and valuable experience - and most importantly, readers are interested. <br><br>  These tips are not binding, but I strongly advise.  If you have your own muse - why not?  ;) Share it - if this is not the secret method of ninja bloggers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288150/</a></p>
