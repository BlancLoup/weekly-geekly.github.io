  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maker-ups are fanatics.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You see, everything seems to be happening, right? <br><br>  For a start, let's prepare the workplace.  A large table on which you can lay your hands so that it is comfortable, a monitor from 19 'and above, so that you can test the pages for different resolutions.  A soft armchair, a cup of green tea without sugar and forth ... We start the computer, on the desktop we see the icons of our favorite browsers IE 6, IE 7, Opera and Mozilla Firefox.  They are like children to us, all different, with their whims, but all the most beloved and always near us. <a name="habracut"></a>  At hand should also be a faithful friend and companion - Photoshop, HomeSite editor and all sorts of stuff, which I will discuss in the course of work.  For complete happiness, turn on your favorite music. <br><br>  We open the psd layout in Photoshop, while it is loaded, we can remember how well we sat with friends at the bar yesterday and drank beer, discussed girls and cars ... Everything, the template is in front of our eyes, we immediately forget about everything and dive into it .  Our brain begins to think quite differently, in our heads only blocks, frames and indents.  We mentally dissect the designer‚Äôs work into parts, and, as if through an X-ray, we look through it, noticing the details hidden from the eyes of an ordinary person.  It is important to highlight the main blocks of the header content and footer, everything else will look more closely along the way ... 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Now we can download the most suitable framework in your favorite HomeSite. <br>  I usually start to impose a skeleton, skipping details, because  global problems (the appearance of a horizontal scroll, incorrect placement of blocks, etc.) that may then arise are most often associated with it.  Here we see that something similar to our layout appears on the screen - a cap, main content, footer.  Now we are starting to "decorate" it from top to bottom, without missing anything, considering all the small details.  Do not forget after making small changes to the code to view it in the browser.  First, I test in IE 6, and then, after the block is folded, I check that it would look the same in other browsers as well.  Sometimes you have to use hacks for different versions of bazers.  But before you do this, you need to make sure they are really needed. <br><br>  So step by step, minute by minute, we are moving towards our goal - to revive the designer's idea.  Sometimes this exercise takes a lot of time, so do not forget to take breaks.  You can go to the store for juice and fruit, call friends, the main thing is not to think about layout for a while.  This especially helps when you are at something stalled and can not find the right solution.  Fresh head thinks much better :) <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that making up websites is a very interesting activity!  For me, every site, every layout is like a new page in a big encyclopedia.  It's like a computer game where you have to go through many levels.  Dozens, hundreds of layouts in the background - this is a guarantee that you will pass the next level faster and with minimal ‚Äúlosses‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19288/</a></p>
