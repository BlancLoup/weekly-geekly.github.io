Moreover, the authorities want to see the result, and with money, as usual, tension. <br><br>  If you had to assemble a ‚Äúserver‚Äù (gateway or router) from several non-working machines ‚Äî from one hard drive, from another - a network card, from the third ‚Äî memory and a processor;  re-soldering drip capacitors on the motherboard;  open the constantly warming and freezing D-link DI604 and add cooling to it;  and then at home, by pulling out the insides from the old tape recorder ‚ÄúRadio Engineering‚Äù, to create in it a home media center with distribution of torrents <br><br>  then perhaps you will be interested in this story.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br><br>  Our small department deals with the maintenance of the network infrastructure at the university, as well as, as is often the case, with a host of other ‚Äúhung‚Äù duties ‚Äî telephony, user support, etc.  The lack of funding, the remoteness of the region (as a result, difficulties in acquiring even such seemingly simple gizmos as colored caps on the connector) and other factors force us to look for non-standard solutions when performing various tasks.  Sometimes they are associated not only with software solutions, but also with physical objects.  We really like to make these decisions come true, giving a second chance to many forgotten things found in basements, or that have been gathering dust for years waiting for their removal.  You can assume that we have a lot of free time, allowing them to scatter so.  I dare to assure you that this is not so - but there is still a little bit of altruism, faith in a better future and the opportunity to stay at work in the evenings for the realization of ideas, why not?  In the end - ‚Äúthe best rest is a change of activity‚Äù, and here it is combined with the solution of working tasks.  Of course, another question is that no one will notice and appreciate it, but why should we give someone else's assessment, especially since the satisfaction of the final result is much higher than the forced praise? <br><br><h4>  So what are these solutions? </h4><br><br>  On Habr√©, you can often find articles about assembling a home server in a desk drawer or other original applications of familiar things.  Our "experiments" from the same area. <br><br>  For example, as an alternative to a burned-out power source for a gigabit switch, a power supply unit from an old systemic was used - washed, cleaned, slightly soldered and painted, it acquired not only a fairly decent appearance, but also allowed it to save several thousand rubles. <br><br>  And the old Soviet hysteresis motor produced in 1965, extracted from an inoperative oscilloscope found in the basement of the physics mat, took a worthy place in the server ventilation system, instead of a VENTS that worked for a short time and was inefficient and would have to wait several months. <br><br>  But the main thing at the moment is the ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù and the quiet pride of our department - a small video surveillance system, which we simply called ... <br><br><h4>  "Big Brother" </h4><br><br>  As often happens in organizations like ours - the implementation of even seemingly necessary projects stumbles, apart from funding, either in the absence of those who could carry them out, or in the banal human factor - many tasks are hung on one employee with a small salary and which is physically not possible (even with all desire) to engage in it. <br><br>  The background of our project is about the same - being impressed by the theft of equipment from the classroom literally ‚Äúin broad daylight,‚Äù the management instructed to urgently start installing a video surveillance system, and, due to the same desire to save, by the staff of the department.  For which the appropriate equipment was purchased - a recorder, 4 cameras and a certain amount of cable.  But ... days went by, then other times unexpectedly came, the leadership changed and the structural changes that took place, multiplied by the same human factor, prevented the implementation of the "grandiose plans" of the system deployment.  About the acquired equipment for a long time forgotten.  Until, a few years later, it came to us. <br><br>  These were: a recorder, four black-and-white cameras, several tens of meters of hybrid cable and four small universal power supplies, supposedly bought for powering the cameras. <br><br>  And they decided - video surveillance - to be! <br><br>  The first problem that arose was the impossibility of placing all this household during installation in such a way that: a) did not interfere, b) did not become dusty, c) was restricted in access, and d) looked aesthetically.  The picture from the ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù that had been presented to the gaze, in which 4 power supply units were stuck, the unit from the registrar and the registrar standing right there with the TV, aesthetes :) could not satisfy us. <br><br>  <b>Exit was found!</b>  <b>Yes, even what!</b> <br><br>  Immediately abandoning the use of blocks for powering the cameras, both completely unsuitable for solving this task - both in their technical characteristics (the cameras are very demanding on the power supply) and for other reasons, we turned our eyes towards the old friend - the power supply from PC.  He not only met all our nutritional requirements (and even with a large margin), but also had a rather compact look. <br><br>  The next idea was - ‚ÄúBut would it not be possible for us <b>to place everything</b> in an ordinary computer case?‚Äù.  There, the power supply unit will fall into its usual place and it will be possible to place the recorder itself, and even plug in a power supply pack!  Instead of scattered and unstable elements, we get a whole system, placed in a closed case, securely fastened, and even with backup power. <br><br>  It was necessary to decide how to ensure the connection of the cameras themselves to the power and video inputs of the recorder. <br><br>  Rejecting many options, among which were the usual "tulips", <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR">three-pin XLR</a> connectors were chosen as <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR">connectors</a> , as providing very strong fastening (impossible to "accidentally" pull out) and possessing exactly the necessary number of pins that we needed. <br><br>  Choosing a suitable case from an old computer and estimating the location of the elements in it (UPS, common power supply, recorder, power supply unit recorder), stopped on the position of the case on its side as the most convenient and stable and preparing a simple tool (it would be possible, it would be just a masterpiece, but everything once happens for the first time), got down to business. <br><br>  We prepared the power supply unit from the computer - they cleaned it, smeared it, and slightly soldered it inside, leaving only the 12V necessary for us. <br><br>  Having freed the case from unnecessary elements (baskets for disks, etc.), having finally decided on where the IBT will stand, the recorder and other elements, and with their exit beyond the limits of the case, cut out the holes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7d/66/7d66b0584a58e8b912d8319f396a1c36.jpg"><br><br>  Painted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/80/99/8099eda10ee2bae3862a61b2259056b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fb/4a/fb4a702d9a54a92edbd724ade9876757.jpg"><br><br>  The working moment is the place of assembly (it is also working) and a simple tool: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/58/aa/58aa4a7ff0541f97ce43e3e0ba5f5beb.jpg"><br><br>  We determine the location of elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9f/0e/9f0ec7c884df3d1f37b0deadd33be15d.jpg"><br><br>  We collect: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2c/a8/2ca8c2f92b374cb6a31f487be333a2bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d3/4b/d34b922803a4319d0f5863604cdc56a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/09/de/09de02e5a2d8819eb19196dbac260c9e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ce/b5/ceb5819a27e03df3da7e510280e9ea17.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/f7/bcf7427b55ac03d69aa58df31ef4c1e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/62/a0/62a09b2f994ed5a2eb3e3b7166683913.jpg"><br><br>  Here is such a nice box turned out: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/fa/e9fa31afd3421d5ec2638b893375d743.jpg"><br><br>  Installed "BigBrother" in the place of permanent work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a9/73/a97382171d2d6d3d47f1af5839c63b40.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/09/bc/09bc35f34d9891382f3a7cc6f5cdb9b5.jpg"><br><br>  We connect: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/38/7c38ba573bd2096942b5834e24759cc6.jpg"><br><br>  Installed cameras in the field of observation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f0/78/f078820d0b255a18e16d4a1e67b57e86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/46/b5/46b5345a4d8987c1c6705e19059dfbd9.jpg"><br><br>  Separate cable was taken from the video output of the recorder to the monitor in the next room. <br>  Launched ...
