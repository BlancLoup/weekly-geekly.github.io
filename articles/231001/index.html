Bring Your Own Device, BYOD) affects a number of positions in many IT areas: from technical support to mobile application development or security management and compliance monitoring.</i>  <i>In fact, according to one research company, this trend is one of the extremely positive aspects of the IT labor market.</i> <br><br>  If you think that BYOD is more of an advertising hype than a real trend, think again.  This megatrend has a very real impact on IT jobs.  According to a recent study in the field of wages, conducted by the agency <a href="http://www.e-janco.com/">Janco Associates</a> , it is those technical posts that require the use of employee‚Äôs own devices. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you have the knowledge and the ability to work on your own device both in implementation and in support or development, this increases your value as an employee,‚Äù said Janco Associates CEO Victor Janulaitis.  "Today it is a valuable skill."

      Analytical agency Janco Associates has researched about a thousand companies, mainly the salaries of IT professionals and the demand for them remained at the same level.  But in the situation with the positions suggesting BYOD, everything was different.  BYOD concept has an impact on all types of IT jobs, from technical support to mobile application development or security management and compliance monitoring.  There are two especially sought-after positions: the hardware installation manager (BYOD) and the head of user support. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, the concept of BYOD is one of the exceptional moments.  The US IT labor market rose to 74,900 jobs in 2013, slightly better than the 62,500 jobs in 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The growth is ‚Äúnot enough to provide all IT graduates in the United States with IT jobs or to increase demand,‚Äù said Janco Associates.  They also added that ‚Äúall the most sought-after posts are related to quality control, the implementation of BYOD and the improvement of the level of service‚Äù. <br><br>  Without a doubt, the concept of BYOD has far-reaching implications. <br><br>  Developers are busy redesigning web applications so that information can be available on custom smartphones and tablets, offering a variety of screen sizes.  The concept of BYOD opens the doors to cloud services and closes them in front of obsolete desktop software.  In addition, the concept of BYOD breathed new life into the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa virtual desktop. <br><br>  The BYOD trend has led the mobile device management (MDM) service providers to stunning success.  Which, in turn, led to the rampant consolidation of the market with gigantic technical corporations that have taken on the MDM niche.  More recently, VMware acquired AirWatch for $ 1.175 billion in cash with a surcharge of $ 365 million in installments, and this is considered to be a fair price.  All this creates good conditions for IT professionals with the skills to manage a pool of mobile devices. <br><br>  In fact, you may have to rebuild the entire enterprise architecture so that it can support the work of employees on their own devices.  "We see that companies adhere to zero trust models in which each device is considered to be compromised and where the concept of a trust network no longer exists," <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2380058/byod/byod-became-the--new-normal--in-2013.html">said</a> Forrester Research analyst David Johnson, CIO.com. <br><br>  Moreover, according to Yanulaitis, he expects that soon will appear certificates, which indicate the skills to work on your own device.  Certificates usually testify to the professional qualifications of an employee over the past two or three years, as Janulaitis says, and the BYOD skill will become a matter of course in a couple of years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231001/</a></p>
