However, even the most productive systems become obsolete over time and leave to give way to new servers and computers.  So at one time happened with the first laptop PC from IBM, the mass of which was 22 kilograms.  Yes, 40 years ago (namely, so much time has passed) 22 kilograms for the PC was very low weight. <br><br>  We are talking about the IBM Model 5100, which had a keyboard, built-in memory and a full display.  Such a computer could be purchased only by a wealthy person.  The fact is that the basic version cost $ 8975, and the ‚Äúolder‚Äù model with all the stuffing would cost customers $ 19975. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a5/939/f74/0a5939f74767204e67cb8c30936c2df3.jpg">

      The IBM 5100 is a portable desktop computer released in September 1975, six years before the IBM PC.  The prototype of the model was developed in 1973 at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable).  In January 1978, IBM announced the release of the IBM 5110 - the ‚Äúbig cousin‚Äù who replaced this series.  In February 1980, the release of the IBM 5120 was announced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45c/143/4f7/45c1434f7eb6fc89196633735087bb1d.jpg"><br><br>  As for performance, at that time there were few PC power equal - the number of competitors could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  Advertising Model 5100 then said - ‚ÄúYou are looking at a small portable computer, called 5100. This model range includes 4 models with 16K, 32K, 48K and 64K memory.  The central part of the entire system is a 16-bit processor module called PALM. <br><br>  If you compare a portable system with other computers of the time, it wins in all respects.  And not only in size, but also in functions.  By the way, at the end of the 60s, computers of similar performance weighed under 500 kg, and their size was equal to two office desks set side by side. <br><br>  It was a really powerful computer with a large amount (at that time) of RAM and shared memory, a CRT display and a tape drive.  It appeared two years before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore PET</a> entered the market. <br><br>  As for the display, its diagonal was 5 inches.  On the screen was placed 16 lines of characters of 64 characters in each line.  If desired, you could display the contents of the first 512 bytes of main memory on the screen in hexadecimal.  This was done for diagnostic purposes.  If desired, the user could connect an external monitor. <br><br>  The computer was equipped with a communications adapter module, thanks to which the operator could send or receive data from a remote system.  The tape drive worked with standard DC 300 cartridges. The memory capacity was 204 KB.  One drive was installed in the machine, the second (Model 5106) could be connected as an external device. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m54rKlErwA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Work The system could interact with APL, BASIC or both programming languages.  At the time of release, only mainframes worked with APL, most of the desktop computers used only with BASIC.  On the front panel of the machine was a switch with which it was possible to set the preferred programming language. <br><br>  IBM 5100 allowed to work with complex mathematical problems, conduct statistical calculations and conduct financial analytics.  For this, the system was equipped with a number of algorithms that helped the user in their daily work. <br><br>  The processor and memory were not discrete elements, but were placed as a set of chips on two separate boards. <br><br>  <b>IBM 5100 Specifications</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Model: IBM Portable PC 5100 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Start of production: September, 1975 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Processor: on discrete TTL logic <br>  ‚Ä¢ RAM memory: from 16 kV to 64 kV <br>  ‚Ä¢ Data Drive: Built-in 200K tape drive (DC300) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Display: Monochrome (white on black), 16 lines of 64 characters each <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sound: beeper in keyboard <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ports: LAN connector, printer connector <br>  ‚Ä¢ OS and software: APL and / or BASIC, templates <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight: 25 kg <br>  ‚Ä¢ Price: $ 19975 with 64KRAM <br><br>  Overall, the IBM 5100 was one of the first truly personal computers.  It was intended to solve scientific and professional problems.  Work with him could and business representatives.  Actually, this PC was more accessible to companies, rather than private individuals, the price was, as one could see, not the lowest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320730/</a></p>
