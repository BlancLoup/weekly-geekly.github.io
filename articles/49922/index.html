Actually, it was caused by a number of factors, but the fact was that on every second site where it was possible to install CGI scripts, it was possible to find a guest book or a bulletin board written in Perl. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Perl replaced the most popular PHP, and it was quite natural from the point of view that PHP has a much more understandable and intuitive development model.  Both languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave their advantages - greater execution speed and security in Perl and ease of development and prevalence in PHP.  But this question is rather a reason for the next ‚Äúholivar‚Äù, so we will not go into it in more detail. <br><br>  Most of the currently existing content management systems are written in PHP.  This fact is indisputable, but it is caused more by the degree of the prevalence of a language than by the adequacy of the language to the task of creating a CMS. <br><br>  I have been developing the Perl language management system for several years - initially for the internal projects of my studio, but at this stage the system has grown to the point where you can talk about the ‚Äúpublic version‚Äù. <br><br>  The CMS is called Taracot, and the project website is available at <a href="http://www.taracot.org/">www.taracot.org</a> (there is also a system demo).  License - GPL. <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_zGgMHnFnqHY/SXi9Rb2efZI/AAAAAAAAARI/R5LBOYwxh9o/s720/taracot.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  From the main features of the system I would highlight: <br><br>  - CMS is written in Perl and uses MySQL as a database; <br>  - the system is designed for * NIX systems (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), but can also be used on other systems, including Windows; <br>  - the modular structure allows you to connect to your site any necessary functionality, in the main set already presented a large number of modules; <br><br>  - works very, very quickly: <br>  - quite comfortable and convenient user interface with the possibility of modification; <br>  - ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù URLs; <br>  - Some features of AJAX technology; <br>  - safety (we hope;)). <br><br>  The system is quite complicated to install on servers.  This is caused primarily by the lack of support by Perl hosters - many necessary modules are not worth it, and it is necessary to correspond with the administrators regarding their installation.  In general, this is a big misfortune of all modern projects. <br><br>  Another flaw is bad documentation.  Yes, since I am engaged in the project at this stage alone, I just physically do not have enough time to write the documentation competent.  The same applies to a good installer. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the system turned out quite successful in at least two plans.  The first aspect is that the process of teaching users how to work with the system is quite simple (I managed to teach at least three people to work with it, who have almost no relation to computers and the Internet);  The second aspect is not too much server load, which allows using CMS in large projects. <br><br>  I hope that my CMS will be interesting and useful to many people, and especially I would like to appeal to the Perl community of programmers to pay attention to this project, point out and discuss shortcomings, and also take part, if possible, in the development. <br><br>  Sincerely, XTreme. <br><br>  UPD: The author of the article was invited to Habr, please love and favor - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/xtremespb/" class="user_link">xtremespb</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49922/</a></p>
