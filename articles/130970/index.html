  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyanogenmod 7.1 firmware on HTC Desire S</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hooray, it happened.  HTC Desire S was included in the list of supported devices for Cyanogenmod firmware, it happened with the release of 7.1. Previously, there was also the possibility of firmware, but I had to use assemblies with XDA, although they worked.  Who cares how - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  So, you have HTC Desire S with official HTC firmware.  In order to avoid misunderstandings with software compatibility, I recommend, for a start, to roll all the official updates that exist now for this beast.  More we will be interested in the version of HBOOT (bootloader).  To find out, you need to turn off the phone (and turn <b>it</b> off <b>completely</b> ; to do this, you must uncheck the <b>Quick Download</b> checkbox in the settings, or turn it off as it is, and distort the battery), then hold down the volume rocker.  The bootloader menu will be displayed on the screen, the HBOOT version will be shown above, the correct and necessary one is 0.98.0002, although it should work from 0.98.0000 too, but I did not check it.  Also on top should be the inscription S-ON, this means that the phone is not unlocked. <br><br><h4>  Roll recovery and do S-OFF </h4><br>  We go to <a href="http://revolutionary.io/">revolutionary.io</a> and download the latest version of the softphone from there, which will help us to do what we‚Äôre looking for, and although its status is still beta, it works perfectly, out of 5 attempts (with different phones) everything ended successfully.  While the jump is in progress we fill in the form, the serial number of the device can be peeped under the battery cover, or on the box. <br><br><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/1162/revform.png" alt="image">

      After clicking the <b>Generate key</b> button, the site will return the key. <br><br><img src="http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/7720/keyp.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It needs to be remembered, but better written.  Now go to <b>Menu-&gt; Phone Settings-&gt; Applications-&gt; Development</b> and tick <b>USB Debugging</b> .  In addition, you need to install the driver, you can take it <a href="">here</a> ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù by this time should have already downloaded, unpack the archive where it is convenient, for example in C: \ revo. <br><br>  Well, the preparation for the process is finished, we begin to sew.  We connect the phone via USB cable to the computer, wait until the device is installed in the operating system, go to the folder with the unpacked archive and start the revolutionary.exe (I don‚Äôt know the linux owners, but I think it‚Äôs not much more difficult).  Next, follow the instructions of the program, everything is simple. <br><br><img src="http://sdl1.4pda.ru/1088537/2.png?0003dc5dc3ef67524e9d4fb5000000000b1a75570b8a510f72cf6db6d21edf35" alt="image" title="The screen is wrapped with w3bsit3-dns.com"><br><br>  Toward the end of the procedure, the question will be asked: <b>Do you want to download (Internet connection required) and flash ClockworkMod Recovery?</b>  - here, you definitely need to agree, otherwise, then you will have to roll up the recovery separately (although for supporters of other recovery mods, you just have to refuse). <br><br>  While revolutionary is working, the phone will reboot several times, this is normal.  It is strictly not recommended during the process to remove the device from the cable and to do other unnatural things.  Great risk to get beautiful glossy bricks.  When the revolutionary is finished, boot again into the bootloader to make sure: S-OFF is received.  Above the pink inscription Revolutionary will flaunt.  With the volume rocker, go to the recovery item and press the power button, ClockworkMod should load. <br><br>  <i><b>By the way, what is S-ON / S-OFF?</b></i>  <i><b>That's what about this <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D233375">w3bsit3-dns.com</a> tells us:</b></i> <br>  <i>‚ÄúOn the new HTC devices, a security called secuflag has been installed.</i>  <i>This protection mounts read-only in the / system and / recovery sections, that is, we cannot directly change / copy system files from the phone, nor can we flash zip files through fastboot and recovery, since the protection only allows HTC signed files .S-OFF turns off all checks in the bootloader, mounting in the / system and / recovery read / wrire sections.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In this case, we have the opportunity to change the system files, delete unnecessary programs from the firmware directly from the phone, resize the system partitions, download picture (Splash), etc. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  Back up and sew </h4><br>  First of all, I recommend making a full backup of the system built into the recovery utility <b>Nandroid</b> , so that if something goes wrong, you can roll back.  To do this in lockworkbod, go to the <b>backup and restore</b> item (navigation in the menu is done with the volume rocker, select the menu item with the power button) and select the <b>Backup</b> item.  The backup process is displayed on the screen.  Saving goes to the SD card along the way: clockworkmod / backup /, the backups themselves are called up to the current date.  <b>Attention!</b>  Do not rename the directories with backups, otherwise they will not be restored later, Nandroid will swear at the mismatch of MD5 sums. <br><br>  After the backup is complete, you can flash Cyanogenmod 7.1.  We take it <b><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices/htc-desire-s">here</a></b> , I recommend stitching only stable releases, as a last resort, RC (release candidates).  You will also need to pick up an archive with proprietary Google applications, this is <b><a href="http://goo-inside.me/gapps/">here</a></b> .  I deliberately do not provide direct links to files, versions do change from time to time.  Downloaded archives need to be thrown into the root of the SD card.  To do this, you do not have to pull the card out of the phone or boot into Android, just go to the <b>Mounts and Storage</b> item and select <b>mount USB storage</b> , after this manipulation, the SD card will appear as a removable disk in your computer, after copying, just leave this menu item and card will be mounted again. <br><br>  Well, that was the last step, the firmware itself.  To begin with, we will do a full wipe (wipe, clear) of the file system. <b>Wipe data / factory reset-&gt; Yes - delete all user data</b> .  Now select the <b>install zip from sdcard-&gt; choose zip from sdcard items</b> and first <b>specify the update-cm-7.1.0-DesireS-signed.zip</b> archive, and after the end of the process we repeat for <b>gapps-gb-20110828-signed.zip</b> . <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Congratulations, you can now restart the phone and, offering prayers and promises to be good to the gods, wait for the device to be fully loaded.  If everything went well, you will be met by an android on a skateboard, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7d/7b5/c7c/d7d7b5c7ca5ed97548f757edf0822d02.png" alt="image"><br><br>  and then the standard initial settings dialog.  After this, the first thing to do is to create a Google account, then the Google Apps Setup dialog will open, where you can select the products you need from the good corporation.  <b>Attention!</b>  This dialog will open only once, I do not know how to call it again, so think ahead that you may need from these applications.  In addition, I also want to note that this firmware is already rutovana, that is, it contains the su utility, and there is no need to take additional actions to obtain the superuser rights.  By the way, using this manual, you can install other ROMs that are compatible with HTC Desire S, but it's better for them to read about the installation nuances on the thematic sites. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  By the way, often phones with custom firmware are not accepted under warranty, so before going to SC (if necessary) you need to return the device to stock form, but this is in the next article. <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> <br>  And remember, everything you do with your phone, you do at your own peril and risk.  The author of the article is not responsible for damaged devices and nerves and other bathert connected with the re-flashing of YOUR device. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130970/</a></p>
