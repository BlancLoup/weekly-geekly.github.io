  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spring update</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since the last <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/announcements/83874/">announcement</a> of the release of the function ‚ÄúZero Karma‚Äù, we have made quite a few changes to the design and engine of the site.  The purpose of this post is to briefly talk about the changes and tell about future plans. <br><br>  So, everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Settings </h4><br>  Until the last moment, the settings (along with the mail) remained the most intact section since the site was founded in 2006.  The section was a chaotic jumble of those or other options scattered across different pages and sections.  Now - more order.  All settings are in one section and divided into subsections.  Several new ones created specially at the request of users were added to the existing options: a separate setting was added to prevent badges from being displayed in the profile, and an additional notification setting that allows you to enable / disable notifications for new comments only for your topics (previously about new comments only to all topics). <br><br><h4>  post office </h4><br>  The biggest change is in the commenting system.  If earlier in the mail a tree-like commenting system was used, now it is a linear one.  No more scrolling down the correspondence page to read the new comment.  The last answer will always be at the top of the discussion.

    <h4>  <strike>Badges</strike> -&gt; Badges </h4><br>  We were mistaken with the name "badges".  This word seemed too foreign to many users, others argued about correct spelling - and they were right.  Anyway, friends from <a href="http://www.turbomilk.com/">Turbomilk</a> came to help <a href="http://www.turbomilk.com/">us</a> and offered to draw new badges.  Such offers are never refused, as a result <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/people/">, new icons</a> were <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/people/">drawn</a> , which they immediately decided to call ‚Äúbadges‚Äù.  We hope Habrap users will like new works of graphic art from the banks of the Volga and the number of users who use the setting to turn off the display of icons in the profile will be quite small. <br><br><h4>  Antiminusator </h4><br>  We would like to apologize to the users who were put in the so-called "topics of evil."  After each manifestation of hatred, we receive a large number of letters, including angry and threatening.  To exclude such manifestations in the future, from yesterday on the ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù another special bot watches.  His name is "Semyon Semyonich", he tracks and shoots "minus", blocking the function of voting for karma, topics and comments for an indefinite time.  By "minuscateurs" a bot understands users minus n times cn frequency for n time interval.  If the same user gets on the radar "Semyon Semyonych" twice, the user will go into the hands of the "Guard" - another bot, more severe and strict. <br><br><h4>  BCP </h4><br>  Since the end of winter on Habr√© operates PPG - Literacy Improvement Program.  The goal of the program is to increase the awareness of users in the rules of the site and acquaint with recommendations on the design of posts.  First of all, the BCP applies to users who publish posts on the site.  Before publishing a new post, the user should tick the box next to each item on the page with the rules and recommendations.  The procedure is carried out only once and takes about 1 minute. <br><br><h4>  More changes </h4><br>  The order of the output of blocks (‚ÄúLive‚Äù, ‚ÄúWork‚Äù, etc.) in the right column on the main page, blog page and post page has changed.  A new block ‚ÄúThe best in 24 hours‚Äù has been added, which broadcasts the most popular posts published in the past 24 hours in thematic and corporate blogs. <br>  Added highlighting of mined comments.  Now the comments are clarified - depending on the minuses typed.  For readability when hovering the mouse, the mined comment is returned to its original state. <br>  In the restrictions tied to the karma of the user, one more was added.  Now users with karma &lt;‚Äì30 can leave only one comment per hour. <br>  The rules for calculating the Star and Legend badges have changed: now for the Star there are more than 20 published topics, for the Legend more than 30. As before, the rating of each topic should be more than 50 points. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  We are working on improving the post editor.  The current one is not very consistent with current tasks, especially for posts with a backlit software code.  Next, we plan to start implementing various extensions to improve work with Habrahabr.  But before we release a completely new section.  Approximately launch is expected in mid-summer, possibly already at the end of June. <br><br>  UPD: We set up a separate server for uploading images to posts on Habr.  We will try to release as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93954/</a></p>
