  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How complex automation can help if you have a small business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Comprehensive automation is the optimization of all areas of the company. </p><br><p>  For small industrial and warehouse enterprises, retail enterprises, work automation is the main condition for full growth and business development. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Small business interested in automation with minimal cost" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9d/e0d/fbe/d9de0dfbe80a109e6446d2a0f77f3170.jpg" alt=" "></div><br><blockquote>  Today it is impossible to manually control the entire document flow: deliveries and shipment of goods, warehouse inventory, etc. Business automation is an opportunity to keep abreast of events, to receive necessary reports at any time and to avoid errors and costs associated with the human factor. </blockquote><p>  But when it comes to small business, there is one problem - a small enterprise does not always have enough resources to conduct complex automation.  Lack of own IT staff and understanding of the main tasks of the process does not allow solving this problem on its own. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Format, objectives and stages of automation of small businesses </h2><br><p>  Carrying out complex automation in a small enterprise most often takes place through the involvement of a <a href="http://scanport.ru/">specialized company</a> , development team. </p><br><p>  <strong>The first stage of</strong> implementation of the system involves conducting an audit (survey) of business processes.  Representatives of the development company study the process descriptions, regulatory documents available at the enterprise, conduct interviews with managers and experts, and, if necessary, travel to the site. </p><br><blockquote>  The main task of the survey is to get a complete picture of the business process in the form in which it exists, in order to further analyze the work and develop recommendations for optimization. </blockquote><p>  The result of the audit of business processes is the conclusion in which the specialists of the outsourcing company diagnose the data and give recommendations on the automation options. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="The introduction of effective automation begins with a detailed survey of existing business processes." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/790/e00/c7d/790e00c7d53d5c4847c78ba7a00e6cb9.jpg" alt=" - "></div><br><p>  <strong>The second stage</strong> involves the conclusion of an agreement on the introduction of automation using <a href="http://scanport.ru/solutions/">ready-made software solutions of a</a> developer or the creation of software for individual client needs. </p><br><p>  As a rule, when it comes to small business, for example, a small warehouse or courier service, ready-made solutions fully cover the needs, and their use saves. </p><br><p>  <strong>The third stage</strong> is to test the performance of the system by the developer.  The purchase of the necessary equipment for the implementation of the system in the enterprise.  We are talking about data collection terminals, barcode scanners, RFID and POS equipment, etc. </p><br><p>  <strong>The final stage</strong> involves the introduction of a system at a small business facility and the training of personnel in new operating principles. </p><br><p>  Most often, small companies come to the introduction of complex automation systems under the pressure of circumstances.  This may be the inefficiency of the work: low relevance or discrepancy of data, the difficulty of obtaining reports.  Or, for example, changes in legislation, as in the case of the adoption of the Federal Law-54, which prescribes the introduction of a new procedure for the use of cash registers.  But the results of automation prove that the decision on its implementation is always justified. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Automation turns an enterprise into a smoothly functioning mechanism." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/662/a1b/4e4/662a1b4e402cd6e0e297c5062cb79deb.jpg" alt=" "></div><br><p>  Comprehensive automation allows you to achieve the following goals: </p><br><ul><li>  increase the accuracy and simplify the execution of all working operations; </li><li>  provide multi-user work with different levels of access; </li><li>  reduce the number of errors; </li><li>  minimize the influence of the human factor (including the plundering of goods and materials); </li><li>  solve the problem of accounting for goods with a large nomenclature; </li><li>  get rid of problems such as re-grading and data inconsistency; </li><li>  provide guidance with current reporting data; </li><li>  provide accurate information about the work of staff to implement an effective incentive system. </li></ul><br><h2>  Automation results and system integrator selection </h2><br><p>  With increasing competition, small businesses are forced to more carefully treat cost savings.  The main assistant in this is complex automation.  Without it, development slows down, so automation systems are in demand by small businesses. </p><br><p>  Accurate work without errors, accurate accounting and reporting are the results of automation.  But for it to go smoothly, you need to choose a responsible developer, such as the <a href="http://scanport.ru/">Scanport Company</a> .  He is an expert in barcode-based automation, RFID tags and other automatic identification technologies.  The company supplies both software and necessary equipment. </p><br><p>  The system of integrated automation is developed and implemented based on the specific tasks of the customer's business.  Free technical support, service and warranty support are provided, staff training is provided.  In case of any changes in legislation regarding accounting, the system is updated as soon as possible. </p><br><p>  Cooperation with Scanport Company will provide a quick, easy and least expensive transition to a new style of work. </p></div>
