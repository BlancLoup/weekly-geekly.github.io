Now, only fruit vendors and htc are absent in this segment, all other manufacturers somehow released their devices with a size of ~ 5+ inches, and LG also did not stand aside: Optimus G Pro reached Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/892/1de/da2/8921deda28c05eb9f3b0b16bd04cfca6.jpg"><br><br>  In all respects, it can be attributed to ‚Äúshades‚Äù - a huge display, a large battery, a high resolution of the display, the ability to call without using a granitor.  I already had the flagship LG Optimus G, it showed excellent results in all aspects, starting with performance and design, ending with autonomy, and I really waited for the G Pro - I liked the new course that LG took in the field of smartphone construction.  What did I expect from G Pro?  Transferring the developments on the flagship device to the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù or ‚Äúphablet‚Äù, as you like.  High-quality screen.  Good camera.  Excellent performance.  Pleasant materials and appearance of the device.  Current OS.  What really happened? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The screen size has increased to five and a half inches, the resolution has grown to FullHD, the updated processor, which is labeled Snapdragon 600, has become a fiery heart, and the battery volume has increased one and a half times - to an impressive 3140 mAh.

But besides the Note (and budget Mega) there are a few Chinese ceiling lamps on the market, and among them there is only one more or less decent competitor: <a href="">Huawei Ascend Mate</a> .  I can‚Äôt say anything about it - a smartphone as a smartphone, a screen and a processor a little worse, a battery (theoretically) a little more, a camera of unknown quality.  That is, of course, he will find his buyer, but I don‚Äôt turn my tongue to call this device advanced. <br><br>  Of the ‚Äúdecent‚Äù competitors, there are also Galaxy S 4 (which has a slightly smaller screen), Sony Xperia Z (again, five-inch), and with a very big stretch - the flagship htc, although it is generally a competitor only in terms of hardware, form factor closer to classic smartphones. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Galaxy Note II <br></td><td>  Optimus G Pro <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen <br></td><td>  5.55 "AMOLED 1280x720, 265ppi <br></td><td>  5.5 "IPS 1920x1080, 400ppi <br></td></tr><tr><td>  CPU <br></td><td>  Exynos 4412 (4xCortex-A9@1.6 GHz) <br></td><td>  Qualcomm 600 (4xKrait@1.7 GHz) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Memory <br></td><td>  2GB RAM / 16 GB Flash + MicroSDHC <br></td><td>  2GB RAM / 32 GB Flash + MicroSDXC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery <br></td><td>  Removable, 3100 mAh <br></td><td>  Removable, 3140 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Camera (rear / front) <br></td><td>  8MPx / 1.9MPx <br></td><td>  13MPx / 2.1MPx <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As you can see, in all respects, G Pro is not inferior to its direct competitor.  But the numbers - in numbers, but the actual impressions of the device can be very different.  So what about the G Pro? <br><br><h1>  Appearance, screen and ergonomics </h1><br>  By common forms, the device resembles an increased Optimus G, which, however, is difficult to surprise anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce3/702/c01/ce3702c0187100d1294533c249f19f26.jpg"><br><br>  Continuity of images, common features of the ruler and all that.  However, in the details, the G Pro is very different from its ‚Äúlittle‚Äù brother: a neat silver edging, side buttons, rear panel styling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfa/792/390/cfa792390b9872075c731ba45eddb919.jpg"><br><br>  Signature textured coating did not disappear, but the glass disappeared from behind, and the battery became removable.  In general, everything can be seen in the photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36a/275/830/36a275830fcdaa4bdee62f72f5d1c5bc.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is bright and juicy, does not lose colors at any angle, fades in the sun, but remains within the bounds of decency, the text is easily distinguishable.  To be honest, after it, using Nexus is a bit strange: it seems that the device is not old, the hardware is up-to-date, the screen is good, but you don‚Äôt look at websites without zoom, less information fits on the screen, and you don‚Äôt really want to watch videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab8/e52/552/ab8e525529fe0e0699682e27fdb886fd.jpg"><br><br>  I had the same feeling after returning the test Galaxy S III and using my S II.  This is a really cool experience - the ability to use the Internet at 5.5 inches without activating the zoom: the clarity of the screen is enough to read the main text.  The side faces are much thinner than the Galaxy Note II, which allows you to more comfortably use the device with one hand and is much easier to type text in portrait orientation.  I would say that the device in terms of holding with one hand is quite a competitor Galaxy S IV. <br><br><h1>  Filling and Performance </h1><br>  Optimus G Pro is based on the Snapdragon 600 platform. Quad-core processor, architecture - Krait.  The Internet is full of tests of systems on the 600th Snapdragon, and they all show excellent results.  Proshka was no exception: in Antutu, the smartphone is gaining more than 20,000 points, in the Quadrant it is about 12 and a half thousand.  Worthy result, however, from 600'ki other and do not expect. <br><br>  For the acceleration of the graphics is responsible Adreno 320 second revision.  Differences from 320'ki, used in APQ8064 (Chipset from Optimus G and Nexus 4) - full support for technology OpenGL ES 3.0, which allows you to bring graphics in mobile devices to a new level.  In Crysis, of course, do not play, but the new mobile games show quite a decent picture.  BEFORE PS Vita is not yet mature, but Vita has access to the hardware at a much lower level, and the toys do not share a light wedge. <br><br>  The smartphone supports all current wireless technologies; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/77b/45e/668/77b45e668c09a4269e5367834144f5c6.jpg"><br>  <sup>Some kind of antenna sealed in plastic main body.</sup>  <sup>Who will tell you what it is?</sup>  <sup>Bluetooth?</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b5/522/72a/2b552272a45d7e02cc631a41273e1c6f.jpg"><br>  <sup>NFC-Antenna and wireless Qi-charging coil built into the battery cover</sup> <br><br>  This includes LTE communication, plus the good old IR port, with which you can control various home appliances, has returned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5f/5c6/2d7/c5f5c62d78b1649e9a966ea93757ed4d.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, it was not possible to test it in the case - there is no TV at home (I don‚Äôt need it).  On the other hand, there are reviews by foreign authors, nobody complains there - everything works.  Well, in all cafes / bars / shopping centers you can have fun knowing the model of the TV. <br><br><h1>  Autonomy </h1><br>  The burning question.  With autonomy, everything is in order, despite the impressive size of the screen and one of the top SoC inside, light day (from 8 am to 10 pm), the smartphone transfers without any problems: SMS, music, Internet, games, movies and calls in the process of testing, I run on it.  What seems to be the autonomy of the apple device ... It‚Äôs well written <a href="http://hi-news.ru/phone/u-kakogo-smartfona-samaya-luchshaya-batareya.html">here</a> .  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d8/f1b/b8a/1d8f1bb8a82383ea7e9cb5d6ce3b040c.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, if you turn on some Asphalt 7, unscrew the brightness to the maximum and play-play-play until greening, the battery will give up after a couple of hours.  True, it is replaceable, and in the American delivery there are two of them + the charger supports simultaneous charging of both the battery and Optimus itself, so you can play all day long, if you have a great desire and there is an outlet nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/373/f9e/b67/373f9eb67aa3f6dccfbab7044147d888.jpg"><br><br>  Charging "from zero to hundreds" of the device for 2 hours and 10-15 minutes.  With my ‚Äúlazy‚Äù wiz-case, the device stayed for two days, with active use in the evening there were about 30-40%.  Pleasant result. <br><br><h1>  Soft </h1><br>  The set of applications is standard for the 2013 line, everything is the same as in Optimus G: both QuickMemo, the camera-translator, the set of dictionaries, and the file manager are no different from those in other LG devices of the latest generation.  The main difference is the new applications for controlling household appliances through IrDA and an improved keyboard, which, in addition to standard modes, has another one that allows pressing a reduced-width keyboard to one of the screen faces.  The Russian keyboard was not ennobled with punctuation marks and additional symbols, accessible by a long click.  It was mentioned so many times in reviews and sent to LG as petitions and requests that it was time to put this fact in the minuses of the device. <br><br><h1>  Stylus </h1><br>  Optimus G Pro does not use Wacom technology, and bundled with it does not have the capacitive pen that Optimus Vu had.  The absence of an induction pen that responds to pressing and tilting forces reduced the cost of the device and installed a highly sensitive capacitive type sensor.  Of course, he does not transmit the force of pressing, but where he works faster and does not cause a delay in writing notes or drawing in Q-Memo.  In the summer with gloves, you don‚Äôt look like much, but through the fabric the screen perfectly understands where your finger was poked.  At the same time, the sensitivity obviously has some auto-tuning, since  the first few clicks he recognized so-so, and subsequently worked the first time. <br><br><h1>  Camera </h1><br>  LG Inzherens finally got to the camera and its applications! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/453/f70/03f/453f7003f5de0ef7e31a8fbba70488c4.jpg"><br><br>  A normal Burst-shot appeared (moreover, the queue length and speed allow you to glue quite good GIFs), a lot of different plot presets, a good ‚Äúcamera‚Äù HDRi.  The autofocus algorithm has been fixed, it has become better to cling to objects and enjoy working in difficult conditions. <br><br>  The module itself is significantly larger than that of Optimus G, hardware, I think there are also quite a few differences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d91/bd9/87e/d91bd987ed75aaf6d862c3053a37738d.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not take so many photos (there are various reasons for this), so some of the photos were honestly taken from foreign (and not so) reviews. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13c/e2c/ff8/13ce2cff8a7d828a3b354b99e34e05c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/671/065/861/6710658614aed39c73a187c8fea221ad.jpg"><br><br><img alt="Image #1865841, 4 MB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3d/e14/21c/d3de1421cc73bc246949a50eddebaee8.jpg" title="Image # 1865841, 4 MB"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e1/f84/365/4e1f84365dfda9b692404a128b1247ba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/469/c24/f7e/469c24f7edc09958fa42d20a03cec9cf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/219/c16/0ea/219c160eaf3a97633f1338e3960b8b07.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/b1f/0d4/e6bb1f0d41b1bfbde6ebfbd75c7e7533.jpg"><br><br><img alt="Image #1865843, 4.8 MB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd9/2f7/845/dd92f7845f67afda4ee788db55143b9d.jpg" title="Image # 1865843, 4.8 MB"><br><br>  The camera shoots well in HDR: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e56/7ea/641/e567ea64173be53715f2138be8198860.jpg"><br>  <sup>Frame without <b>HDR</b></sup> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/b6d/a9d/4cbb6da9d47b00299cea2cb0c86bfc89.jpg"><br>  <sup><b>HDR</b> frame</sup> <br><br>  And its rate of fire allows you to glue quite good gifs: <br><img alt="Image #1865883, 4.4 MB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd4/2a6/318/cd42a6318a479a4354d0a86c25fbbd70.gif" title="Image # 1865883, 4.4 MB"><br></div></div><br><br>  Pleasantly pleased with the video quality: autofocus works smoothly, the exposure meter tries not to fake and give the main objects a normal level of illumination, the sound does not suffer from the ‚Äúconcert effect‚Äù, the colors are more or less similar to those that should be visible to the eye. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCJz95kf-Ic%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsyvE5_9SbYlUh6zkAP6s3nvPhBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzvGPo4Ql7U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAoA9cWyaJwYe77DkNEMSSa4UOJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Unfortunately, engineers still need some work with the camera software itself.  Shumodav aggressively climbs where it would not be worth it, the white balance is sometimes determined in a very strange way, and in the dark so much noise ... Well, but you can see that you are taking pictures. <br><br><h1>  In total: </h1><br>  It is time to draw a line.  Optimus G Pro is a worthy competitor to everyone on the market 5.2 - 6 inch devices. <br><br>  Yes, G Pro does not have a stylus and it does not brew coffee, but, you see, a pen is not so often required, especially sensitive to pressing, and it is better to entrust coffee to a good coffee maker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ac/871/954/4ac871954914ad1b6bf0e4bf2c5640f9.jpg"><br><br>  But he is incredibly fast, has an excellent battery (maybe even two, everything will depend on what equipment will be sold in Russia), updated camera, good body from practical and resistant to impact and scratches plastic, well, just excellent 5.5 "Full HD - Display can not be discounted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b25/3ca/cf9/b253cacf938af605cfa9b243e5db9499.jpg"><br><br>  G Pro liked foreign critics and users, but we can only wait a bit - the device will go on sale very soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186306/</a></p>
