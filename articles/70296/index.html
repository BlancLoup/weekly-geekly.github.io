  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical writer: about languages ‚Äã‚Äãand countries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, what languages ‚Äã‚Äãdoes a technical writer use in IT? <br><br>  <b>English.</b>  THIS IS A MUST, as they say.  It so happened that this is the standard in the world of information technology.  The technician in this field is simply obliged to master it, regardless of what is his main working language.  Otherwise ... alas. <br>  By the way, what pleases is that it is easy and pleasant to read documentation in English (as well as scientific articles, by the way).  It is usually written in simple and easy to understand language. <br>  Often, even in Russian documentation is more difficult. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sample documentation: <a href="http://www.starwindsoftware.com/images/content/starwind_best_practicies_guide.pdf">http://www.starwindsoftware.com/images/content/starwind_best_practicies_guide.pdf</a> .  If you understand and feel about it, you can write as well - well, good luck! <br><br>  <b>Deutsch.</b>  In the expanses of Europe, an important language.  If there is documentation, then why not be in German?  So say the speakers of this language. <br>  Pros: the language of the German group, so many terms are either English or similar to English (das Netzwerk = network, but the keyboard is already die Tastatur).  Disadvantages: the documentation is written in a very blocky and official syllable, which is sometimes recognized even by the carriers.  So a person who wants to develop writing documentation in this language will have to sweat well.

      Here is a good and blank example of documentation: <a href="http://www.kolab.org/doc/Allgemeine-Betriebsdokumentation-KolabServer22_20080103_1.0.pdf">http://www.kolab.org/doc/Allgemeine-Betriebsdokumentation-KolabServer22_20080103_1.0.pdf</a> .  So what do you think? <br><br>  <b>French.</b>  Unfortunately, I am not familiar with this language at all.  He is not among the most popular in IT, but from time to time in vacancies he skips something like this: ‚ÄúFor long-term cooperation, you need a remote technical writer who is able to create documentation in French in the field of software for pharmacy automation in France.‚Äù  ( <a href="http://www.it4business.ru/forum/topic13528.html">http://www.it4business.ru/forum/topic13528.html</a> ).  Or even like this: <a href="http://jobs.belhard.com/vacancies/techwriter">http://jobs.belhard.com/vacancies/techwriter</a> <a href="http://jobs.belhard.com/vacancies/techwriter"><br></a> <br>  In any case, if you speak this language and are interested in information technology - you will be in demand. <br><br>  Here is an example of documentation in French: <a href="">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.pdf.fr</a> <a href=""><br></a> <br><br>  <b>Spanish.</b>  The language of Goya and Cervantes is becoming increasingly popular in the world.  Moreover, it is the second <u>European</u> language in the world (after English, of course) in terms of the number of speakers.  Looking at the website of the University of Nueva Leon <a href="http://www.uanl.mx/">http://www.uanl.mx/</a> , you understand that with such a pace, he may well come close to the leader.  Especially liked on this site the virtual museum of modern art and the electronic library in which you can read rare books, for example, the edition ‚ÄúNabob‚Äù by Alfons Daude of the 1880s ... <br>  Latin America is now starting to wake up.  Note that the relationship between the former colonies and the metropolis is not as it may seem.  Yes, there was a huge number of wars of independence, Spain imported slaves there and turned the local population into slaves.  But Spain is Spain, you do not touch it.  Hugo Chavez may fight for megasocialist ideas, but comes to the Spanish king for an audience and conference, Fidel Castro fights for the same thing, but Cuba helps to eliminate illiteracy (and it still exists there!) In the former metropolis.  And the Cuban Technical University, according to my Spanish teacher, not so long ago developed some large software for Gazprom.  Unfortunately, I did not find confirmation of this fact on the Net.  But all these factors give rise to thoughts about the future of the Spanish language. <br>  But we digress ... <br>  Already, at the interviews begin, in addition to compulsory English, to ask about the knowledge of Spanish.  But those who know him are mostly girls who like Spain, Enrique Iglesias, salsa but, alas, having very little to do with technology.  Do not think for sexism, but most often it happens.  There are almost no technical specialists with knowledge of this language in our country.  It's a pity.  It may come in handy soon. <br>  A few notes for those interested: Spanish is not quite as simple as everyone who has studied it will agree with me.  Computer terms, I think, look more like French: el teclado is a keyboard, la red is a network, it is good that software is software here. <br>  By the way, if you are a freelance technical writer and speak this language, and you also have a degree, you can ask your home university if they are going to introduce any special technical subjects in this language.  In one of the Kiev universities, such a program exists, only there are no specialists who would simultaneously speak language and materiel.  But it would be good: there is really little work, and at the same time there is a practice of spoken language.  Yes, and teaching at the university is considered a prestigious job abroad. <br><br>  Well, for a snack, as usual - an example of documentation: <a href="">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.pdf.es</a> <br><br>  <b>Portuguese.</b>  Patugalia, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde ... mda ... Brazil ... Brazil! <br>  A few months ago I read some article about the state of the IT industry in this country.  It was noted that there are many excellent programmers.  Well, this is not news.  But what was interesting was that their rather low knowledge of English was noted.  But this moment is more interesting and, perhaps, it is worth paying attention to this country.  I think that at the junction of English and Portuguese (that is, the writer will be explained in Portuguese, and he will write in English) there are chances to develop in this region of the information world. <br>  By the way, Portuguese Portuguese is very different from Brazilian Portuguese.  If you own the first, but wish to master the second, there is an option to search ... the closest section of capoeira (this is not a joke! In any case, in Kiev there are such retraining courses at one of the schools for those who already know the original Portuguese).  Or perhaps you will find yourself a new non-computer hobby, not all are sitting in front of the monitor ... <br>  By the way, here is a summary of the average technical writer from Brazil: <a href="http://www.odesk.com/users/Native-Brazilian-English-Portuguese-Translator_~~d64545b97d12842e">http://www.odesk.com/users/Native-Brazilian-English-Portuguese-Translator_</a> ~~d64545b97d12842e <br><br>  Here are some examples of documentation: <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.pdf.pt_BR, ">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.pdf.pt_BR, http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.pdf.pt</a> . <br><br>  You like?  Then do not lose time :) <br><br>  <b>Italian.</b>  In the Apennines, the software development market is extremely small.  Of the giants, we can only recall Olivetti, who, during the Soviet Union, had placed his ad on the chimes of the ‚ÄúTime‚Äù program.  Readers with experience, of course, remember.  Most of the other companies are outsourcing. <br>  Unfortunately, it is difficult to speak about the prospects of this language in the IT sphere.  Among the Italians I have ever met, no one knew English, this is typical of southern nations.  However, I did not see any Italian programmers either.  Therefore ... the language of opera, literature, the second state in Somalia (there are those who want to go there on a cruise?), But not the world of information technology.  However, readers can correct me if I'm wrong. <br><br>  As usual, sample documentation: <a href="">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/ia64/index.html.it</a> <br><br>  <b>Post-Soviet space, state languages.</b>  But do not laugh.  After all, there are government programs, especially before the arrival of any important delegations, when it is necessary to show that ‚Äúwe have this too!‚Äù.  Because if you really really need to yesterday, then in the post-Soviet space money is often not considered, and wages can be very good. <br>  And if you take non-state projects, you can also make good money on them.  Personally, I have this experience. <br>  So prepare a resume in your native language, revise the grammar and monitor the situation.  After all, what the hell is not joking ... <br><br>  Unfortunately, I know nothing about such languages ‚Äã‚Äãas Chinese, Hindi and Arabic and their use for writing IT documentation.  But maybe our reader knows more? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70296/</a></p>
