    <h4>  Dissolution of Dota 2 formulations </h4><br>  The VP dota teams have a difficult history: the teams never could boast of a stable game and taking big titles.  All the compositions of the "Virtus" in recent years have been completely unpredictable: today they destroy the Tier-1 rival on the whole map, and tomorrow they lose to the second-tier team. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even in the presence of players with a high personal skill (as an example, you can bring VP VP Sergey God Bragin), the team constantly lacks something.  Whether the matter is in communication between the players, or in a constant lane of bad luck, or in management. <br><br>  The last straw for the leadership of the organization was the failure of both teams of ‚Äúbears‚Äù (VP and VP: Polarity) in qualifying for the main tournament of the year - The International 6. At the group stage, the main team of VP took only sixth place along with two other teams from the CIS: Team Empire and Vega Squadron.  The second part of the VP - Polarity, also qualification for TI did not pass. <br><br>  In addition, along with the disbandment of the teams, two managers of the organization were also removed from their posts.  Georgy ‚ÄúdrAmer‚Äù Faleev and Sergey ‚ÄúDiver233‚Äù Pisotsky were relieved of their posts.  Anton Cherepennikov, who is one of the leaders and founders of the current Virtus.Pro in 2010, will fulfill the organization‚Äôs temporary responsibilities as the organization‚Äôs CEO.  In addition to the duties of the director, he will be engaged in the collection of new teams and their training sessions in manual mode. <br><br><h4>  Hots all </h4><br>  In addition to the dissolution of the Dota 2 teams, the entire Blastard MOBA-Heroes of the Storm line was launched under the knife.  This game appeared a few years ago and was actively promoted by the ‚Äúblizzard‚Äù, however, the powerful positions of League Of Legends and Dota 2, as well as the features of the game mechanics of HotS itself, for example, the lack of familiar ‚Äúfarm‚Äù and the collective growth of the level of characters to win a place under the sun from competitors. <br><br>  The leadership of Virtus.Pro HotS direction was considered unpromising.  It is for this reason that the organization refuses this discipline and dismisses its team on it. <br><br><h4>  Outlook Virtus.Pro </h4><br>  Almost with full confidence we can say that we will meet part of the players from the old squad even after collecting the new team.  So, most likely, the leader of the team Sergey God Bragin and the former captain Artem Fng Barshak will remain in their positions.  The return to the ‚Äúbears‚Äù of Ilya Illidan Pivtsayev, who now stands for the Fantastic Five team, is also called likely.  Whether Virtus.pro will continue to experiment with the presence of another team in one game is unknown. <br><br><h4>  Other disciplines </h4><br>  Of the serious assets, Bears has only the Polish CS: GO team, which, however, according to hltv.org, has not been happy to play a stable game in recent months, either.  Now the team, which is recognized as one of the most stable in the world in terms of composition, has dropped to the seventh line of the rating of teams according to hltv.org.  And if VP can win against Tier-2 teams (for example, the last four meetings with Gambit were 16-6, 16-6 and 16-8 in favor of the Poles, the Russian team was able to take only one card, de_nuke, in a fierce fight against 16-12), the teams from the top 3 rankings (Brazilian Luminosity, French G2 and CIS-team NaVi) most often do not like the Poles.  In any case, the composition of CS: GO will hardly touch, since all its players are world-class professionals. <br><br>  Another compound that missed the trouble was the Virtus.Pro team in the Hearthstone card game.  But HS is a niche direction and there are no leagues with serious prizes and such a huge community as in Dota 2. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that the organization is extremely motivated for the result not only for the sake of large prizes and attracting sponsors and advertisers: in October 2015, USM mining and metallurgical holding owned by billionaire Alisher Usmanov invested $ 100 million in the organization Virtus.Pro.  Not a single cybersport organization has previously received such investments, and Usmanov‚Äôs step became a signal that cybersport is a promising direction and it is worthy of attention of large businesses and investors, but so far the Bears have failed to justify the trust shown by the billionaire. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395623/</a></p>
