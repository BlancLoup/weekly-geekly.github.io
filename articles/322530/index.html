      Mamikon was born in 1979.  He graduated from MADI TU.  From 2002 to the present day she has worked for Lester IT.  Married, two children. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  I solve problems of varying complexity, including those with which none of the company's employees, including me, have encountered.  You have to understand and fix problems. </li><li>  Together with the director of the IT department, I conduct productive training for a group of developers, I study with them. </li><li>  I advise staff on solutions. </li></ul><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Drill (pobedit) <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  About 8-9, usually, except for time on the road. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  7-8 hours. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  I do not have breakfast.  Maximum - a cup of Turkish brewed coffee.  She is mostly absorbed in watching cartoons with my children (smiles). <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  I read and outline technical literature. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  Todoist. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Google Mail, Skype, Telegram, actually, Todoist, Google Keep, banking services; <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  TaskTracker. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  SQL Server Management Studio, SQL Server Profiler, Visual Studio 2015, Outlook, OneNote, Telegram, Notepad ++, Total Commander, TortoiseSVN, SOAPUI, MS Office. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  TaskTracker is a proprietary product.  There is also a manager for synchronizing versions of elements of assemblies installed on databases with elements of file storage assemblies. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Urgent switch to other tasks. </li><li>  Questions from the employee, which he had already asked. </li><li>  The realization that the deadline is almost yesterday, but this is rarely the case (smiles). </li></ul><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  It is quite readable material from the authors of official literature of Microsoft: Itzik Ben-Gunn, Dejan Sark, Glenn Johnson. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Definitely electronic "reader".  I am comfortable with the size, the ability to search the content of the book.  In addition, the tablet is much easier to use the clipboard and translator, if the literature is foreign and met incomprehensible words. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  At the moment, computers at home and at work are almost identical in characteristics, with the same keyboards and, not least, with the same two monitors, which are identical.  It helps to feel like at work when working remotely from home and vice versa (smiles). <br><br>  On the left there is a 4x3 monitor for reading ZR, working with a task manager, a browser, fixing the time spent on tasks and the like, and on the right 24x10 (portrait orientation) is strictly for encoding.  So it is much more convenient for me to control the entire workflow. <br><br>  Headphones monitor, gated.  They save when you need to come up with some complicated algorithm, drowning out external noise or doing routine work with music. <br><br>  Separately headset for negotiations with employees of branches and sometimes customers.  And also an IP phone. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  It all depends on the nature of the work.  If the work is routine, then PSY-Trance or heavy guitar music, if the work is creative, then classical music, blues or such directions as Dark Ambient, Drone Ambient.  If the work is very simple, then you can listen to music with a broken rhythm, in other cases the broken rhythm hinders me, although I like it. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Helps with music and the means to unload the memory.  My phone with the appropriate applications just saves me in this. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Delve into time management, learn how to use time more efficiently.  When you work in IT, you should always be aware of events, you need to pass through a huge amount of information, somehow digest it, emphasize the necessary.  And all this is not to the detriment of personal life, sleep, parenting, entertainment, creativity and other activities. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Do not try to cover more than possible.  Learn to prioritize tightly.  Learn to quickly let go of what has already outlived itself in your opinion, but by virtue of habit still remains with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322530/</a></p>
