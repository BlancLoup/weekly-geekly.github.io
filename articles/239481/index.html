    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the very beginning of HackDay <a href="http://hackday.ru/hackday-32/projects">, 21 ideas were announced</a> on the site and 4 more were submitted without an application on the site.  Only 15 teams were able to assemble teams and decide on development. One team gave up and, as a result, we saw 14 prototypes of projects at the demofest. <br><br>  So now about each: <br><br>  <b>"One click"</b> <br>  A team of a project manager, 3 developers, a PR manager and a designer introduced a mobile application platform that will help service companies and registries solve the problem of recording customers using the concept of ‚Äúone click, here and now‚Äù, i.e.  using the minimum elapsed time and anywhere.  At the demofesta solution was presented, which will help a person to book the nearest free car wash in 1 click, and the car wash will get the client painlessly. <br><br>  The project was awarded in the ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù nomination of the established <a href="http://www.iidf.ru/">IIDF</a> . <br><br>  <b>Machine Gun Day</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/f54/dfa/c1cf54dfa4bb4cafa8b9e0ab7988d363.jpg"><br>  A prototype of an arcade first-person shooter dedicated to the difficult everyday life of the Heavy.  The goal of the player is simple and noble - to protect the Motherland from the oncoming troops and equipment of the enemy.  However, the weapon reveals its crushing power only in capable and caring hands.  The player will not only have to shoot, but also constantly maintain the machine gun in working condition. <br>  Combining various input mechanics (tapas, swipes, accelerometer, microphone) and first-person view, the game allows you to fully get into the image of your virtual alter ego.  Android app <a href="http://bit.ly/gunzday">here</a> <br><br>  The project was awarded the nomination "Hack" <br><br>  <b>Cheerful remote</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb7/570/365/fb757036563c4d02bf723ddd45999aac.jpg"><br>  A fascinating story about the development of a prototype with technical details <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/238491/">here.</a> <br><br>  The project was awarded in the category "Tech".

Large IT forums and conferences are held in Samara and Tolyatti, in which more than 4 thousand people a year take part.  Nehilo, right?

If you want to receive prizes from HackDay and partners or to receive investments after the launch of the prototype - pay attention to the individual HackDay nominations. <br><br>  Action conditionally paid.  The cost is 400 rubles, but everyone can write a motivation letter in which it is necessary to explain why the organizers have to pay for the site and meals and how you can be useful to the participants. <br><br>  See you in Samara!
