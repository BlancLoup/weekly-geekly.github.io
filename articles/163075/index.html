  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC One X + - evolution in action</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The original One X, presented at the MWC exhibition almost a year ago, became the flagship device of the One series and earned a fair amount of positive feedback.  A lot of interesting solutions could be found in a thin and stylish case, and the device itself was made relatively compact, despite the impressive diagonal of 4.7 inches. <br><br>  To date, the lucky owners of One X certainly managed to please the update to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, but what can the direct heir of an interesting and outstanding model surprise us?  At first glance, the external differences can be counted on the fingers, but One X + is easy to recognize, barely taking in the palm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f6/b5d/ae7/5f6b5dae7f4c2ad1179f658bbe75f5d0.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Covering the rear wall has acquired a practical texture that is characteristic of all the new products of the company, and it will be very difficult to drop the device out of the hands.  Despite the fact that the smartphone is equipped with a 4.7-inch touch screen, made using Super LCD 2 technology, it is difficult to call it a ‚Äúshovel‚Äù: the edges of the device are beveled, and the frames on all sides of the screen have a minimum size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17a/de3/eb3/17ade3eb364903dd5608acf3a264351f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ca/b48/822/7cab488229dd2535842f3369e8a459c8.jpg"><br><br>  The display coating is scratch-resistant and has shown excellent results during daily operation of Corning Gorilla Glass 2, and the traditional IPS-matrix chosen for the HD-screen with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels will definitely please all connoisseurs of plausible and natural colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f2/02e/82e/4f202e82e3f1567c72fce970d020f753.jpg"><br><br>  Dimensions of the smartphone are 134.4 x 69.9 mm with a thickness of only 8.9 mm, and weighs One X + 135 grams.  The battery, as in its predecessor - non-removable, and its capacity has increased and is 2100 mAh.  We'll talk about autonomy a little later, but for now we will carefully examine the device from all sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea0/64c/2e5/ea064c2e5934bc4934493210ace1bd33.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the proprietary conversational speaker grid is a 1.6 megapixel front camera that records video in 720p resolution.  Favorite by many light indicator that signals incoming messages and missed notifications has not disappeared anywhere - it is just hidden in one of the speaker cells, and if necessary, you will definitely find it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a0/ef9/a57/7a0ef9a57df4a7d7fcb8446e96eb927f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15a/952/080/15a9520806bd28aaaae4a95a7c094c77.jpg"><br><br>  The controls traditionally consist of a power button on the upper end of the switch with a clear stroke and a clear response to pressing, a side volume rocker and standard touch buttons located below the screen.  The upgrade of the device was reflected in the color scheme used, so the button illumination is red, and complements its large logo of the Beats Audio sound enhancement algorithm and the main camera bezel, which stand out from the crowd. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f03/741/194/f037411949c9eb4b0055a3cc83967bd4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e4/e1c/5cb/1e4e1c5cb61fe701d8a35c7084470571.jpg"><br><br>  So what's inside?  The current nVidia Tegra 3 chipset with a maximum operating frequency increased to 1.7 GHz, 1 gigabyte of RAM and as much as 64 GB of internal memory.  In benchmarks, the device shows itself from the best side, and the experience of real use only confirms the remarkable computational capabilities of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfd/dfe/989/dfddfe989f437ac31f1006cfaaa5e1a6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e04/9c4/54b/e049c454bfadee34593f6ed467af771c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/686/0dd/ce2/6860ddce2e5cc16c91254c703b7fbecd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d53/e4c/f6b/d53e4cf6b8fff0ae6381ad06bd83f561.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/250/9f6/896/2509f6896447732be9e03b3df7d69fb7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10d/31b/2fe/10d31b2fe7dea6f416d304e234020470.png"><br><br>  One has to think that this volume is enough for everyone, and most importantly, this array is a single whole and is not divided into conditional 2 GB for applications and some gigabytes for user data, as is usually the case with many models equipped with built-in memory.  It remains only to decide what to store in this vast space.  However, in the creation of content it is possible to count on the potential of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/848/37b/9b2/84837b9b2d3e38640598d0c1c59710f9.jpg"><br><br>  Before you turn on the device, you must insert a microSIM card, using a stylish bundled clip, and the initial setup screen will appear to your look.  We think that the procedure will not come as a surprise, but NTS still saved one surprise.  The fact is that One X + can be configured remotely using a desktop computer and saving time to add email accounts and other accounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/806/fa9/31d/806fa931dd8839764fe9706b628517b5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a2/231/47c/3a223147c8ade951a0aa6e77ccc27491.png"><br><br>  Just go to <a href="http://start.htc.com/">start.htc.com</a> , select a phone model (currently only One X + is supported), and you can proceed.  At your service is the quick addition of Dropbox service, LIVE services and email to any existing domain, and the next step is personalization of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfb/9d8/161/bfb9d8161b234f3a1840b3bf66c20b52.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2b/8cb/e25/d2b8cbe25ef41be5087941d13fc68dba.png"><br><br>  Of course, all these operations can be done from the phone, but if possible, it is definitely more convenient.  The list is not limited to adding a wallpaper and choosing a lock screen, even a list of bookmarks and a layout of widgets on the home screens of your device are configured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18c/d48/a0d/18cd48a0d083e7cce74b95a7139e2c02.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b5/d12/eb5/0b5d12eb525f8714cba4abe54240d4fa.png"><br><br>  To transfer the work done to a smaller screen, you only need the HTC Sense service account (yes, it can still be useful!).  A useful addition, isn't it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc3/0dd/3f0/fc30dd3f01d65fc7f9c8a2b274646420.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/281/01a/9f4/28101a9f4b208ad8a92dd1a358e8340e.png"><br><br>  Making sure that the smartphone is on and working, let's allow ourselves to go over the distinctive features of the interface of the new model.  The device out of the box comes with Android OS 4.1.1.  Jelly Bean and proprietary interface Sense 4+, containing a number of improvements and improvements compared to numerous predecessors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/662/06d/b9566206df8a01d7b52a6d21f32b7200.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9e/cce/6b1/f9ecce6b1396f877aea41dd119fa6621.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbd/a25/8e9/dbda258e975c4cafc0f538a3ac9cf026.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d05/364/6c6/d053646c695db51c59d91fe2cf224f2a.png"><br><br>  First, there is the presence of useful and high-quality third-party applications.  The client of the branded Google Music streaming service, an excellent Google Chrome browser - all this is already included in the firmware and can be immediately tested.  There is even an analogue of TeamViewer QuickSupport - a program for organizing remote access to the LogMeIn Rescue device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9e/136/d6b/f9e136d6bad58b35db8d83bc728c63c5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c77/a06/3cf/c77a063cfe3b286c1aab130f73c8390c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69c/749/20c/69c74920c0ea5772ed31bb0a84862c2a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c58/067/b96/c58067b96d810517db2a8b3b6186d327.png"><br><br>  Nowhere are the NTS brand services familiar from previous models.  At your service are watches that have become a symbol of the brand, many other full-screen widgets, as well as a set of utilities designed to make life easier, and to save many users from the torment associated with finding "the very" perfect program to perform certain functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccb/942/900/ccb94290050d96bc2cdd107df8453c7f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05b/2e5/007/05b2e50077f216c1d7be638c7103aa8f.png"><br><br>  To begin with, the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù can be easily combined with your account in the popular Evernote service, it is not necessary to even install the client.  Weather, stocks, contact management, and the Media Gallery are all traditional for the NTS and implemented at the highest level and deserve all praise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a79/877/d86/a79877d863828c250368c91c4dc15b68.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce7/cea/0c4/ce7cea0c4ec5b3ac82828ad9eaff195d.png"><br><br>  Due to the fact that not all applications have switched to using the Menu button, the settings provide for the possibility of imposing an honorary duty to invoke contextual functions on the Recent Apps button, and when you press or press it for a long time, it depends only from you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ace/e71/11e/acee7111ef74bed6d6d24ee2e3950d2e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c3/e15/8be/0c3e158beaaa5e8b8042d634a17a0d49.png"><br><br>  The branded Sense shell, which, by analogy with the device, has received a ‚Äúplus‚Äù sign in the version number, boasts an updated screen of energy distribution between running applications, which allows you to quickly complete programs that are not needed at the moment.  In turn, in the main sections of the settings a configuration option Media Link HD appeared - a set-top box for the TV, which allows you to translate content literally with a flick of your fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd2/035/c23/cd2035c238ebfc283f54fcad195fb284.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/3e1/137/2ca3e11378a8e9645ec963cc0a0761a7.png"><br><br>  The device is equipped with NFC support, which allows you to quickly transmit various information just by touching your device to a compatible device.  As the relevant infrastructure develops, you can not limit yourself to watching the remaining trips on the subway, but pay for purchases from a mobile phone account and allow yourself many other actions in the name of saving time and increasing efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6f/761/83a/a6f76183a98a233e3f7cd1804a70b4b3.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to NFC, in the presence of various interfaces and sensors, befitting a smartphone of 2012 sample.  It is important that the Bluetooth protocol version 4.0 is equipped with support for aptX code, which allows to bring the quality of the sound transmitted wirelessly to a speaker system to a level comparable to a wired connection.  The standard microUSB connector is equipped with MHL support, so content can be transferred to a high-definition TV via a special cable.  If your choice is life without wires, then DLNA support for streaming images and video will help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38f/58a/324/38f58a32464d3770117ddc35e642a4c1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/135/519/d7c/135519d7cc3b8297a7d6eccb7581a505.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7db/7b8/bee/7db7b8bee61d4437b66f202772b1a7d7.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e8/4ac/5ad/7e84ac5ad7a234ab6829c39cc7522d8e.png"><br><br>  Connecting complete or any other headphones, do not forget to try out the Beats Audio enhancement technology in practice, and the standard music player for smartphones from the NTS should appeal to most users.  The collection is sorted according to standard criteria, and a couple of clicks are enough to update album covers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/007/b16/62f/007b1662fe20dedb43b90a6eaa1753c0.jpg"><br><br>  Along with the music files, an important part of the library is also made up of photos from the video, and here the NTS One X + camera will not disappoint.  The high-aperture sensor with a resolution of 8 megapixels, a f / 2.0 aperture, a focal length of 28 mm and a back-illuminated matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcomplemented by a processor for image processing HTC ImageChip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/857/bcf/703/857bcf7030eee8420440d668986f7ed8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b99/f32/80c/b99f3280c70a006d35d1a8eac80ec85b.png"><br><br>  As in other models of the One series, you can take pictures right in the process of creating a video.  Burst mode allows you to take up to 99 shots in one click and then select the best one by removing multiple duplicates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/979/27e/42a/97927e42a068e8e82ef980db372b034d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e5/376/88e/1e537688e31f221b457a7a181c1301dd.png"><br><br>  The camera is ready to work instantly, but it doesn‚Äôt take seconds to get a frame.  A ‚Äúsmart flash‚Äù will automatically select the impulse force needed to illuminate the object being photographed from the five gradations, and the image stabilizer will minimize the ‚Äújerkiness‚Äù when shooting with hands.  There is also a slow motion mode at 120 frames per second. <br><br>  With examples of photos you can find below. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90a/3db/4aa/90a3db4aa92e951a2d856032886e8677.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad3/3a2/0f3/ad33a20f36441ee688189a4b6aecea7f.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff5/dbc/042/ff5dbc0426a7924f178ffb51b48df12d.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e12/b29/5c3/e12b295c3c8ac29c2661b7f832b58c76.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5dc/ead/612/5dcead6125563a3ec52f7636bbecd62e.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aac/a97/86d/aaca9786d7d278042e8623a06bd2edc6.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71e/c94/315/71ec94315ae456d1bc6a8b87b8ed7035.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b79/5f8/6a4/b795f86a45b6d3280290a6d948aff5c2.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd6/02a/3b6/bd602a3b6f3ee26f3e0a7b2023ab7561.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74e/2b8/e36/74e2b8e3613a800959f9b8009055905c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50c/f3e/e1c/50cf3ee1c447a36bf8f1ce9c872ff78a.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/495/a55/fe7/495a55fe7ceaa9d93a222eb0bea1a41f.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68e/70a/4db/68e70a4db8954d2f628855e40b591340.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b82/581/ffc/b82581ffc535421840acbba4a311aea3.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f7/adf/dc7/0f7adfdc77d720839416eb659bfa6168.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c6/e49/aa7/5c6e49aa705d3db5f37da8cf32fcef0c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  To assess the performance of the HDR mode, we offer you a couple of comparative images. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c2/c36/481/9c2c36481abaa63d0e483b1dc7fe0d4d.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98d/e22/f8a/98de22f8a4a0fb4a613e536f00ce5686.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In addition, we did not miss the chance to remove a small panorama of the surroundings. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd4/385/9a2/bd43859a2ee5b6bcb0e842b03def7274.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A sample video in 1080p available on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Da_4iwVSEpQo">link</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/060/8d3/7fa/0608d37fa8a914e57a16557e8f7e866c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18a/834/8a8/18a8348a878269b7d75fddab8cd823c2.png"><br><br>  The camera interface is designed in the style of the One series, but even here there are certain improvements compared with previous models.  The main shooting scenarios are grouped into a separate pop-up menu, and panorama, group portrait, and HDR modes are available in one click.  The built-in and flexibly customized effects did not disappear anywhere, and the shutter button became larger than the video mode activation, because we still take pictures on the phone more often than we record videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/989/c79/3a0/989c793a062a05e45d7ffed6fbf6e3e4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/251/c65/833/251c658339731f5e9f45ded7786eebea.png"><br><br>  When you go to the panoramic shooting, a virtual horizon will appear on the screen, and the correct ‚Äúgluing‚Äù of the image components is guaranteed by a convenient indication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b0/19c/57a/0b019c57a2b7cf009293d40481cacb39.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a58/b74/783/a58b74783baf51d13b3f6e7fa92e6f8d.png"><br><br>  Captured images and recorded video, as expected, can be viewed in the Gallery, but do not rush to go to the local storage.  On the start screen of the application, you will be greeted by large icons of network services, so that after entering the appropriate credentials, a single application will become a real guide to the world of content scattered across different ‚Äúclouds‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/874/ab7/d5e/874ab7d5ee381ef877eb97b45f6b455c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3a/151/c9e/c3a151c9eaacef3475b4a6b0bada7683.png"><br><br>  The generation of thumbnails is very fast, thanks to the powerful hardware, but the built-in player cannot yet boast of ‚Äúomnivorousness‚Äù.  As before, to play files in the MKV container, you need a third-party player, but the native video player without any problems played videos in MPEG4 (MP4, M4V) format with resolutions up to 1920x1080 pixels inclusive, not to mention standard DVD-quality files in AVI and WMV formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63c/cd7/113/63ccd7113c91a511b621e7d85151f4b4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de7/c00/f28/de7c00f28a09ca8860f6477453af320c.png"><br><br>  The keyboard for entering text has become more convenient, and if you wish, you can activate text input with a stroke in the settings, becoming more and more popular and traveling from one third-party solution to another.  In this case, you do not need to install anything, all the necessary functionality is present initially, the only question is in the formation of your personal dictionary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/758/6f7/62f/7586f762f29e68dccd8c4cb990297501.jpg"><br><br>  Traditionally, the NTS has a large selection of personalization tools, not limited to proprietary widgets and wallpapers.  Available themes and whole images suitable for various scenarios of using the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a9/c37/0e2/0a9c370e22640ba37f46520084ea1093.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea9/4a1/294/ea94a12943e28de4e0f0eb4a33918a6a.png"><br><br>  It would be a sin not to use such a powerful device as a navigator, but the special mode ‚ÄúIn the car‚Äù will help to increase safety and comfort.  When activated, the display will display the main information about the time and weather, and in the corners will accommodate large labels of the desired programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/714/fd5/492/714fd54929cdb915d569ec5cad2a1c81.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/986/733/3ee/9867333ee921d54bf7ee7ca1e4a93509.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b53/52b/992/b5352b992b31423930d7d058a1a8ff36.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33a/63f/6ac/33a63f6ac966e3e5515beeb5cf75e426.png"><br><br>  It is important that both the dialer and the music player are fundamentally reworked, which is important when connecting the phone to car speakers.  However, when driving, you should not ignore a headset or a hands-free system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f1/29e/2a6/0f129e2a6197ba8ca728ec7fc52ba982.jpg"><br><br>  When a free minute is issued (or the cork seems to be especially impenetrable), the whole range of exclusive games presented for the Tegra chipset is at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1d/9ff/c2c/b1d9ffc2c05023ee82ed1f8f946543ff.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cba/d5e/25a/cbad5e25a4b6036318b1aeee70d66a52.png"><br><br>  The Tegra Zone application will help you make your choice, and the level of graphic performance and the fascination of mobile entertainment will definitely not disappoint.  As an example, we can take screenshots from the Horn and Dark Meadow: The Pact games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/4ad/f8a/0bc4adf8a89570abb81d8090093c9e30.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b51/529/5d0/b515295d0fec2e2172448c53e2fcc9b4.png"><br><br>  And now about the painful - battery life.  Due to the increased battery capacity, you can safely count on the functioning of the phone during the day with automatic brightness control and background synchronization of several accounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd8/2d3/7c3/dd82d37c3ecb9a121bd07b8fae4dc61a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7d/53f/d8c/b7d53fd8c749fccfd1299fdfb1ce49d7.png"><br><br>  To prolong life at a difficult time will help activate the power saving mode, reducing the brightness of the screen and turning off the data transfer in the background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b3/47a/7cc/5b347a7cca8dda317750fffd760f2a46.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96f/bd9/c34/96fbd9c34526798d8ae601ab7a9867a5.png"><br><br>  The increased frequency of the CPU does not greatly affect the performance, because most of the time the device operates at a modest 500-700 MHz.  Heavy games can land a battery quickly enough, but spending hours behind them is unlikely to succeed, because the pace of modern life does not tolerate idleness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fe/9f4/ca1/4fe9f4ca1506d900eccbb07fcd3c8f8b.jpg"><br><br>  Let's sum up.  Smartphone HTC One X + deserves the title of "flagship, and its characteristics should be to the liking of all lovers of high-quality technology.  The device works smartly and without the slightest ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù, and the interface did not restart even after the launch of demanding applications.  The phone is always ready to make calls and perform the basic functions expected from the means of communication, but it is also able to entertain you and help you in your work.  If you are looking for a powerful stuffing, dressed in a really beautiful body - pay attention to the One X +, it is worth it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163075/</a></p>
