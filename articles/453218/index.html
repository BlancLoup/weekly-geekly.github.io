    <h3>  UAVs </h3><br>  In 2019, hundreds of autonomous cars with NVIDIA equipment in the trunk will appear on the roads of Russia (Moscow, Kazan), USA (Nevada, California) and Israel.  They will not be engaged in anything special cars - only to collect data on the trips in various conditions.  Behind the wheel while driving will always sit the driver, ready to take control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/wk/wg/-mwkwg4h1lhsedquzcjkagazsn8.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, by the beginning of the project everything is ready, only in Russia it remains to settle some legal subtleties.  According to Volozh, the company is negotiating with the traffic police.  As for Moscow specifically, for the time being, Yandex is not sure whether the whole city will be provided for the tests or separate areas of the city will be allocated for this. <br><br><h3>  Yandex.Auto </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/yc/er/ueycersls9mr5fr9fxk1dk2-6d4.jpeg"><br><br>  The conference also presented a new version of the head unit for cars.  Now it can be used not only to control the multimedia system of the machine, but also other systems.  For example, you can ask the built-in Auto Alice to open or close windows, unlock the lock using a smartphone, start the engine remotely, etc.  When the car is evacuated, the head system will send a notification via SMS, if necessary, will automatically pay for parking and refueling, and in the future will be able to pay for the toll on the toll road itself.  If a car model is equipped with sensors in tires, then according to the speed of rotation of the wheels and their direction, the Yandex navigator will be able to determine the position of the car even where there is no GPS signal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4k/lc/sq/4klcsqhm79qad8gti6o5jwoaffy.jpeg"><br><br>  Some functions will be available in the first version of the Auto after the software update, but it may require reconnection for more tight interaction with the car via the CAN bus.  The second hardware version of Auto will be on sale in the fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z8/fa/qi/z8faqi_h2cylhafh6d5zemjikm4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Food, Chef and Cloud Restaurants </h3><br>  Gastronomic entities owned by Yandex, it became more, and separate them from each other - more difficult.  The network of ‚Äúcloudy restaurants‚Äù will unite the Food and Chef services - this will be something in between a meal from the usual ‚Äúoffline‚Äù restaurants and self-cooking sets.  With the only difference that the menu will be built on the basis of data on the preferences of Russians in food, and the dishes themselves will be prepared by the chefs from partner restaurants.  According to Yandex, the production capacity of restaurants is often idle, and the ‚Äúcloud restaurant‚Äù will allow them to be used as efficiently as possible and to extract profits from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/wp/-l/x7wp-lsijai1g-0nldahqnthopg.jpeg"><br><br>  The most popular in Russia were borscht, cutlets, cheesecakes, and Caesar salad.  However, in addition to this, you can order burgers, rolls, pizza, etc. The price for any of the dishes will be no higher than 250 ‚ÇΩ.  Service will start this summer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/-j/ke/lu-jkewhdum3j1cjl_kxbf1srdq.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Ether and Module </h3><br>  According to Yandex‚Äôs calculations, before watching a video on the Internet, a person spends 9‚Äì18 minutes to choose from.  According to the developers, this problem will be solved by the <a href="https://yandex.ru/efir">Ether</a> service, which analyzes human behavior on the Internet: visited pages, likes in streaming services, search queries, etc. Ether compiles a program a couple of days in advance, as well as selections of films and broadcasts.  If in Yandex you enter the query ‚Äúwhat to see‚Äù, the search will display a catalog of movies and TV shows with classic ratings.  But if you evaluate at least one of the suggested things, now, in addition to the rating on the cover of the film, there will appear a probability that you will like it - as a percentage. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1urwhw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>Yandex is starting to give out the likelihood that you will like the movie or series based on the first assessment.</i></font></sub> <br><br>  In Yandex, it is believed that the most convenient way is to watch videos on a TV screen.  And although there are already many ‚Äúsmart‚Äù ones among them, the strength to support proprietary applications for various operating systems goes too much.  Therefore, YaC showed a radical solution to the problem - Yandex.Module, which connects to almost any TV via HDMI.  In fact, this is a small computer that can exchange data with Alice (wherever it is installed), and to which you can stream video over Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-5/lc/p6/-5lcp6o99p1nbmzw8pr_xr74xpa.jpeg"><br><br>  The module can be compared to Google Chromecast, but the Yandex gadget is larger, heavier, made of metal and equipped with an external antenna.  It does not look so elegant, but theoretically it can better receive the signal from the source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/cv/rt/uocvrt59dfnjcty9kyrc_pdwi60.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Smart House </h3><br>  The module is part of the smart home ecosystem, which Yandex now plans to actively develop.  To this end, the company has already entered into contracts with manufacturers of devices for smart home.  At Yandex, we are sure that a truly smart home becomes when additional devices are not needed for control - only a voice.  Therefore, in the near future on all sorts of sensors, relays and other smart sockets you can expect the label ‚ÄúWorks with Alice‚Äù.  In addition to partner devices, Yandex also offers its own devices: a smart light bulb, a power outlet and an IR remote control - all made in Germany. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/y7/fb/puy7fbw4zse9_thaa4bqaj2c6ru.jpeg"><br><br>  To complete the work of a smart home, you need to have in it the device on which Alice works.  But it doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly the Station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/ga/_v/rqga_vwnwzsl0mr-xdjaiczx2lm.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453218/</a></p>
