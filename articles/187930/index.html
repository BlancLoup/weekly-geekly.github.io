And this is not surprising, because it was our main ringtone for almost 20 years, becoming one of the most reproducible melodies in the whole world.  More recently, she underwent a slight rethinking, and in honor of this, we decided to dedicate our little Friday note to her.

Before the creation of the first commercial mobile phone, 81 years remained, and Nokia only mastered a new industry for itself - power generation.  This year Francisco Tarrega, one of the greatest guitarists and guitar composers of the late XIX - early XX century, the author of several dozen works for six-stringed guitar, creates his composition Grande Valse, which originally sounded like this: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3huwi5gxixE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhhPIY6siSlriHGKiHt3Hl2IDUcGLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To be honest, this melody was not popular in the works of the Spanish composer, and so it would probably remain in the annals of world music history, however, by chance, in 1993 it was used as a sound track to one of the advertisements where we and heard.  After that, Anssi Vanjoki (at that time, the executive vice-president of Nokia), gave Grande Valse to his colleague Lauri Kivinenui and together they chose an excerpt of the work for which the rights were acquired and which was later named Nokia Tune.  The excerpt included bars from the 13th to the 16th. <br><br>  A year later, the legendary melody first appeared in the Nokia 2110 series of phones and originally wore the name of a piece of music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/107/5cb/efc/1075cbefc43e06515e3d53d82d644083.jpg"><br>  <i>Nokia 2110 Phone Family</i> <br><br>  Having started to pre-install Nokia Tune on all devices, we made this tune one of the most popular in the world.  This ringtone people listened to about two billion times a day!  Kanye Westu, Jay Z and Lady Gaga have more to strive for. <br><br>  Since then, along with the development of mobile devices (especially their audio component), the Nokia Tune has been updated eight times.  Not so long ago, our audio and visual design team finally completed the latest update to date, presenting the latest version of Nokia Tune, as well as adding new soundtracks for the alarm clock, email, calendar, messages and launch. <br><br> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nokia-design-team/nokia-tune-2013"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d1/7c0/fb4/5d17c0fb49a1e9a33caf581081e568e9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the work on updated melodies, our audio designers did not seek to achieve any radical revolutionary changes, but rather followed an evolutionary path.  The team began work literally with listening.  Experts listened to old melodies dozens of times and thought about how to correctly introduce new elements into them.  Consultations were held both with customers and with sound experts.  Finally, they managed to create four versions of Nokia Tune, one of which was chosen as the official version. <br><br> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nokia-design-team"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f3/9f8/8e3/5f39f88e3542eff2c3f8cde7238cd0d9.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Download sound</i> <br><br>  During the years of its existence, Nokia Tune was performed on various musical instruments, for example, on a guitar or a piano.  In the past, the melody was calmer and more relaxed, but now we are opting for a more confident sound.  Although this change is barely perceptible.  In this new ringtone, we hear percussion, bells, and elements of artificial sound. <br><br>  Creating this melody we tried to please everyone.  And our main point was regional and cultural differences.  In Asia, for example, people usually love a louder sound.  But in Western countries, this sound may seem annoying.  A huge number of people never change their ringtone, so Nokia Tune was created just for such people.  Those who want to emphasize their individuality, in any case, change the ringtone on your phone. <br><br> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nokia-design-team/nokia-clock-2013"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e37/836/4e3/e378364e3a0e41d3b7f14b5e829564d1.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Alarm sound</i> <br><br>  Branded melodies are already automatically installed on new Nokia devices, however anyone who wants to install new melodies as main sounds can download the official SoundClaud from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nokia-design-team">Nokia Design</a> . <br><br><h4>  P.S: </h4><br><br>  <b>Nokia Tune performed by a small orchestra</b> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaIQiJSluYo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2dj02C7wT2mldYqZo78mHvYHkgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Nokia Tune on accordion</b> <br> <a href="http://youtu.be/5w5vVSRjzFU"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b1/d6f/b35/1b1d6fb355a38e11a73042d99691e3e4.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187930/</a></p>
