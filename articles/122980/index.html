  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO: invest a couple of hours in customer retention</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost all SEO companies, companies engaged in contextual advertising, display advertising and other similar services to attract traffic to the site, there is one big problem.  This problem - customers who are dissatisfied even when all the obligations under the contract are fulfilled by 5+.  Managers have to essentially re-sell the service every month, and each time it‚Äôs more difficult.  The most annoying thing is that you cannot argue with the arguments of the customer - there are no orders from the site.  We will talk about solving this problem. <br><br><h3>  First, let's look at the reasons <br>  (we look from the point of view of the head of the SEO company) </h3><br><br>  <b>Problem in the work of the optimizer-advertiser (production does not pull)?</b>  On the contrary, he will provide reports on pages of pages confirming that he did everything remarkably (and where in seo differently?).  Site positions in the search for simply transcendental.  Announcements on the minimum rates on the positions of special placement.  Even targeted traffic to the site is abundant and stable (although under the contract you only account for positions, and you can score on the amount and quality of traffic).

      <b>Is there a problem with client managers who process applications and work with customers?</b>  I really want to appeal to this, but this is not the same!  In order to work with buyers, orders, letters and calls that are not available from these very buyers are needed.  And let the customer, a discreet person, but he has already openly stated that your services cost him more than the site brings money.  And in general, he is no longer thinking about changing the agency, but about completely refusing to advertise on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>The problem with your management, who works with the customer?</b>  Again not true.  Give them a bonus, since in this state of affairs they manage to keep it on the subscriber for a month.  Once they are hit by SEOs, so that not only the site is well searched, but the traffic is targeted. <br><br>  So what is it?  In fact, it is possible to identify the causes of zero (or close to that) conversion in a couple of hours.  Once no one is to blame, take another look at the site from which everyone is waiting for orders (in a clever way this is called an audit site, more precisely, an express audit). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Have you looked?  Usually in this place you can be scared. </h3><br><br>  It's amazing how much advertising budgets are spent on promoting frankly bad sites.  But even if at first glance everything is good, one should pay attention to the following points: <br><br>  1. Is the traffic correctly distributed among the pages?  Do people come to the right pages?  Do the users on the page find what they were looking for, or do they need to scour the entire site?  Many times I saw how all the traffic goes to the hidden articles hidden deep in the site, or, alternatively, to the main page.  Minus one. <br><br>  2. Is it obvious what is being sold on each of the pages of the site, what does the company generally offer, what actions are expected from the user?  If in 5 seconds the user does not understand what's what, he will most likely leave.  Minus two. <br><br>  3. What is the overall impression of the site?  Oddly enough, many serious corporate sites look like warez-portals or medium-sized psychics sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3b9c2e6e/24e6de2c/6b8efab1/21cb9b06.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the freelance student, the aesthetic predilections of the director or, as in this case, the design template, which saved your customer a budget for a couple of months of promotion (at best!) Due to the cost of development.  But at least three months, the money for promotion after that was simply thrown away (awesome savings!).  Rarely does this problem come up earlier than the third month when the client starts to sound the alarm.  For some reason, SEOs are absolutely insensitive to the appearance of the sites being promoted and their content (I can even guess why).  A project manager is more concerned with the implementation of the contract.  In short, minus three. <br><br>  Of course it's a shame, but the medicine will be only one thing - to redo the site again.  Entirely or partially - depends on the neglect of each particular case. <br><br>  4. Is the company contact information easily accessible?  Sometimes you have to search through the site to find how to contact.  At a minimum, the telephone and feedback form should be visible at first glance (on the header, for example).  Otherwise - minus four. <br><br>  5. Transparency of site navigation.  Check whether it is easy to find on the site information about a product or service that is interesting to visitors.  One day, a client came to us for promotion, who (judging by site statistics) tried to find something long and hard in the catalog with a dozen levels of nesting and a half of empty pages.  Completely desperate, visitors went to the search pages and site maps (ha ha, links on the header, in the most prominent place).  So, the site map duplicated the main menu of five points.  And the search did not work.  Definitely - minus five. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cbe19c84/c24d512c/e5b3a583/49a066b8.jpg"><br><br>  6. We read the texts.  If there is a text on the site that will suit any company in this industry (and sometimes texts are such that any company will do), or a seo-footwoman, or a copywriter did not understand who he is writing for - there will be no sales.  Therefore, alas, the texts will have to be rewritten to interesting, selling, understandable and necessary for the potential buyer.  And let the optimizer get out as best he can, because the positions in the search for a site with bad texts will not give anything.  It will be minus six. <br><br>  7. The quality of the presentation of services and products on the site, including photos, readability of tables, etc.  No matter how trite, a good photo itself can sell a product.  Even without text.  Further I will not consider cons, and so it is clear.  OK? <br><br>  8. Is the order button clearly visible on the product and service page?  Easily accessible clear price information, or pricing principles?  There are a lot of sites in runet where there are product catalogs, but there are no prices in these catalogs.  Their owners apparently expect that the buyer will call or write to find out the price.  Only here 90% of buyers do it too lazy.  I - definitely. <br><br>  9. If the site has a basket, order forms, etc.  - check.  Fakapy can be upsetting funny.  And in general, the refusal of a client at the stage of an order is the most useless throwing out of the budget for his attraction.  Therefore, here we analyze everything in as much detail as possible.  Here is a small example from my practice, an analysis of the procedure for ordering an online store and the proposed solutions: <br><br>  *** <br><br><h5>  Audit online women's clothing store </h5><br><br>  The site for the order entered a mandatory registration.  This discourages most buyers.  We recommended implementing ‚Äúeasy registration‚Äù - when the user is automatically registered when placing the first order. <br><br>  In the basket there is no product photo.  If the buyer is not satisfied with the final amount, and he wants to remove something from the order, he will have to re-open all pages with the goods and choose.  As a result, most likely the order will not be made.  recommended - add product photo to cart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/21b266bd/9f4de3fa/98a7e053/114e12db.jpg"><br><br>  After registration and its confirmation there is no automatic authorization on the site.  The system asks to log in, and for this you need to go to another page!  It is likely to leave the user.  It is recommended to implement ‚Äúeasy registration‚Äù, eliminating all unnecessary steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c66ea49/ae1e9f0b/4b56dc55/c1e2f6c4.jpg"><br><br>  After the user login, he tosses to the main page of the site, and not to where he placed the order.  On the main link to the basket is very carefully hidden.  The probability of leaving the user 99%.  Recommendation - after login to leave the user on the same page where he was.  Additionally - raise the block with the basket in the header, so that users do not have to search around the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f88fa712/5b07efaa/7e0d9f84/27328014.jpg"><br><br>  When placing an order, the store prompts the registered user to re-fill in the contact details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6926f50c/7079bc4d/47261571/40d65c26.jpg"><br><br>  The question is, what was the registration?  The recommendation is to take all the data necessary for the order from the user profile, as they were entered during registration.  When a simple registration will be implemented on the site - ask to fill in these data when you first order, at the same time registering the user in the store.  In the future - to take from the profile. <br><br>  Incorrectly processed errors when filling out the form - the system allows you to send the form before checking the fields.  In case one of the fields is filled in incorrectly, the page is overloaded, and the error field is highlighted.  In this case, all the data in the form disappear, it is necessary to fill again.  There are also no tips on the format of data entry (for example, I, for example, did not manage to guess the format of phone input the first time).  Solution: check the fields immediately upon filling.  Say what is the error, without reloading the page.  Save data already entered by the user in the form. <br><br>  As a result, the process of placing an order on the website has been reduced from 7 steps to two: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1716de0e/14b71532/efc17e67/0310470d.jpg"><br><br>  Changes finally allowed to move the sales off the site from a dead center.  It was timely - if we advertised the site "as is", then in 2-3-4 months the client would fall down, and in general would be right. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  This analysis takes about four hours, no more.  General moments can even throw in an hour.  But if you do it, and then (most importantly) insist on the implementation of recommendations and monitor this process, we will get a site where the orders will come from.  And the client will be pleased with your work in advertising and promoting his site.  True, it is not a fact that he will appreciate the audit work, but it cost you not a lot. <br><br>  If you are a good salesman, and you are too lazy to make a site audit, then sell it as a separate service.  If it's easier for you to do than to sell, invest <nobr>2-3</nobr> hours in keeping the client.  Do an express audit for free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122980/</a></p>
