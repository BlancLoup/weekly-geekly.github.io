That's right - to make a presentation on 100,500 slides, book a meeting or a conference room, throw an invitation to the post office, and wait for everyone who is remotely interested to come and make an effort to sort out the question themselves.  It is not hard to guess that the chance of success of such an event is 0.00%. <br><br>  But <b>Yevgeny Golev</b> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/cheaffa/" class="user_link">cheaffa</a> ) knows why, and how you really need to approach the transfer of knowledge within the company to achieve results.  And <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/">she</a> told us at <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/">TeamLead Conf</a> , and now she will share with you many years of experience in adult education. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j0/13/88/j01388ueynnggegdaryzctmskjy.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>About the speaker:</strong> Yevgeniya Goleva has been engaged in adult education for 10 years, and recently she has combined this with the work of the maiden at Tech.Lamoda.

The site itself is only 10% of the development, there is still an automated warehouse the size of a football field (imagine 5 more floors up), own delivery service in 600 cities, 3 call centers.  World fashion brands buy logistics services from Lamoda in Russia and the CIS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/nt/jo/plntjo0z8h5k2n7w9ajsc5h9mbw.png"><br><br>  300 IT specialists develop and maintain more than 100 internal services that are used by all 5,000 employees.  <strong>Knowledge sharing is happening all the time</strong> .  Most users are internal employees.  Sometimes it happens that you need to teach team leaders not only users, but also neighboring teams, new employees in their teams, and everyone else, if new technologies appear.  At times, it would be good to teach the customers, because they demand the impossible. <br><br>  Using the example of several case studies from Lamoda‚Äôs everyday life, I‚Äôll illustrate the basic principles of adult education that you can apply in your work. <br><br>  I will use the following terminology: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>I'am a teacher.</strong>  In a situation when I myself teach people, or I am a customer. </li><li>  <strong>They, the target audience - the group.</strong> </li></ul><br><h2>  Case "ERP Developer Training" <br></h2><br>  A request for training usually looks like this: <br><br>  <em>- There are restrictions: approximately as much time, 2-3 presentations, 2 articles and some number of people who agree to spend an hour.</em>  <em>I prepared a presentation, how to make it better, how many people and what time to call for training?</em> <br><br>  With this approach, the efficiency of the event will tend to zero, and here's why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3i/f7/65/3if765uwlga3xtmke6ssgo-_zl4.png"><br><br>  We have ERP - financial accounting system, which consists of two parts: <br><br><ol><li>  Axapta, because we are an international company. <br></li><li>  1C, because we pay salaries in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus. <br></li></ol><br>  ERP interacts with all other systems.  In addition, there are a lot of internal ERP users. <br><br>  When the guys from ERP come to me with a proposal to tell all our developers (300 people!) How these systems work, I pull out my schema card from the store (on the left is the teacher - I, on the right - CA). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/xt/xj/-axtxjzpul0ogxphelfcf5q0b6k.png"><br><br>  I start asking questions - let's go over them all. <br><br><h3>  My problems <br></h3><br>  <em>- No one understands how our systems work.</em>  <em>Ok, maybe they don‚Äôt have to?</em>  <em>What is the problem?</em>  <em>What is burning?</em>  <em>Where does it hurt?</em> <br><br>  After a few iterations, it turns out: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Teams forget important.</strong>  They take into account the processes of Lamoda, forgetting about partner processes that may occur at any time. </li><li>  <strong>Helpdesk asks a lot of questions to the wrong address</strong> - not to those developers, distracting them from current work, and this is not very good. </li></ul><br>  It would seem that there was one problem - it became two.  But at the same time they became more specific and it is easier for us to understand further what to do with them. <br><br><h2>  My result </h2><br>  Then we think about the result we want to get: <br><br>  <em>- If the teams take into account A (do something specific), and the Helpdesk will ask questions at the address and use the documentation, will this solve the problem?</em>  <em>It seems not to the end, because</em>  <em>it would still be nice if they took into account B and B.</em> <br><br>  Add: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Teams consider A, B and C.</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Helpdesk asks questions at and uses the documentation.</strong> </li></ul><br>  We consider the result immediately, when we are only talking about the problem, because this is the purpose of our training: <br><br><ol><li>  Check if this solves the problem?  Sometimes it happens that training, for which we did not think over the result in advance, does not solve the problem, but is simply a waste of time. <br></li><li>  The result focuses on what needs to be put into people's heads. <br></li></ol><br><h3>  Lecture hall <br></h3><br>  Who usually makes decisions in a team, where is it important to consider A, B and C?  Most often this is not the whole team, but only a technical.  Therefore, if it is enough to talk about techlids about A, B, C, then this reduces the target audience - you need to learn only the techlids and the Helpdesk. <br><br><h3>  CA problems <br></h3><br>  Then we ask the question, what are the problems of Central Asia? <br><br>  The problems are pretty obvious: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Overloading the techlides with information</strong> ‚Äî many systems, indeed, pass through them. </li><li>  <strong>Helpdesk has a job, SLA is not maintained</strong> .  Moreover, an emergency situation often occurs when an incident occurs, and support cannot find the right developer and suffers. </li></ul><br>  Here, when we look for problems in Central Asia, we find motivation - those strings, for which we will continue to pull and try to help people.  In this case, we see that the techlids have a rather negative motivation.  To occupy them with a two-hour lecture about complex systems will be cruel.  Helpdesk has a high motivation, because it really solves their problems and helps in their work. <br><br><h2>  CA Level </h2><br>  Then we have to look at the level of these people (we have two Central Asia). <br><br><h4>  A bit of theory.  Conscious competence <br></h4><br>  The scheme of conscious competence below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f2/tu/1a/f2tu1as8drk8s1awfd-a6soi31k.png"><br><ol><li>  <strong>They do not know that they do not know.</strong>  Imagine a child of 4 years old who first saw a red car with a man behind the wheel.  He thinks: ‚ÄúWow, how great!  I also want to turn the steering wheel - the machine is driving from the steering wheel! ‚Äù. </li><li>  <strong>They know they do not know.</strong>  At 10 years old, the child already guesses that the machine is not going from the steering wheel, but there are mechanisms that somehow add up to each other, and he will have to study it. </li><li>  <strong>Know they know.</strong>  At the age of 18, a person goes to study at a driving school, and there he is told about the rules of the road, how to release the clutch pedal so as not to stall on the slide.  He learns to look in the mirrors and taxi to the right lane, turning on the turn signal.  He suffers, but he learns.  He has a long checklist to do. </li><li>  <strong>Do not know what they know.</strong>  After many years, he already drives, as he breathes: he shaves with one hand, the other pulls out something from his pocket, which he steers - God only knows.  And while he somehow still manages to fit into complex turns. </li></ol><br>  This is he already in the fourth square, but since the last time he looked in the traffic regulations, they have changed, and according to the competence of the traffic regulations he is in the first quadrant. <br><br>  This concept is not about the level of a person as a whole, but about individual knowledge (competencies).  A person may, according to different competencies, be in different zones at the same time, just like our driver. <br><br>  If we talk about learning, then most often we mean zone 3, which begins with knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/py/aa/ozpyaa6-cc2sbt-of-h2yvlohhy.png"><br><br>  The knowledge is partially in zone 2: we have some horizons, but we did not dig deep.  Knowledge accumulates and during practice flow into skills - these are technologies: do it once, do two, do three ‚Äî checklists from repetition become skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3m/kg/o2/3mkgo2e6wkygr206uapflpced7c.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The transition <strong>from the first zone to the second</strong> occurs with children in case of interest (eyes wide open, red typewriter).  But adults, unfortunately, are already more callous, they can be hooked on to problems.  It is better if there is interest, but more reliably through problems. </li><li>  <strong>From the second zone to the third</strong> person passes, when he already has fragmentary knowledge from different areas.  It takes a lot of energy to choose which one to spend your time on right now, make a decision and start to study it. </li></ul><br>  Many of us paid in advance for English courses (or any other courses), and then did not go.  The reasons: the decision was not fully made, the choice was not fully made, too little effort was made to realize that this was necessary, and I will do it. <br><br>  I dwell on it in such detail, because more often they begin to learn like this: ‚ÄúLook - technology: one, two, three!‚Äù already crammed.  Most likely, the person will just fall off in the middle of the road. <br><br><ul><li>  The transition <strong>from the third zone to the fourth</strong> occurs through repetition and process.  Sometimes we taught people, gave them some kind of technology, but it is not applicable in their real life, their process is different.  It is important to remember that when you give a technology, you must check that it fits - it does not interfere and helps. </li></ul><br>  Conscious competence is the third zone.  All other zones are unconscious and incompetent. <br><br>  We return to the case with ERP systems, where we wanted to conduct Knowledge Sharing for 300 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/tp/h4/jgtph4gmzuxm6l0ucyjtbluwrg4.png"><br><br>  Helpdesk on the diagram is in the third zone on the border with the second.  They would be the second if we showed them the system for the first time and told them to start supporting it.  But they are already working with her, doing something and they know - that is, they are in the third zone. <br><br>  The techlids are in the fourth zone - they know for sure that A, B and C should be taken into account, and it‚Äôs probably not worth telling them about it again for two hours. <br><br>  <b>How do we solve this problem?</b> <br><br>  Helpdesk was trained separately in two meetings: <br><br><ol><li>  Simple lecture, answers to questions, 2 weeks of work. <br></li><li>  After 2 weeks, the lecture is more complicated, the answers to the questions that have appeared. <br></li></ol><br>  Thus, all was relevant to what is happening.  They were keenly interested. <br><br>  The Techlids were not invited to a lecture, but they asked: <br><br>  <em>- How do you do it?</em> <br><br>  <em>- We have such a workflow.</em> <br><br>  <em>- Well, let's put in this workflow here, here and here checklist, and you will take these A, B, C into account.</em> <br><br>  The guys were happy - they finally helped them to do their work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gw/r8/vi/gwr8vipgxowbhfyf2mdzevffxyw.png"><br><br>  The items ‚ÄúMy task‚Äù and ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù remain.  The task in the first case was to teach, and in the second - to help organize the process.  The dry residue was completely different.  In further cases, you will see how our task and the dry rest of the audience change from the level of target audience. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusions from the ERP Developer Training case:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Different levels of Central Asia are different approaches.  People need to work in different ways. <br></li><li>  Do not always need to learn. <br></li></ol><br>  But if not to learn, then what? <br><br>  Let's see: we have my problems, Central Asia problems, my result, Central Asia level, and then my task.  How does it change? <br><br><h2>  Newbies <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u2/fb/cd/u2fbcdwl3jpwa3yt486hkawwdfq.png"><br><br>  In the first zone are often beginners.  They come without knowing anything about the company.  At this moment it is difficult for them to explain how everything works with us, it‚Äôs better to give at least some kind of card.  Here we do not teach, but solve two problems: <br><br><ol><li>  the simplest is not to demotivate, <strong>not to scare</strong> ; </li><li>  <strong>interest</strong> - it's about those most burning eyes. </li></ol><br>  Thus, our task is to inspire rather than teach.  Glowing eyes will not appear by themselves, someone must ignite them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/48/ih/pj48ihzoeeogiwysghkmb-_o_yw.png"><br><br><h2>  Case "Hiring Testers" <br></h2><br><br>  A QA manager comes to me and asks for help in understanding the situation where recruiters select resumes for unsuitable candidates.  We look deeper - they "float" in the databases. <br><br>  Once in the industry, it is customary to think that in any incomprehensible situation it is easiest to change recruiters.  But we have a great team, it just needs to pump expertise in this area.  In general, it is useful to teach recruiters - how do they otherwise find out what we need? <br><br>  Recruiters are in zone 2 of our scheme, that is, "they know they do not know" - they have heard something about something, but they do not really understand. <br><br>  What would you like to get from their training?  Naturally, we do not expect that they suddenly begin to understand the bases.  It would be nice to have HR: <br><br><ul><li>  understood what the candidate was talking about; </li><li>  owned a terminology that can google. </li></ul><br>  Then the <strong>task of the teacher</strong> : <br><br><ul><li>  it is very simple to explain, without complications (not everyone can); </li><li>  give a map for a landmark. </li></ul><br>  <strong>In the remainder</strong> we get the expected result: understand what they say;  know the keywords. <br><br>  The story ended with the fact that the QA head held three meetings at which HR specialists directly deployed databases, opened windows, sent requests, received some data.  So they remembered much more than if they had listened to a review lecture for 40 minutes with definitions.  So it was possible to effectively solve the problem explained "on the fingers." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/ga/gd/pfgagdntoz2yfjcxa4bqys7j9iw.png"><br><br><h2>  Case "Trainee analysts" <br></h2><br>  In the following example, a person is on the verge of the second zone into the third. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/yc/nt/wzycntlkzxe9pwdiqo4on1aavdi.png"><br><br>  Every year we recruit a group of interns to the analyst.  A fairly common practice is to read a course of lectures on a database, simply to compare the terminology adopted at the university with the slang in a company.  They will work with this, and everything will be fine for them. <br><br>  But we thought deeper.  Here, in fact, the <strong>problem of the</strong> <strong>target audience</strong> is not a problem, but a sincere desire to learn.  That same motivation.  People really want to learn (also for salary)!  This situation is ideal for learning. <br><br>  <strong>The result</strong> we expect: <br><br><ul><li>  less questions and errors of certain types; </li><li>  higher speed work. </li></ul><br>  These are measurable metrics that can record and evaluate learning outcomes - what we love and what makes us understand why we have spent the time. <br><br>  <strong>Task:</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  give technology; </li><li>  show shortcuts. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Remainder:</strong> the same skill - one, two, three. <br><br>  We made a session with applied tasks.  Every week, interns for 10-15 minutes were told about some solution, offered to try it.  If it did not work out, why?  Then the interns were still practicing on the spot, for a week they were engaged in exactly the same tasks, after which they proceeded to the next topic. <br><br>  We used the so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0">Kolb cycle</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/lg/bi/eelgbi_0oxoot0ln2zb5w8ci0uy.png"><br><br>  When you come to a training session, they usually give you a diagnostic exercise.  If you have a skill, the development of which is aimed at training, then you do this exercise easily, effortlessly.  More often it fails, because the skill is not enough.  At this point, you are thinking about the experience gained, why you did not work out, and want to find out how it was necessary.  Then the coach comes out, or you throw ideas on yourself - how it was possible to do better, that is, collect technology, critically think about it and raise it to the level of abstraction: ‚ÄúIt was possible to do that.‚Äù  Then you come up with a theory and then with this theory you proceed to the next exercise, apply it in it (‚ÄúIt seems, it works!‚Äù), And go into life, repeating it over and over again.  This is the Kolb cycle. <br><br>  If the task is to teach people exactly skill or technology, then it is convenient to apply the Kolb method. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/j2/n0/cjj2n0sp_mors8aczdctftw6ofe.png"><br><br>  When people in the third zone, and it would seem, know and are able to, what can go wrong? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/25/ax/fg/25axfgivvbgwu4vaeuou3uho-pg.png"><br><br><h2>  Case "Falling base" <br></h2><br>  Olya from BI (Business Intelligence) comes to me and says: ‚ÄúOnce a week, our base falls and marketers seem to drop it.  What to do?". <br><br>  You can, of course, come to marketers and say: ‚ÄúYou write bad requests - do not do it!  Do this.  Where are we going after this?  Most likely, far away.  Therefore, we went the other way. <br><br>  We have a <strong>problem</strong> - the base drops once a week. <br><br>  As a <strong>result,</strong> we want people to: <br><br><ul><li>  stopped making X; </li><li>  started doing Y - the way we need it. </li></ul><br>  And they have no such problem, but there is an interest or another <strong>problem</strong> - they would like: <br><br><ul><li>  get data more accurately; </li><li>  get data faster. </li></ul><br>  In general, marketers are not to blame - they have a huge amount of data of epic size.  In order to build a forecast of user behavior, they actually take data from the database as they can without thinking about query optimization.  This is not in their area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest.  If you think about their problems and find out how to help, then people will more favorably accept our help and training. <br><br>  Our <strong>task</strong> is, on the one hand, to solve the problems of marketers, on the other hand, to convince them to do otherwise (Y).  So that we can convince them, in the dry <strong>residue there</strong> should be some factual fact that if you do Y, you will get a better result than if you do X. <br><br>  We conducted several sessions on SQL advanced for marketing.  Prior to this, the guys from BI came, sat down with marketers, looked at how they made requests, asked questions, why, why.  The preparation was quite lengthy.  After this, BI understood how to help get better data and not to drop the base every time. <br><br>  It worked - marketers gladly came and started to learn.  If this did not happen, but simply stood in the calendar: ‚ÄúCome learn SQL‚Äù, they would say: ‚ÄúWe know SQL, do not go - we have other tasks!‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, one of my tasks as a teacher is to persuade people, not just to teach. <br><br><h2>  Case "Feedback Timlid for Managers" <br></h2><br>  The development manager comes to me and suggests: ‚ÄúLet's conduct training for department heads on how to give feedback to the Timlids‚Äù.  I wondered: the heads of the departments have been working for more than a year - probably, they have already given a feedback, and they know how to do it.  It seems that they are in the fourth zone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0e/zi/ou/0eziout5h33xsj4c7y7b97mfrmq.png"><br><br>  What is the <strong>problem</strong> ?  At the Performance Review it turns out that approaches to timlids in different departments are somewhat different, due to which the career development of people who could move from one department to another at the same time is complicated.  Different requirements - it is not clear what to do. <br><br>  What <strong>result</strong> do we expect?  We would like us to have a single approach in all departments. <br><br>  What is the <strong>problem with department heads</strong> ?  In general, and they have this problem, but not that it was paramount.  However, you can go on the other hand: <br><br><ul><li>  look at others; </li><li>  to show yourself. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Task:</strong> let's look at the cases - who works how, who faced what, exchange experience, systematize it.  The <strong>bottom line is that the</strong> guys come out with complicated cases and can now at least have an approximate idea how to solve them. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have worked on the problem of Central Asia, now we need to work on our task: to work out common rules. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, in order to get our result, they must not only work out the rules, but also agree that they really need to take a unified approach, and decide to adhere to general rules. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1u/qt/ho/1uqtho7-vebpwjbtbxlzibc2sfw.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you look at the task a little deeper - not just feedback training, as requested by the customer, - then you can come to the format of parsing complex cases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This also requires lengthy preparation: you need to come to everyone, sit in front of him and ask: ‚ÄúDear, what hurts you? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How are you doing this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What complicated cases were there? ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To make high-quality training, it would be good to say that it hurts them, while promoting their interests in parallel.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k7/le/5w/k7le5wgknmrhen_vis5ixywpnjc.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So, one of our tasks is to help make decisions. </font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Framework </font></font><br></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we looked at the problems, and at the results, and at the level, we defined our task and what dry residue people will endure, we can begin to talk about restrictions. We remember that we have limitations: </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2o/9i/nl/2o9inltghy5qxtwwsjmrlgktzks.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they often forget that there is a </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">budget</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the first column </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Sometimes it is non-zero, and it can be used. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Important note:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Many people think that the teacher is good when he is in the fourth zone - where the car is driving, eyes closed. This is a misconception because the </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">best teachers come from people in the third zone.</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are aware of what is happening, they know the methodology and can explain by it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it is not always effective to teach yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you communicate well, but you cannot explain why you are doing this, by what method, then it is better to call a person who is in a more conscious area and can sort out the methodology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes it is more efficient to spend the budget than to do it yourself. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the second column, </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">processes are</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> sometimes forgotten </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have already said that the process can both limit and help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Think about the process, think about it - maybe it can be refined so that it is convenient for people to do what you want, and not always for this they need to be taught.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Decision! </font></font><br></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now we can finally talk about the decision and discuss the format: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Individually / 6 small group / 12-16 training group / x * 12. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Lecture / meeting / demo / training / workshop / business game / simulation. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> One-time / several meetings / regular club. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Working / non-working time. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Weekdays / Weekend. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 1 hour / 2-4 hours / 8 hours a day. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Morning / Lunch / Evening. </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An important parameter is the number of classes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some skills without regular repetition are not learned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you give a person one time technology, most likely he will not understand it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we have, for example, a club of speakers, which I </font></font><a href="https://youtu.be/Eqtzj2JIJQw"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">talked about</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in February, where people regularly come and learn to speak publicly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do not repeat, instead of moving from the third zone to the fourth, people are dumped into the second. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some things must be repeated regularly.</font></font><br><br><h2>  Results <br></h2><br><ul><li> <strong>  ‚Äî   .</strong>    ,     .      ,   ,     HR  : ¬´     ?¬ª,        .     .
