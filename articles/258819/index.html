Why take a chance when there are simple-clear champignons &amp; truffles in stores?  Wild mushrooms both look and smell suspiciously, and the one who eats them and walks alive is either incredible lucky or the one who knows all the secrets - which is also, in general, suspicious. <br><br>  Understanding the cautious Britons will help mushroom folklore and the test for survival in the English forests.  Go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  "Toad chair" and other concepts </h1><br>  Mushrooms are farmed and wild, the latter are divided into poisonous and edible.  Fungus (reads "fangus", plural fungi) is a clever name, mushroom is a popular name, and toadstool is a warning: sometimes it is something poisonous and sometimes edible, but mimicking deadly twins. <br><br>  Toadstool (“toad chair” / “toad chair”) is an echo of medieval superstition: an edible mushroom becomes poisonous if a poisonous toad sits on it, and since it is impossible to determine by eye, it is better not to take any.  About local toads, everything is true: their skin really releases toxins.  And about mushrooms - no: it’s just that some are not combined with alcohol, others cannot be eaten raw, and still others - with the taste of regular mushrooms or radish - are killed only on the fourth day.  But should someone be extreme?

    <h1>  “Eat me!” (C) </h1><br>  There are about 15,000 species of mushrooms on the island, so there are few rolls with the continent.  This is what people-friendly top 5 looks like: <br><br>  1. Black truffle - Truffle.  Rare.  We love for the fact that he has no false cousins. <br><br>  2. The cep is Porcini (boletus), aka Cep (which is in French), it is Penny Bun - a small bun for a penny, which alludes to the “Bread Act” of 1266 - then the standard “loaf” appeared. <br><br>  3. Morel present.  The origin of the name is vague, but it did not go without the French.  He has a twin, "Morel false" False Morel.  The one that is poisonous in its raw form and is considered a delicacy in the Scandinavian countries. <br><br>  4. Champignon.  What is sold in a shop / served in a restaurant is Portobello Mushroom, a two-sided champignon.  And he is good because you will not confuse him with anyone.  Another thing - Field Mushroom or Horse Mushroom (also mushrooms, by the way).  They are very much like a poisonous cousin, the Yellow Dyer, Yellow Stainer, from whom they die a time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb8/26b/33f/eb826b33fe0c47fdbc6211bae22d6f95.jpg"><br><br>  Hint: who smells like anise, that friend, and who the ink (Indian ink), that enemy. <br><br>  5. Chanterelle summer - Chanterelle (shantrell).  The one that we have served with sour cream.  But there is also the Yellow Foot, Yellow Foot, or Trumpet Chanterelle, Chanterelle-Trumpet, an autumn-winter variation.  Strange, though edible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac2/016/08c/ac201608cc5b4f1c8483104cd3964617.jpg"><br><br>  Special attention is given to the local landmark Giant Puffball - a giant rain coat.  It grows the size of a pumpkin, and makes steaks out of it.  In the photo, by the way, is not pretty :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/bb6/fa3/d83bb6fa3a1d45d0a38aed6b780563b5.jpg"><br><br>  The Blue Stalk Mushroom Mushroom Blue Foot (aka Wood Blewit) and the <s>russula hybrid with a</s> mushroom Caesar's Mushroom - the Caesar mushroom are just as good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a14/ef7/3d5/a14ef73d555f442ebf8b69dc0ec63fcb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e45/878/81b/e4587881b19d4e7cba394143a8675e3b.jpg"><br><br>  The latter is so good that enterprising Bulgarians sell it on amazon.co.uk as Wild Hand-Picked Gourmet Mushrooms (as long as she wrote, the product ended): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/509/a4d/4e2/509a4d4e27d041a29987ed3b17fdeea1.jpg"><br><br><h1>  The sweeter, the more dangerous </h1><br>  Part of the assassin fungi migrated from the continent and successfully zakosila under the small local ones.  The appearance does not give them away, and the names are still like: “Fool's Webcap for a Fool” Webcap (aka Panther Cap), “Smashing Angel” Destroying Angel and “Cap-Killer” Death Cap.  Learned?  Amanita panther, mushroom smelly and pale toadstool.  Just in case, let me remind you that the antidotes to such toxins have not yet been discovered, and the victim has failed the kidneys and liver for 10 days after a long vomiting, diarrhea and imaginary recovery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d5/161/59e/5d516159e8cc4a93aba20f52cd250a8d.jpg"><br><br>  They smell sweet and taste good - the Roman Emperor Claudius loved it. <br>  Another visiting mercenary is the fly agaric (Fly <s>Agaric), a</s> famous <s>gluco-</s> mushroom (Fly Agaric).  In Britain, famous for the fact that in the Middle Ages the hat was crumbed into milk to get rid of the flies - they were poisoned, became lethargic and immediately sank.  It was believed that boiling killed his toxins, but where are these people now?  Causes pulmonary edema and death from suffocation, because of the varning! <br><br>  And here is the local guard - “Sweaty Mushroom” Sweating Mushroom (it will make you sweat endlessly!), “Jack Lantern” Jack O'lantern and “Ink Cap” Inky Cap.  “Jack's Lantern” mows under a chanterelle-shantrel in everything, including taste and smell, and at the same time it glows in the dark (!), And the fermented “Cap” used to be boiled in water with clove spiciness and urine to get ink.  There is something you can after heat treatment, and drinking with alcohol is absolutely impossible.  Dry law for 48 hours - otherwise, goodbye, heart.  For the second popular name of the fungus is “Pyanchuzhkina doom” Tippler's Bane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/293/dc5/94d293dc5bd54f5cbf0dece80cfa4c3b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/560/933/bde560933a2049d6be42b34c639ee4e8.jpg"><br><br>  So now you are ready for anything :) Let's start with! <br><br><h2>  Virtual simulator: “What is this toadstool, sir?” </h2><br><br>  There are 5 edible mushrooms, 2 poisonous mushrooms and 1 mushroom with a surprise.  Gather friends, and let the enemies grow further.  Mushrooms are cut off like this: write in comments <br><br>  <i>#picking [numbers of pictures through zpt].</i> <br><br>  On the third day, I will tell you who survived, and to whom the irretrievably pophlohelo ... And how it all called - too :) Go! <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49d/dab/a37/49ddaba37bbe4926848c4b7b4cbc03e5.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/e5b/5c8/e85e5b5c8e214523af1b4c2a722b7906.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93d/c3d/03e/93dc3d03e1634ff8b4cc98bcd4c396c3.jpg"></td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3c/ded/219/a3cded2197be479fa6ee274f132e29b4.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/f43/2d4/da5f432d4c134a5bb6f8b20edd52df76.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e2/2f1/8f5/4e22f18f58b243c3a6e38726f1a473c4.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/525/1b8/6fc5251b8248463da7a9c8602725d7db.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/937/0fb/9fe/9370fb9fe26340979a7379f5bc5308f5.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c47/b44/b64/c47b44b64db24cf5a0ca61ef6dbe3845.png"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h2>  UPD: The quest is over, and here it is, the moment of truth. </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Survived:</b> <br><br>  Odinokij_Kot <br>  kirias <br>  ihhabr <br>  Dolios <br>  Arilas <br>  hmpd <br></td><td>  <b>Definitely trapped:</b> <br><br>  Veliant <br>  rocknrollnerd <br>  chronomaster <br>  Snipe (RIP) <br>  Nadoedalo (RIP) <br>  jstudent (RIP) <br>  Myosotis <br>  HunterSpy (RIP) <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mushrooms in the photo: xy of xy and collection statistics</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> 1.

They took 10 people. <br>  3. The Funeral Bell - “Mushroom-By-the-Who-Toll-Bell”.  Insidious - symptoms of poisoning manifested within 7 days - and <b>fatal</b> : coma, kidney failure or gastrointestinal bleeding.  Took 4 people. <br>  4. Scarlet Wax Hood - “Scarlet Wax Cap”.  Edible, even though it may be like candid toadstools.  Good with any side dish.  Took 9 people. <br>  5. Verdigris Agaric (verdigris - the name of the paint "armadian").  <b>Poisonous fly agaric</b> : vomiting + diarrhea, and then how lucky / on what hit.  They took 5 people. <br>  6. Chicken of the woods - “Forest Chickens”.  Edible, taste like chicken.  Vegan favorites.  Took 9 people. <br>  7. The Blusher - "Mushroom Rouge".  Amanita pink, he's a mushroom with a "surprise."  <b>In its raw form it is poisonous</b> , it is edible after heat treatment.  Took 3 people. <br>  8. Wood Ears, they are also Jews Ears - “Wood Ears”, “Judah Ears”, because it grows on elder.  According to their beliefs, it was the elder, not aspen.  Edible, growing all year round, but it must be cooked for a long time.  They took 8 people. <br></div></div><br><br>  Those who feel the strength to go to level 2, please click on the picture with <b>Birch Bolete</b> , the British version of the bobbler.
