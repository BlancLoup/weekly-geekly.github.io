  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Svyaz-Expocomm 2010: what did the big three show?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From May 11 to May 14, Moscow hosted the twenty-second annual exhibition devoted to the field of information communications - Svyaz-Expocomm.  Of course, among the companies participating in the exhibition, there were mobile operators, who demonstrated their new technologies in the allotted days. <br><br>  On the stands of mobile operators, those products and technologies that now seem to be fantasy seem to be presented to us, however, they will soon become quite ordinary things. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  MTS at the Svyaz-Expocomm 2010 was represented at the booth of Sistema with Comstar-UTS and MTS Strim - by the way, all these companies will be replaced by the MTS single brand by the end of 2011, - where it showed a number of unconditionally innovative solutions for both business and the consumer market.

      So, MTS gave a glimpse into the future, demonstrating <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE technology</a> , or 4G, which allows data transfer at speeds up to 326.4 Mbit / s - this is more than twice as fast as WiMAX. <br><br>  In addition, MTS introduced a femtocell, a low-power base station that creates additional channels for voice communications and a 3G coverage on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã350-1000 sq. M.  Femtocell is ideal for companies whose offices are located in places with poor communication (outside the city, in the basement), allowing you to get an indoor connection instantly and without any problems.  The station allows you to serve only the employees of your company, as well as monitor their presence in the workplace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/63/5c/635cfd2ce121c45d831414c49808bc89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Navigation services were also presented to corporate clients.  The first of them, ‚ÄúNIKA‚Äù, is designed to track vehicles ‚Äî using a combination of GPS / GLONASS, the service provides positioning accuracy of up to 5 meters and is independent of the satellite constellation.  The second service, Mobile Employees, is designed to monitor the company's employees and ensures the accuracy of locating up to 150 meters using data from the base stations of the GSM network.  By the end of the year, the accuracy of determination should be doubled. <br><br>  For private users, the first car GPS navigator from a cellular operator with a GPRS modem was presented to download traffic information, as well as to use ICQ and other Internet services.  Home users and small companies should come to taste and a new router that allows you to use the Internet, IP-TV and home phone - the router, working in any networks (using ethernet, 3G, Wi-Fi or WiMAX), always stays in touch. <br><br>  Finally, new BlackBerry smartphones, which are gaining popularity in the Russian corporate market, were presented, as well as innovative thermal SIM cards operating in the temperature range from -40 ¬∞ C to + 150 ¬∞ C and characterized by vibration and shock resistance, as well as increased service life - such a "SIM" will work for more than 13 years, having survived 2 regular SIM-cards.  Several tens of thousands of such SIM-cards belong to the largest operators in the world (Vodafone, Telefonica) - MTS has 40,000 such SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/b1/2ab1a21a60c1e7ec9db4653155372a8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This time, Beeline has focused visitors on the now popular 3D-TV broadcast via cable Internet channels.  The Beeline booth showed the implementation of three-dimensional content using the Video on Demand service and the Beeline home digital television already familiar to Muscovites and St. Petersburgers. <br><br>  Beeline demonstrated to corporate users the capabilities of LTE technology already mentioned above, as well as the work of the Office service in 5 minutes - using this service, a small office can be connected to a telephone line and the Internet without any other access to telecommunications. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt leave Beeline without attention and the increasingly popular market of smartphones and services for the BlackBerry business, demonstrating their work to visitors. <br><br>  Megafon, like Beeline, did not surprise visitors with the number of new products - at least the number of those new products that are aimed at corporate users and the consumer market.  However, the company introduced systems designed to save people in emergency situations.  Acting with the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584">Center for Disaster Medicine</a> (CMC), MegaFon created a permanent secure connection between the CMC and the Ambulance.  Thus, through the Internet, doctors can remotely exchange various data on the patient's condition (for example, send X-rays and ECG data) without losing time for a diagnosis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/ca/7cca41e3bae68ac76ed9cbc1200043ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, Megafon together with Aeroflot demonstrated base stations to provide communication on board aircraft - in 2010 they will be equipped with 4 Aeroflot airliners. <br><br>  A corporate femtocell was presented to corporate users similar to the one shown by MTS, for deploying its network in an office space.  The usual customers of <a href="http://trava.ru/">MegaFon</a> were shown the portal <a href="http://trava.ru/">Trava.ru</a> , which could immediately be tested in action.  The portal "Grass" is a place to get acquainted with music, video clips and other licensed content, and, of course, to purchase it. <br><br>  At Sviaz-Expocomm 2010, one could see the overall vector of development of the top three mobile operators.  In general, this is the development of LTE technology and the provision of communications to small businesses.  Otherwise, the interests of the operators are different, and for Beeline they run into 3D television, and for MegaFon they run into an entertainment portal.  MTS does not rely on something concrete, and providing a greater number of innovative and simply useful end-user oriented services in this regard looks more attractive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93880/</a></p>
