In principle, the technologies they developed along roughly the same pattern as ours - they also played Digger, Karatek and Prince on CGA monitors, they too were delighted with Doom and Wolf 3D, they also sat at UFO and Diablo at night , endlessly fulfilled tasks in GTA, rejoiced at the success in Starcraft and waited for the release of Half Life 3. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/281558/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85d/9e7/5eb/85d9e75eb6f418da8ca46b63314cc367.png"></a> <br><br>  But there was one difference that, it seems to us, radically distinguishes this civilization from ours - they were deprived of gaming laptops!  We do not know why this happened, but their scientists, who were very similar to ours, for some reason could not invent such a device.  Either they could not make the video cards mobile, or they could not solve the problem of overheating, we don‚Äôt know.  So they sit, probably, still on bulky desktops, tied to a power outlet ... At the time, like you and I, friends, we are already using this wonderful invention.  Guess what we want to talk about today? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A small lyrical digression.  You can‚Äôt just start talking about gaming laptops without mentioning about laptops ‚Äúin general‚Äù, as they are, in some way, their ‚Äúancestors‚Äù.

As for the "gaming" laptops, their historical path is not so long.  But the future, whatever one may say, is still behind mobile devices that give the user freedom of action and movement and do not require wired connections.  And, of course, on the front of gaming devices, this principle is just as important!  Today we just want to consider one of the representatives of the line of gaming laptops - we got the Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 and want to ‚Äútouch‚Äù it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/676/d8e/e82/676d8ee82424979702df566893358589.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, this is not the top model in the line of Lenovo gaming laptops, let's say - from the whole model range it is more accessible, but if you are interested in more abruptly, then you can get acquainted with the entire line <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/gaming/laptops.html">by the link</a> . <br><br>  Let's start with a visual inspection.  The device is delivered in a cardboard box, nothing remarkable, standard packaging made of good cardboard.  Inside we are met by black color: foam rubber, accessories packaging, cellophane - all are strictly black.  The laptop itself, to be honest, is not small.  Dimensions ‚Äúmy honor‚Äù: 42x30x27.9 cm and weight 3.5 kg.  To call such a device a mobile device with a stretch, but when you understand what the "beast is hiding under the hood," all these reservations recede into the background.  And still contributes to such dimensions 17-inch Full HD display, with a matrix made by technology IPS with anti-reflective coating.  The solid size allowed to install solid iron!  But we will not run ahead, first consider the laptop from all sides and get acquainted with the input-output ports and interesting engineering "discoveries". <br><br>  A closed laptop on the back looks like the hood of an expensive caddy.  It seems that now Bi-Xenon headlights will flash, a roar of a diesel turbo engine will be heard from under the grille and you will rush along the highway towards the night! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4bb/fdf/9ce/4bbfdf9cecd8636b195ff444baf10830.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f4/2af/3cd/0f42af3cd532bcf08eca01b173a88094.jpg"><br><br>  What, unfortunately, can not be said about the front view.  The usual front view, no more. <br><br>  The body (aka topcase) of the device is cold, dull, but not metal.  Fingerprints remain, if this is important to you, but it is well erased, which will somehow sweeten the pill. <br><br>  But the bottom panel is metal, not plastic, as it may seem during a quick inspection, despite the fact that the design on it is exactly the same as on the top.  On it (the panel) there is an air intake window, with a grille and dust filter inside, as well as a 3W subwoofer in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06f/a60/44d/06fa6044df85cb71b643ed9ceda3c003.jpg"><br><br>  Now about the area and the use of storage space.  The main thing - her, this area a lot.  For example, the keyboard climbed with a number pad and full-sized arrow keys.  But all the same, when you open the laptop, at first you lose a little.  In the upper corners, right and left, there are 2-watt JBL speakers supporting Dolby Home Theater technology.  Here, of course, the collaboration between Lenovo and JBL has borne fruit - the sound of the Y700 is quite pleasant.  A bit lacking bass, but this is a laptop, not a studio audio system! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fb/3a1/32e/7fb3a132ef5df4246b4a927b282595d7.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side of the notebook are: proprietary power port, USB 2.0, SD / MMC card reader, 3.5 audio jack, Lenovo Recovery hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9cd/7de/f3e/9cd7def3eeb02200829095277b6fa874.jpg"><br><br>  On the right: Kensington lock, RJ-45 network port, HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fb/09d/2e3/0fb09d2e36260f45640ed1d6a7165f0d.jpg"><br><br>  It is time to turn on the ignition and look at the specifications.  Our specimen has the following performance characteristics: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="150">  CPU </td><td>  Quad-core Intel Core i7 6700HQ (Skylake) </td></tr><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  Windows 10 Home </td></tr><tr><td>  Video Cards </td><td>  NVIDIA GTX 960M 4 GB GDDR5 and Intel HD Graphics 530 </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  DDR4 16 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Drives </td><td>  SSD 120 GB + HDD 1TB </td></tr><tr><td>  Audio </td><td>  Two 2W JBL speakers and a 3W subwoofer with surround sound and support for Dolby Home Theater technology </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  4 cells 60 W ¬∑ h </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td> Frameless, Full HD (1920 x 1080) with support for IPS technology and anti-reflective coating </td></tr><tr><td>  WLAN network </td><td>  LAN 1000 Mbit, support Wi-Fi 2 x 2 a / c and Bluetooth 4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports </td><td>  Two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port (permanently on), DC-in connector, 2-in-1 combo audio jack, one HDMI connector, 4-in-1 card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC, MMC) </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Pro performance better words tell brothers tests.  To begin with a couple of pictures with the characteristics of the hardware of the laptop. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f36/d71/311/f36d71311290cbcb6072a99079e4e9fb.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/125/c82/65f/125c8265f055bfb537b98d93883b3fc6.png"></div><br>  The performance of the disk subsystem was estimated using the popular package CrystalDiskMark.  Recall that the disk here is 2: agile SSD at 120 Gb and spacious, with a capacity of 1 Tb, the traditional HDD. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/817/a64/096/817a640966013186959755fd48552b00.png"></div><br>  The speed of packing / unpacking the archive in 7-zip. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/699/e30/d71/699e30d71adf38aebaad6118ce2ac395.png"></div><br>  With the ComputeMark benchmark, let's take a look at the overall GPU computing performance.  This test is based on the automatic execution of several computational scripts that run through the API DirectX 11 Compute. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25f/a1b/44a/25fa1b44a46116a3b24a7a5269dc86f4.png"></div><br>  To study the performance of the construction of three-dimensional models, design and animation, we use the specially designed for this purpose test CINEBENCH. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c8/5c6/733/1c85c67334e225a3dbac1b1fcc0d3b73.png"></div><br>  To conduct stress testing of the video card and test the computer cooling system at maximum heat output, we use the Heaven benchmark with the Basic and Extreme settings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02f/ccb/cbf/02fccbcbfa6a48db13b9997f227d157e.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba2/4e5/7b2/ba24e57b286e2adaabef77005a97df1a.png"></div><br><br>  Well, where do without 3DMark :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f3/6f6/ecf/5f36f6ecf9997728ae657e9693962e11.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87a/e65/26c/87ae6526cff8e2043871443d221364e2.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a37/1e1/c2a/a371e1c2a39004a2c9613ecbd0aef4ba.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86e/f90/222/86ef902223f9bd9c831b6dd80ce7ec22.png"></div><br>  How does the Y700 behave in games?  We managed to play only a few: World of Tanks, Dying Light, Fallout 4, World of Warships and Sleeping Dogs.  The device proved to be worthy: the performance does not fall, the heating of a key component - the video card did not exceed 70 degrees Celsius, and the noise level of the cooling system does not turn into a depressive and annoying howl.  WOT and WoWs at maximum settings give about 60 fps in combat, Fallout 4 - 50 fps at medium, ultra at 30 to 50 frames per second, it all depends on the environment. <br><br>  But something tells us that not everything is so ‚Äúrosy‚Äù everywhere.  For example, in Sleeping Dogs we did not manage to get impressive fps figures at maximum graphics settings and had to ‚Äúroll back‚Äù to the average. <br><br>  In principle, a bunch of GeForce GTX 960M graphics card and Intel Core i7 6700HQ processor are not exclusive and, coupled with a fairly brisk disk subsystem and an impressive amount of RAM, give quite an acceptable result - a ‚Äúsolid four‚Äù, so to speak, and in the classmates shelf (by iron) - and all 5 points. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Dry residue</font> </h2><br>  What do you mean by the term "gaming laptop"?  Is it just a game?  But, thanks to its powerful hardware, such a device can perfectly cope with the encoding / playback of video and audio, work in CAD, and can act as a good home media center, even with its own audio.  He does not claim to be the "beast machine", but his iron will be enough for almost any of the tasks listed above and if home is needed not prohibitively expensive gaming PC with the ability to quickly move it not only within the apartment, but also within the city, without strain back, bruises from the system unit on the legs and without calling a taxi for transportation, the Y700 is a good, balanced choice. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <br>  Price?  Prices for gaming laptops Lenovo Y series start at 60,000 rubles.  Depending on the configuration and screen size. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398303/</a></p>
