Earlier, you could already familiarize yourself with the first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/startupacademy/blog/161651/">part of the article</a> , in which we tried to set out our vision for the 2013 trend review prepared by <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/">Trend watching</a> .  As you understand, all these ideas can become new multi-million businesses (or failures) in the next 12 months, so read and be inspired! <br><br>  It is time to talk about ecology, fashion and medicine: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  4. We return debts to nature </h4><br>  Now we will discuss the trends in 2013 related to ecology: for example, a significant phenomenon of products and services that literally ‚Äúcontain a new life‚Äù. <br>  Instead of being recycled or recycled, these products can organically ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to the natural environment in order to give life to something new, the same ‚Äúeco‚Äù in status. <br><br>  Of course, the products of the ‚Äúnew life‚Äù will not solve many environmental problems, but, more than ever, 2013 is a symbol of creating something fundamentally new, a product friendly to nature.

      Correct positioning of your values ‚Äã‚Äãcan find a response from your users.  Especially if your words imply serious intentions to perform conscious and environmentally correct actions. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2011/10/18/chopstick-gardens/">"To Be Nature" chopsticks</a> : a</b> change of thinking in favor of the plant <br>  Korean designer Gyeongwan Koo created "To Be Nature" chopsticks as an alternative to disposable chopsticks.  One of the sticks is equipped with a cap in which the seeds of the plant are located.  After the owner of such sticks ceases to use them, they can be placed with a tip in the soil, where the seeds germinate and give life to the new tree.  The second stick (without attachment) can be used as a support along which growth will take place. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/democratech/sprout-a-pencil-with-a-seed">Sprout</a> : a</b> pencil that wants to be a plant <br>  Sprout is a pencil that can grow in perspective!  When a pencil becomes too short and inconvenient to use, it can be planted in the ground: at the tip of the pencil, again, there is a capsule that dissolves upon contact with water, which allows the seeds inside it to germinate.  At the time of stopping the fundraising process in September 2012, the project raised $ 35,000 from more than 2,000 supporters who supported it. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.tierrapatagonia.com/">Tierra Patagonia Hotel &amp; Spa</a> :</b> seeds that are being watched. <br>  Tierra Patagonia Hotel &amp; Spa in Chile has launched a program in which each guest receives a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù seed of a tree.  Guest himself can choose a place in a specially designated area where he wants his tree to be planted.  After landing, the guest receives a link to Google Maps with reference to the location, where you can follow your "own" tree. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.molsoncanadian.ca/en/red-leaf-project/home.aspx">Molson Canadian</a> :</b> seed stands <br>  As part of a special project for the natural restoration of the forest, the Red Leaf Project, a Canadian beer brand Molson Canadian's, has launched coasters for beer kurzki made from seed, which, once in the soil, germinated.  Since June 2012, one million coasters have been distributed in bars and together with boxes for bottles of beer. <br><br><h4>  5. Digital medicine </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92b/f2a/8ab/92bf2a8ab25400e7f33dd38f93503544.jpg">  Digital technology is a new medical word.  Taking into account the fact that the App store today already has more than 13,000 medical applications, the question now is not to find such applications, but to choose the best ones, and also - given the fact that the question concerns human health is the most accurate and safe ones. <br><br>  In 2013, it is expected that users will contact doctors and various medical institutes and institutions to confirm the certification of medical applications and other technologies, or for doctors to advise them on such treatment applications (to the same extent as drugs) .  Professional therapists, in turn, see medical applications as real assistants in their work, designed to help achieve even greater success and progress in treating patients. <br><br>  Applications will reduce the costs and costs of treatment, because they force their users to think more often about their own state of health, increase their level of consciousness when undergoing treatment, and also allow them to recognize warning signals at early stages in the monitoring process. <br><br>  Even if you are not part of the healthcare industry, and you think that digital medicine is not for you, we are sure that the time spent studying this trend and the trend underlying the process is a transition to the massive use of mobile services. - can open for you a lot of insights, promising profits. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.happtique.com/2012/08/20/happtique-launches-mrx-pilot-program">mRX</a> :</b> App store for healthcare professionals <br>  Happtique (a division of the Greater New York Hospital Association) is an app store for medical applications that was created by professionals for professionals.  In August 2012, Happtique launched a pilot program, in which doctors recommended proven applications to their patients, and then made sure that each of them downloaded the prescribed. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/antibiotics-reminder/id532054264%3Fmt%3D8">Antibiotics Reminder</a></b> <br>  In June 2012, the Australian government-supported National Prescribing Service launched the Antibiotics Reminder project.  The free downloadable application is a kind of ‚Äúreminder‚Äù for taking medication: it helps to ensure that medications are taken, as well as keep a kind of ‚Äúdiary‚Äù to track progress.  The purpose of the application is to help users take medications on time, thereby enhancing the positive effect of treatment. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://proteusdigitalhealth.com/technology/">Proteus Digital Health</a> : a</b> ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù tracking sensor approved by the Drug and Nutrient Monitoring Commission. <br>  In July 2012, the Food &amp; Drug Administration in the United States sponsored Proteus Digital Health to develop and test a ‚Äúswallow‚Äù sensor that should monitor whether a patient is taking prescribed medications or not.  The device is activated when gastric juice hits it, and then it collects data about the patient‚Äôs condition, directing it to a mobile application that allows you to signal if the medicine was not taken by the patient on time. <br><br><h4>  6. The triumph of national culture </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a2/188/375/9a2188375295a6bc9974cfe695f43b43.jpg">  In 2012, the cultural component of globalization will continue to self-destruct in the same way as its financial aspect.  Where it leads?  Emerging markets will successfully export and distribute their ‚Äúcultural heritage‚Äù in the next 12 months.  Symbols, lifestyle and traditions, the significance of which was previously understated (if not rejected), will become an object of pride and mass consumption for buyers in the domestic market, as well as arouse interest in the global market. <br><br>  In the event that you still do not take into account the triumph of national cultures, it is a good time for you to develop relationships with leading brands in emerging markets, which will help bring their flavor to your business, as well as to your products for customers.  However, even if you are already working in one of these markets, do not miss a selection of trends and do not forget that you should always respect the local culture: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.ne-tiger.com/en/index.html">NE-TIGER</a> :</b> Luxury Fashion ‚ÄúFrom China to the Global Market‚Äù <br>  The first Chinese luxury brand NE-TIGER, known for its ethnic design at the junction of East and West.  In September 2012, the founder of the company, Zhang Zhifeng, gave a speech under the heading ‚ÄúChina to the World‚Äù before the presentation of his new collection in Milan. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://houseofmasaba.com/">House of Masaba: Pop Art Saree</a></b> <br>  The fashionable design house (luxury style) from Mumbai. Masaba Gupta's House of Masaba rethought traditional Indian women's sari dress and added eccentric, modern colors and motifs to it, as well as Pop Art prints - an action aimed at attracting young girls, fashionistas.  The black and white sari collection, released in the spring of 2012, has been recognized by many Indian celebrities, as well as the animal print version.  Prices ranged from 8 to 10 thousand Indian rupees (approximately $ 150-200). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.tsimanistudio.com/">Studio Tsim√°ni</a> :</b> Mexican Style <br>  In April 2012, Studio Tsim√°ni joined the Destination Mexico initiative in the MoMA Design Store in New York.  The studio draws inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and creates modern furniture and other household utensils that embody people's desire for identity in their home country. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.tvnstarhunt2.com/">tvN: K-Pop Star Hunt</a></b> <br>  In July 2012, the second season of tvN's K-Pop Star Hunt was launched, the goal of which is to find a new pop star in Asia.  Searches are conducted in 8 Asian countries, including South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.  Korean music is now, of course, at the peak of its popularity, especially after the PSY Gangnam Style hit triumph on the international stage. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.sulwhasoo.com/main.jsp">Sulwhasoo</a> :</b> Korean cosmetics in the US market <br>  In 2013, the rise in popularity of Korean cosmetic products, which have been talked about for so long, is expected.  For example, already in October 2012, Neiman Marcus customers in San Francisco ordered products from the Korean cosmetics brand Sulwhasoo.  This product stands out for its special packaging design, which resembles a ceramic product, as well as the properties of a product developed on the basis of Korean medicinal herbs, including ginseng and white peony root. <br><br>  What noted for themselves?  What direction, in your opinion, is the most promising? <br><br>  <i>To be continued‚Ä¶</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162337/</a></p>
