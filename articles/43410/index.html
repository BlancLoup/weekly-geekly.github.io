Projects are not new, a collection collected <a href="http://www.goodwebpractices.com/">here.</a> <br>  Naturally, I am writing not to inform you about this rating (surely everyone already knows), but to get opinions about failed projects. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">Myspace.com has</a> 90 million users.  In July 2005, it was sold for 327 million USD.  However, this did not prevent PCWorld from calling the portal the worst website of 2006.  Why?  Just because the user profiles the administration of the site complacently allowed to draw up in accordance with their own taste.  So we got a killer characteristic "uncomfortable for reading and not beautiful." <br><br>  <a href="http://www.havenworks.com/">HavenWorks.com</a> Actually, it became known for its disgusting design.  Actually, this is the only reason that I once received 70,000 visitors per month.  In general, this is a news site ... Yeah.  And for 9 years of their existence they spent as much on $ 120 a year, which completely went to pay for hosting.  In general, I do not understand why this successful project turned out to be in this ranking of losers.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://www.pets.com/">Pets.com</a> Online <a href="http://www.pets.com/">pet</a> store.  The highest attendance among similar resources (I think that the biggest expenses are 82.5 million USD).  However, the authors of the rating do not like the business model of the project.  Delivery of goods is carried out within 2 days, and animals do not agree to wait for such a long period of their feed and tray filler. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.webvan.com/">Webvan.com People</a> traded in themselves quietly groceries, primus, rumored to have repaired quite well.  And they got the idea to create a grocery online store.  And they spent over a billion dollars on this idea.  And suffered their failure.  And the company's shares began to sell not at $ 30 apiece, but at 6 cents.  Amen. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kozmo.com/">Kozmo.com</a> Charity, as it turned out, still does not make a profit.  The idea to deliver goods for free from $ 10 ‚Äúate‚Äù $ 280 million over 3 years and did not meet investors' expectations (Amazon.com). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.flooz.com/">Flooz.com</a> Americans have created online currency.  And they asked Whoopi Goldberg to advertise it.  We can not say that the project completely failed.  According to the author of the rating, the system was actively used by the Russians for money laundering.  And honest Americans both used bank cards to pay online, and continued to use.  For three years, 50 million dollars have safely gone to minus (but they certainly have not been laundered by the Russian mafia) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys.com At</a> one time, this online toy store was the most successful on the American Internet.  However, over time, market conditions changed, competitors merged, and eToys did not want to keep up with new trends.  The result - the disbandment of the state and bankruptcy.  Business, children are not toys. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kibu.com/">Kibu.com</a> Social network for teenage girls.  What really went wrong there is not clear.  Owners cite the dot-com crisis.  And adolescent girls enjoyed the site for exactly 46 days ... since the launch of the dot-off project.  Live fast die young. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.boo.com/">Boo.com</a> Online sales of luxury clothing.  The site was made entirely on a flash (at a time when not everyone could afford to wait indefinitely for all of his collections to load) and served by 400 employees, while there were 30. Hmm ... reminds me of this one Russian startup in 2008 Oh, how it reminds. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.msn.com/">Microsoft live search</a> Spent several billion dollars, the result - "Users have no incentive to use this search engine."  For that kind of money, users could simply be bought. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43410/</a></p>
