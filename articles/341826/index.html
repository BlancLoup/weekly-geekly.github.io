In his speech, Denis told which product metrics to focus on in order to achieve maximum results in the US market. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcX2quRp7uY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a>

      The rapidly developing US mobile market is overflowing with products and competition between them for the right to be the best.  Thousands of developers from around the world are trying to conquer the US market, turning competition into a real meat grinder.  Far from many, but FunCorp has succeeded. <br><br>  So, in order to survive and achieve success in the ‚Äúmeat grinder‚Äù, it is necessary to focus 100% on the product. <br><br>  Of course, marketing is very important, but, according to Denis, it should be a consequence of the achievements of grocery metrics. <br><br><h2>  Key Product Metrics <br></h2><br><h3>  Hold (RR) <br></h3><br>  It's no secret that now the most powerful retention rate have instant messengers.  Even in the middle - RR on the 30th day does not fall below 50%.  This is due, primarily, with socialization.  In order for the company to grow, you need to focus on these numbers. <br><br>  Case: FunCorp works a lot on socialization, constantly improves the comments feed, makes the functionality of group communication and pushes users to communicate with each other. <br>  Through the introduction of UX comments and public relations comments among the audience - it was possible to increase performance.  The number of commentators increased by 10%, the 30th day Retention rate + 3%. <br><br>  As a result, the guys from FunCorp identified a direction that works for itself: <br><br>  <b>Socialization + Monetization + Performance</b> <b><br></b> <br><h3>  Lifetime (LT) <br></h3><br>  We can assume that 30 days is a trial period for the user, for which he precisely decides whether he needs a product or not.  Anyone who stayed on the 30th day can be considered their loyal audience, which makes a profit. <br><br>  For mobile-only free products, the only way to make money is advertising.  To work in a team of 50 people in Russia with a product in the United States, you need to earn $ 10 on one user. <br><br>  If LT is 1 year, then eCPM Banners 320x50 = $ 0.75, and Banner refresh rate = 20 sec, then: <br><br>  <b>$ 10 = 13300 Banners = 73 h = 12m per user per day</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This is a cool indicator. <br><br>  To achieve a positive result, Denis proposes to integrate the following actions into your promotion tactics: <br><br>  - <b>Creating a habit</b> .  The most correct solution is to create user habits.  A person should get used to the fact that there is something interesting waiting for him in the application every day.  For example, FunCorp makes 6 issues a day, and users know for sure that you need to go to the iFunny application 6 times a day, spend a few minutes, get fresh memchiki and go on to go about your business. <br><br>  - <b>Community</b> .  Creating a community gives you the opportunity to make friends, people come back to chat with friends. <br><br>  - <b>Content analytics</b> .  Analytics of audience tastes and community management allowed FunCorp to achieve LT about 2 liters <br><br><h3>  DAU / MAU <br></h3><br>  The ideal proportion of DAU / MAU is ¬Ω.  This is the proportion of top world products.  This ratio means that the product is extremely necessary for the audience, it gives it value every day. <br><br>  In FunCorp, the main issue is the availability of daily issues + the creation of content monitoring services, checking the content for button accordions and shelf life.  This approach allowed us to go from a ratio of 1/4 to 1 / 2.2. <br><br><h3>  Viewing depth <br></h3><br>  For a product super-useful, if users sit for a long time in the application.  This gives you confidence that you are on the right track, and, of course, directly affects monetization. <br><br>  <b>Fact: The average ceiling for monetization is 30 minutes per day per user.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  These were 4 fairly clear metrics.  The value is that they can be influenced + they are easily calculated.  They also apply to many types of mobile applications. <br>  What else matters besides 4 metrics?  Your audience. <br><br>  Conquer your audience, especially innovators and early followers.  The more active the innovators are, the higher your product performance will be.  Of course, they have higher requirements.  Therefore, try to create only the underground, as the usual marketing will not affect them.  Only after that, you can do marketing of the investigation: traffic and nativkoy. <br><br><h3>  Total <br></h3><br><ul><li>  100% focus on the product, especially at the start. </li><li>  Key metrics: <b>RR, LT, DAU / MAU, viewing depth</b> . </li><li>  Decide on the audience of the product and have a clear plan for competition with giants. </li><li>  Remember that the application in the store does not equal the site on the Internet.  And the moderation rules are tough enough, especially in the USA. </li></ul><br>  Read full decoding on <a href="http://goo.gl/xyVV7h">vc.ru.</a> <br>  Subscribe to the <a href="https://www.t.me/epicgrowth">Epic Growth Channel</a> in the Telegram, so as not to miss the interesting content on product marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341826/</a></p>
