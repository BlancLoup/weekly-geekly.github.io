  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile version of Habr</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, citizens.  Less than a <s>year</s> and three years, as we did a lightweight version of Habr (so far in the fashionable beta mode), which is convenient to read from modern mobile devices.  It is located at the addresses <a href="http://m.habr.ru/">m.habr.ru</a> and <a href="http://microhabr.ru/">microhabr.ru</a> , displays all zahabrennye posts and has the following nice features: <br><ul><li>  each page weighs an average of only 5 kilobytes; </li><li>  the complete absence of advertising and unnecessary elements; </li><li>  each page contains 40 links to posts; </li><li>  well displayed on all major mobile platforms; </li></ul><br>  In addition, owners of mobile phones with a hardware keyboard can use the "2" key to go to the main page, and "4" and "6" - to navigate through the pages. <br><br>  Yes, I will note that since the version is all so lightweight and so mobile all the authorization, voting and commenting functions are not available.  That is, it can only be read, which, in fact, from this kind of versions is required.  <b>In addition, I emphasize: this version is not the final release, but only the foundation for the further development of the mobile version of Habr.</b>  <b>Please pay special attention to this fact :)</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further I propose answers (A) to the questions already asked (Q) :) <br><br>  <i>Q: Posts with the main one are good, but where are the contents of the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù tab?</i> <br>  A: We made a lightweight Habr in order not to replace the main version, but to supplement it, and decided that it should contain only what was approved by the community and hit the main page.  Other publications can always be found on the main site.

      <i>Q: Yes, the page weighs only 5 kilos, but after all some posts weigh much more.</i>  <i>How is the savings?</i> <br>  A: We minimized the amount of downloaded data to a reasonable minimum, but we will work in this direction and further, although we can not influence the volume of the content of topics.  Since the bulk of the articles are illustrations, we can recommend to turn off the display of pictures in mobile browsers in order to save traffic in advance, since they all allow you to do this without problems. <br><br>  <i>Q: Why in this version the name of the topic is before the name of the blog, and not vice versa, as in the usual Habr√©?</i> <br>  A: This is done to more conveniently navigate through the list of topics, since on most mobile devices the screen is quite small and can accommodate headers not completely. <br><br>  <i>Q: Why can not login and vote / comment?</i> <br>  A: This version was originally conceived as a universal lightweight, that is, occupying a minimum of volume and providing the main content Habra in read only mode in a single form for most modern mobile phones, smartphones, communicators and netbooks.  Connecting additional functionality will inevitably "make the page" heavier and make it more difficult for various mobile devices and mobile browsers to support. <br><br>  <i>Q: Where did Mikrohabr go?</i> <br>  A: All our experiments with microblogging successfully moved to the growing <a href="http://respectiva.ru/">project "Respect"</a> , and the website <a href="http://microhabr.ru/">microhabr.ru is</a> given entirely to the needs of the mobile version. <br><br>  <i>Q (real!): But this is the usual RSS, I was deceived!</i> <br>  A: RSS readers require aggregators, which, as a rule, are present on mobile devices less frequently than browsers.  However, we do not cancel RSS, and if someone likes it more, we welcome it :) In addition, for political reasons, we cannot yet provide full versions of posts in RSS, unlike m.habr.ru. <br><br>  <i>Q: Improvements are planned?</i> <br>  A: Yes, of course.  What is presented now is the first version made in a couple of days and devoid of some amenities that will be added as soon as they are ready. <br><br>  Well, that seems to be all, use a good health!  Yes, report bugs and suggestions in the comments and / or support@habrahab.ru. <br><br>  UPD: With what we will try to figure out as soon as possible: optimization for the iPhone (now they made a small crutch, it should be better), picture optimization ... <br><br>  <b>Bonus !!! 1:</b> since such a binge went, then I‚Äôll make iPhone and iPod touch owners happy: a standalone client is being prepared for you with the possibility of authorization, commenting and voting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68389/</a></p>
