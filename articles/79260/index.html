Interest was caused, rather, resentment.  Why is computer smarter than me?  And the game.  Playing, making him, computer, do what I want.  You press the button, but he says what is wrong, you correct the mistake, but he says that again it is not so ... And now it started.  And there is no happiness.  You begin to understand ... look for ... You feel yourself as a builder of the world, so it seemed to me then.  It seemed to me that I was creating my universe ... My little world ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Over time, the number of errors decreases, and they are reduced to ‚Äúoops‚Äù and ‚Äútypo‚Äù with different non-normative words in the scm history due to the fact that someone was distracted, or you wanted to sleep.  Did I get frustrated with programming?  Yes and no.  Baby bugs are gone.  Programming turned out to be very simple and very boring, really complex and interesting tasks come across less and less and it was imperceptible to a child who felt like a god, who got confused in the keys and was happy when everything started.  But with age and projects have changed.  Debugging the pet project is not easy, but interesting.  True no responsibility.  And there is no time limit ...

      Whether the work - work.  The project depends on a very large number of third-party projects, varying degrees of openness and friendliness of the community.  Bugs appear in hardware, compilers, environment.  Users appear, responsibility and the first million lines of code.  There is a misunderstanding of how it works ... And there are bugs.  And not just bugs, but bugs in the framework.  Within budgets and deadlines.  And there is a new responsibility, the responsibility to sink, along with myself, with my bugs, not only myself, but a few more people.  Maybe even a dozen.  And if the project is large - then hundreds.  And most of them are your friends, for you spend the whole conscious day with them.  There is a risk that people will be in the labor market if you don't fix this nasty bug, and even those 5 pieces by the end of the week, and if you fix it, there will be bonuses and royalties and covers in magazines and fame and honor.  Or maybe not.  The risk is big, but there is also a place for hope. <br><br>  Every bug is a research.  And the bigger the project, the more entertaining it is.  I think that not so many diplomas are written with the same tension of the mind in universities, honestly, as attempts to catch a bug that is reproduced every first Sunday of the month on one machine out of ten in the cluster ... But the most important thing in bugs is a valuable spiritual experience that most people never received it once in their lives - the programmer saw his mistake.  He confessed it to himself, to others ... And corrected it. <br><br>  Most people live with the thought: ‚ÄúI was mistaken only then, once, and even then, I thought that I was wrong, while in fact, I was right!‚Äù <br><br>  I mean serious mistakes.  When you sincerely believe that you are right, it turns out that it is not.  When you admit to yourself, really that, you get a little bit of enlightenment, and having received it several thousand times, you cease to consider yourself to be something right in general.  And someone's confidence in the rightness causes only laughter.  In the process, you can see how shrewd mosk in an attempt to protect their faith.  Is it possible to get a similar experience in other professions?  Yes.  But in the case of a programmer, this experience is accelerated.  And in programming, when alone, you will be able to find dozens of arguments to disguise your bug as a feature, or why it is not your fault.  And now I myself, with my brain, resist admitting my mistake.  I want to believe in the glitch of the environment or cosmic interference that breaks the bits in the wires ... <br><br>  We can say that this is an act of human self-preservation.  After all, to recognize that your mind chose the erroneous truth - to strike at yourself, at your ‚ÄúI.‚Äù <br><br>  When you take a new bug, it is not in the beginning.  You are looking for bushes, bushes in which there is a rabbit.  You can say that he is here.  Or say what bushes in your clearing it is.  You find him.  You catch  Give me a carrot.  He is soft fluffy.  A man comes up and says that this is not a rabbit, this is a tire that the neighbors' boys threw into the bushes.  What will you tell him?  How do you look at him?  And what will you feel when it turns out, really, that this is a tire from a bicycle, and inside there is an ‚Äúeaten‚Äù carrot, and the delicate fur is just your gloves ... <br><br>  That's exactly the same enlightenment you feel when you understand a bug.  When you find your piece of code, for which you are ready to lay your head, that it is true ... and he ... and it is good that you did not put it ... and you are a burdock ... And here it is, the moment when the value of programming passed for me. <br><br>  <a href="http://catap.ru/blog/2009/12/24/for-that-i-love-programming/">Original</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79260/</a></p>
