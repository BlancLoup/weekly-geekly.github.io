  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 questions to prepare a presentation to investors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having listened to several business presentations from start-ups, I noticed that most people tell too much unnecessary information that could ‚Äúsink‚Äù their project.  They delve into such details of their business that investors are starting to get bored.  No matter how colorfully you present your project, if you do not speak in essence, then the chances for investment are extremely small.  Below are a few mandatory questions that need to be included in the presentation in order to speak only in the case and in the language of investors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b4d/d1e/f5c/b4dd1ef5c2a0e89ecdea010329a9c233.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1) The name of the project and its description.</b>  The ideal description should be short, like a post to Twitter.  Clear and to the point.  After it, you can tell a little more about the essence of the project, but try to keep within 10-15 seconds so that the investor does not lose the essence. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <b>2) The existing problem in the market and your solution.</b>  Determine for yourself: do you think of a problem, because you just like your project.  To understand the need for your service or product, you need to conduct tests and studies in advance.  Investors are not stupid people, and, for sure, will be able to understand what's what. <br><br>  <b>3) Your current results and stage of the project.</b>  In 3-4 sentences, tell us what you have achieved in all the time, focusing on your income (if you don‚Äôt have one yet, then say so).  Do not exaggerate the numbers - in the future this will create only additional problems and bad reputation. <br><br>  <b>4) Market size.</b>  Briefly tell how large the market already exists, and how much you plan to take to a certain time. <br><br>  <b>5) How much do you need, and for what.</b>  Think about what you really need to do business.  If you write that you spend all the money on creating a prototype, advertising and employees, then the chances of getting an investment will disappear.  No one is going to check your idea, create a business for you and, moreover, pay you a salary. <br><br>  <b>6) Financial model.</b>  Here tell us how you are going to make money.  Remember, investments, and especially venture investments, suggest that for every ruble spent by an investor, he will be able to return 10. <br><br>  <b>7) Competitors.</b>  Tell us about 5 - 6 direct and indirect competitors.  Investors need to show that you know who works in the market with the same products as you.  It will be better if you make a comparison table with competitors, explaining why your product is better.  Never say that you are the only ones on the market with a unique product. <br><br>  <b>8) Risks.</b>  Consider all possible risks that may arise in further work.  Write 2-3 major risks in the presentation and tell how you insure yourself if such situations arise.  Be sure that investors will find a couple more points that you have not foreseen.  Do not worry, say that you solve these problems and provide an answer at the next meeting. <br><br>  <b>9) Team.</b>  Honestly tell about the people who are working with you on the project.  Their experience, achievements and shares in the company.  It would be a big plus if you have at least three people in your team. <br><br>  <b>10) Summarize.</b>  Call again your project, development plans and the necessary investments. <br><br>  Your entire presentation should be no more than 5 minutes, so as not to bore investors and focus their attention. <br><br>  <b>Here are also a few tips on how to make your presentation more interesting:</b> <br><br>  1) Do not read on paper.  Practice at home in front of the mirror to speak without papers.  You can make a small speech plan with the main theses and pry into it after.  But remember that with public presentations there is nothing more important than visual contact with investors and the public.  Do not forget to smile too! <br><br>  2) Do not speak abstruse phrases.  Even if you have an innovative business using special terminology, you can always find the right words to make it clear to everyone. <br><br>  3) Do not use such things as ‚Äúwe are the only ones on the market‚Äù, ‚Äúwe are a national product‚Äù, ‚Äúwe have a unique product, there is no such thing yet‚Äù, ‚Äúour product is revolutionary‚Äù, ‚Äúwe have a lot of likes on social networks‚Äù, ‚Äúwe have no competitors "and so on.  Investors hear these words every day, and their mood to your project changes immediately. <br><br>  4) Adequately perceive criticism.  Yes, there will be criticism.  Humble yourself.  There will always be people who will not like your product or service.  The main thing is how you will react to this. <br><br>  5) Try not to put a lot of text on the slide.  Listeners will be too lazy to read the entire text and, certainly, by the end of the presentation they will not remember what was at its beginning.  One or two sentences in large print will be enough. <br><br>  You can also now prepare a presentation of your project and ‚Äúgive it to the mercy of‚Äù the business community.  There are several popular sites where entrepreneurs communicate with each other and help their colleagues find the right solutions.  They will be happy to find all the flaws in your presentation and give advice on how to improve it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296610/</a></p>
