In the article itself and in the comments, many people expressed their wishes for improving the service. <br><br>  Let's observe the work of an ordinary Moscow branch of the bank.  I had to spend about 40 minutes here, but for quite good reason. <br><br>  This is a very tiny Marinoroshchinsky branch with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 20 square meters.  meters with 5 service windows.  Submitted?  There are 2 universal windows for any questions with a common queue, 1 window - only lending and 1 window - cash.  It is not very clear why the cash desk was taken out separately, but there is almost never a queue for it, because most of the payments are accepted in the same universal windows.  I can explain the presence of a special window for loans by the fact that each call to it is a long question and will slow down the queue.  But almost no one ever stands in this window, so it would be quite possible to serve it on other issues.  Well, according to the old Soviet tradition, one window is simply closed - apparently, there are not enough employees.

      In the part of the premises intended for customers there is a table with blanks, 3 chairs for those who are difficult to stand, and a fancy ATM, which is described below.  There is a security guard and 2 female consultants in the room, one of whom is also the head of the department.  The task of consultants is to avoid the occurrence of a queue, because more than 10 people do not fit on such an area. <br><br>  They consult very competently, therefore a person, coming to the window with a question of any complexity, already knows exactly what he needs and how to do it.  For consultants 2 comments.  First, they speak very loudly and prevent others from filling out account numbers or communicating with the operator.  But there is a plus - those who are bored in the queue, sometimes find out useful things for themselves.  And, secondly, some service obtrusiveness is annoying when you are constantly being offered to either get a card or connect a telebank.  This is all, of course, useful, but we must be able to see which clients need it and who do not need it at all.  For example, I receive a salary on a VTB card, and I am persistently offered to open an account in a savings bank almost every time I come here. <br><br>  And now we will watch clients. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A very large percentage of people come to Sberbank to pay a bill or withdraw money (mainly pensions).  Moreover, young people have long and successfully used Internet banking, so the main customers are middle-aged and older. <br><br>  Consultants in the hall with enviable patience are trying to teach these visitors to use an ATM.  But very often it fails.  Standard answers: ‚ÄúI do not trust your equipment‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if money does not reach‚Äù, etc.  All the bones of the ATM interface have already been washed here, but, as you can see, the problem is quite different.  It does not help even the proposal of consultants to help with the payment and the prospect of not standing in line. <br><br>  The second most frequent operation is to check the balance in the ... passbook.  Yes, the majority of pensioners do not want to get themselves an incomprehensible plastic card - ‚Äúpaper is more reliable‚Äù.  I, too, was forced to start a passbook for a kindergarten - such is the requirement.  However, you can issue a free Maestro card to the account on the booklet, which will allow you to carry out all operations at an ATM.  But here, customers prefer the old proven way to stand in line.  Although, some people dare and fearlessly go to the ATM. <br><br>  The ATM in the branch is very advanced - it allows not only to withdraw and credit cash, but also can read bar codes from various receipts and is not inferior in functionality to payment terminals. <br><br>  And separately I want to say about the staff.  Most of them are true professionals in their field.  Now Sberbank began to hire young operators, but they are quickly mastered.  Young people, having worked quite a bit, are not inferior in speed of service to employees with years of experience.  Another thing is that they have to manually drive in thousands of accounts per day, and here, of course, something needs to be changed.  Leonid Kaganov mocked him in his time: <br><br><blockquote>  Director of the provider company <br>  District Southern Chertanovo Moscow <br>  from Kaganov Leonid Aleksandrovich <br><br>  STATEMENT <br><br>  I, Kaganov Leonid Alexandrovich, personal account 771534525261, personal account login adsl-771534525261, IP 215.79.121.14, issued November 26, 2008 at 14:21:01, using the ASUS EEE-701 laptop serial number AX123-13284, MAC address 0051EB2DA168, purchased at M-Dietrix on 04/11/2008, I ask you to allow me (once, repeatedly, in transit - underline the necessary) in the period from 11/26/2008 to 12/26/2008 to visit the site razgovor.org, IP 66.242.20.102, issued on 27.05.2007 in 12:01:23 on 05/27/2010 12:01:23.  I have read the rules for visiting Internet sites. <br></blockquote><br><br>  But as far as I know, this is a problem for almost any bank. <br><br>  Summarizing, I can say the following: <br><ul><li>  Sberbank is really trying to improve the service, and this is evident to all.  It may be inept, but for such a monster it is already quite good. </li><li>  Yes, this is only the beginning of the road, and in almost all directions there is no end of work. </li><li>  A very big problem to be solved by the bank is to overcome people's distrust.  Moreover, it is not even a fear of some technological innovations, but a constant implicit consciousness that they want to deceive you.  I don‚Äôt know since when it‚Äôs coming ‚Äî from the dashing nineties or from the Soviet era, but this is a common feature of our people.  I think that this will not change in one year. </li><li>  Well and, probably, you should not even remind about the inadmissibility of rude treatment of clients.  Fortunately, it is gradually becoming a thing of the past. </li></ul><br>  I want to wish Sberbank prosperity.  Be open, work hard on mistakes, listen to people's opinions, and this will lead you to success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114283/</a></p>
