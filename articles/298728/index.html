In both cases, the strategy was based on the initial limitation of the availability of the album at a low purchase price, with a simultaneous surge of ‚Äúpirated‚Äù activity on trackers and streaming services, such as Vkontakte. <br><br>  Right now we can watch how this turns one of the most ingenious, in marketing their own creativity, of course, musicians in the States - Kanye West.

      West has many well-known advantages, as well as shortcomings, the purpose of this note is not to discuss him as a person, but to consider the actions he is doing right now, multiplying the conversion of listeners of the last released album, simultaneously with the increase in the number of Tidal streaming subscribers, not so long ago <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcYYGdcLbFkw">with pomp running</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that the new album ‚ÄúThe Life of Pablo‚Äù of the mentioned musician is <i>officially</i> available for listening only in Tidal.  What, of course, Kanye did not fail to say, accompanying his own words of various kinds with ‚Äúbikes‚Äù, which effectively raise the noise: <twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1553168811451554466="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  My album will never never be on Apple.  You can only get it on Tidal. </p>  - KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699376240709402624">February 15, 2016</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  It was not enough for him to humiliate many former colleagues with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest">mockery</a> on Soundcloud on the eve of the release of the album - the release of the disc took several hours, which Kanye spent with his friends at the closed stadium, listening to music in some similarity of fashionable and musical performance. <br><br>  At the same time, the official representative of the recording label immediately corrected the rapper's words - the album will be available exclusively on Tidal only until next week.  A little later, Kanye corrected his own words: <twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-2" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1553168811451554466="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Please for all music lovers.

Because he is the Walt Disney of his generation.  In general, absolutely nothing unusual for West: <twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-3" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1553168811451554466="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Mark Zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West ideas </p>  - KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698926987281371136">February 14, 2016</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-4" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1553168811451554466="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Thank you for signing up to Tidal.

But because of an error with the ability to download the album (initially it could be done on the Kanye website, but the link <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/tidal-screws-up-release-kanye-west-new-album-2016-2">quickly disappeared</a> , leaving many unhappy) and the inability to do this in Tidal literally a few hours later he was on the trackers, where he began to diverge from the siders with a fantastic activity.  Yesterday the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35587381">reported</a> a minimum of 500,000 downloads on trackers, and the RIAA has already sent 20 applications for deletion. <br><br>  TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/kanye-wests-the-life-of-pablo-piracy-160216/%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2BTorrentfreak%2B%2528Torrentfreak%2529">reports</a> that at the same time he observed the appearance of about 10,000 distributions of the album, which has never happened before. <br><br>  So Kanye is picking up his ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù, who will talk about these songs at the time of their classic release on iTunes, which cannot but happen.  At the same time, we observe approximately the same set of parameters. <br><br>  Radiohead distributed its own albums on the ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù model and collected a huge cashier: In 2007, in 2007, she made $ 3 million in direct sales on the site, after the classic release headed the UK Album Chart and US Billboard 200. <br><br>  Nine Inch Nails in 2008 offered different versions of the album to listeners: from free (9 tracks) to the most expensive and full Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition for $ 300.  All 2500 copies of the limited edition were sold out on the very first day - the company earned $ 1.5 million for them, and the group's website rested for a while. <br><br>  Both events were accompanied by frantic torrent activity.  And Kanye helps his own businessman friend and the most well-to-do musician in the US raise Tidal's capitalization, which didn‚Äôt cause much optimism after the start - Tidal is available in two versions, for $ 10 and $ 30, which remotely resembles the option of selling Radiohead and NIN records. <br><br>  <i>Gee, Gees * (from "Grand" - "one thousand") - slang "money", "grandmother";</i>  <i>often used in rap terms, showing the financial superiority of the subject.</i> <br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-5" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1553168811451554466="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Mark Zuckerberg I know if you can call me by 2mrw ... </p>  - KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699106758816632832">February 15, 2016</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298728/</a></p>
