A good idea, like wizards, is never late.  However, it does not come early.  She comes exactly when necessary.  That is, during the meal. <br>  That is how the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dachi304/" class="user_link">dachi304</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jimlet/" class="user_link">jimlet habrausers</a> came to us, with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplaying with letters, words, languages ‚Äã‚Äãand brains.  I came seasoned with burgers, America 2350x and cats in a good mood. <br>  If the story has intrigued you, if you want to remember all the words ever read and just have a good time playing with friends and other good people - if you please, under the cat. <br>  So‚Ä¶ <br>  In the beginning was the Word. <br>  And the word was ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  CAKE </h1><br><br>  Bake Fake Cake. <br>  Whole three words. <br>  The company, who was sitting at the table, became thoughtful as she finished her burgers. <br><br>  On the musical apparatus (I mean, the Jukebox-e), descended as if from past films, there were only 10 letters.  So began the game.  First offline tournament.  The food was put aside, the pancakes were not roasted yet, and the notebook slowly but surely filled with new and new words. <br>  Every few <s>tens of</s> minutes there was a pause and a phrase in the spirit of ‚ÄúTwenty-six is ‚Äã‚Äãthe limit for 10 letters.‚Äù After that, the game continued on. <br>  The waiter, who ran past here and there, often looked with interest and wanted to join the camp.  But - the service!  But now he can always play ... But more on that later.  Having guessed everything that could be guessed for dinner, and having caught fire from ideas (and hot sauce), the company moved in unison to design, code, create!

At this stage - only English.  Of these, at least two vowels.  That's more interesting. <br>  From these letters you can make words.  Some words make more, some less - you never know. <br>  Who will make more words - the winner. <br>  Who is less - runs for the dictionary. <br>  You can play alone, you can in the company. <br>  For the company, we have provided several modes at once: <br><ul><li>  Long-suffering hotsit (in development) [oldfazhno] </li><li>  Private game (by invite code) </li><li>  All-User Championship </li></ul><br>  Their duration is limited to 60 minutes, after which a new round begins, with new letters.  In a single game, you can train your memory forever.  By the way, saving works for us, so really - forever *. <br><h6>  * Under the condition that you are a supergalactic energy entity. </h6><br>  At the moment, there is support only for the English language, in the process - the preparation of an adequate dictionary for Russian.  In theory - support for major European languages. <br><br>  But this article would not be a Habr if it were not for our <s>suffering</s> efforts over the code. <br><h4>  How was it created? </h4><br><blockquote>  From what, from what, from what <br>  Made our boys? </blockquote><br><br>  At the heart of everything is the Java EE platform, and not simple - but the seventh version.  For the user interface, we used the now so popular AngularJS.  The project revolves on open source GlassFish 4. As a transport medium, the mechanism of web sockets is finally used, which is standardized for JavaEE, which, unfortunately, can create some difficulties for users who are still sitting under outdated versions of proxy servers and browsers.  Update more! <br>  But the authorization is temporarily through Persona from the corporation that gave us the chanterelle browser.  It performs its functions well, but we will probably change it. <br><br><h4>  And what next? </h4><br><br>  Next - <a href="http://lettered.me/">play</a> ! <br><br>  And we - let's go code.  After all, we still have so much for you! <br>  In addition to mobile applications, we implement the following: <br><ul><li>  Great application design </li><li>  Keyboard input </li><li>  Alternative Authorization </li><li>  Game Statistics </li><li>  Player Profiles </li><li>  Integration with social networks </li><li>  And everything else.. </li></ul><br><br>  By the way, our team of enthusiasts will be glad to other enthusiasts who may want to join the development.  Programmers, designers, sponsors - everyone will be happy!  Reviews, comments, bug reports too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/21f/cbb/364/21fcbb36434f3005147233b33d605144.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS the author of a wonderful photo with a cat - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ronxoane/4965283882/">RAM√ìN ESPELT</a> <br>  PPS And in distant plans there is a true offline version. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192070/</a></p>
