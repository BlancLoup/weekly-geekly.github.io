Not so long ago, CLRium # 2 was completed in Moscow, which brought together quite a few - <b>380 developers</b> , which is 3.8 times more than last year!  For me, this is a big victory: it means that last year everyone enjoyed it, and in this we made great topics for reports.  About how everything went and what conclusions I drew before the St. Petersburg conference I want to tell in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b61/684/56b/b6168456be054aaeb06fdbb927e451fb.jpg"><br><br>  But for starters, I would like to say that despite the fact that there were overlays, it seemed to me that, on the whole, everything went perfectly, for the most part people liked it, and the reports turned out so cool that I decided for myself that there was a reason to visit something else half a year left for me.  But first things first.

      Immediately links to the <a href="http://clrium.ru/">event website</a> and <a href="https://vk.com/album-91247740_213778032">photos of the Moscow meeting</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfb/9c2/07e/bfb9c207eba646729044ab7bed7f5c91.jpg"><br><br><h1>  <b>About jambs</b> </h1><br>  Actually, there were only two punctures on our side: <br><br><h5>  <b>Broadcast</b> </h5><br>  The biggest overlay was the broadcast.  But, as far as I know, with the broadcast always and at all overlays.  But we could still avoid them.  We were going to FRIA City Hall, which is famous for its most powerful Wi-Fi.  However, having gotten used to the fact that wi-fi, regardless of laudatory speeches of various landlords in his direction, constantly strives to fall off, the operator asked to put the laptop from which the broadcast to the wire went.  That was the mistake: the first 20 minutes, the audience watched from time to time falling off the broadcast channel.  We guessed to outweigh the wi-fi, we did not immediately, but as soon as we guessed, all the problems disappeared. <br><br><h5>  <b>The laptop did not fit</b> </h5><br>  The second problem we encountered was that the speaker Pavel Avsenin suddenly had no laptop.  Well, yes, one of Asus‚Äôs latest laptops (I don‚Äôt mention them at all, most likely by surprise) couldn‚Äôt spill a picture from the screen into HDMI.  And so I had to urgently set up the environment on my personal laptop, and give it to Paul.  As a result - I lost the feedback from the Internet visitors. <br><br>  The rest is just a positive experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/172/106/6fc172106d69441f89a4e2841178310f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  <b>About reports</b> </h1><br>  Andrey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin gave a truly cool talk in which he spent three hours telling us about CoreCLR internals, RyuJIT bugs, CLR desktop bugs and the new ASP.NET And the report turned out to be the coolest not because he well from innovations, and scolded MS far and wide.  And he scolded the cause!  Three hours of feyspalma.  I am sure that you would not hear such a thing anywhere.  After each performance, the visitors did not release it all the time off - and in a direct dialogue it was possible to pick up no less interesting information. <br><br>  Pavel <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pavsenin/" class="user_link">pavsenin</a> Avsenin came out on the second day of the seminar and made a memory profiler for us no less heroically from complete scratch.  This may seem like a lot of toys to many, but the ability to write the core of such a profiler and programmatically search for leaks, knowing the structure of the application, is a super tool for a true professional. <br><br>  I chose three topics to speak at once.  First, it was Shared Objects (objects that exist simultaneously, physically, in several applications at once).  I was scolded for him that he said too quickly and as a result - not everyone understood how it works.  I will definitely correct and Peter and Yekaterinburg will work a deeper report.  The second report was ‚ÄúClone Flows‚Äù.  This report is my pride.  Not even the report itself, but the project itself.  After all, I dreamed of realizing it about 10 years ago.  But just now, having gained experience, I was able to do it.  He was not in the announcement and told him only because at the end of the first day, when he asked the audience if they had read my article about it, I learned that there wasn‚Äôt.  To some extent it was a mistake to tell about him, because  Because of further problems with the laptop, Pavel did not leave time for a big report on Roslyn, which made it a bit shorter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/773/f02/cf6773f021314e7094b21fe7c3f14cb5.jpg"><br><br><h1>  <b>findings</b> </h1><br>  What conclusions did I draw from this?  Of course, take into account the blunders and make in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg better and cleaner.  And secondly, after reading the reviews, I realized that I was afraid to read them in vain: people were very pleased with the time spent, which means that the CLRium # 3 will be! <br><br>  By the way, we received the Startup package on <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/braingems/">megamozg.ru</a> from Habrahabra.  And that means, we will be laid out there, telling how we are doing our conferences.  You may well want us to help you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59c/043/e68/59c043e68fde4c1dbcd3a04fafd1b0cd.jpg"><br><br><h1>  <b>Announcement of conferences in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg</b> </h1><br>  May 17 - in Yekaterinburg and May 29-30 - a series of <a href="http://clrium.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrup%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">CLRium</a> seminars will take place in St. Petersburg <a href="http://clrium.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrup%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">.</a> This means that very soon our hall, provided <a href="http://luxoft.com/">by Luxoft</a> , will be ready to host almost <b>300 interested developers</b> .  Also appeared payment in <b>PayPal</b> ! <br><br><h4>  Andrey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin </h4><br>  <b>CoreCLR, RuyJIT, ASP.NET, DNX</b> <br><ul><li>  Let's talk about the new .NET core CoreRR and the future of the .NET platform. </li><li>  Let's collect CoreCLR under Windows and Linux, and also talk about the new cross-platform .NET-world. </li><li>  Consider the insides CLR, available to us on the source code, we build in the core of its functionality. </li><li>  Let's talk about the features of the new RyuJIT and what its use will give us (for example, SIMD and accelerated JIT compilation). </li><li>  Let's look at JIT-bugs for various processor architectures. </li><li>  Take a look at the latest ASP.NET 5 and DNX execution system. </li><li>  Let's run an ASP.NET site under Linux. </li></ul><br><h4>  Pavel <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pavsenin/" class="user_link">pavsenin</a> Avsenin </h4><br>  <b>Code Coverage in .NET</b> <br>  It is always interesting to learn a lot of details about the work of viscera from professionals.  From those who do it daily, for whom it is work.  From DevExpress‚Äôs CodeRush product developers, we‚Äôll learn: <br><ul><li>  what is the code coverage, how is it counted and how do the tools that consider it work </li><li>  write from scratch your simple tool that will be able to read code coverage by methods </li><li>  in the process of writing we will get to know the Profiling API and the amazing things that it allows us to do with applications running under CLR control </li><li>  let's touch the COM and ATL technologies needed to work with the Profiling API </li><li>  rummage through the insides of the body of the method, learn in detail how it looks, including the analysis of the header and the SEH tables </li><li>  learn how to replace the body of the method on the fly, during the execution of the program! </li></ul><br><h4>  Stanislav Sidristij Sidristy </h4><br>  <b>The magic of working with types, CoreFx, Roslyn</b> <br><ul><li>  How to adjust the fastest interaction between applications - SharedMemory - without serialization of reference types?  As a result, the resulting code will be limited to one limitation - the switching time between application threads. </li><li>  We forward the object and everything that it points to in the sandbox, bypassing all security barriers in .NET so that the sandbox could not take advantage of the opportunity and break the defense </li><li>  Consider options to leave the sandbox on a pair of CLR cores already closed. </li><li>  We will learn how to make extensions for MS Visual Studio 2015, embedding various code refactorings and analyzers for work tasks: real examples from our own experience </li><li>  As soon as we review them, we will review the existing metrics on Roslyn.  How they are written, how code metrics are built. </li><li>  Next, we will write not just count the number of letters "a" in all the words of the source texts, we will write support for C # <b>tuples</b> , thereby showing how easy Microsoft will expand the language in the future: we have a happy future !! </li></ul><br><br>  Price - 2,000 rubles.  The same amount you leave in the store, if almost nothing to buy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/787/21a/6e978721a17f4a79a43c9ad6145a7699.png" alt="cool">  I hope the <a href="http://clrium.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrup%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">program</a> turned out as tasty as possible.  <a href="http://clrium.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrdn%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Register!</a> <br><habracut text=""><br>  <b>Contacts:</b> <br><ul><li>  Stanislav Sidristy </li><li><a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/422/b50/1e2/422b501e24537ac09fe28155426deac4.gif"></a>  <a href="">sunex.development@gmail.com</a> </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f59/7c7/12c/f597c712c0e4233560e5a8da188022b9.png">  +7 (921) 948-16-08 </li></ul></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256201/</a></p>
