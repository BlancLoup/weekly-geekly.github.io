  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Poll on how to be copyrighted</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's imagine that the habrasoobshchestvu entrusted to decide what should be the law on copyright.  Not in a particular country, but in general.  Opinions on this matter are very different, and I tried to put the questions in such a way as to cover at least in general terms all possible options.  Speech in all questions is only about products and works protected by copyright: music, movies, books, games, programs.  It will be interesting to see the big picture. <br><br>  On Habr√© there were already similar polls, but either the post itself, apart from the survey, included some (usually extreme) opinion of the author, so the post quickly went to otgabrennye and as a result there were very few voters, or the wording was inaccurate, so the results are not too reliable. <br><br>  After consulting with colleagues on copyright discussions, I compiled 7 questions.  Those wishing to participate - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the beginning I put the shortest general question, whether you are satisfied with the current state of the laws. 
      <br>

      Further, since the main difference in opinion is the term of copyright protection, there are two questions about deadlines, separately for commercial and non-commercial use.  Of course, the program and the film are very different things, but I decided to concentrate on the commercial component.  If you are learning Photoshop - this is a non-commercial use.  If you edit them photos, which then sell - commercial.  If you are watching a movie or listening to music, this is a non-commercial use.  If you use music in your movie that sells - commercial. <br><br>  Often the opinion is expressed that attitudes towards copyright may differ significantly from the authors and the public (users).  Moreover, between groups of those authors whose income depends on copyright, and accordingly does not.  Therefore, I decided to make an additional 3 separate similar questions: <br><br><ul><li>  The question for copyright holders and authors, who even if they sold exclusive rights to their work, can still make a profit from sales.  In addition, if the author distributes his works for free, but has all the rights to them, he is also in this group. </li><li>  The question is for the authors - employees who work on request, receive money under the contract, or a salary that is completely independent of the results of the process. </li><li>  The question is for those who are not involved in the creation of works and products protected by copyright. </li></ul><br>  Of course, there is no clear separation between the first two categories.  Perhaps you get a salary for programming, and 5 years ago you wrote a book that you still sell as the copyright holder.  I think each author will be able to decide for himself which of the two polls he will take part in, or both at once. <br><br>  In conclusion, those who are interested will be able to indicate which other proposals related to copyright they support.  Many of them are controversial, and can cause big problems in implementation, however, they still have a lot of followers. <br><br>  Despite the complexity and topicality of the problem, the opinion was repeatedly expressed that there must be some kind of solution that will suit everyone, which may not yet have been found, but it must be there.  Therefore, I have included this item in the list.  So, the poll: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169177/</a></p>
