      remember Phileas Fogg, and one of his quotes <br><blockquote>  Use what is at hand, and do not look for another.  (16 series, "In New Orleans") </blockquote><br><br>  and here I remember that I have a raspberry pi;) <br>  and it can be used instead of a large computer! <br>  and this is a full-fledged Linux comp! <br><br>  here is our hero on duty <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c08/caa/4c3/c08caa4c3cfefb06470d99521a92905a.jpg"><br><br>  that PI is very convenient, so that it ceases to be a media player (raspbnc) and just become Linux (raspbian) <br>  just change the SD card (good enough of this good, and 2 gig for his eyes) <br><br>  those.  according to the instructions from the site we put on the card Rasbian, we connect to the TV, configurable (without graphics) <br>  disconnect from the TV, all other actions are done by ssh, <br><br>  since the time that it is all going to work is not known, we will assume that everything is bad, and write to an external USB flash drive <br><br>  there is no internet on the shelf! <br>  well, let it stand autonomously, we will sometimes pull out the flash drive and see what happens. <br>  those.  you need to configure everything in advance and make this thing as autonomous as possible <br><br>  Next, we are looking for a package that can take screenshots from the webcam <br>  we find <a href="http://www.firestorm.cx/fswebcam/">fswebcam</a> , set it from the repository, check it, it works! <br><br>  Further we write a script that starts from the crown 1 time per minute! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">script which we pull from do.sh crown</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/bin/sh path='/mnt' killall blink1.sh &gt;/dev/null sudo sh -c 'echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' if [ -c /dev/video0 ] then fswebcam -q -c /home/pi/plant/config.cfg --flip v $path/plant/`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S.jpg` fi sudo sh -c 'echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' /home/pi/plant/blink1.sh &amp; sync</span></span></code> </pre> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">script that blinks light blink1.sh</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/bin/sh sudo sh -c 'echo none &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger' n=1 while test $n -le 30 do sudo sh -c 'echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.5 sudo sh -c 'echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.5 n=$(($n + 1)) done n=1 while test $n -le 15 do sudo sh -c 'echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.25 sudo sh -c 'echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.25 sudo sh -c 'echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.25 sudo sh -c 'echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness' sleep 0.25 n=$(($n + 1)) done</span></span></code> </pre><br></div></div><br><br>  the main script itself switches the light bulb to the user control mode (by default it flashes when accessing the flash drive, we use it as an indicator) <br>  then he takes a photo of our plant <br>  and then it causes a script that flashes a light bulb <br><br>  script - a clean flasher, for the convenience of the user <br>  30 seconds with a frequency of 1 per second <br>  15 seconds with a frequency of 2 times per second <br>  and then goes out <br>  This script is guaranteed to work &lt;60 seconds, it is restarted from the main script once a minute. <br><br>  on the indicator you can see in what condition PI is now (and when finally the flash drive can be temporarily pulled out) <br><br>  left a trifle <br>  the shelf was made from the waste of the game Carcassonne (there were cardboard sheets with holes left) <br>  which were collected with the help of scotch tape in enough for our task a strong shelf <br>  and on it was built a place where the object will stand, and where to mount the camera! <br><br>  ropes of the required length were made of threads, and this is all hung on the window! <br><br>  it looks like it all <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/626/578/4d1/6265784d16bcf29a634aaf63de6da2f0.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the "subject table" larger <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/196/460/dde/196460ddef5746c79ae0cd5ead428ca9.jpg"><br><br>  it was all left for a few days, turned on a light bulb at night ... <br><br><h4>  final processing </h4><br><br>  at the end of the process received a folder with a bunch of photos, <br>  selected the desired range <br><br>  and apply magic ffmpeg (now known as avconv) <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">avconv -f image2 -r 30 -i src/f%04d.jpg -c:v libx264 -r 30 out2.mp4</code> </pre><br><br>  This magic script takes files with the names f0001.jpg and further from the src folder and makes a .mp4 file with a frequency of 30 frames per second. <br>  Files from the form YYYYMMDD-HHMM.jpg in fNNNNN.jpg rename the simplest script, here it is not very interesting. <br><br>  Well, in the end, that's what happened <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKYASy7GNZ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGFAX5d6jzP99eGbag5aHnuLsLtw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-8d4WowNvA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhhPWQzQeVv3ImwDJiszfNv4oUaOgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  difficulties and conclusions </h4><br><br>  what was not thought at the beginning, <br><br>  For a strange reason, the PI webcam did not want to shoot 640x480 frames, only 320x200, maybe there is little power? <br>  Without an LED flasher it was not clear whether it works! <br>  I highly recommend doing the work indicator <br>  the plant eventually got out of the frame, it is necessary to study the issue in advance and make the appropriate equipment <br>  the sun is very VERY bright, the camera is wedging;) <br><br>  for good it would be necessary to take a normal camera <br>  correct constant lighting <br>  put the right sprout <br>  to mount correctly (add music) <br><br>  but also what came out very informative! <br>  growth goes at night! <br><br>  Raspberry PI is very handy thing for home toys! <br><br>  ps about errors please start in PM! <br>  pps ask questions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180227/</a></p>
