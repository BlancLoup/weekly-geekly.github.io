However, the modern Android device does not necessarily require the presence of accessories and can act as a stand-alone assistant for leading an active lifestyle.  Suppose if you do ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/764/53e/2ca76453e8054624d21a12414c4cbc39.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  ... parachuting </h4><br><br>  Forced landing or landing (landing) with a parachute after an airplane accident may occur in a deserted area, away from populated areas.  If you are lucky and your Android is <s>not dead,</s> survived the landing (landing), an excellent choice could be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.SpecialBooks.military.AOTSSDEYWGXEAFMOJ">"Memo on survival"</a> <br><br>  Surprisingly, the appendix is ‚Äã‚Äãjust a scanned sheets of the ‚ÄúFlight Records for the Flight Crew‚Äù of the 1988 edition. Trite?  Yes.  The chances that a similar book is preloaded in your favorite reader are minimal.  In addition, it is an excellent means of boredom in public transport.  But if instead of parachuting you do ... <br><br><h4>  ... cycling </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b09/1e3/6b6/b091e36b6772a0b6576a3df98d9626ab.png"><br><br>  The free program <a href="http://goo.gl/xnDBL">Move</a> can be useful <a href="http://goo.gl/xnDBL">!</a>  <a href="http://goo.gl/xnDBL">Bike Computer</a> , <br>  It combines the capabilities of a GPS logger and a bike computer, displaying various characteristics - speed of movement, average speed, operating time since launch, distance traveled, and number of visible GPS satellites.  From the program menu, you can enable GPS track maintenance, and in the settings, specify the sensitivity threshold for movement when calculating the distance. <br><br>  But if you prefer to take up instead of a bicycle ... <br><br><h4>  ... walks in the fresh air </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/675/6a9/2ec/6756a92ec6c3333ab25fa846761cc347.png"><br><br>  First of all, you will need a compass application, for example, <a href="http://goo.gl/0meYG">Compass,</a> which can display the north direction on the screen using a magnetic compass (if such a function is provided in your Android device), and using GPS. <br>  The program is integrated with the popular Catch Notes application, so you can directly fix the coordinates, altitude, direction, current address and speed in your notes directly from it.  If the compass shows incorrect data, it must be calibrated: to do this, you need to describe the device in the air in the air within a few seconds. <br>  You can turn on the orientation to the real north, choose the strength of the noise filter and the type of sensor.  There is also a choice of units of measurement and themes for design - from the stylized antique to the night mode.  However, the choice of compass software is very large, there are even 3D compasses operating on the principle of augmented reality, for example <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.a0soft.gphone.aCompass">3D Compass (AR Compass)</a> . <br>  Is walking too slow?  Then for sure you prefer to do ... <br><br><h4>  ... running sports </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c88/e72/cf8/c88e72cf87bed6a39d79a14204a3559a.png"><br><br>  The leader among the applications "for running" - this is certainly <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.fitnesskeeper.runkeeper.pro">RunKeeper</a> .  Back in 2012, included in the list of the best programs of the "dark side of the force" AppStore, for the year it gained popularity and Android users (the number of users who used the Android version of RunKeeper reached already 14 million).  The program‚Äôs capabilities are multifaceted: it is mandatory data synchronization with the web version of the service, the ability to specify the type of activity (from running to cross country skiing itself), training mode, remembering and different types of target routes, integration with third-party applications, voice prompts, the ability to share achievements with friends and much more. <br>  A good application also offers the sports brand Adidas - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.adidas.micoach">miCoach</a> .  It is compatible with Adidas brand accessories, but it works without them.  There are voice prompts, running schedules, route tracking, synchronization. <br>  However, if you prefer ... <br><br><h4>  ... run from zombies </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/711/d73/880/711d738803f82d55707e375d0393c275.png"><br><br>  Do not miss the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sixtostart.zombiesrun">Zombies, Run!</a>  - this is both a tracker and a game.  Unfortunately, the program is available only in English, but nevertheless it is capable of turning a run into an exciting adventure with audio history and quests. <br>  By the way, Habrahabr recently had an article about the design of a similar project, perhaps soon we will have a competitor waiting for this unusual tracker, where you can play for both people and the opposite side. <br>  Who does not like to run, can work out ... <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¶ in the gym </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/064/3f9/f13/0643f9f139f964f9943bb8d4265c7c57.png"><br><br>  For starters, you can determine the percentage of body fat using the three-point Jackson-Pollock method using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dm2m.bc">Body Control</a> .  I am not going to judge how accurate this method is, but according to the results of the test, I clearly need to go to the gym and eat less sweet. <br><br>  But the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.training.programs">application</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3DmyApp.trainingdiary">for logging</a> workouts in the gym, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.superphunlabs.pushups">swing press</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hippoapp.pushup">pushups,</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sappadev.sappasportlog">perhaps even more</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.proshik.android.gymtoday">than we would like</a> .  Alas, after trying to test a few of them, I couldn‚Äôt choose a ‚Äúleader‚Äù - the pretensification after each is subjectively the same.  Probably, <i>specially trained people are</i> necessary for full comparison. <br>  I prefer classes more ... <br><br><h4>  ... skiing </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3cb/5b8/471/3cb5b847179e5cf47d879de88c021d87.png"><br><br>  Depending on the <s>coolness of</s> forethought of the ski resort, which you are going to visit, you can find branded applications on Google Play with maps of the slopes and the ability to check your ski-pass data (ski pass).  The popular Ukrainian ski resort <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dua.kiev.generalyuk.Bukovel">Bukovel</a> has already received such an application.  In addition to data on the slopes and lifts, local weather forecast is also available. <br>  If you prefer the Alps, then try the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.alpinereplay.android">AlpineReplay Ski &amp; Snowboard</a> app.  It was with the help of this program that I found out at what speed the non-fixed mounting of my left ski decided to unfasten - 80 km / h.  And the real-time log with the display of my ‚Äústopping distance‚Äù <s>with the nose</s> in the prone position, my friends and I revised more than once or twice. <br>  And if the skis are not extreme enough, perhaps you are doing ... <br><br><h4>  ... tricks on snowboarding or BMX </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c70/fa5/711/c70fa57118ff05cec7ff58783fb41067.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.whitescape.ride_allinone">iRide</a> , as stated by the authors of the application, is the largest in Russia free base of tricks for mountain biking, BMX and snowboarding.  The program has a decidedly excellent reputation (4.9 points out of 5) and it is actively developing.  We must take! <br>  If you prefer a fight, try the app to practice ... <br><br><h4>  ... boxing </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfb/063/652/bfb063652dfd77b50e836befe5aaaaeb.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dhu.android.TrainHard">Boxing timer</a> is a convenient timer for boxing training, simple and effective. <br>  And what if you prefer ... <br><br><h4>  ... another sport </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69a/4b4/331/69a4b4331992a95fa222a1c17f85e2f4.jpg"><br><br>  I am sure there is an application for him!  A small sample of applications has shown that, fortunately, there is no shortage of fully functional applications for sports and just for an active lifestyle.  The only obstacle can be perhaps the battery life of the gadget, but in this case there are many ways out of the deplorable situation.  With the close integration of applications and web versions of services, you will always be aware of the situation.  And what could be nicer than observing ever-increasing success rates? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169535/</a></p>
