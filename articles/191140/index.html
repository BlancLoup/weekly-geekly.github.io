Alarm clock, the road to the office or to the workplace of a freelancer.  Routine duties and new projects, tasks, orders.  Breaks for a smoke, lunch, drink, chat on Skype and VKontakte.  Evening, way home, shop, dinner or movie, beer or TV, wife, children, ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù.  Computer or tablet, the same VKontakte, classmates, zheshechechka.  Fresh series of the next series, sleep.  So lives the majority, including me.  In our life there is a place only for work, family and entertainment.  We are looking for entertainment, they help us not to think, relax, distract.  Civilization of egoism.  "You deserve it."  "Treat yourself".  "And let the whole world wait".  I do not know about you, but I increasingly have a feeling of uselessness, meaninglessness of the life being lived.  No, of course, everyone finds the meaning of life: taking care of parents, wives, husbands, children, self-realization, becoming a boss, emigrating ... But man is a social animal.  It is thanks to the interrelations that we build and support with other people that the human community is capable of everything that it is capable of.  As all sorts of abominations, and the greatest achievements and achievements.  And the ability to unite efforts for a good cause, for the sake of help, is our most important advantage.  After all, none of us are immune from misfortune (pah-pah-pah!).  You can only rely on yourself and your family, but every day many people are confronted with such trials and hardships that they cannot cope with on their own.  Why am I leading all this?  In addition, there are quite a few people among us who find time, energy, and means to not only get something from this life, but also give others.  I'm talking about charity.  Each with this word has its own associations, but today I want to talk not about charity as such, but about charitable projects in Runet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Probably, there is no other technology that would give a greater impetus to the development of charity than information networks.  With the spread of the Internet, there are more and more new initiatives to organize assistance to the sick and needy, people and animals.  And what is gratifying is, basically, these are not one-off PR actions of different companies, but communities of really enthusiastic people who are trying to improve this world a little bit.  Let me tell you about several charitable Internet projects in RuNet that stand out from the crowd: some of you may want to take part in the event and help someone, not just like or ‚Äúsend rays of goodness‚Äù.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, charity projects need such types of assistance as: <br><ul><li>  monetary donations, both for the project as a whole and for individual people or animals; </li><li>  assistance in organizing and conducting various events; </li><li>  volunteer assistance in any activities carried out by charity projects. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  People </h4><br><h5>  1000 hearts </h5><br>  <a href="http://1000serdec.ru/">Action</a> to raise funds for targeted treatment of children, organized by the charity foundation "Life Line".  Quite a rare case of "non-protocol" design of a charity project site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a8/669/287/0a8669287725445873a7a69aad0b7b3f.jpg">

      The collection of help is organized on this site in an original way: every child who needs help is presented in the form of a virtual ‚Äútree‚Äù.  You can leave a wish for the child on the virtual ‚Äúleaf‚Äù of this tree.  To get the "leaf" you need to make money: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c94/84f/fbd/c9484ffbd142f69bdbb53116b54796a1.jpg"><br><br>  An interesting idea, implemented conveniently and clearly.  You can look at each ‚Äútree‚Äù in detail, read the description of the child‚Äôs problem and the wishes left on all the leaves of the ‚Äútree‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/8f1/41e/1c68f141eb5cd5138c29dae4ac284b2c.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Welcome Mail.ru </h5><br>  The recently launched portal is a <a href="http://dobro.mail.ru/">platform</a> for hosting charity projects.  This is not a specific foundation, it is a meeting place for those who want to help someone: for organizers and volunteers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/254/a52/95c/254a5295ca1b4ebe2e6b923041bfef19.jpg"><br><br>  You can either create your own project to raise funds or attract assistants, or simply provide all possible assistance to published projects with your wallet or presence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9dd/709/ba4/9dd709ba40a2941f0771d00d8e602744.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the site is made in the traditional style for Mail.ru, well thought out, clearly and simply implemented the choice of parameters by which you will be offered projects for help: <br><ul><li>  city, </li><li>  Help topics: </li><li>  <i>For children</i> </li><li>  <i>For adults</i> </li><li>  <i>The elderly</i> </li><li>  <i>Animals</i> </li><li>  <i>Nature</i> </li><li>  how do you want to help (in money; deed; and in both) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa5/4b1/e23/aa54b1e23e10276d01fac01b83e01588.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Together </h4><br>  Another <a href="http://wse-wmeste.ru/">platform</a> for hosting private charity projects and receiving assistance, whose partner is Yandex.  If ‚ÄúWelcome Mail.ru‚Äù offers a wide range of topics for help, then ‚ÄúAll Together‚Äù is almost completely people-oriented.  With this, the division into sub-topics is as follows: <br><ul><li>  Treatment </li><li>  Orphans </li><li>  Adults </li><li>  Different help </li><li>  People with disabilities </li><li>  Hospices </li><li>  Elderly </li><li>  Homeless </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/003/a3f/9f4/003a3f9f466fe4b0cdf6f11de9935825.jpg"><br><br>  But at the same time, the total number of projects presented on the site is still very small.  Navigation is inconvenient: for example, in order to transfer money to a project, you will have to either go to its own website, or make a donation to the project through <a href="http://www.blago.ru/">Blago.ru</a> website.  Well, just everything for people ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1d/1bf/b31/c1d1bfb31b08ae4dbcc84b12e1fc5c79.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Blago.ru </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e00/43c/294/e0043c294b523243e8c6d0ad90b5dcf7.jpg"><br><br>  Much more clever ground compared to "All together".  Also focused almost exclusively on helping people, the list of topics is even wider: <br><ul><li>  Special children </li><li>  Severely ill children </li><li>  Teenagers and young people </li><li>  Animals, including homeless </li><li>  Veterans of the Great Patriotic War and "hot spots" </li><li>  People living with HIV / AIDS </li><li>  Elderly and old people </li><li>  Orphans </li><li>  People in difficult situations </li><li>  Families (including large and incomplete) </li><li>  Children, adults with disabilities </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd1/4ce/7b8/cd14ce7b86ce44dae1bcadb4cac99718.jpg"><br><br>  The main type of assistance is fundraising.  Of course, volunteering is often indicated in long wordy descriptions of projects, but only in descriptions.  As they say, he is looking for, he will find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/356/6fc/b7b/3566fcb7b6b73a41ca39ccdc78caef02.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, this brief review does not pretend to multi-dimensional coverage.  This is just some attempt to tell about the development of the form of spreading charity through the Internet.  About charity portals, so to speak.  At the same time, of all the charity sites I viewed (there were several dozens of them), ‚ÄúWelcome Mail.ru‚Äù stands out favorably with ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù and convenience of interaction with visitors. <br><br><h4>  Animals </h4><br>  For those who believe that animals deserve help too, there are also projects, of course.  So, here are just a small part of charity projects that help those ‚Äúfor whom we are responsible‚Äù.  All the funds below provide assistance in the treatment and search for hosts for homeless, maimed, discarded animals. <br>  Here I will not dwell in detail, I will give only a few addresses where you can find contacts for animal welfare organizations across the country.  All the funds below provide assistance in the treatment and search for hosts for homeless, maimed, discarded animals. <br><br><h5>  Together </h5><br>  The section on <a href="http://www.wse-wmeste.ru/partners/friends/show_144/">animals</a> , on the site already mentioned above. <br><br><h5>  Information project about shelters and problems of stray animals </h5><br>  <a href="http://priut-info.ru/">It</a> contains information and contact information for animal shelters across the country.  The list is organized geographically. <br><br><h5>  The section on the site " <a href="http://www.kotopes.info/shelter/">Kotopes</a> " </h5><br>  Another database of animal shelters across the country. <br><br>  I hope that thanks to this brief reviews of charitable projects, some of the readers will help those who are in need of help now.  And not necessarily in those projects, which are described here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191140/</a></p>
