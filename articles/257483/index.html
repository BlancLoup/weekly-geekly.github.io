  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And again about the ears</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another letter that came to us in the mail: <br><br>  Some time ago, after talking with friends who are professionally engaged in special effects for the cinema, I had a desire to try myself in animatronics.  Given the presence of a self-assembled 3D printer, some skills in using Arduino, fairly straightforward hands didn‚Äôt look very difficult. <br><br>  To begin with, Solidworks designed, and then printed and assembled, movable eyes controlled by Arduino.

I thought that these ears with some modifications may well complement the already made eyes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f93/f7b/07a/f93f7b07af694f06aa2928657cb6a153.jpg"><br><br>  No sooner said than done.  Print out the details.  It turned out that the sizes of the servos by the author were somewhat different from mine.  I had to scale slightly, and later on the site there were files under my typewriter.  And then it became clear that the tail of the buttons does not add to the convenience and beauty of the whole structure. <br><br>  As a result, the first version of the change appeared - with control from the IR remote.  I used one of the smaller Chinese consoles, of which there are many on Ali.  And the circuit changes were minimal - all the buttons were thrown out and a standard TSOP31236 receiver was hung on one of the Arduino inputs (I usually use Pro mini). <br><br>  This sketch of mine is present <a href="http://3d.masterkit.ru/shop/solutions/cat-ears/1903802">on the Master Kit website</a> in the description of the lugs (along with the apk-file for Android and the stl file of the enclosure for electronics).  The main thing is first to use a standard example from the Arduino library to read the remote control codes for the buttons used and change my codes in the sketch to those received by the scanner. <br><br>  Well, then there was a desire not to use extraneous consoles.  The solution is simple - any tablet or phone on Android and bluetooth. <br><br>  At hand was the module HC-05, which was introduced into the system.  Due to their small size, both boards were combined into one case and placed on one of the rim arms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ce/604/de5/0ce604de5c9a4b318647b19c39bbe6f0.jpg"><br><br>  And on the second, the 18650 battery holder was fixed with a power button and a DC-DC boost converter from the same Chinese comrades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b60/8bb/d43/b608bbd4326549d697e6d0b18262535c.jpg"><br><br>  Connection diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/442/c42/859442c420584f6ab91829fd277ae28b.jpg"><br><br>  And then the fun started, because before that, writing programs for Android had absolutely no relation. <br><br>  An attempt to install the Eclipse environment at first did not succeed, all sorts of errors came out, for which even Google did not give definite answers.  As a result, it became clear that at the moment it would have to do with a simpler tool, which is AppInventor. <br><br>  After a couple of evenings reading the documentation and watching the video tutorials, a <a href="">simple application</a> was compiled and launched.  Of course, experienced programmers will say unkindly both about its size and about my ‚Äúabilities‚Äù, but for such elementary tasks the program has completely justified itself.  I got the initial skills of working with Android, I liked the toy for my grandson and friends. <br><br>  The immediate development is seen in the additional control mode (the departure from 5 standard subroutines to the direct control of each ear) and the combination with the previously manufactured eyes.  Well, and, perhaps, the third option on the basis of the ESP8266 modules, which are increasingly used everywhere by WiFi. <br><br>  And yes, I won Eclipse, but his regular emulator is sadness, and the alternative one in the free version seems to have been severely cut off.  I will sort this out. <br><br>  Project author: Vladimir Klimovsky <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vovvovich/" class="user_link">VovVovich</a> <br><br>  We posted this letter with the permission of the author and his note: <br>  This is my first article, so I am ready both for practical advice and for throwing slippers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257483/</a></p>
