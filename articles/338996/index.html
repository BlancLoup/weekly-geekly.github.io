      <strong>The reason for the trip - <abbr title="User interface design and user experience design">UX</abbr> Australia</strong> - an annual conference dedicated to research and design / creating the most comfortable, ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù <strong>experience of user interaction</strong> with anything you encounter day after day in your daily life: with the website interface, with the application or a program on a personal computer, with a gadget or physical space, it can be an airplane cabin, a medical office, a train station, even the ergonomics of your computer mouse are directly the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis study. <br><br>  We will meet with worthy examples, complementing the above, they are waiting for you in the continuation of this article. <br><br>  In the meantime, I will introduce myself and tell a little about myself. <br><br>  For 3 years I have been living and working in the international company Mindvalley, which is based in the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, has a branch in Estonia, Tallinn, but is registered in America, Nevada.  My professional field of study is <abbr title="User interface design and user experience design">UX / UI</abbr> . <br><br>  I‚Äôm in the position of Senior <abbr title="User interface design and user experience design">UX / UI</abbr> Designer and Front-end Developer. <br><br>  Australia is an expensive treat!  But still, I was lucky to get on such a serious and interesting event, of course, before that, I carefully planned and calculated everything. <br><br>  And I will tell you a little secret that even though I was flying from Malaysia, the budget was not a small one. <br>  And for those to whom it is interesting and who are also, like me, open to such events, I will even give a small calculation below. <br><br>  In fact, I believe that this is how we grow professionally, through the exchange of experience, technology and skills with like-minded people from around the world. <br><br>  So I met at the conference with a lot of experts in the field of UX / UI from all over the world.  They include a manager and a couple of designers from the Sydney UX research department in Google, content managers and specialists from the Instagram and Facebook team, XD strategist / usability writer / honored speaker from Dallas, USA, CX / UX Melbourne specialist (I really liked her conference on working on improving the UX environment, streets, train station and subway), UX specialist in visualization of data and statistics from Kansas, USA, and many many more other talented specialists. <br><br>  In the next image, I noted only 20% of those that were voiced at the 4-day conference, to give some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat was discussed at such a serious event in a more detailed format. <br><br>  Lectures were held in several rooms and wanted to have time to visit everything!  Only flew from one audience to another. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/103/95a/90c/10395a90c0e3a5c4cc1977b4103beaae.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  After receiving information about the conference, I immediately began to figure out what I needed to pay attention to in the first place in order to correctly distribute my finances. <br><br>  And so what happened: <br><br>  <strong>Visa:</strong> 500 RM / 150AUD / 120 USD <br>  <strong>Biometric data:</strong> 121 RM / 37 AUD / 30 USD <br>  <strong>Air ticket:</strong> 1600 RM / 473 AUD / 375 USD <br>  <strong>Accommodation:</strong> 1060 RM / 314 AUD / 250 USD <br>  <strong>Meals:</strong> 150 + AUD / 120 + USD <br>  <strong>Conference: (student price)</strong> 1200 MYR / 350 AUD / 280 USD <br>  <strong>Practical workshop:</strong> 2030 MYR / 600 AUD / 480 USD <br><br>  <strong>As a result:</strong> you need to count on investments in the amount of 1700 - 2000 USD as a minimum. <br><br>  Well, better to ask your boss to finance this event. <br><br>  Let's go back to the main topic of the article.  And it is to reveal as many aspects as possible regarding UX design or, in other words, user experience experience.  Honestly, I have long been engaged in the study and improvement of my knowledge in the subject of <abbr title="User interface design and user experience design">UX / UI</abbr> , I read articles from various authors and specialists, and began to notice that, finally, it was time for me to start talking about this topic and try to share my accumulated experience and thoughts.  A trip to the conference pushed me to a meeting to implement this desire. <br><br>  It's time to start. <br><br>  The article is supposed to be quite long, but, I hope, interesting and embracing various fine points, actual problems and aspects. <br><br><h2>  Voila, Mr. UX </h2><br>  Many people mistakenly think that UX / UI is a new direction that suddenly appeared in the lists of the most popular vacancies in the wake of the development of new IT technologies. <br><br>  This activity is really gaining momentum now.  More and more companies and startups are hiring interface designers and <abbr title="User interface design and user experience design">UX</abbr> designers / developers. <br><br>  However, no, I‚Äôll reveal a little secret to you, it is not new and existed for a long time, just enough attention was not given to it, and now its interpretation still brings confusion, especially from customers, business / company / product owners, project holders. <br><br>  <strong>Why are there so many alternative definitions around this direction?</strong> <br>  And all because UX or <strong>user interaction experience</strong> is a kind of polyhedron that includes many disciplines at the same time: it is psychology and analysis, focused on studying user behavior;  this and information architecture;  methods / techniques of research and usability tests aimed at solving a problem and increasing the convenience, ease and friendliness of the process of interaction with a digital / digital product screen or directly with a physical product, space or service;  this is the search, research and finding the target user audience;  selection and maintenance of participants (respondents) testing;  visual design;  contextual design;  content creation and strategy;  graphic design;  prototyping (wireframing and prototyping);  analytics and building business processes;  design and programming;  interactive design;  compilation of customer journey maps (CJM) of consumer travel maps and further, further into the depths. <br><br>  From here you understand that it is impossible to be a unique specialist and professional in every discipline.  And that on this UX (user interaction experience) work many different experts, working in a team.  However, speaking of the profession of UX designer, we mean a person who still has a solid (solid, solid, integral) experience, operating with all the above areas of knowledge, but has profound skills in a particular narrow direction. <br><br>  And yet, there are still questions: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  Why does the <abbr title="User Experience Designing">UX</abbr> absorb so much resources, time and attention? </li><li>  How and where did this direction come from, what does it bring to life, what is its use? </li><li>  And yet, what is the reason that this term sounded only 5-7 years ago, or even less, having gained popularity with the advent and development of digital technologies and products? </li></ul><br></blockquote><br><h2>  UX in the language of metaphors - my interpretation </h2><br>  Recall the phrase from the cartoon <strong>‚ÄúGreat Nehochuha‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, there would be such a country where nothing needed to be done, only to play, and that no grandmothers, only robots‚Äù!</strong>  Or to all the well-known Russian folk tale <strong>‚ÄúAt the behest of the pike‚Äù</strong> . <br>  A person has always sought to simplify the experience of interaction (with someone or with something) in an effort to make as little effort as possible in a given case.  And in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/d52/f23/b9ed52f232b86e1452cdbe5efd4ea54c.jpg" alt="from m / f &amp; quot;  Great nehochuha &amp; quot;"></div><br><br>  The first thing to understand is that the <strong><abbr title="User Interface Design and User Experience">UX</abbr> revolves around the user and this is his main character</strong> , and everything else is the story associated with this hero.  In other words, imagine a scene on which we observe our character and everything that happens to him and around him, thereby studying all his characteristics, behaviors, habits, movements, and so on.  What does the user interact with and how does he do it and what feelings does he have at the same time, all this should reflect our scene.  <strong>The reflection of what is happening and will be UX - the studied and accumulated experience</strong> . <br><br><blockquote>  The <abbr title="Specialist in designing interfaces, services, physical environment and products for the user, taking into account providing the client with a friendly, efficient, easy user interaction experience">goal of UXers</abbr> is to prepare and create a scene, and the hero seemed to merge with it together so that everything would fit together and he would feel part of the whole picture, easily and naturally merging into it and providing a so-called seamless work process. and interaction with all the elements in it. <br></blockquote><br>  It is necessary to understand that it is not easy to design the above described platform, taking into account the needs and situations of all its participants / heroes, especially knowing and knowing that <strong>everyone</strong> has their own <strong>specific goals, requirements and their own vision of what is happening</strong> .  Nevertheless, the <strong>scene</strong> should be a kind of <strong>union</strong> , where <strong>different processes and actions take place</strong> , but some kind of interconnection can be traced.  To meet all needs and organize a smooth, simple, friendly perception takes time and in-depth research.  It is necessary to go through a lot of duplicates in order to make sure that the process is built on our stage correctly and without road blocks (interference). <br><br>  Since I decided to operate in the language of metaphors and draw a certain analogy that facilitates the ability to convey, decipher the experience of user interaction (the so-called UX) in a more interesting form, I can safely say that in the higher text you could also meet and recognize a significant part of the basic terms and concepts related to UX design and which are the main satellites of this direction. <br><br>  Everything is easy, <br>  <strong>A scene</strong> is a playground, a laboratory, a chessboard with figures, a reflection of our reality; <br>  <strong>Heroes</strong> are characters (persons with their motives, goals and actions); <br>  In turn, the <strong>Actions and peripetia on the stage</strong> are user stores, user journeys (stories of our characters or even a specific list of their successive steps (scenario of possible actions); <br>  <strong>The script for the whole picture</strong> is a list of flows; <br>  <strong>The feeling of smoothness and friendliness of the process itself</strong> is the so-called usability and so on. <br><blockquote>  And <strong>UX-er is a kind of director</strong> who takes into account all the nuances, imbued with empathy for all the characters. <br>  It is he who shoots as many duplicates as necessary to ensure further selection of the optimal option. <br>  Sampling and cutting of the best duplicates (the result of careful research and analysis) gives an impetus to the creation of an effective and convenient product. <br></blockquote><br><h2>  UX chases everywhere!  Talk about UX in the context of daily life routine </h2><br>  This chapter is presented for a more complete and deep understanding of the UX as a scientific direction.  After all, in terms of this concept, you should understand the whole essence of its meaning, significance and wide application. <br>  UX is not limited only to digital technology and IT. <br><br>  Very often one has to deal with situations and circumstances in life, in which one feels and understands in one‚Äôs own experience mistakes and omissions in the UX.  Often, designers do not take into account and do not view all possible options, diversity and heterogeneity of users who will interact with the object (product / service / environment) within the framework of this UX.  Many companies do not bother about it at all. <br>  But, as they say, what is the reason, such a consequence!  In such situations, I like to use the concept of <strong>‚ÄúSUX‚Äù - the SOME User Experience</strong> is a UX that does not take into account the full range of users, with their set of circumstances, personal abilities and limitations. <br>  I note that this is quite a serious problem and, by the way, it is often met when user interaction experience is not only not thought out properly even for an ordinary (ordinary) user, but also, as often happens, does not take into account people with disabilities at all.  And it is necessary to pronounce it necessary during the design process! <br><br>  In connection with all this, let's give an example from a rather funny life situation, which, probably, could happen to any person.  And it looks like the very day when everything goes wrong with you, and you think that luck has disappeared beyond the horizon, and you, like the hero of the film ‚ÄúUnlucky‚Äù with Pierre Richard, are a fiasco at every turn.  And all because you are faced with a whole chain of UX, do not take into account the diversity of typical life circumstances for the user. <br><br>  <strong>Evening</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a36/920/1db/a369201db85fa21afb9d871f66c2da62.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><blockquote>  Imagine that your car's battery overnight was discharged, only because in the evening after work, during parking, your child in the back seat distracted attention and said that the next day school was canceled for a specific reason.  Since you were late to school because of the situation in the subway (misunderstandings, which I will discuss below), this news has become known only now from the child, and not from the teacher.  Well, the reason in general remained hidden ‚Äúbehind seven locks‚Äù, since the child was not attentive and the main thing he caught is that tomorrow we don‚Äôt need to go to school.  Hooray!  You, realizing that someone should sit with the child tomorrow, immediately dial the grandmother's phone in order to agree with her quickly.  The child at this time loses his phone in the car and turns on the light in the cabin.  You do not pay attention, busy talking.  The child finds the phone and forgets to turn off the light.  A lighting in the cabin is not provided for automatic shutdown after a certain period of time, there is also no sound, giving you to understand that something is not completely off.  After a successful parking, you get out of the car, your wife immediately calls and asks you to buy milk and bread.  The child distracts and plays around.  Before you go out, you turn off the dipped beam and turn the keys, pull them out of the ignition, but as it turned out, do not turn the mechanical element to the end of the headlights, as the switch is not designed to understand that you really turned off position.  You turned to the state when the parking lights are shining.  Due to the bright light in the parking lot, the light of the dimensions is no longer noticeable.  You close the car and run quickly to the store, still talking on the phone.  The inner light remained on.  Overnight, the battery is dead. <br></blockquote><br>  <strong>At the end of the working day, after work</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9df/4c5/5d9/9df4c55d91d859368acb0e6794b0bf1e.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>  Before you pick up the child from school and get into the car, you had to drive several stations on the subway. <br><br>  You are used to leaving the car at another station, since from there it is easier to get home and to school without traffic jams. <br><br>  There is another important point: 2 days ago you flew in from an important business trip and immediately went to the office for a meeting, left your luggage in the office, now it‚Äôs time to take it home. <br>  At the metro station there is a special wide turnstile.  Usually the attendant is also present nearby.  There are people with strollers and large bags.  Your case.  You know that there is enough money on your travel card, replenished it relatively recently.  But bring the card, and the doors do not open and at the same time emit a signal that something does not work.  You try again, look at the people passing through the usual turnstile, and you cannot understand what is going wrong. <br><br>  As often happens, the person on duty is not at the right moment, and you have to go back to the place where everyone buys tickets to make sure that the balance is positive and everything is in order with the card.  You lose time, wait in line, get psycho.  After all, you are late for a child in school.  And having waited for your turn, you are convinced that everything is as it was supposed, a working card, a sufficient budget.  You come back, try again.  Already go to the stage of despair, and here you see the attendant, who also notices your displeasure over the expression of the face.  He explains what you are doing wrong and finds a solution to the problem very quickly, it turns out you need to hold the card a little longer than the ordinary turnstile - more than 5 seconds.  Unfortunately, this information does not appear anywhere for the lack of thoughtful UX.  And this is a fact. <br></blockquote><br>  <strong>At work</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/366/374/b3636637449a0db4360e8dc5327493ce.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>  At work, from the very morning, you have everything arranged, meeting after meeting.  Very important day.  Planning for next month.  You were late and did not have breakfast at home.  There are very short breaks between meetings, and in the meantime you are dreaming about a cup of hot and evocative coffee.  Literally rush to the coffee machine after the first meeting.  Press the button, select the desired drink from the list of coffee cards (hoping that the filled cup will be waiting for you) and run to the toilet. <br><br>  Afterwards, the director meets you in the corridor and is interested in hearing your opinion on a specific issue.  You communicate, but inside you think about the cup of coffee that is waiting for you.  The conversation ends, you are happy and run to the desired.  But you get upset because everything stopped at the place where you started it all.  Here another person approaches the machine, and you already look at him as a competitor, but he is only trying to explain that you did not press the button to the end and for this reason you were left without a long-awaited drink.  There is no signal or indicator lights indicating that the coffee machine has started. <br>  The lack of competent UX. <br><br></blockquote><br>  <strong>Morning</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f68/d57/cb4/f68d57cb4e944feac34398bd2a77b58f.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>  And here we come to the very initial link in the whole chain of events.  You overslept.  Alarm clock did not work on time.  You turn off your smartphone while you sleep and put it away from you at night, consider it more harmless.  You are using an ordinary electronic clock - alarm clock.  This time it did not work, because the time had gone astray.  And the time got lost due to the fault of your pet, who managed to walk through these hours during your sleep and reset the timer.  The clock you left on the floor, next to your bed.  If the interface of this clock would have been worked out a little differently, the button layout would have a different configuration, perhaps this would not have happened. <br></blockquote><br>  A rather ridiculous set of circumstances, but giving a more complete picture of how the UX can be embedded in our daily life and spoil or improve our mood. <br>  Examples can be cited endlessly, and I‚Äôm sure that each of us is dealing with user experience experiences day by day. <br><br>  I recently spent a lot of time to find myself a full-size headphones with active noise cancellation, lightweight and ergonomic, visually pleasing and design interesting in appearance, with a touchpad, a good output frequency, a microphone, etc.  There was a whole list of requirements.  My search was quite long, I was already disappointed in the range that is offered on the market.  But it was still a success, and now, pleased with the result of my search, I enjoy the choice ... ... <br><br>  I hope that you are still here with me and are not tired of meticulous examples, after all, UX pros should be thoughtful and detailed. <br><br><h2>  A tour of UX history.  Disperse the fog </h2><br>  As you can see, UX is a user experience, gained from day to day, it continues to evolve with the person and has a fairly rich history.  Just think about the time when the first so-called <strong>steam</strong> - <strong>powered cars</strong> began to appear, when the history of the first car began. <br><br>  We can recall Dmitri Mendeleev‚Äôs proposal, dated as early as 1863, when he proposed to deliver oil from oil production sites to the seaport at the Baku oil fields not in barrels, but through pipes.  These are the <strong>first ideas of pipeline transport</strong> .  Mendeleev‚Äôs proposal was not accepted, and two years later, the first pipeline was built by the Americans in Pennsylvania.  As always, when something is done abroad, they start doing it in Russia.  Or at least allocate money.  As a result, in 1878 Shukhov built the first oil pipeline in Russia, proving the convenience and practicality of pipeline transportation. <br><br>  You can go deeper even earlier and remember the story of the <strong>‚ÄúKitchen Nightmare‚Äù by Leonardo da Vinci, 1430</strong> .  Maybe someone now finds out about this for the first time.  But this is a very interesting and informative fact.  There is a book called ‚ÄúThink like Leonardo da Vinci‚Äù and it tells the story of the Duke of Milan, for whom da Vinci designed the kitchen for high-profile grand holidays. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This famous in history, the so-called ‚Äúuniversal man‚Äù took up the work and </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">developed conveyor belts for transporting food to the cooks</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . This case is considered the first example of the use of technology (hundreds of years before the industrial revolution). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, here we can trace the first echoes of the modern problem of designing and searching for the best, optimal experience of interaction with various systems friendly to people who directly need them. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the advent of the industrial revolution, interest was attracted by research aimed at the development of production tools for more efficient use of them in enterprises. And in </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1857, Wojciech Jastrzembowski</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> coined such a term in science as</font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúErgonomics‚Äù</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . At the same time, other scientists have studied how people think, how the process of cognition takes place, and what motivates people. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wilhelm Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory in 1879. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you know about the project idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãHenry Dreyfus for people in 1955? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Henry Dreyfus</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , American industrial designer, wrote the classic text </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDesigning for People‚Äù</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.

We observe what the user is doing, ask him to comment on his actions, ask clarifying questions and with him describe in his daily routine as much as possible.

Participants can easily record on video all the answers to their questions, it is easier to collect information about user behavior and the use of this or that device. </li><li>  <strong>Empirical sampling (ESM)</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9d/7ed/907/b9d7ed907c8693662e3a3194088f1132.jpg" alt="ESM"></div><br>  While keeping diaries and records forces the user to address and describe a particular event / action that occurred in the past, the ESM method stops the participant at a predetermined period of time (during use of the application, during arrival at the destination, after registration on the site, etc.). <br></li><li>  <strong>Automatic saving and analysis of logs, computer programming</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a5/a4e/65f/5a5a4e65f395841b92e5ed64475a433c.jpg" alt="Logging &amp; Instrumentation"></div><br>  In this method, information is obtained by processing / analyzing <abbr title="Event log files">logs</abbr> (text format files or database tables, which contain all the necessary data about all user actions). <br>  The data in the log file is a rather incomprehensible information for an unprepared beginner, but for system administrators it is quite understandable and meaningful text, which can serve as a basis for carrying out any actions, research or even criminal prosecution of the client (of course, in the case of unlawful act, for example, hacker hacking, resulting in the removal from the server of the database stored there with the data of bank cards of customers of the company). <br><br>  But when analyzing event log files (log files), system and network administrators should take into account that the data obtained is still not 100% real, the deviation in them is usually 5-10% due to various technical and technological features of the equipment used and its settings. <br><br>  To receive summary reports and statistics on log files, special software is used, which is called ‚ÄúLog File Analyzers‚Äù. </li></ul><br></li><li>  <strong>Usability (usability) and concept assessment</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Heuristic Methodology / Expert Evaluation</strong> <br>  This method does not focus on the attitude to the product from the point of view of end users.  Here, more work is aimed at a thorough analysis of the product (competitor) in order to find and identify its strengths and weaknesses, weak and strong aspects, based on the principles of interaction design as guidelines.  Competitive reviews can also give a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existing functional characteristics and capabilities. <br><br>  Recall the definition of the term "Heuristics".  Under the heuristics understand the set of techniques and methods that facilitate and simplify the solution of cognitive, constructive, practical problems.  Heuristics is connected with psychology, physiology of human higher nervous activity, cybernetics.  As a science, heuristics develop at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, the theory of "the arts, the intellect", structural linguistics, information theory, mathematics and physics. <br>  Here we also give 10 Jacob Nielsen heuristics (you can read them in more detail later): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed1/68a/8fe/ed168a8fe5d82e0e30b99e99b626ecbd.jpg" alt="methods variety" align="left"><br>  - System awareness <br>  - Similarity of the system with the real world <br>  - The freedom of action <br>  - Uniformity and standards <br>  - Preventing mistakes <br>  - In sight, not in memory <br>  - Flexibility and efficiency <br>  - Aesthetic and minimalistic design <br>  - Understanding of problems and their solution <br>  - Reference materials and documentation <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Cognitive step by step research process</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f99/3df/d7d/f993dfd7dd4a9f2ed1e75245e8b836ad.png" alt="methods variety" align="left"><br>  Cognitive walkthrough research is a quick way to get feedback and initial impressions about user interfaces and the correctness of their navigation flow directly from experts in the field of study. </li><li>  <strong>Concept testing</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d8/2a2/071/3d82a20710dfb85eedfe8255b326a82a.png" alt="methods variety" align="left"><br>  This is a method in which the focus is on conducting conceptual tests with a selected number of participants to determine whether the concept meets the needs of the user or is a solution to a problem.  This method allows you to check and make sure that the user perceives the navigation flow (real navigation through the product in the process of testing user scenarios), as well as to ensure the sequence of actions taken in the way of solving the set tasks, the correct communication of the main goals and intentions, an effective approach to building and information architecture strategies. </li><li>  <strong>Prototyping with iterations followed by evaluation</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4f/8bd/02d/a4f8bd02d913f58624c2113be7d6b7be.jpg" alt="methods variety"></div><br>  The design method begins with the design of rough prototypes or low-definition prototypes (a set of sketches on pieces of paper).  Rough prototypes are used in the early stages of design to collect the initial feedback from participants and correctly determine the design flows. <br><br>  High-definition prototypes, with good detail, are usually evaluated at later design stages to test all levels of interaction and bring the prototype to the ‚Äúfinal product‚Äù, then the final testing of all user interactions with the object takes place. </li><li>  <strong>Guerrilla testing / UX-special forces</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38a/482/c1e/38a482c1e4dea359935dc97db6b9093a.jpg" alt="methods variety"></div><br>  Typically, this method is most often carried out in a cafe with a gradual catch of interview participants.  Therefore, it is also called "partisan research in the cafe."  Participants, however, are on the fly (bar, public transport).  This helps to get a more fair assessment without the respondent‚Äôs training effect, that is, we see a real reaction to the product in an unprepared situation.  The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes per participant, and the cost of holding does not go beyond. <br><br>  Guerrilla research is a kind of non-lethal form of guerrilla tactics.  As you know, in the guerrilla war, small mobile forces are fighting the enemy, using the tactics of ambush and fleeting fights.  Who in this case is considered an "enemy", you ask?  Probably the main enemies of your team will be time, money and resources;  if you run out of something, it may turn out that you have created an innovative, but non-viable digital product.  For customers who do not have the time or budget, traditional user research (for example, ethnographic) takes too much time, and usability testing simply cannot show how well the proposed value matches the audience or whether key aspects of the interaction provide value innovation.  This is where guerilla user research comes to the rescue ‚Äî this economical and mobile tactic should help to quickly get answers to necessary questions. </li><li>  <strong>Research in usability laboratories</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3f/ae7/bd4/a3fae7bd4eef2539e547375fe5dc33b6.png" alt="methods variety"></div><br>  Each of the group of respondents, individually or directly in a team, meets with a researcher in a special laboratory, where he performs a series of tasks on using the product / service, following a specific scenario.  Most often, participants are given the opportunity to work and test the prototype.  The advantage is that this method allows the test manager to establish and organize space / space.  in a way that is necessary for a more effective result.  This includes installation of video surveillance, audio recording, etc. <br></li><li>  <strong>Remote research</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80f/146/e44/80f146e444eff7f296718d36a4694530.jpg" alt="methods variety"></div><br>  A remote usability study conducted using screen sharing and device co-management software. </li><li>  <strong>Unmoderated user experience survey</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b5/e0b/d1d/2b5e0bd1d8edfaf36d6134ba2b3a9e46.jpg" alt="methods variety"></div><br>  A group of trained users (panel), on the devices of which programs for video recording and data collection are installed, voice their thoughts in the process of using the object of study.

Selection and recruitment of test participants </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the main criteria for successful testing is competent selection of participants (respondents for UX-research). Since the validity of usability testing results depends on the correct selection of participants. By testing the product with its real users, we sort of identify problems when interacting with it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You need to have a good understanding of the target audience of the research subject. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each subject must represent one or another group of users (subset). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very important to take into account diversity according to the following criteria, such as experience, preferences, level of computer literacy and "advancement" in IT technologies, interaction patterns, demographics of the audience, etc ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, different users can operate with the product, each has his own vision, goal, problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the more accurate the sample of respondents, the more ‚Äúmixed‚Äù candidates you find, the higher the likelihood that meeting the needs of one representative of each target group will be a reflection of the entire subset. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Selection takes place through a survey, a scenario for collecting data on candidates and selecting the appropriate requirements. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be ready to show your creativity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use empathy skills to imagine yourself in the place of target users: where to look for them and what can make them take part in testing?</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e97/9ca/bce/e979cabce2883e57199a75e595e697c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 5. Conduct research, data collection and analysis of the result, followed by the conclusion </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this point, I would like to give certain recommendations and just make a conclusion. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you lead the research process, think about how to maintain the interconnection of participants during testing. Motivate the subjects, keep in touch with them if necessary. In cases of keeping diary records / photo / video reports (diary studies), try to send out permanent text reminders. Do not forget about the form of remuneration for participation in testing.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data collection depends on which method you used. It can be a combination of dictation notes, table records, photos, video records. In the case of another methodology in which the user must enter data from an electronic device (surveys, reports), provide a convenient form of a survey or diary, it should not be boring and infinitely long. Let the participant break up the filling process into several stages, take a break and use autosave. Try to think through the process of data analysis and their subsequent comparison, comparison, plan the processing of the results in advance, collect data in the correct order, organize proper storage of the information received.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not forget that even though you have done an enormous amount of work, you should not stop at what has been accomplished, continue to collect recommendations, think over the following steps, answer the questions you have posed, visualize the results in an easily accessible form. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try not to conduct research alone, invite at least 2 observers / assistants and train them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recheck everything several times (equipment, addresses, materials, etc.). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be prepared for unforeseen conditions and circumstances (animals in the interview room, uncleaned rooms, no lunch and other difficulties and inconveniences). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You should always be open and flexible to the rapid turn of events. Memorize, observe, write down and photograph everything that is possible. Evaluate and discuss on the spot.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And finally, a couple of tips on how to properly communicate with the participants of the experiment ... </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The art of interviewing how to ask questions </font></font></h3><br><blockquote> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the conversation with the candidate:</font></font></i> <br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Avoid questions that show your superiority over the participant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They lead to the stiffness and closure of the interviewee.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Try not only to listen, but also to watch. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not use prof. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">UI / UX vocabulary</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Let the subject think about the question, do not squeeze in time </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Do not help imposing your point of view. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Ask the respondent to think out loud, this will show his thinking logic. </font></font></li></ul><br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank you all for taking the time to my review, I hope everyone found something useful for himself in the article. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now a short and funny cartoon on the subject of conducting a ‚Äúpatient‚Äù relationship during the testing of a research participant. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See you all soon!</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fa9DLxDtPtc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338996/</a></p>
