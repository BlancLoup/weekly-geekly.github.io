It‚Äôs great if a startup communicates with its first clients whom it knows personally. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f9/17d/b89/9f917db896ea98f9f3af568972db340a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But how to build communication with new users?  How to tell them about new features and activate features?

      Based <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/">on our experience</a> and materials of our colleagues, we have developed several techniques for improving communication with users.  Meet <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Chat based on user behavior </h2><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/599/2c0/4c1/5992c04c1a3828ea07927a43d20da95b.jpg" alt="chat-on-the-road" width="799" height="476"></a> <br><br>  1) The user returned to the site a second or more times. <br><br>  If you see that your visitor has not come to your landing page for the first time, he probably has a question.  You can not wait for him to ask him, but to offer him help.  Just do not forget to say that you have already seen it "here." <br><br>  2) Help the user find what he is looking for. <br><br>  If you have a search on the site, and the user has used it - help him.  Having seen what he is looking for, you can give him a far more accurate answer than if he continues to search for himself. <br><br>  3) Talk to the most active. <br><br>  Users are different.  Scoring users by points, identifying the most active.  Talk to them, they can tell you a lot of useful things about your service and give a good review. <br><br>  4) On the way to conversion.  Where is the stone? <br><br>  Any service has a sticking point when most users do not understand something or do not activate some function.  For you, this is a good reason to talk with the user and figure out what exactly is not clear to him. <br><br>  Just remember that you already know about the problem of the client.  Do not write him in the chat "how can I help" - contact on the case. <br><br><br><h2>  Popup windows.  When are they needed? </h2><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e2/327/65a/4e232765a4a4e59dfa5dbf829db96de1.jpg" alt="popup-on-the-road" width="720" height="496"></a> <br><br>  One of the biggest problems with pop-ups is that they appear out of place when they are not expected.  And they suggest that the user is not relevant at the moment.  Here are some examples of trigger windows that will be relevant: <br><br>  1) If the user came from advertising in direct. <br><br>  It is not a secret that your advertising message in direct must correspond to the message on the site.  Conversion is higher if the user confirms his expectations on the site, which you have promised in advertising.  It makes sense to make a window that confirms your advertising promises. <br>  Or make a substitution of content (title and description) for the channel from which the user came. <br><br>  2) Ask for feedback. <br><br>  If you see that the user is actively using your service - ask him for a review.  Just not at the moment when he moves to the conversion.  You can do this with a new visit, or if it is not active for a long time. <br><br>  3) Talk about new features. <br><br>  You constantly update your service.  This should be told.  Pop-up window for returning users is a good option to tell what has been updated for you in a week. <br><br>  4) Show how to use the function. <br><br>  You have complex functionality or users have doubts about some simple things - show them a little instruction. <br><br>  There are many more ways to make your users life easier.  Experiment with trigger windows.  The main thing is to be in the subject. <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  Email mailing that does not spam </h2><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed5/1e7/9a5/ed51e79a5a564e0c69f1e1198b130710.jpg" alt="email-on-the-road" width="783" height="550"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Emails are a great way to talk to your customers.  Write to your users the way you would like them to write to you. <br><br>  1) Say hello! <br><br>  We love to say hello.  This is a sign of respect that cannot be neglected.  Greet your users and give them useful material for further work with your product. <br><br>  2) Letter in 7-14 days <br><br>  It should not be a secret that your task is to earn.  Nothing good is free.  Remind your users of this by sending emails a few days after registering. <br><br>  3) Give more time <br><br>  Not everyone can feel your product at 100% for the trial period.  Give the most active a little more time if they ask for it. <br><br>  4) If something went wrong <br><br>  If you notice that your product had some kind of malfunction or something did not work, inform your users about it.  Let me know that everything is fine and everything is working out. <br><br>  5) Share tips <br><br>  Who besides you best knows how to use your product and how to get the most benefit from its use. <br><br>  Tell your users about this. <br><br>  6) Tell me how you missed <br><br>  Surely, among your users there is a segment that is registered, but does not use your product.  Remind them of yourself.  Give them useful knowledge, tell us more about your product, show the benefits, or just say how much you miss. <br><br>  7) Ask for feedback <br><br>  It's great when the service has active users who are ready to share their impressions.  Find these and ask for feedback. <br><br><br><br>  All these features are implemented in the <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/">carrot quest</a> service.  Try it. <br><br>  Segment your users, communicate with them personally and when it is convenient for them.  Be helpful.  Activate new features, tell the possibilities of their services and applications. <br><br>  Cool products to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244965/</a></p>
