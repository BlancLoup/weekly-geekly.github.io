  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychiatrists have recognized that Internet addiction does not harm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new psychiatric <a href="http://mednews.stanford.edu/releases/2006/october/internet.html">study of</a> American Internet users was conducted by specialists from <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford Medical School</a> .  They found that 13.7% of adult Americans today are suffering if they are forced to do without the Internet for several days in a row.  In addition, about 9% of Americans hide their attachment to the Internet from their loved ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact itself indicates that psychiatrists are still trying to find a black cat in a dark room, although it is not there.  They are clearly looking for evidence that Internet addiction exists as a disease.  Just as before, they sought out a painful attachment to mobile phones, email, televisions, and other technological innovations.  As soon as a new, wonderful technology appears, which to some extent changes the world - just like that, psychiatrists with their ‚Äúscientific‚Äù conclusions. <br><br>  In addition, scientific terminology confuses users.  When it comes to ‚Äúaddiction,‚Äù heavy physical dependence on chemicals like nicotine or heroin immediately comes to mind.  In the case of the Internet, we are talking only about psychological dependence, which is now recognized by the doctors themselves. <br><br>  What disease can we talk about now, when the Network has become part of the life of most normal people and is considered ‚Äúsick‚Äù rather by those who persistently avoid the Internet?

      Of course, the Internet is such an attractive technology that 12.4% of users admitted that they were ‚Äúabused‚Äù by it, that is, they stay online longer than originally expected.  About 12% sure that you need to reduce the amount of time on the Internet  But at the same time, people who ‚Äúabuse‚Äù the Internet have <b>absolutely no negative</b> health <b>effects</b> .  Doctors are forced to officially recognize this fact.  This means that the notorious ‚ÄúInternet addiction‚Äù cannot be considered a disease or mental disorder. <br><br>  However, doctors do not give up hopes to find these negative consequences.  They suspect that about 5-10% of Americans experience lack of sleep, insufficient physical activity, poor health and appearance, decreased communication with other people, as well as dry eyes, tunnel syndrome, diseases of the hands and fingers - all of this is allegedly a consequence of a painful attachment to the internet.  A typical ‚Äúpatient‚Äù is a single man, 30‚Äì40 years old, who is engaged in ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù things on a computer about 30 hours a week. <br><br>  Researchers from Stanford conducted a telephone survey on a sample of two and a half thousand respondents, this is the first study of this kind.  His results are published in the October issue of the <a href="http://www.cnsspectrums.com/">International Journal of Neuropsychiatric Medicine</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4552/</a></p>
