  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GDPR. Practical advice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone has heard of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), which takes effect on May 25, 2018.  Fines are big and have to match.  Like any official document, it is written dryly and can be interpreted in different ways.  Over the past six months, I have analyzed a dozen different web systems for compliance with the GDPR, and the same problems have been encountered everywhere.  In this regard, the goal of this article is not to clarify what is GDPR (much has already been written about this), but to give practical advice to technical people on what needs to be done in your system so that it corresponds to GDPR. <br><br>  A couple of interesting points on the rules: <br><br><ul><li>  If there is at least one customer from Europe whose personal data you store, you automatically fall under the GDPR </li><li>  The regulation is based on three main ideas: protection of personal data, protection of the rights and freedoms of people in protecting their data, restricting the movement of personal data within the European Union (Art. 1 GDPR) </li><li>  UK is still in the EU, so it falls under the GDPR, after Brexit the GDPR will be replaced by Data Protection Bill, which is inherently very similar to GDPR (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection -bill /) </li><li>  Seriously limited data transfer to third countries.  The European Commission determines which ‚Äúthird‚Äù countries or sectors or organizations in these countries are allowed to transfer personal data Art.  45 GDPR.  <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm">Here is a list of allowed countries</a> . </li><li>  It is clear that no one will let the supervisory body inside the system, which means that it is only ‚Äúon paper‚Äù that can demonstrate how abrupt the security of the system and processes are.  If the security of processes, systems and personal data is not documented, then the company does not correspond to the GDPR.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a rule.‚Äù (Art. 24 GDPR) </li></ul><br><h2>  Putting GDPR into practice </h2><br>  Public pages on the site
