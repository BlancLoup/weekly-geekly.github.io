And then, in December, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/LG_Russia/blog/163353/">they wrote</a> that the terms of the competition had been revised, and eight weeks were given to those who wanted to add and refine their ideas. <br><br>  Eight weeks have passed, the competition has moved to an active stage, active tours, testing and voting of the jury and various communities have passed, and, as we promised, on April 5 the winners received prizes. <br><br><img alt="Image #1766706, 130.1 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f3/9e4/675/7f39e467524b19aab3a38d3507330ccd.jpg" title="Image # 1766706, 130.1 KB">

      To be honest, we did not expect such a return from the competition, so time after time to sift out the contestants was not easy.  It so happened that the date of the award ceremony coincided with the III International Forum Apps4All held in Moscow, and we decided to combine our event with the forum held.  About the winners, prizes and discussions can be read by clicking <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Top places </h4><br><h5>  First Place - Top Applications - vTelek </h5><br>  Special application for Smart TV, allowing one-click to send videos from the social network vk.com and other video sequences directly to your TV screen. <br><br><h5>  Second place - Best apps - Clever TV </h5><br>  The application analyzes the viewer's preferences, viewing history, selects interesting content for the viewer and dynamically forms a queue of video using VoD and Live media transmission media. <br><br><h5>  Third place - Best applications - Simple Smart IPTV </h5><br>  The application allows you to watch IPTV channels provided to the user by his provider.  The base of the application contains almost fifty providers, over three thousand unique sources of video content.  It does not require the purchase of the console or rent it from the operator. <br><br><h5>  The best socially significant application - Smart Job </h5><br>  Quite an unusual application for TV, offering smart TV owners to use a large base of vacancies. <br><br><h5>  The best educational app - Smart Bookshelf </h5><br>  An even more unusual application, offering to read e-books from the TV screen;  tired of reading, the user can switch to the listening mode.  Fortunately, all LG models that support Smart TV have excellent picture quality and resolution that is optimal for their diagonal.  We hope that users will appreciate the quality of the text display in this application. <br><br><h5>  The best entertainment app - Football </h5><br>  A game in which the player is asked to hold the ball in the air for as long as possible using the LG Magic Motion remote. <br><br><h5>  Additional nomination - Best interface solution - Smart IPTV </h5><br>  This application took the third place, but won the hearts of the jury with its fresh look at the interface of such programs. <br><br><h5>  Ideas Contest - Legendary Adventures in 3D: Carrebian Islands </h5><br>  Again the game, which this time is a fencing simulator with elements of a shooting gallery.  As a controller, it is proposed to use the Magic Motion console, a low bow (and an excellent bonus as a prize) to the author for such an interesting approach to our console. <br><br><h5>  Audience Award - Smart Cinema </h5><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is that the application complements the already existing films of the gaming component.  While watching the film, at key moments, viewers are invited to answer questions about possible options for the development of the plot.  When the action comes to the events described in the question, users are awarded points, in accordance with their choice.  He is very good at training intuition, although the authors of the questions will have to try to avoid obvious ‚Äúspoilers‚Äù and not spoil the sensation of viewing. <br><br><h4>  Discussion on the basis of the Third Apps4All Forum </h4><br><br>  In addition to awarding developers, in the framework of the III Apps4All Forum, LG organized a discussion panel dedicated to developing applications for the Smart TV platform and discussing the prospects for the development of Smart TV in Russia and in the world.  On the panel, the winners of the application competition told about their own projects and shared their development experience for smart TVs. <br><br><img alt="Image #1766701, 122.8 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be1/626/d7d/be1626d7d517229f990cca5d4cc085b7.jpg" title="Image # 1766701, 122.8 KB"><br><br>  The President of LG Electronics in Russia, Daehyn Song, also performed on the stage. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe are very pleased to be present at the digital platform, which brings people together, defining the future of society with their smart ideas and developing smart applications.</i>  <i>Our technical and scientific approach to supporting local content providers and application developers has evolved in parallel with the Apps4all forum.</i>  <i>And, precisely on this platform, our vision and opinion on the development of widgets in the future coincided.</i>  <i>We consider it the responsibility of the manufacturer to hold contests that support Russian developers, programmers and engineers.</i>  <i>I have always stressed that evolution is only meaningful when it serves people, providing them with a variety of content and opportunities.</i>  <i>This is the main theme of LG in the field of applications for 4 years, ‚Äú</i> - said Mr. Song. <br><br>  The International Developer Forum Apps4All is an innovative platform for information and business interaction between Russian application developers, mobile ecosystem experts and mobile device manufacturers. <br>  <a href="http://forum.apps4all.ru/">The third Apps4All Forum brought</a> together more than 800 participants on its platform to discuss new trends in the creation and distribution of multiplatform applications. <br><br><img alt="Image #1766703, 155.2 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f4/7c6/48d/0f47c648dee75b9cfc8fc20b31b13200.jpg" title="Image # 1766703, 155.2 KB"><br><br>  The company Apps4All is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/">present</a> at Habr√©, and their author @DaryaZ writes excellent weekly digests about the development for mobile platforms. <br><br>  We are pleased that our collaboration with App4All has allowed us to create an effective platform for improving and developing software for our smart TVs.  And most importantly, we showed that the desire to create new applications, motivated by pleasant gifts gives an effective and unexpected result, when hundreds of contestants are desperately fighting for victory, not so much because of the prizes, but because of the desire to show people that their application can help. entertain, teach, guess the desire and just make Life's Good. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and see you again on the pages of our blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175265/</a></p>
