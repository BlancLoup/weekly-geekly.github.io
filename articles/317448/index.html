A simple criterion by which we judge the popularity of a job is the number of responses that it receives during the month.  What determines the number of responses?  What do applicants pay attention to? <br><br>  The obvious answer is, of course, salary!  Yes, the salary is really important, we ourselves often <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/315992/">talk about it</a> .  But work is not only a place of earning, but also a place where we spend a significant part of our life, we communicate with colleagues more and more often than with friends and even with family.  A third of life, according to the most modest ideas, is somehow ‚Äúat work‚Äù. <br><br>  Do the figures confirm that applicants who respond to a vacancy are not only important to the salary indicated in it?  Yes - we regularly see that the number of responses to the same vacancies, with the same salary, located in the same city, but related to different companies, may differ significantly.

      In today's small study we will try to look closer at those non-monetary factors that influence the choice of work.  In the first part, let's see who is ready to change his current job without changing salaries and why he is ready.  In the second, how often new employees come at the invitation of friends and what influences this. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/317448/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/911/c49/832/911c49832a5a3a56bba231b3d557f8e0.png" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  We surveyed more than 1600 people, users of ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù and ‚ÄúHabrakhabr‚Äù.  We received a habitual cut for us, the same as in all our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/313756/">other</a> surveys.  Most of our respondents are programmers: backend and front-end developers, developers of mobile applications and software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b9/ff8/047/5b9ff80478e24181a80b59de096b0ea8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13a/2b3/8aa/13a2b38aa32b40428fcd5d9ad6bd4d81.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Part 1. What non-salary factors affect the choice of work for IT professionals</b> </h2><br>  So what factors, other than salary, can determine the choice of work for an IT professional?  To find out, we asked everyone to answer the next question and received the appropriate distribution of answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05c/f16/f87/05cf16f87f0049e7bc6aa71dde854985.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It turned out that the salary is the only condition for changing jobs only for every fourth IT specialist (highlighted in yellow in the diagram).  Only 25% of respondents see no reason to change jobs if they are offered the same duties with the same salary!  For most, there are many other, additional, factors that may affect the final decision to change jobs. <br><br>  In the first place are <b>professional factors</b> (highlighted in green in the diagram).  Every second can go into a more interesting project.  Two of the five can be carried away by more interesting technologies.  One of the three is a more interesting area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company. <br><br>  In second place <b>are comfort factors</b> (highlighted in purple in the diagram).  Almost one in three can be seduced by a good office and better working conditions.  Every fourth - more convenient work schedule or proximity to the house.  Every fifth - the presence of a social package.  All these are material factors, in some ways close to salary. <br><br>  However, this second place is disputed by a completely intangible <b>factor - the value factor</b> (highlighted in orange in the diagram).  So, every fourth is ready to change jobs only because the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company coincide with his personal. <br><br>  In third place are <b>communicative factors</b> (highlighted in blue in the diagram).  Every seventh may go to another company, if there are his friends there or if a more interesting corporate life awaits him. <br><br>  Finally, in the fourth place are the <b>factors of the</b> company's <b>prestige</b> (highlighted in yellow in the diagram).  Every tenth may go without a change in salary to a larger or well-known company. <br><br>  As we see, most of the factors contributing to the choice of work are intangible or, more precisely, do not always directly correlate with money.  If a company wants to attract specialists without increasing its salary costs, it must be able to manage these factors and communicate its hidden benefits. <br><br><hr><br>  We looked at non-salary factors of job changes in the industry as a whole.  It will also be interesting to see how they are the same depending on the age or field of activity of the specialist. <br><br>  Below are the color highlighted 4 age groups.  The height of each color bar indicates how many percent of people of this age indicated that this factor could motivate them to change jobs without an increase in wages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb5/e70/e0d/bb5e70e0d716445584ad78f40599a4d6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, for young people in college age more than for other age groups, <b>fame</b> is important <b>, the size of the company and company values</b> , and less than others the <b>social package or proximity to home</b> . <br><br>  For the most adults who have stepped over 40 years of age, <b>proximity to home is</b> more important than others and <b>acquaintances among colleagues, corporate life, fame or company size are</b> less important. <br><br>  For young people from 20 to 30 years, compared with those who are between 30 and 40, <b>acquaintances among colleagues, corporate life, fame and size of a company</b> are slightly more important. <br><br>  The color below highlights the individual specialties.  The height of each color bar indicates how many percent of people in this specialty indicated that this factor could motivate them to change jobs without an increase in salary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/881/007/f6f/881007f6f1d54e4eb91e52034e1070ec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We see that for administrators and testers, compared to other specialists, the <b>values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company are</b> less significant, and for managers and designers are more important. <br><br>  For testers, the <b>proximity of work from home is</b> more important than other professionals, and designers, on the contrary, are less important than others. <br><br>  For managers, the <b>work schedule is</b> more important than for other specialists, and the <b>interestingness of the project</b> , oddly enough, is less important than others. <br><br>  For designers and managers, <b>interesting technologists are</b> less important than other specialists, well, this is understandable, they do not work with code. <br><br><hr><br>  How do companies manage to convey their work advantages to their potential employees?  To find out, we asked the following question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de7/352/c5e/de7352c5e1a243178253d1f01dbecbf1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It turned out that for more than 40% of the respondents their ideas about the working conditions in the current company were worse than they really are.  This suggests that very, very many companies do not convey to applicants of their advantages and advantageous qualities.  Recently, by the way, we wrote about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/314152/">how to convey the benefits of a company to IT professionals</a> using the example of a company profile on My Circle. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Part 2. How friends influence the attraction of new IT specialists to the company</b> </h2><br>  In the second part of our research, we will try to figure out how IT professionals will learn about their future work and what role the word of mouth plays in this process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/309/48a/267/30948a2679af46c6981070980e35e1f6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We all know that new specialists come to IT companies, including on the recommendation of their friends who are already working in the company.  For us, it turned out to be some surprise how big this factor is. <br><br>  On average, most often they find work on their own, responding to a posted job - every third person said so.  But on the second place in frequency was a friend's recommendation - every fourth came to the current company in this way.  Every fifth person is found by a recruiter.  Every twelfth initially wanted to work in this company. <br><br>  This is an average.  And if you look at how the above factors are distributed depending on the type of company, you will see that a friend's recommendation is the main channel for attracting employees in state-owned companies and start-ups.  And for small private companies, this factor is much more significant than for large ones. <br><br>  Driving new employees with the help of their friends already working in the company does not require direct cash costs from the company.  Unlike posting vacancies or using the services of recruiters (both their own and external ones).  Therefore, it is very important to understand under what circumstances this channel will work.  This understanding and take on. <br><br><hr><br>  To do this, we need to attract the NPS Loyalty Index (Net Promoter Score).  This technique was first proposed in 2003, and since then has gained immense popularity for decision-making in the field of business, product, marketing and personnel management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eac/ba2/c72/eacba2c72e927006de0fdf4f6d3bf5a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, NPS is considered so.  The respondent is asked: ‚ÄúHow likely is it that you would recommend company X to your friends / acquaintances‚Äù?  And it is proposed to estimate this probability from 0 (I definitely will not recommend) to 10 (I will definitely recommend). <br><br>  Then we look at those who indicated 9 or 10, we call them "supporters": these are the ones who most likely will recommend to friends.  Those who have pointed out 7 or 8 are called ‚Äúneutrals‚Äù: ‚Äã‚Äãmost likely they are passive people who will not do anything at all.  And finally, those who pointed from 0 to 6 are called ‚Äúcritics‚Äù: those who are more likely not to recommend to their friends, and with low marks, on the contrary, they will dissuade their friends. <br><br>  Next, subtract the percentage of ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù from the percentage of ‚Äúcritics‚Äù and get the desired ‚Äúloyalty index‚Äù.  It can vary from -100 (some ‚Äúcritics‚Äù) to +100 (some ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù).  It is believed that if it is positive, then organic growth is possible only due to loyalty.  And if it is very large, then growth is possible without additional advertising.  Conversely, at low rates, it is possible to fall and shrink.  <a href="http://radar-research.ru/goals/client_loyalty_and_satisfaction/net_promoter_score/">Learn more about the method</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  First, let's look at how the type of company and its fame affect the willingness to call your friends for company employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec7/0b6/2be/ec70b62be3ee4fdda5f59530cfa15991.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, much more willing to recommend their company as an employer are those who work in a large private company or a startup, or in a company that is known throughout the IT industry.  And the least willing to recommend those who work in a state-owned company, or in a company that is unknown to anyone. <br><br>  NPS is obtained as follows.  As you can see, only companies that are well-known in the IT industry as a whole have a positive NPS, zero NPS among large private companies.  And the NPS is strongly negative for state-owned companies and little-known companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f19/cd7/5c8/f19cd75c857546ec994812918bd283ca.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br>  And how does the readiness to recommend your company affect the duration of work in this company or the remoteness of work in it?  We see that with the growth of seniority NPS on average falls - according to another diagram, it is clear that this is happening because of an increase in the share of ‚Äúcritics‚Äù with the same share of ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù.  Those who work in the office are a little more loyal to their company - among them there are slightly fewer ‚Äúcritics‚Äù and almost as many ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7b/d8a/d30/b7bd8ad301bb4e23925041e247c67695.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br>  So far, we have rather considered external factors of a company that affect the likelihood of inviting our friends to our company.  These factors are largely insurmountable or difficult to overcome for companies. <br><br>  But finally, we got to the most interesting.  Namely, to those internal factors on which the company can influence management methods, without increasing cash costs.  We have identified 6 such factors, but in fact they can be much more.  We asked on a scale from 1 to 5 to assess how satisfied one or another factor was with the employee.  Then they crossed these answers with their answers about their readiness to recommend the company as an employer to their friends.  And that's what we did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa2/f5e/2b1/aa2f5e2b131244ee97771ec511002da7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It turns out that if satisfaction with the factor is average (more or less), then NPS turns out negative and varies between -30 and -50. <br><br>  A positive NPS can only be achieved by those companies that more than satisfy their employees.  Moreover, this positive loyalty index will be approximately the same, in the region of 30, for all factors, but the factor of understanding how their tasks relate to the company's goals will be slightly lower. <br><br>  Worst of all, loyalty is affected by disrespect to the professional opinion of the employee.  By this factor, NPS can very quickly reach -90!  Following the potential negative impact, there is a lack of understanding that the company's product is really needed by people.  Here NPS can quickly fall to -80.  But dissatisfaction with salary, oddly enough, the least of all factors affect loyalty destructively.  And it can only reach the mark of -60. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Let's sum up </h2><br><ol><li>  In this small study, we showed that in addition to salary, there are many other factors that affect the choice of IT professionals in your company.  And some of them can influence much more strongly: first of all, we are talking about such professional factors as project and technology. <br><br></li><li>  A job in more than 40% of companies turns out to be much better for an employee than he originally expected.  A lot of companies do not convey their strengths of the employer to future employees.  And the high salary has absolutely nothing to do with it. <br><br></li><li>  One of the main channels for attracting new employees is the recommendation of their friends to those who are already working in the company.  This channel does not require direct cash expenditure, and therefore companies should pay enough attention to it to attract good specialists to themselves without making wages higher than others. <br><br></li><li>  There are many internal factors that increase the likelihood that current employees will recruit their friends to work.  The company can influence these factors again only at the expense of internal organizational resources. </li></ol><br><hr><br>  All charts are prepared using the service <a href="http://infogr.am/">infogr.am</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317448/</a></p>
