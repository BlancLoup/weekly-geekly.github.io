To my great surprise, the number of pluses outweighed the number of minuses with a gap of 80 points.  Unexpected popularity has been very helpful.  I was approached by many web programmers who want to become co-founders of my startup NextMusic.TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4dd/2ac/96b/4dd2ac96bf677746c4996c70746dff48.jpg"><br><br>  My search path partner STO does not look like a fairy tale.  It is rather an action adventure comedy-dramatic action movie.  Given the relevance of this topic, I hope that my experience will be useful for someone. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <br><h5>  Hell </h5><br>  Hell began in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178463/">last article</a> .  He was quite a lot and in different guises.  All this hell gave me invaluable experience.  In this article I will tell you how I managed to dispose of this experience and eventually come to the happy side. <br><br><br><h5>  New understanding </h5><br>  Having filled the abundance of cones, I understood for myself an important point.  I saw that there are globally two extremes between which a person can remain. <br><br>  One extreme is when stability, current well-being is in the top priority in life.  This extreme is comfortable when there are clear tasks, answers to the question ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù, When responsibility is minimal.  If not, then even better.  ‚ÄúWho is to blame?‚Äù - ‚ÄúNot me.‚Äù Uncertainty, lack of a source of instructions, increased responsibility cause pain, discomfort, fear, disgust, and someone has a rage. <br><br>  The other extreme is when, on the contrary, any instruction from above enters into a rage.  When they infuriate any encroachment on freedom of choice in any sphere of life  Comfortably - this is complete responsibility for everything.  ‚ÄúWho is responsible for all the failures and successes in my life?‚Äù - ‚ÄúOnly me.‚Äù The question prevails in my thoughts: ‚ÄúWhat do I need to change in myself, my actions in order to achieve the goal?‚Äù.  If everything is known in advance, then immediately boring.  Uncertainty, a challenge to faith and will for the sake of a big goal spark eyes and an interest in life. <br><br>  Each of these extremes is useful for a particular type of activity. <br><br>  Entrepreneurship, and especially startup in its initial stage, as the highest degree of uncertainty, brings happiness only to those who are closer to the second extreme.  I will not say that I am completely at the second extreme, but somewhere between 68-73% I am exactly in it, and I want more. <br><br>  I tried to stick people from the first extreme to a startup.  I tried to stick a hired programmer, freelance, professional outsourcing and a partner on the s / n.  At the exit - it was always a mockery of all participants in the process, leading to the finish lines of varying degrees of trouble. <br><br>  Realizing this, I decided to change the conditions under which I would seek partnership with the future STO. <br><br><br><h5>  New conditions </h5><br>  The main new condition is no salary, only a fraction.  This item immediately eliminated all those who are not ready to take full responsibility, swim in obscurity, to take the full risk. <br>  The second condition is to do part of the work for a startup before the partnership.  Such an item immediately extinguished the motivation of those who are in the business purely for the benefit of.  Such an item attracted those who are really in love with the project, whom the process itself actually inserts.  Who is ready to do it, simply because he likes. <br><br>  On this occasion, I personally remembered and felt very deeply one moment.  Through the mass of my past projects, I saw that in any business there are always periods when everything is difficult and long, although at first you believe that everything will be easy and fast.  In any business there are periods when the project brings nothing but hard work: no profit, hopes and success.  During such periods, the moral energy dries out very quickly, you can even dry out physically, get sick and hard. <br><br>  But there is one essence, an exception that energizes in any conditions - it is the love of the project itself.  For example, when it is hard for me once again, I turn on the music to my hellish mood with the help of my startup and charge myself with energy like an atomic reactor.  I have a real love for the project.  He solves my own problem of finding the flow of music in the mood.  Sometimes you want to hug him for it. <br><br>  I decided that the SRT should have the same thing, so that he would live happily ever after, like our cooperation. <br><br><br><h5>  New approach </h5><br>  In addition to the conditions, I also changed the approach to finding a partner. <br><br>  First of all, instead of inspiring speeches, on the contrary, I talked about all the real complexities of a start-up life, which one has to give up and for what.  How much risk, uncertainty and how much responsibility.  In general, told the truth-womb.  The enthusiasm of the trio of the majority, and the second conversation was no longer there, even if they said otherwise in the process. <br><br>  The second thing I gave the real task of the project.  You want, you can do.  You do not want, you can not do.  It's not obligatory.  Those who did not want (‚Äúcould not‚Äù, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time‚Äù, ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù ‚Äúthere were other more important matters‚Äù), he also stepped aside. <br><br>  The one who coped with the tasks most enthusiastically, briskly, quickly, confidently became the service station of NextMusic.TV, namely, Andrei Transsky, a programmer wagon with more than 20 years of experience, the owner of php.su. <br><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  What our partnership now looks like. <br><br>  My responsibility is business, perpetual experiments, research, prototypes, testing, searching from an infinite number of unknown directions of the next known point for the vector of the company's development, testing hypotheses on customers, communicating with mentors, investors. <br><br>  Responsibility of SRT is the embodiment of a found vector, a proven hypothesis in the most priority, optimal way, organization of work in a team of developers. <br><br>  No disputes, everything is smooth, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is clearly distributed, everyone sticks around the clock, does not whine, no one needs to kick with kicks, control, everyone is delighted with what results it produces.  Compared with previous partnerships, like bud something from hell to heaven. <br><br>  New foundation. <br><br><br><h5>  Incubator </h5><br>  On May 20, we drove together to the HappyFarm business incubator, working shoulder to shoulder.  July 20 ends the first acceleration period before traveling to the United States.  A lot of interesting, productive and informative, as I will write in the next article. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbd/350/2ff/bbd3502ffb61ccb6540569b652257989.jpg"><br><br>  PS Thanks to Andrew, who embodies the ideal business partner of my dreams, and Karpolan for the perfect link with everyone :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186524/</a></p>
