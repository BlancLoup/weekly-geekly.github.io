  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Appnique debuts with a new service that will help developers with ASO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Seattle <a href="https://appnique.com/">Appnique</a> , a new startup from mobile industry veteran Jai Jashimha, aims to help application developers achieve higher positions, making them more visible in the iOS and Android app stores.  This is the newest project aimed specifically at ASO (App Store Optimization, App Store Optimization) space, a new generation of search engine optimization that explores keywords, headings, and descriptions to take the app higher in search and, accordingly, help the app climb to the top. charts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05e/176/f0b/05e176f0ba029cacb26324705415693f.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ASO is actually a new SEO.  The recent surge in interest in optimizing is due to changes made by Apple in the new App Store, which was updated this fall in iOS 6. Due to the fact that Apple‚Äôs new search engine offers icon-style search results, not lists, as it was before , for developers from the "long tail" of applications it has become even more difficult to make their applications can be detected by potential buyers.  Especially for developers in such crowded space as games.  The only correct solution is to focus on what combinations of keywords will help raise the application higher in a highly specialized search in the app store.

      However, it is easier said than really to understand what these keywords are.  That is why services such as <a href="https://searchman.com/">SearchMan</a> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/161071/">our news on Habr√©</a> ) and <a href="http://www.mobiledevhq.com/">MobileDevHQ</a> from AppStoreHQ are becoming increasingly popular among developers and publishers of applications.  Together with analytics and other measurement and research tools offered, for example, by companies such as Distimo or App Annie, developers and marketers can find out what really works, what impact the changes will have and what other developers are doing in their field. <br><br>  Appnique is going to do the same.  The service offers developers an online dashboard, with which they can identify the right keywords for their applications, compare them with keywords from other developers, and track changes in their specific niche. <br><br>  According to Jashimha, the founder and CEO of Appnique, the point is not only to propose a new ASO system, but also in a method that will differ from the competition.  Jashimha says that he "works on mobile applications as much as they exist" and uses his extensive experience for the new company.  Before that, he worked at RealNetworks, as well as a mobile search company, Medio, and most recently left AOL, where he was vice president of mobile technology and products, before setting up Open Mobile Solutions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAn important lesson for us is the fact that many more people know how to build applications than they want to serve them with systems like OMS,‚Äù he tells about his earlier projects.  "And everyone who develops applications has problems finding them." <br><br>  <b>Why do you need a tool like Appnique?</b> <br><br>  With Appnique, the company algorithmically identifies who the developer‚Äôs competitors are, what keywords they use, what they do, and what effect this has on their ratings and chances of being detected. <br><br>  "Other SEO products give you keywords and, in effect, duplicate App Annie," says Jashimha.  "But no one tells you that one of your competitors just changed the description and it raised the rating, or that your rating fell after you posted the new version, or that someone posted the new version and that's what it was , or that you received a surge of views, or your average rating has changed, "he notes, laying out one by one examples of the application of these tools. <br><br>  This information is not only displayed in the online charts on the Appnique website, but is also regularly sent to e-mails, informing developers of the measures they should take. <br><br>  Due to the fact that Appnique conducts a broad structural analysis of two app stores, this tool also reveals general trends in the app market as a whole.  For example, out of 1 million applications that he currently tracks in US app stores, he already found 580,000 version updates, 503,892 updated descriptions, and 350,000 updated titles (from September to mid-December).  This means that developers are struggling to make their way in the market with their applications.  ‚ÄúThe scale has hit us extremely hard,‚Äù says Jashimha. <br><br>  <a href="https://appnique.com/">Appnique</a> can be used for free for a single application, and the cost of paid versions ($ 50, $ 200 or $ 1000 per month depending on the size and tasks) varies for larger development centers. <br><br>  The company is currently in the process of raising funds, having already received $ 400,000 from investors such as Mike Rowell (Chomp, engineer at AdMob), Rudi Gadre (former Facebook general consultant and former vice president of Amazon.com) and others.  It is expected that the total amount of funding will range from $ 750,000 to one million dollars. <br><br>  The company has just recently completed a private beta with several dozens of developers.  Now, any developer can register <a href="https://appnique.com/pricing">here</a> to join the testing of the public beta. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163343/</a></p>
