This also includes the technology of Wi-Fi, which has become the most popular in the world.  It is difficult to find a building and a place in a large metropolis where such a data transfer method would be common.  Therefore, disputes about the possible harm from electromagnetic pollution of the environment do not subside.  In some cases, this even led to mass anxiety of the population, as it was in the United States several years ago, when many Americans moved from large metropolitan areas to a village where there was no wi-fi-signal.  The reason for this migration was the so-called ‚Äúwi-fi allergy‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If we discard the disease not confirmed by official science, and turn to research, it becomes clear that the constant impact of strong microwave radiation on the human body does not pass for him without a trace and is fraught with health problems. <br>  Due to the fact that the number of Wi-Fi devices in public places is growing steadily, and to increase the bandwidth of the access points are placed close to each other, the signal level from all devices in total can exceed the permissible norms. <br><br>  Wi-Fi devices operate in a non-ionizing range of radiation that does not have such harmful effects as ionizing radiation.  The latter, in turn, is able to form ions in the substance that it affects.  There are several types of ionizing radiation: alpha, beta, gamma radiation, and neutron radiation.

      However, non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation can also affect living organisms due to thermal and non-thermal effects, which can cause significant damage to health.  Below will be presented some materials on the effects of Wi-Fi signal on the biochemical composition of blood and hematology. <br><br>  Hematology is a branch of medicine that studies the blood, blood-forming organs and blood diseases.  In addition, hematology includes the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of blood diseases. <br><br>  In the experiment, which will be discussed below to study the effect of Wi-Fi on the biochemical composition of blood, mice were used, since their biological characteristics are similar to humans. <br><br>  At high signal strengths, Wi-Fi can cause a ‚Äúheat effect‚Äù that can damage living cells.  That is why there are sanitary standards that recommend the power of Wi-Fi routers 0.614 V / m (0.1 W / cm2) for access points installed in an open area and 0.19 V / m (0.01 W / cm2) for indoor use.  When measuring the level of cell damage from radiation, the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is used.  It is measured in watts per kilogram of tissue (W / kg).  SAR is a quantity that measures the rate at which an organism absorbs energy when exposed to an electromagnetic field.  The limits of SAR in the United States and Europe differ.  In Russia, radiation is measured in watts per square centimeter. <br><br>  The scheme of the experiment conducted by the researchers was as follows.  An antenna with a signal generator operating at 2.4 GHz is directed to cell ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  The cell is located at a distance of a meter from the radiation of the antenna in its far field.  It is worth knowing that the far zone of the antenna is an area where the angular distribution of the field is independent of the distance to the antenna. <br><br>  In the cage "B" planted 15 male mice.  It was located near the signal generator, so the radiation should have had almost no effect on them.  The experiment lasted six months, during which test mice were irradiated for 8 hours daily. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f5a/da6/caa/f5ada6caa77c4804b063574b512f3713.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To determine the far zone of the antenna, you must first determine the wavelength <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b9d/7b8/6e4/b9d7b86e4d3343bf9ac402049e0dc295.png" alt="image"><br><br>  where c is the speed of light, f is the radiation frequency. <br><br>  Then the far zone is determined by the formula <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/32c/559/44d/32c55944dad0431ca7a9535dc4b8da68.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Where D is the length of the antenna (in the experiment it is 0.267 meters) <br><br>  In order to eliminate the possible negative effects of water and food on the quality of the experiment, mice were fed diet food, purified water, and the room temperature was set at a constant room.  Two weeks later, the first group of experimental mice, three from each cell, were sent for biological tests.  Two weeks later, another group of mice was sent for testing, and so on until the remaining rodents. <br><br><h3>  <b>results</b> </h3><br><br>  The first adverse biological effects from Wi-Fi began to appear after the first four months of testing.  In particular, in experimental mice under irradiation, brain tissue and liver were inflamed, and lung tissue abscess was observed.  In mice that were not exposed to radiation, no deviations were shown in the analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/38b/81e/99f/38b81e99fa794448b6e2cc269ab416e2.png" alt="image"><br>  N = NORMAL;  D = cell degeneration (cell damaged). <br><br>  The appearance of normal and degraded tissues of various organs is shown in the figures.

In turn, the tendency to increase shows aspartate aminotransferase.  As a rule, liver injury can lead to similar changes.  That is, changes in AST and ALT confirm the presence of degradation of liver cells. <br>  After one month of exposure to radiation, the level of Globulin decreases.  Two months later, an even greater tendency to decrease is visible.  The level of glutamyltransferase is well below normal.  On the contrary, the level of lactate dehydrogenase was higher than normal.  This enzyme has the property of being released when cells are damaged, and a high level of ammonia in the blood suggests that the liver is simply unable to convert ammonia into urea, which leads to hepatitis. <br><br>  The levels of Globulin (whey protein) become significantly lower than the normal range after a month of exposure to microwave radiation, and this level further decreases after another 2 months of research.  The level of glutamyltransferase (enzymes) is significantly lower relative to the level, and the level of lactate dehydrogenase for all samples under the influence of microwave was significantly higher compared with the normal value.  Note that this enzyme is released from the cells into the bloodstream when the cells are damaged.  A high level of ammonia in the blood indicates that the liver is unable to convert ammonia to urea.  This in turn can cause hepatitis. <br><br>  The results of the study speak for themselves - microwave radiation has an adverse effect on biological organisms.  When exposed to radiation for a long period, changes in the tissues of the organs begin, and the biochemical parameters of the blood also deviate from the norm.  This clearly shows that Wi-Fi radiation leads to the degradation of certain organs and tissues. <br><br>  Sources: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5296279/">http: //ieeexplore.ie...cument/5296279/</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6944290/">http: //ieeexplore.ie...cument/6944290/</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1232183/">http: //ieeexplore.ie...cument/1232183</a> / <br>  4. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6717901/">http: //ieeexplore.ie...cument/6717901/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373459/</a></p>
