  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pay taxes - sleep well</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/43825/">this</a> . <br><br>  Every day, ten men gather at the bar to drink a glass of beer, and get a total bill of $ 100.  They paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it looked like this: The first four people (the poorest) did not pay anything.  The fifth paid $ 1.  The sixth paid $ 3.  The seventh paid $ 7.  Eighth - $ 12.  Ninth - $ 18.  The tenth (richest) paid $ 59. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All ten daily drank beer at the bar and were quite pleased with the established order.  Until the day the bar owner threw a bone of contention to them.  "Because you are such good customers, he said, I‚Äôll give you $ 20 a day for your daily drinks."  Now drinking at ten cost not $ 100, but $ 80.  The group still wanted to continue to pay its participation on the same principle that we pay taxes.  Therefore, the first four discount did not affect.  They continued to drink for free.  But what about the rest of the group - paying?  How did they manage to divide the $ 20 that had fallen from the sky, so that everyone would get their fair part "? They calculated that $ 20, divided into six, gives $ 3.33 each. But if you subtract this amount from what everyone pays, then it will be the fifth and the sixth will still receive a surcharge for his drink. Therefore, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair if everyone paying a discount was a relatively equal amount. He even decided to calculate what the discount would then be due to each of the payers. and the first four  oh, I didn't pay anything (100% savings). The sixth now had to pay $ 2 instead of $ 3 (33% savings). The seventh began to pay $ 5 instead of $ 7 (28% savings). The eighth was $ 9 instead of $ 12 (25% savings). Ninth - $ 14 instead of $ 18 (22% savings). The tenth paid $ 50 instead of $ 59 (16% savings). Conditions for all six improved, and the first four continued to drink beer for free.

      But, having left the bar, the drinking buddies started counting the money saved.  "I received only one dollar out of all $ 20," exclaimed the sixth and pointed to the tenth, "and he received $ 10!"  ‚ÄúAha, really,‚Äù supported the fifth.  - I also saved only a dollar.  It's not fair that he got ten times bigger than me! ‚Äù  Seventh shouted: "Indeed!  Why should he get $ 10 if I only get two?  All the benefits are always rich! ‚Äù‚Äú Hey, wait, we didn't get anything at all, ‚Äùthe first four screamed.  ‚ÄúThis system exploits the poor!‚Äù All nine disgruntled surrounded the tenth and firmly beat him. <br><br>  The next evening, the tenth did not come to the bar, so the first nine sat down at the bar and drank their beer without it.  But when it came time to pay the bill, trouble was revealed.  They did not have enough money to pay even half of the bill! <br><br>  And this, boys and girls, journalists and university professors, shows how our tax system works.  People who pay the highest taxes benefit most from tax cuts.  Increase their taxes, beat them for their wealth, and they may no longer appear.  In fact, they can start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is more friendly. <br><br>  I do not put copyrights, I received it through 10th hands. <br><br>  PS <br>  For those who understand, no explanation is needed.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43893/</a></p>
