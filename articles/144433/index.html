The Internet is a special area, specific.  Seas and oceans, land, airspace, space and ... the Internet.  So who owns the Internet?  Will the national states share power under the UN auspices, will they seize the power of the corporation, or will the Internet belong to the people?  But if people - what will it look like?  Anarchy?  Freedom of piracy?  Or the power of an organized civil society?  I will describe two scenarios.  And you decide - which of them will become a reality.  And also I will tell about the new social concept - ‚Äúthe trade union‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Who owns the Internet?  States?  UN?  Nobody wants it all.  Who manages the Internet?  Partly - it is a corporation, partly - the state.  Who governs the states?  As a rule - corporations or oligarchic clans (which is essentially the same thing).  XX century - the century of ideology.  Who ruled the world?  The world was ruled by ideologies and ideologues.  The world was ruled by ideas.  Socialism, communism, capitalism, fascism, national socialism ... Be that as it may, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Corporatocracy</a> won.  In this war, people did not win, no country won.  The corporations won, the oligarchy won.  Nationalism flared bright flames just to go out forever.  ‚ÄúThe decline of Europe‚Äù, which O. Spengler predicted at the beginning of the last century, has finally arrived.  The European civilization, and with it the American, perished.  The souls of the nations perished, their Spirit.  Proud Germans and fierce Vikings, fierce Franks and bold Gauls ‚Äî they were all tired of fighting and winning.  All of them are outdated, outlived.  Those who at one time violently crushed and tore up the Roman Empire, now they themselves are trying, though in vain, to protect their crumbling empire from the influx of barbarians.  Europe and America ... They smell of old age and corruption.  Their well-fed peace is reminiscent of a well-fed and tired old man.  They are fighting with the hands of immigrants, as the Roman Empire fought during the hours of its death with the hands of barbarians.  They are served by immigrants, workers from other countries, while their indigenous people prefer to live at the expense of the state, but just do not work.  What distinguishes an old man from a young man?  The old man wants peace, is not inclined to change his point of view.  Yes, maybe he is wise (rarely).  But, there is no life in it.  He stands with one foot in the grave.  He does not know what life is.  He only lives by the memories of life.  Life is passion.  This is a pulsating flow, this means breathing deeply, speed ... Life is a passion.  Everything else is just a memory, an imitation of life.  So - "Corporatocracy" is an imitation of life.  This is a virus, a dangerous disease, infection.  All the ‚Äúold men‚Äù suffer from such sores.  When civilization has aged, even young people look old.  Look at teenagers and young people!  What is in them?  Is there passion in them?  Is honesty?  Courage?  What are they ready to fight for and are they ready for anything at all?  They are ready to spend, ready to exhaust themselves in nightly feasts, orgies, computer games and other items of energy waste.  Willing to spend, but not ready to achieve anything, not ready to create.  Our society is more and more like a sinking ship.  And everyone is not averse to escape from this hell, leaving the others to die.  Or do not run?  Why don't they understand that it's time to leave?  No, everyone understands.  But, they also understand that they themselves cannot survive on the high seas, that they have to keep to standards, to be like everyone else.  Otherwise you will have to take responsibility for your life.  And so, if with all, it will fit ... Those are also forbidden to "fish" in the open sea.  They hire workers for this purpose.  And after that they sell people what they could get.  They inflate prices, pump up fish with water and freeze, soak rotten fish in vinegar, and then they smoke or fry.  Yes, these sly and predatory people are those who use the position of a prolonged shipwreck.  They promise that the ship will not sink while they are in power.  And this is enough for people.  If only the skin was intact.  However, no one thinks that the ship, although it does not sink, does not float anywhere.  It stands still, stands aground ... <br><br><h4>  Option number 1 - "Corporatocracy" </h4><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe corporatocracy is not a conspiracy, but its members do have common values ‚Äã‚Äãand goals.</i>  <i>One of the most important goals of a corporatocracy is the perpetuation, continuous expansion and strengthening of its system.</i>  <i>The lives of those who "do this", her entourage - mansions, yachts and personal jets - are presented as role models to inspire us to consume, consume and consume.</i>  <i>Any opportunity is used to convince us that the purchase of goods is our civic duty, that the plundering of the planet is good for our economy and, therefore, serves our highest interests.</i>  <i>People like me are paid colossally high wages to promote the system.</i>  <i>If we do not cope, comes the turn of jackals, even more malicious killers.</i>  <i>If they fail, it is the turn of the military. ‚Äù</i> <br>  John Perkins.  "Confession of an economic killer" <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfZ4qF0LEyE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfuE0fh9l9V2EhkiW0A64tylCr9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It makes no sense to prove how destructive the existing social order is.  If someone does not notice how dangerous the current situation is, then any arguments will be only a matter of discussion.  Therefore, I will not be long and in detail to paint the "bright" future of Humanity under the rule of corporations.  Dozens of ‚Äúdystopia‚Äù films, dozens of books, documentaries and hundreds of articles have already done this for me.  If you are not familiar with them, then you are not interested in this topic.  I can only offer to view the video.  Everything is quite clear, and even detailed.  Particularly logical is the aftermath of corporatocracy in the near future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w947gLC0CNs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1GNe6uDk6SwdMg8lTjFG2-t5MWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I will say briefly - the Internet is waiting for the fate of television.  Zombing, hype, management tastes, political views.  If we take into account the list of the most popular TV channels, programs and serials, then we can confidently call the influence of television on a person‚Äôs mind more negative than positive (again, people who make it popular mass make it. In itself, television is only opportunity for both development and degradation).  Still leave the question of the negative version of our future.  This issue has been devoted a lot of time by science-fiction writers and directors.  It is better to pay attention to the positive scenario. <br><br><h4>  Option number 2 - "Profocracy" </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúProfocratia‚Äù - professio - from Latin ‚Äúprofession‚Äù, ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù, Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ - from the village-Greek ‚Äúpower‚Äù.  ‚ÄúProfocracy‚Äù is the power of specialists, the power of professionals. <br><br>  Today, society has reached the peak of egalitarianism.  Postmodern culture, expressing a rejection of tradition, authority, authorship brings up only negative trends in society.  The society has lost the guidelines of development and existence in general.  Lost cultural standards.  To solve this problem can only reorganization of society on the principle of professionalism.  In each area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity, the power should belong to the specialists (the most experienced), around which circles of specialists with less experience and authority should be formed.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new social concept is to form creative workshops.  The existence of such workshops will become the real basis of civil society.  The prototype of the creative workshops are trade union organizations, civil organizations, foundations. <br><br>  Creative workshops.  The society will be divided into specialist workshops.  For example, a large IT workshop will include small workshops for programmers, designers, system administrators, etc.  It is this workshop that will manage the Internet, since only people from this workshop understand the essence of this technology.  The workshop will be organized according to the type of trade union, but with the difference that it will unite the representatives of this profession throughout the world into one organization.  Organizations of this kind will be able to resist the arbitrariness of corporations and even states, with their national claims.  All employees will receive absolute protection from the employer, and the employer, in turn, will be protected from non-professionals.  the structure of the workshop will be designed in such a way that more talented and experienced specialists occupy higher positions.  Everyone will have their own rating inside the workshop.  A person who is not located in this type of activity will not be able to enter the workshop.  Schools and universities will be organized inside the workshop.  More experienced will train beginners.  Payment to teachers will be deducted from the general box office, which will be formed by regular fees from all members of the workshop.  The workshop is a multinational state with its own laws.  Inside each country, all parties will be replaced by workshops, each of which will receive representation in parliament.  People unite on a professional basis, not on the basis of political concepts and ideologies.  No, this does not mean that the poor and rich will disappear, that equality and universal prosperity will come.  No, all people are different.  And the shops are different.  There will be rich and poor workshops, large and small workshops.  There will be poor and rich.  But there will be no super rich people.  And since super-wealth will not be possible, then poverty will not be possible.  Profit will be controlled by the shop.  And part of the profits will be transferred to the world organization.  So this money will be redistributed among the "poor" workshops.  The market will not be as free as it is now, but will be partially regulated.  The land will belong to the peasants, the factory workers, and the Internet - IT-specialists!  No, this is not communism.  Under communism, all power belonged to the Soviets (party nomenklatura) ‚Äîa separate class, exploiting the whole of society to please itself and ideology.  Profocracy - gives power over a certain area to the type of people who are directly related to it.  Power does not mean that they will own and collect all profits.  Power means good governance and reasonable control.  The policy in turn (in the sense of - the management of the state, its budget and natural resources) should be handled by the best representatives of all departments of society. <br><br>  <i>... And there must be a movement that counteracts the social entropy that has embraced modern democratic societies.</i>  <i>The principle of action directe, the spontaneity of individuals and groups will upset the old policy.</i>  <i>The immediate, primary life will prevail over the secondary and reflected life of politics.</i>  <i>Political parties and their leaders are likely to lose all meaning, and strong people will not be promoted through parties.</i>  <i>Parliaments with their fictitious, vampiric life of growths on the body of the people, incapable of fulfilling any organic function, will finally die out.</i>  <i>The exchanges and newspapers will no longer control life.</i>  <i>In social life there will be a simplification, a return to more elementary processes of the struggle for existence.</i>  <i>Social life will have to join the original sources of life, to become more natural, less artificial.</i>  <i>People will probably be grouped and connected not on political grounds, always secondary and in most cases fictitious, but on economic, directly vital, professional, in the spheres of creativity and labor.</i>  <i>The old classes and classes die off, and professional groups of spiritual and material labor take their place.</i>  <i>Trade unions, cooperatives, workshops, of course, have a great future.</i>  <i>And this is a sign of a return to the Middle Ages on a new basis.</i>  <i>Political parliaments - degenerated talkers - will be replaced by business professional parliaments assembled on the basis of representation of real corporations, which will not fight for political power, but solve life issues, solve, for example, agriculture, public education, etc.</i>  <i>essentially, not for politics.</i>  <i>The future belongs to the syndicalist type of society, of course, not in the sense of revolutionary syndicalism.</i>  <i>Success can only be a policy in which decisive social radicalism will be combined with the hierarchical beginnings of power .....</i> <br>  N.
