  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money at work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the crisis and the massive layoffs caused by it, job search sites (job sites) are becoming increasingly popular.  Yury Virovets, President of the <a href="http://hh.ru/">HeadHunter</a> group of companies, which owns one of the most famous and convenient jobs, told how these sites function and what you need to pay attention to if you decide to develop such projects. sites in RuNet. <br><br>  At the beginning of the lecture, Yuri Virovets spoke about the scheme for generating income and the sources of income for job sites. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost job sites are focused on taking money from employers.  First of all, it is beneficial because in this case it is necessary to contact with a smaller number of people.  In addition, employers are able to pay more and know exactly what they want and what budgets are ready to allocate for this.  What do job sites sell? <a name="habracut"></a>  There are two types of ‚Äúgoods‚Äù:

      1. Advertising, first of all, the vacancies themselves.  In general, job sites in the US and Europe earn just by posting jobs.  Moreover, the pricing system is very incomprehensible - that is, the determination of the price for a separate vacancy.  It varies considerably from country to country.  The lowest prices for job placement - in Russia and India.  Slightly departing from the topic, I will note that on the Internet, the price, unlike the traditional economy, is not tied to the cost price.  Rather, it is tied to a competitive situation.  For example, when we determined the price for a job placement for the first time, we asked several employers what price they thought were reasonable and set a slightly higher cost.  And in the future, monitor the prices of competitors and make the necessary changes. <br><br>  2. Information.  Providing information is a type of service that usually takes up a smaller share of the budget.  It is to provide access to databases.  This service is not so widespread in the world, because HR specialists are more willing to work with those applicants who have shown interest in the vacancy.  That is - with motivated candidates.  Even taking into account the fact that a large number of specialists who do not comply with the requirements, respond to vacancies.  However, in HeadHunter, access to information services occupy a significantly larger share.  They are responsible for 60 percent of revenue. ‚Äù <br><br>  Then Yuri Virovets went on to describe the characteristics of competition in the market for job search sites. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn conditions of tough competition, it is necessary to use even minimal differences from competitors for one‚Äôs own purposes,‚Äù he noted.  ‚ÄúCompetition among job sites is based on several parameters. <br><br>  1. <b>Brand.</b>  On the Internet, always be the first number.  If you occupy the first place in the niche, then your income is much higher than the income of the one who occupies the second place.  If you can not provide primacy - create your own niche, where you will still be the first.  A job site is a brand when a user who is thinking about finding a job first of all has a thought about this particular site.  If you have made a strong and convenient site, but have not made a strong brand, you will most likely be expected to fail.  After all, any technical solution can be copied.  Online business is done in the minds, and marketing for an Internet company is at least 50 percent of success.  One of the most difficult issues is whether to launch new projects under one well-known brand or for each project it is worth developing your brand.  While the story does not give an exact answer.  We went both ways and until we came to the multi-brand picture. <br><br>  2. <b>User interface.</b>  It is clear that the site interface can be improved indefinitely.  After all, this is the most important parameter that makes your site attractive to the user.  The convenience of the site determines the user's choice. <br><br>  3. <b>Technology.</b>  When choosing a technology for a site, it is always necessary to keep a balance between development speed, complexity and low cost.  At the same time it is necessary to think about the future.  We must initially plan the development of a system that can cope with significant loads. <br><br>  4. <b>Services provided.</b>  It is important that you understand what can be automated, what is technologically easier to make, to make life easier for the user.  Here your own user experience may be useful for you - you yourself can understand what can be improved and simplified. <br><br>  5. <b>Business plan and financial plan.</b>  It is important not to be afraid of these plans to write and take responsibility that you implement them.  I saw a lot of startups with business plans, but at the same time very few people applied a table to them, which would list the estimated revenues for at least the next two years.  You need to somehow contrive and think about exactly how you will receive income.  Most often, when you present a business plan to investors, this is not a reliable and accurate forecast (everyone understands that a startup is a risk), but an indicator of your psychological self-confidence. ‚Äù <br><br>  The President of the HeadHunter group of companies also stressed the critical importance of organizing an effective sales system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are different sales arrangements that are located between two extremes. <br><br>  1. The scheme according to which the majority of job-sites, including us.  There are many sales managers who are engaged in calling and coaxing customers.  A model of this type is very costly, because the time of managers is expensive.  For this reason, the profitability of job-sites is one of the lowest in the Internet. <br><br>  2. The sales department may be absent altogether.  As, for example, until recently was at Yandex.  Customers come themselves.  Whether or not such a model is possible depends on the business.  And thank God, if you have such a project.  In general, a competent sales organization is very important (I believe that 90 percent of HeadHunter‚Äôs success is due to the fact that we initially relied on a good sales system).  For example, it is important to foresee the introduction of a CRM system so that your sales will not take your customer base from you.  At HeadHunter, we specifically control that sales managers do not forget to drive their contacts into the system. ‚Äù <br><br>  During the lecture Yuri Virovec answered questions of interest to the audience. <br><br>  <b>- What kind of CRM do you use in HeadHunter?</b> <br>  - Currently we have a self-made CRM installed.  However, we are going to give it up and introduce the purchase. <br><br>  <b>- What is the principle of the classification of occupations?</b> <br>  - Classification is a very difficult question.  Because it is hard to understand what to choose as a criterion for such categorization.  In the beginning we approached the cataloger from the position of a recruiter.  Now we are introducing a system based on groups of synonymous concepts, which will allow the user entering keywords to get the catalog corresponding to his query. <br><br>  <b>- How is the company going through a financial crisis?</b> <br>  - Like most others - we optimize costs.  We had to cut a number of branches.  We moved our call-center to Yaroslavl, and the development center in Penza had to be reduced - now the Moscow center is responsible for all development issues.  Also, traditionally in times of crisis, the marketing and HR departments were partially cut. <br><br>  <b>- How are vacancies distributed by specialization and region?</b> <br>  - Of course, Moscow and St. Petersburg are leading among the regions.  They are followed by Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar.  Krasnodar, by the way, is generally a very advanced city in terms of the development of Internet projects.  Many successful and interesting projects from there.  By specialization, a greater number of vacancies are accounted for by Internet technologies, finance, sales, and logistics. <br><br>  <b>- What do you think will happen to the job market for young professionals?</b> <br>  - I think that quantitatively it will change slightly - employers will still need such specialists.  However, it is possible that the level of salaries offered will decrease. <br><br>  <b>- Do you do start-up projects?</b> <br>  - Yes, we are engaged in such projects.  There are still many less developed projects around our main site.  In addition, we are buying and already running projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46978/</a></p>
