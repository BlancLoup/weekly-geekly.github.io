  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Four AI passed the Rorschach test. And that's what they saw:</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Characters</b> : <br>  There were four bots, CaptionBot from Microsoft, Watson from IBM, WolfAI (aka Image Identification Project) from Wolfram Alpha and Imagga from Imagga Technologies.  I wanted Google‚Äôs Vision API to take part too, but in order to register, I had to enter a credit card number, so I abandoned the idea.  I myself also took part so that readers could compare the results of bots with the result of natural intelligence. <br><br>  For those who do not know, CaptionBot and others like it are image content recognition programs.  And quite advanced, they are able to recognize a large number of a wide variety of items.  In this way, they compare favorably with highly specialized programs that are trained to recognize only a few specific categories of objects (such as cats).  And it is precisely by this that they are interesting in the context of the Rorschach test, for the specialist program will at best see those few items that she has been trained on.  For example, if genital organs are onenals, then she will see them everywhere, giving the impression that the test was performed by a sex maniac.  In the case of CaptionBot and Co., some kind of intrigue is already being created, since it is impossible to predict in advance what exactly they will see. <br><br>  All four bot responded in English, so there may be inaccuracies caused by the translation.  Also, some bots displayed several versions of what they see in the picture, in this case I chose the versions that were assigned the highest probability.

      I took drawings from the Rorschach test wikipedia article, since they are in the public domain for years.  I used images in the highest resolution. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5e/751/dbf/c5e751dbf96fb05a47e7440ff5f3d1a9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Puzzle. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Monster. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : The peacock-eye is small. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I do not have confidence, but I think it is a bird flying over the clock (Note: this means stationary watches, that is, watches that cannot be worn). <br>  <b>I</b> : In the middle, I see a headless woman in a coat and an hourglass figure who, in horror, clutches at the place where the head should be.  She has a belt with a big badge on her belt.  Mittens are on hand.  To the left and right of it, I see the head of the devil.  Each devil has horns horizontally, the nose is long and sharp, the beard is long and sharp, the eyes are small and deep-set, the look is unkind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/267/d2d/37e/267d2d37e602d6374672989b8a1000d9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Design. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Vegetation. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Seashell. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I think this is a piece of cake. <br>  <b>Me</b> : A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wing">plane with a delta wing</a> that will have a powerful flame erupt (a white spot in the middle).  The rest of the picture is incomprehensible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efc/c62/1b3/efcc621b3401f44ecd3c61fc39f8c7af.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Silhouette. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : (No answer). <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Device. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I do not have confidence, but I think it is a bird flying in a vase. <br>  <b>Me</b> : Two naked eaters-cannibals practicing black voodoo magic.  At this point in time, they conjure something with a boiler.  The rest of the picture is incomprehensible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6e/4d6/194/f6e4d61949ce719611f4c58246153815.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Terrier. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Bird. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Insect. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I do not have confidence, but I think it is a bird flying in a vase. <br>  <b>Me</b> : It looks like the head of some alien monster with a trunk, hanging ears and no eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf1/adb/135/cf1adb1353b2717a6b42a53ee6202c56.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Alpine Mountain Goat. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Bird. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Stegosaurus. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I think it is a bird flying in the sky. <br>  <b>Me</b> : Looks like a bat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a5/426/e0b/3a5426e0b9cfeb750b719e6bb7b91141.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Black. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Airplane. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : European <b>Angelfish</b> . <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I have no confidence, but I think this is a train with smoke coming from it. <br>  <b>Me</b> : I see a waterfall and a huge humanoid statue standing on top of the onon waterfall in a pose reminiscent of the statue of Christ the Savior from Rio de Janeiro.  He has an infula (catholic miter) and antennas on his head, two left and right.  He has four arms, but instead of claw fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bca/e22/a47/bcae22a478dce6938a62e0b41a5b7ef4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Ice. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Necklace. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Water tap. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I have no confidence, but I think this is a train with smoke coming from it. <br>  <b>I</b> : I see two fists "face to face" and a heated thumb up at each of them.  Below them are the faces in the headdresses with plumes, I think it is hussars.  The rest of the picture is incomprehensible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e5/117/5d2/2e51175d27836c263e0955abd40ea506.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Creation. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Vegetation, flower. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Butterfly Orchid. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I have no confidence, but I think this is a cake. <br>  <b>Me</b> : On the left and on the right there are two kind of pink tailless beasts with slender figures, like wolves, and blunt (in the sense of not sharp) short muzzles like beavers / bears.  With their paws, they hold onto the wings of a huge blue-winged bat.  Opposite her, the revived skeleton of a humanoid lizard with a long neck is studded with bone plates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac3/1d3/8a2/ac31d38a2eb1a98c6de928fd3e5bbeac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Watercolor. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Watercolor. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Dental plate (unsure, but it seems to be translated as "dental plate"). <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I have no confidence, but I think this is a piece of cake. <br>  <b>I</b> : Here I pass.  Alas, but at least in something more or less meaningful, this picture does not fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b6/cd3/980/8b6cd3980dbe75966747aede444435f7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Imagga</b> : Watercolor. <br>  <b>Watson</b> : Vegetation. <br>  <b>WolfAI</b> : Pinata. <br>  <b>CaptionBot</b> : I do not have confidence, but I think this is a cake from which smoke comes. <br>  <b>Me</b> : Pass again.  Alas, but at least in something more or less meaningful, this picture does not fit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395063/</a></p>
