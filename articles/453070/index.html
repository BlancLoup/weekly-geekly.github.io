  <section class="page js-page"><h1>L - logic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new puzzle game with a very simple, but at the same time, interesting mechanics: the player is given a set of 5-7 pictures - you need to define a logical chain by which these pictures can be lined up, and , select them in order.  If in the process of selecting images the player makes a mistake by trying to select the image not in turn, then the whole construction is discarded, and the images are mixed.  Absolutely any topics that are only able to connect different and not very objects can act as the logic of a union. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1f/6f3/dfc/e1f6f3dfc4e17bd44bba0f5d2f98ff99.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game, and I decided to embody it in a mobile application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, of course, I began to collect references about what is already on the market.  But it turned out that, despite all the simplicity of my idea, there are no logical games with similar mechanics.  Mostly on the subject came across games as follows: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ol><li>  ‚ÄúCompose words from a small set of letters.‚Äù  Letters are arranged in a circle on the screen - the player must combine them into words.  Yes, the tactile component of my idea is almost the same as in these games, but the goals are different. </li><li>  Classic tasks like "Identify the last picture (or number) of the logical chain." </li><li>  Games with huge sets of the same type of levels ‚ÄúFind a closed pair‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuickly click on the same picture‚Äù, ‚ÄúSelect all the same pictures on the screen‚Äù. </li></ol><br>  It's not that.  And this is good. <br><br>  Google's search yielded logical chains of pictures for children, the overwhelming majority of which, again, were ‚ÄúComplete the logical series.‚Äù  There were also sets corresponding to my idea, but there were few of them, and the number of pictures in them did not exceed four, and I needed 5-7. <br><br>  In the end, I sat down to compose my own logical chains.  This is what I want to tell. <br><br>  Everything that could be found on the Internet, I, of course, collected and refined to my own format: 5-7 pictures in a chain.  But the main array of levels for the game had to be written by myself, actively involving relatives in the creative process.  Children with pleasure and in large numbers gave birth to new ideas for levels, many of which came into play in my implementation.  Then the children with no less pleasure solved the finished tasks.  The game proved to be viable, accessible and interesting for all ages, and writing logical chains turned out to be a very exciting exercise, a useful workout for the mind.  I divided all levels according to complexity into two groups: children will be interested in lungs, and adults will solve them easily;  heavy ones will make adults think, but children can also try to solve. <br><br>  In the course of work on the levels, clearly defined themes emerged - tasks with the same logic of building chains.  Here are some of them (I will not tell everything, in order not to spoil the game too much). <br><br><h4>  Counting quantity </h4><br>  All levels in which the pictures differ in the amount of some common feature fall into this topic.  The player needs to determine what this sign is, and arrange the pictures in ascending or descending order. <br><br>  The most numerous topic and easy to write assignments.  We can take any object (a geometric shape or an object from life), and with a high degree of probability it will have a feature that can be changed by quantity.  If it is difficult to determine such a sign, then we can simply draw a different number of these objects.  The theme ‚ÄúCounting the quantity‚Äù is a boundless field for creativity. <br><br>  Here is a simple example from the game - the number of points on the dice (in the illustrations of the levels I will arrange the pictures in random order so that you can solve these tasks yourself): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6b/118/2e7/d6b1182e73642bef3686832a5ddf5cfb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In order for tasks not to seem too simple, you can mask the common feature - to draw objects so that it does not catch the eye immediately.  For example, geometric shapes can be superimposed on each other, making it difficult to count the number: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7a/fc6/0b4/b7afc60b43f0592348d38abbce44bad3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Very interesting tasks are obtained when a group of completely different objects is taken, but with one common feature: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93b/e8f/e01/93be8fe0142a36fff4d72abf0aa911ec.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Common feature </h4><br>  A group of objects, at first glance, very different, but united by any one common feature.  The player needs to understand what unites these objects, and arrange the pictures from one extreme value of a common attribute to another. <br><br>  For example, objects with different temperatures: from the coldest to the hottest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d7/fc8/9e9/6d7fc89e985a5044e9221d3ab8be3505.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Very interesting and beautiful topic.  True, in the production requires the mobilization of fantasy and high costs of drawing. <br><br><h4>  The history of development </h4><br>  A group of pictures that show the historical development of a phenomenon.  Accordingly, the player must arrange the pictures in chronological order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b8/fa1/32a/7b8fa132a964a08c6e58bdae53061324.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Adding Details </h4><br>  Logical chains for attention.  The first drawing has the lowest detail, and one detail is added to each subsequent one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9c/2e0/30d/b9c2e030d5b7391778b9c2cd7b24b0b0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This topic, as well as counting the number, has tremendous opportunities for creativity.  We take any cute object with a sufficient number of parts and remove them one by one. <br><br><h4>  Difference in one detail </h4><br>  This topic is like adding details, but much more difficult to solve.  Requires increased attention.  Here each subsequent pattern from the chain differs from the previous one in one detail.  Accordingly, the extreme figures (with which the logical chain begins) will be those for which there is only one adjacent figure.  All the same average pictures will have two neighbors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/0fd/f6f/7970fdf6fecab2582ca75a6348057ce2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For this topic, you need to take objects that have a sufficient number of different signs to change them one by one. <br><br><h4>  Processes </h4><br>  My favorite topic.  And the most difficult to compose.  It contains logical chains illustrating natural or industrial processes separated in time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b77/025/f5e/b77025f5effe1fad17d2918e4dcca6f2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Among other topics: step by step overflowing of one shape into another, animation frames, changing colors.  There are also exotic tasks outside of themes, for example, a chain of notes of various duration, Roman numerals in order.  Writing levels, I tried to bring as much as possible a variety of tasks. <br><br>  I invite you to play the game, show it to your children, help them solve difficult tasks.  Perhaps you and your children will want to come up with new logical chains: write, I will definitely draw levels according to your ideas - especially since I have daily updates of the levels.  It is possible that someone even wants to use the tasks from the game for classes in children's clubs - it would be mega-great! <br><br>  I hope it was interesting.  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453070/</a></p>
