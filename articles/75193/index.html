As a result, sales of this company amounted to $ 900 million, bringing to the creators both huge money and recognition of the world community.  But there were other people ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The RSA cipher (under a different name), but up to the coincidence of all designations, was opened in <b>1969</b> .  At the headquarters of the government communications in the UK, a cipher was suggested, which was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cox</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_J._Williamson">Malcolm Williamson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Ellis">James Ellis</a> , the employees of this organization. <br>  Due to mathematical complexity, the UK cryptographic authorities <u>did not accept</u> this cipher as a working tool.  What is the difference?  Rivest, Shamir and Adlerman published the algorithm in the open press, and he became known to everyone, and these people, as officers of the secret service, wrote the code they developed to their superiors.  They did not succeed in convincing the authorities in the year 69 in England, because then no concept of one-way functions existed.  Yes, they were used, but they were objected to the arguments about the difficulty of decomposing the product of two simple large numbers in the spirit of ‚Äúwell, there are a few mathematical problems, it will take 3 years and some student can arrange everything for you.  So what are you going to do?".  And the cipher was rejected.  The description was put "on the table", but because  they were employees of the secret service, they imposed the top secret, therefore there was no talk of any publication.  It was removed only in 1983, this is 6 years after the open publication of RSA.  The fun is that they denoted p and q - prime numbers, n - product, d from decription, e - encryption, and in general the algorithm was identical ... <br>  Thus, 3 people who could take the place of Rivest, Shamir and Adlerman could only follow the distribution of a full copy of their algorithm, which they were not allowed to publish.  It is known that the National Security Agency (USA) tried to fight against the proliferation of the RSA algorithm after more and more people started using it, but the attempts were unsuccessful.  Asymmetric encryption has firmly entered our world ... <br>  This, of course, is not the only case.  Often, secret theorems (for example, from lattice theory, group theory, Boolean algebra, etc.) of strategic importance were declassified no longer during the life of the author, thus the date of the creation of the theorem was later than the death of the author himself.  But about this, another time :) <br><br>  Source: Professor Saliy Vyacheslav Nikolaevich, Saratov State University, Saratov. <br>  I apologize in advance for inaccuracies.
