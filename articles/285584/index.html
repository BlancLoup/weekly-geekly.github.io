  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recruitment for the benefit of the business, triptych</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, people often hear from various sources about the low professional level of recruiters.  On the one hand, candidates who do not trust the fairness of the assessment complain.  On the other hand, employers complain that they do not receive the necessary specialists on time, who receive low-qualified specialists, who cannot start the project at all / win the tender due to the complete absence of the necessary specialists.  In many ways, low rates in the selection are associated with a short-sighted approach to the organization of the recruiting process.  If you look at this problem from the business side, you see 3 main areas in which recruitment should work in order to meet the needs of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Strategic recruiting at the stage of presale.</b> <br><br>  In my work, I have seen only situations when a recruiter is sent a job application with the estimate ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù.  Sometimes it happened like this: ‚ÄúBefore 18.00, we need an answer whether there are such specialists on the market and how many‚Äù.  Yes, the recruiter now has the tools and tools to make approximate calculations.  In large companies, there is a base of candidates, which can also give plausible results with a small statistical error, but still.  If recruiters had information on planned projects in the company, on the company's near-term development plans, on strategies in technology areas, as well as in business areas, this would allow to allocate the appropriate part of each recruiter‚Äôs working time to search and establish contacts with specialists that may be interesting. companies in the future.  In addition, the awareness of the fact that your work in a very definite way helps the company to develop increases the motivation of almost every specialist, increasing his involvement and involvement. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caf/f69/262/caff69262c8725244dd536768574d5d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If we talk about the feasibility of such a ‚Äúpresale recruiting‚Äù, then many may doubt it, because in this case we do not offer work right now, and even sometimes we can‚Äôt stipulate any deadlines in advance, will such communication be interesting for candidates?  I am sure that if one describes the situation correctly for them, then such a strategy will not only gain trust, but also respect for the target audience. <br>  The benefits, I think, are quite obvious.  If you have enough time to find specialists for upcoming projects, you can make it more targeted and thorough.  Especially if before the company did not hire specialists of a certain profile, or a presumptive project uses technologies that are new to the market in which stuffing is expected.  With this approach, you can get contacts and agreement from potential candidates in advance, or find out that there are no such candidates in the market, and take alternative steps to start the project. <br><br>  <b>2. Market analysis.</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      Each recruiter to some extent has information about the labor market in which he works.  We know about him from candidates when we ask them about current projects, the employer, previous jobs.  However, such information cannot be called market analysis, since our information is fragmentary, unsubstantiated, sometimes it is even just rumors, and the conclusions we draw may be hasty and baseless. <br>  Analysis can be called the use of information obtained from several independent sources, structured according to certain parameters, as well as constantly updated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1d/95c/f9a/c1d95cf9a8ecca623b2553d6b7f8d475.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This can not boast of any company that I know.  Now the entire IT world is talking about big data and data analysis.  At the same time, none of the IT companies in the Belarusian market has yet taken care of storing valuable information in the right form, as well as using the statistics made on their basis, while many pay considerable money to get such statistics from staffing and consulting agencies. <br>  To collect such information in the agencies there are special programs using anonymous surveys and mass mailings, which is worth serious financial investments.  Every recruiter receives such information every day in the work process for free.  The question of analysis here is only to unify the data and store it in an ordered manner, providing access to it and the creation of statistical reports on predetermined criteria. <br><br>  <b>3. "Hot recruiting."</b> <br><br>  I think that this process I need to tell the least.  Of course, recruiting in areas that are relevant to the company at the moment, should take from a specialist in the selection of most of the working time.  However, this process can be simplified and much more effective if it already contains elements of a strategy: preliminary agreements with potential candidates, long-term relationships with applicants, information about donor companies and competing companies, general awareness of the market situation. <br><br>  Such a strategic approach can not only reduce the time for hiring staff, but also make recruiting processes more predictable, and hence manageable.  In addition, it allows you to integrate recruiting into the company's internal processes, which significantly increases the efficiency of work, including in production, and also simplifies the implementation of changes. <br>  As for the benefits for HR department itself, the work according to the described scenario gives recruiters the opportunity for professional growth and development through a deeper understanding of the business and the market in which they operate.  The correct understanding of business goals, in turn, ensures their correct translation, as well as the most accurate assessment of applicants, which means the selection of suitable specialists to the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285584/</a></p>
