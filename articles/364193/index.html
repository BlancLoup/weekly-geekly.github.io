The device, which we will talk about today, belongs to the budget segment (7-8 thousand rubles).  At the same time it has a nice thin body (6.9 mm) and a complete set of four colored covers.  The 4.7-inch device was a logical addition to the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini SE - also a ‚Äúchameleon‚Äù, but with a 4.3-inch display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/916/99c/1f2/91699c1f27ef489a8fc473ca02e526d5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Contents of delivery</font> </h2><br>  Omega Prime S is packed in a classic Highscreen box made from recycled cardboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ed/a48/985/2eda48985ca441b8b0137b3ce1c5212c.jpg">

      Highscreen Omega Prime S, like its predecessor, the Omega Prime Mini, comes with interchangeable panels.  True, instead of five of them was 4. A pity.  Also in the box in addition to the phone itself, you will find unpretentious headphones-headset, USB-cable and charger, warranty card and brief instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/09e/475/5e609e47536741949ca27360f1631d51.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Design</font> </h2><br>  The device, in my opinion, turned out pretty.  In general, the latest Highscreen models are made in the same style and are quite recognizable.  It‚Äôs not to say that the tubes are ‚Äúhooded‚Äù from various Chinese factories.  Highscreen Omega Prime S is similar to Omega Prime mini, except that the screen has become larger and the device itself is thinner (6.9 mm case versus 7.8 mm).  Before us is definitely one of the thinnest smartphones in the budget class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a09/0cb/e1a/a090cbe1a1f2428bbd11086c5b0d79bf.jpg"><br><br>  The weight of the device is only 100 grams: when you first take it in hand, you are immediately struck by the lightness.  Before us is not a ‚Äúshovel‚Äù - the streamlined Highscreen Omega Prime S body is comfortable to hold and use with one hand, it doesn‚Äôt interfere in the pockets of clothes at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2f/9ed/663/e2f9ed6639e644a5955bd83c7e9b490f.jpg"><br><br>  The highlight of the device give four interchangeable panels.  By mood, you can make your phone a classic white or black (matte panels), and if you want to add colors, you can get juicy yellow and red covers (glossy).  You can change the mood, but you can - as wear (from unpleasant accidents no one is immune).  The panels are pleasant to the touch, do not slip into the palm of your hand.  I was pleased that fingerprints are almost imperceptible on glossy covers.  It is also worth noting that the side keys are built into the interchangeable panels, that is, their color also changes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/72b/c68/81772bc685374fdc8d26b42f9f14139c.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel collects fingerprints with a bang.  And all because of the lack of oleophobic coating.  Screen protection - plastic.  About Gorilla Glass there is no question, however, the material is resistant to the appearance of scratches - for the month of the test no noticeable appeared.  By the way, initially on the display there is a protective film.  When the screen is off, the frame is almost invisible. <br><br>  The assembly of Highscreen Omega Prime S is beyond praise - no squeaks and backlashes.  Even the periodic change of paneles did not affect this. <br><br>  Let's look at the tube from all sides.  Above the display is a front camera, light and proximity sensors, a speaker.  Below it is the round Home touch key (similar to that of Meizu) and ‚Äúback‚Äù from the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù in the form of dots (at first you get confused because it is not clear where it is).  The backlight is comfortable, not blinding at night. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/239/f3e/8fd/239f3e8fd0384868a271593ef91508ef.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side - the "rocker" volume control, on the right - the lock button.  The keys are well located, somewhat tugovat, but the move is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7b/1f5/c94/a7b1f5c9462c4beaaf9313ca0ef67676.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eff/587/2e6/eff5872e67bc4d95a4374f625e83251c.jpg"><br><br>  The connector for the cable is located at the top, next to the audio output.  This is not very convenient if you need to talk on the phone connected to the charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6be/eac/9d0/6beeac9d019749cbb616ef82f71a1eb5.jpg"><br><br>  The back panel can be removed easily (just press a special groove with your fingernail), it is mounted on a set of latches.  Under it, you will see a battery, two slots for micro SIM cards (as usual, only one slot works with 3G networks) and a slot for a memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27a/163/1be/27a1631be23d45e4ba18dfbd3eba7de4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dd/854/697/0dd854697c4148a0b6252b763d9a47df.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Screen</font> </h2><br>  On displays in Highscreen usually do not save.  Prime S has a very decent matrix.  Diagonal - 4.7 inches, resolution - HD 1280x720 pixels.  The picture is clear, not talking about any graininess.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS, without an air gap, which means a lively and juicy picture.  Of the shortcomings - a weak depth of black, not enough high brightness of the screen, which also falls, if you look at an angle.  The image fades badly in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfc/414/d48/dfc414d4804f453195a303f38dc8af37.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Camera</font> </h2><br>  The main camera is 8 MP.  For a state employee, the photo quality is more than decent.  Autofocus works well and relatively quickly, the macro mode is also quite good.  In low light, frames are acceptable, although digital noise is noticeable.  Moving objects are often "smeared."  There is an HDR mode.  I think the undemanding user of the Prime S camera will be more than enough for everyday photography.  The front camera is 2 megapixel: the quality of the photo and video is average - for the ordinary "selfie" will come down (on a chat to chat - too). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba9/68f/7c4/ba968f7c4376486c96eccc2ff9e03cd4.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/4e9/133/6b04e9133b0d415999f0f8dc010e42d5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23d/0db/6fa/23d0db6fac33425499e5532d921b9e36.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fda/84f/3e1/fda84f3e13214282af573ca92a7f96e5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  But as for the video - here, like the predecessor of Prime mini, there are problems.  Autofocus is constantly trying to tune, because of this, the image is fuzzy, while moving the lens, the picture ‚Äúbeats‚Äù into squares, the sound is not the best.  Video resolution - HD 720p at 30 frames per second. <br><br>  The interface of the application for shooting is standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e3/c59/362/9e3c5936290e48a7ab1e5ef24a3ddd4f.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Battery</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen Omega Prime S is equipped with a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1,750 mAh.  By modern standards it is not enough.  Especially if you consider not the most economical processor from Qualcomm.  But what can you do - a thin body requires sacrifice. <br><br>  During the test, one charge was enough for me for about a working day.  That is, you get up at about 8 in the morning, during the day a total of two hours go online through 3G, about an hour on Wi-Fi, listen to music for about an hour (watch videos, work with programs or games), talk for 20-40 minutes, take a few photos , sometimes you run a GPS to determine the position and build a route.  Well and everything, on the way home (approximately at 19 o'clock) Prime S is already almost discharged.  If you are less active on the Internet, then the phone will be enough for a day.  In any case, it is best to always carry an external battery with you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Hardware</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen Omega Prime S is powered by a 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 MSM8212 platform with ARM Cortex-A7 processor cores (28 nm process technology, 1.2 GHz frequency).  Graphic accelerator - Adreno 302. Chipset, though budget, but modern. <br><br>  The amount of RAM - 1 GB, flash memory - 8 GB (about 4 GB available to the user, no more than 2 GB for program installation).  The situation is saved by a slot for microSD memory cards with support for cards up to 32 GB.  For the sake of interest, we tried to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the device with a 64 GB card - he did not ‚Äúsee‚Äù it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/a80/9ae/c26a809aef2f4cee8ece6c917e765bdf.png"><br><br>  The device turned out very fast.  The software ‚Äúflies‚Äù and there are no ‚Äúlags‚Äù of the interface even with complex tasks in the background (for example, installing multiple applications, loading large amounts of data, copying files).  There are also no complaints about the launch and operation of "heavy" three-dimensional games (in particular - Asphalt 8, Real Racing 3, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 5), which is perhaps not surprising, because they adapt to Qualcomm chips.  Yes, the graphics will not be the maximum, but still - without the "brakes".  One claim to the chip is still there - video in HD-resolution can be played with ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù, I don‚Äôt keep silent about FullHD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f4/65a/162/7f465a162dd645ee959729c70ff4aad2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/4ff/c50/03a4ffc50a4d49af9f03632ac097f59b.png"><br><br>  Among other characteristics of the smartphone - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, GPS / GLONASS (determines the position as quickly as possible, even in the room "sees" several satellites).  The device works in modem mode and a removable disk.  USB On-The-Go support is missing. <br><br>  The sound quality of the smartphone is good, the headphone volume is high.  The melody of the call is also quite loud, but at the maximum level the sound ‚Äúwheezes‚Äù.  When the phone is on the table with the screen facing down, the volume of the ringtone drops noticeably.  Speaker pumped up - the volume margin is not enough in a noisy environment.  Voice quality is excellent. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Software part</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen Omega Prime S is running Google Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean).  Not the latest version, but it seems it is not so critical.  There is no information about a possible software update to KitKat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5db/5b8/6a1/5db5b86a1f164054aa2a9756d49bde88.png"><br><br>  The Android is almost ‚Äúnaked‚Äù here, there are only minor ‚Äútweaks‚Äù of the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/533/d97/e90533d97b5e49b3bfe36c96d07d227b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63c/9aa/935/63c9aa935fec469d821947a126d1df7a.png"><br><br>  Pre-installed software is not very much.  First of all, the program from Qualcomm BatteryGuru, which allows you to extend the operating time of a single charge, caught my eye.  It has a huge number of settings, in particular, even the timing of updates for specific programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/aae/f29/c34aaef292b0427fa5626f5ee1bcf055.png"><br><br>  There is a client of the cloud service 4sync.  By registering on the Highscreen smartphone, you get 32 ‚Äã‚ÄãGB of disk space instead of the standard 15 GB, then you can set up automatic uploading of your photos and videos to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù. <br><br>  Also available are a file manager, voice recorder, FM radio (with the ability to record broadcast), Snapdragon Audio + equalizer (many presets, bass and 3D), a simple video player, flashlight, clock (a handy program for using a smartphone as a desktop clock with a special night mode) , a search application on the phone or on the network, a utility for updating the firmware "over the air". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed6/35b/24c/ed635b24c92e4d5e821c38a88579c0d0.png"><br><br>  The interface is ‚Äútuned‚Äù to work with two SIMs.  If two SIM cards are installed, then the names of two operators will be indicated on the lock screen and in the status line, there will be two network reception indicators, the numbers of SIMs associated with them will be marked in the SMS application and call lists.  In the call log, you can see calls from only one SIM.  Each "SIM" you can assign your own ringtone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5c/b74/240/c5cb7424089f42dd9210eb02a3fd2959.png"><br><br>  Before making a call, the phone is always interested in which network to use.  Or in the settings you can set the default SIM.  I note that the radio module on the phone is one (there is another rarity in the market).  That is, in the standby mode, both SIM cards are active, and when talking to one of them, the second one will be unavailable.  Also, do not forget that only the SIM installed in the second slot will work with 3G networks. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">findings</font> </h2><br>  The official cost of Highscreen Omega Prime S is 7 990 rubles (if you wish, you can find cheaper offers).  For so little money you will get an elegant, lightweight, thin smartphone, the color of which you can change at least every day.  The bonuses to this are a high-quality HD-resolution screen, a rather powerful Qualcomm hardware platform (mostly ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù work on MTK base), a good photo quality for a ‚Äústate employee‚Äù and a perfect assembly.  Doubtful moments - poor video quality, problems when playing HD and Full HD-videos, quiet speaker.  Unambiguous minus - low battery capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/435/a9b/361/435a9b361bc6497babe4a48628cd24eb.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Highscreen Omega Prime S is a rather interesting smartphone.  The device is inexpensive, smart, stable, well-assembled and has a "killer feature" in the form of interchangeable panels, which allows it to stand out among many competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364193/</a></p>
