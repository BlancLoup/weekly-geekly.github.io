It is logical, since it is a first level certification.  This is the first step!  But by adopting the correct training tactics from the first certificate, then the rest can be passed successfully!

    <h2>  Training </h2><br><ol><li>  Any network administrator must understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI</a> network model at the bone marrow level.  If you think that the unit of data at the transport level is a bit, then you are too early on MTCNA. </li><li>  The same goes for understanding <a href="https://www.networkeducation.ru/video/track/ipv4">the IP protocol</a> .  You need to understand what the address space is formed from and how to calculate the mask. </li><li>  Practice.  You should have experience configuring not only TP-Link home routers.  Put on virtualki Cloud Hosted Router and solve various cases.  Without registration, all ports operate at a speed of 1Mbps.  For tests, this is quite enough. </li><li>  Basic knowledge of English.  You still have to correctly understand the <a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Main_Page">official wiki</a> .  At least with Google translator.  This resource is quite enough to pass the exam. <br><br>  Of course, the teacher can answer questions from the general theory of computer networks, closing some gaps in your knowledge, but this is not the goal of the course. <br><br>  Yet it is believed that you came prepared. </li><li>  Register at mikrotik.com and fill in your personal data correctly. <br><br>  If you write your nickname in the Full name field, it will be fun to get a certificate for some LeoMaXx.  Same with e-mail.  Your email will drop invites from the teacher. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  The course takes 3 full days and 4 are being tested. <br>  The official program can be <a href="https://mikrotik.com/download/pdf/MTCNA_Outline.pdf">found on the website mikrotik.com</a> . <br><br>  In Russia, the course is conducted in Russian. <br><br>  You will be given the cheapest RouterBoard for laboratory work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u7/od/jr/u7odjrtjpu50h2hpzt4moicufay.jpeg"></div><br>  Perform ALL the tasks that the teacher will give.  If you can not perform - ask for the help of a teacher.  All tasks are given with the goal that you better understand the theory.  Each unfinished lab reduces your chances of passing the exam. <br><br>  All questions that came across in the test were considered in detail by the teacher in the class.  Listen to him carefully! <br><br>  Drink ‚Äúglycine‚Äù before classes so that the attentiveness is good. <br><br><h2>  Exam </h2><br>  For the exam you are given 1 hour and 25 questions.  The teacher gives access to the surrender. <br>  You gather your thoughts, calm down and click ‚ÄúStart test‚Äù in your account on <a href="https://mikrotik.com/client/trainingSessions">mikrotik.com</a> . <br><br>  Questions are in English, but there is a ‚ÄúTranslate to Russian‚Äù button above the first question. <br>  Not all questions will be translated into Russian.  The quality of the translation leaves much to be desired, despite the fact that the translation was done by people ... The teacher helped us with the translation of untranslated questions.  I also turned to translate.google.com <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/s-/n6/ces-n6ejm-pxch-wblj1cyjnaye.png"></div><br>  Read carefully the text of the question and answers.  They can be a trick.  And do not think out anything.  Read the questions literally. <br><br>  For example, there is a question: ‚ÄúWhat kind of mask can combine two microtices?  There is no indication of the type of connection in the question.  But many responding think about Ethernet, forgetting about point-to-point connections and set / 29/30.  / 32 remains without its treasured tick.  Do not try to put / 31.  Mikrotik does not know <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3021">RFC 3021</a> ! <br><br>  The time is counted on the right and the ‚ÄúSave progress‚Äù button in case the ‚Äúrunaway‚Äù is over.  But progress itself is automatically saved. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/ad/a-/uaada-70rr0_x2zm8e26rkho8ms.png"></div><br>  Having completed answering questions and if time allows - check all the answers again!  I checking myself found a mistake. <br><br>  <i>Do not try to copy the entire text of the questions.</i>  <i>It is said that the test "shoots" as not passed.</i>  <i>Also, if you publish your questions, then there is a chance that you will calculate and cancel the certificate.</i>  I did not check this theory on myself. <br><br>  At the end of the test, the result will immediately appear on the screen.  The key for the L4 / P1 license will also appear immediately in your personal account. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/a7/d8/xha7d8lg9sm9rh1hbmr4c_tlosu.jpeg"></div><br>  To get a certificate, you must pass at least 60%.  If you did not have no more than 4%, then you will be given another chance on the same day.  But in our group, nobody took advantage of this.  So this theory could not be verified either. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  You should go to these courses not only for the sake of ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù, but also in order to really raise your professional level.  We are, after all, not at the university, where we must pass the test ‚Äújust to pass‚Äù. <br><br>  You will have to apply the knowledge gained in practice. <br><br>  On the Internet you can easily find a list of MTCNA questions.  Hoping that you will get some of these questions is not worth it.  Mikrotik is constantly refining its tests. <br><br>  But if you understand how to answer the questions from this test (for example, you are able to calculate the intersection of networks), then you will definitely pass by 60%! <br><br>  The main thing is not to be afraid!  There is nothing supernatural in the MTCNA course. <br><br>  PS: I want to express my deep gratitude to mikrotik-courses.ru and personally to <a href="https://mikrotik-courses.ru/trainers/nikolai-kuznetsov%3Futm_source%3Dtelegram%26utm_medium%3Dsocial_post%26utm_campaign%3Drouter_os">coach Nikolai Kuznetsov</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1c/kb/li/1ckblixrdfynowqatdhgti7lzz8.png"></div><br><br>  PPS: <br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/353530/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/60/eg/qa60egm4dcaljtdaobllobzr-fa.png"></a> <br>  Less than a day: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k8/if/ng/k8ifng_jksxeove6qrlbk0sxnru.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353530/</a></p>
