    <h4>  Why did it happen? </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis service came to me this summer when I was going to go from Kharkov to Moldova.  The route was quickly laid out by Google, but I knew nothing about the quality of the roads, except for horror stories.  Climbing on the automotive forums, I realized that there are sites like after the war ... But people said different things.  After that, I went to the bus station, found the drivers of a bus that goes to Chisinau, and the information from them has already been confirmed.  But unfortunately, the alternative routes did not suit me, because  it was necessary to keep within one day's ride and had to go along this route.  And, indeed, the trip cost me a detached muffler, a jammed fuel level sensor and a bent protection.  80 km in 3 hours and 30 liters of petrol ... Sometimes it was easier to drive on the sides of the road than on the road ... <br>  So, returning to our topic, when searching for information about the road, I was looking for such a service where you could see clearly the quality of the coating.  Ros / Ukr Yama unfortunately does not provide an overall picture, since  there are mostly single (pinhole) pits.  And the tasks of these services are different. <br><br>  What happened with me - you can see under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How it works? </h4><br>  Going to the main page, you will see a map of your region on which road sections are added to the system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8f41e832/877908d5/3fd195cf/bc9f5f84.png"><br>  The color of the lines depends on the quality of the coating and changes from green ‚Äî the ideal coverage, to red ‚Äî the coating is in terrible condition. <br><br>  When you click on the added road, a window opens with information about this site.  Where you can also vote and / or add a comment. <br><br><h4>  Where does the content come from? </h4><br>  At the moment, the content is added only by me and my friends, because  I almost never published my resource (except for several auto-forums), there is very little content and it is in Ukraine.  It is also the main reason that I publish in a private blog.  But I hope that there will be interested people on Habr√© who are ready to support the resource with content, especially since anyone can add a road.  To do this, do not even need to register.  It is enough to fill the captcha.  The process of adding a section of the road is very simple - click on the plus sign in the header of the site, the map goes into add mode, then we set the first marker on the road, it will automatically be pulled to the nearest section, then we put the second marker - the end of the section and if Google can determine the route, it will be displayed on the map and the properties window will appear.  Fill in and choose the authorization method - login on the forum, or captcha input.  In the first case, the forum will open in a new tab and the system will wait until you log in, in the second you just need to enter the captcha and the road will be added. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  There are many plans and they depend on the demand for the resource.  The closest ones in perspective: <br><ul><li>  Ability to upload photos and links to video for the selected section of the road. </li><li>  API </li><li>  Mobile version, but it cannot be implemented without API </li></ul><br>  I am actively working on the first and second.  How to approach the third and which side I do not know yet.  Time is sorely lacking. <br><br><h4>  In custody </h4><br>  The service is in beta testing, with minimal content.  Please do not kick strictly, I am developing in my free time.  I have long wanted to do something useful for society, but a sensible idea never occurred to me.  I hope this service will be really useful to many who turn the wheel of their favorite iron horse. <br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133647/</a></p>
