Last week we found ten more projects, and with all our strength we are waiting for your opinions: your criticism will greatly help startups to become better. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/548/8fe/8d0/5488fe8d043fb57b50440b3c80925514.png" align="left">  Having barely learned from the evening news about the killing of Bin Laden, 23-year-old Maurice Harari, without wasting time, made several layouts with not very funny pictures about the deceased Al-Qaida head, reprized them on T-shirts and sold about 10,000 pieces in a couple of days on sale of $ 120,000. <br>  Armed <a name="habracut"></a>  this experience, we stocked up prints in case of all possible high-profile deaths in the next few years.  In the meantime, the range of services that allow you to create T-shirts with your own design has been added to another site, <a href="http://printio.ru/">Printio.ru.</a>  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/sealing-equipment/">+++</a> <br><habracut>

The first is a large number of autonomous information systems.  The second is unique technologies and models for managing various types of activities.  And the third is the complexity and high cost of traditional management automation platforms. <br>  The creators of <a href="http://www.asys.ru/">ASys</a> tried to solve all three at once.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/responsive-government/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/558/64c/63b/55864c63bb3ef2c0d83e52794f3fab9d.jpg" align="left">  ‚ÄúIn any case, you MUST pick up one chair from a warehouse with broken packaging, only after that you will be sold three chairs from a shop window,‚Äù the IKEA-Ekaterinburg manager <a href="http://www.yapokupal.ru/ekaterinburg/review.php%3Fid_comment%3D433">tells the</a> buyer (by phone).  My heart is warming: sitting in Moscow, you feel an inexplicable bright sadness from the awareness of the unity of such a huge country - in all its manifestations, in all cities, in all IKEAs. <br>  <a href="http://www.yapokupal.ru/">‚ÄúI Pokupal‚Äù</a> is a site thanks to which buyers will learn about the features of certain sellers, whatever they sell - dresses, chairs, education or medical services.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/ibought/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/ibought/"><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77d/6d8/d1e/77d6d8d1e46208147825aad9ababb15f.jpg" align="left">  While the <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C/">‚ÄúLife Button‚Äù is</a> trying to help the elderly, the creators of the ‚ÄúRemote Fetal Monitor‚Äù set themselves a far more difficult task - to monitor the health of people who were not yet born. <br>  The device created by them does not yet have Russian analogues, however, it is significantly cheaper than similar imported products.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/fetal/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ff/bea/055/2ffbea0554ef47263e517e423e2e78d3.jpg" align="left">  Traditionally, parks are occupied by two warring factions.  The first is mothers with children from 0 to 5 years.  They are usually based on playgrounds and violently hate the second group - dog lovers.  Dog lovers, unlike mothers, are often quiet, docile and realize that not everyone is delighted with their little Bobby. <br>  Both mothers and dog lovers are herd creatures.  They, like their pets, are bound by the desire to rally their efforts and get the most out of their daily runs.  The technology of mothers is quite simple: to find suitable connections for your child and, having acquired the telephone of the mother, to go for a walk in the future, having previously coordinated the time and place. <br>  Dogs are more difficult: they walk at different times and with different regularity, their children are very different in size and character, and most importantly - they tend to move much more actively during the walk than the contingent of playgrounds.  Just for them was invented the service "Acquaintance for dogs."  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/getting-a-dog/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c99/113/76f/c9911376f9e6f3b4d083f28cdb45050f.png" align="left">  The Receiving email service is able to pick up mail from the specified email account and convert the email message as if the client had filled out a form on the website. <br>  For users, this is the ability to use a single email interface instead of understanding the many new options.  For the customer - the systematization of work with mail flows.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/receiving-email/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0db/8ab/ee4/0db8abee43536c741f900ba40e089679.png" align="left">  There were so many coupon services that the creators of each new similar project have to invent new and new refinements in order to somehow differ from their colleagues in the shop.  Recently, we <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/d1-81-d0-ba-d0-b8-d0-b4-d0-ba-d0-b8-d0-b4-d0-bb-d1-8f-d0-bc-d0-b5-d1-81-d1-82-d0-bd-d1-8b-d1-85/">wrote</a> about the <a href="http://www.smskupon.ru/">SMSKupon</a> service, the authors of which hand out coupons for free and save users from having to print them.  The creators of <a href="http://soholife.ru/">SohoLife</a> , which will be discussed, did not reinvent the wheel - they simply focused on another part of the audience.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/luxury-for-the-middle/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de8/809/f7b/de8809f7b5a23d551cbfd215ec155b0c.png" align="left">  Once in the mall, a normal person experiences two opposing feelings: confusion caused by the number of shops and unfamiliar surroundings, and an irrepressible desire to buy everything that looks at.  If you give in to the second, you can partially get rid of the first.  Therefore, it is not surprising that we usually return from shopping centers laden with unconvincing purchases. <br>  To save users from the oppressive feeling of uncertainty and <a href="http://wizee.ru/">confusion</a> , the creators of <a href="http://wizee.ru/">Wizee Shopper</a> made a mobile application that will orient you in any mall, tell you where to find what you need, and where you need, give you a discount.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/shopping-guide/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/shopping-guide/"><br><br><br><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bd/f21/9fe/3bdf219fe426fb49b9139125aa805b1a.png" align="left">  As a child, you discovered as many as two gifts: the ability to write books and the ability to heal by laying hands on.  Growing up, you decided to write a book about how to treat by laying hands. <br>  You go to the publisher, agree on the topic and the title, provide the synopsis, paint the plan of the book on chapters, write the first chapter to the established deadline, agree on a percentage of sales ... <br>  ... or you can do this: you go to the site of the <a href="http://wanted.vc/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8.%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A4">Living Books</a> project, post your book there and watch how your thoughts on imposing hands become available to the reading public.  Without intermediaries in the form of publishing and paper media.  And comments to the written appear directly in the book.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/interactive-reading/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/interactive-reading/"><br><br><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/9bb/51c/1679bb51c622f73a2f0c85e84feae9c4.png" align="left"><br><br>  Like yesterday's project, <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/shopping-guide/">Wizee Shopper</a> , ShopPoints was designed to make it easier for buyers and sellers in offline stores to find a common language. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis mobile application is to reward customers with points for visiting the store and its activity.  Points are awarded simply for the physical presence at the point of sale, for scanning the barcode of the product of interest and for participating in promotions in the sales area.  You can spend your earnings at your own discretion - to pay for a mobile phone bill, purchase certificates and gifts, charity, etc.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/bonuses-for-shopping-offline/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125352/</a></p>
