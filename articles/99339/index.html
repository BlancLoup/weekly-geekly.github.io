  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sberbank Online in Arkhangelsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, I had the need to regularly transfer to the account of individuals in the savings bank a certain amount of money.  At the same time, I still have a salary card, a mobile bank is connected to it, in principle, all this, together with terminals, even works quite well somewhere.  But through the i-no it would be even better, even the ass from the chair is not necessary to tear.  Tempting by itself.  Having read the corresponding article on Habr√©: <br><br>  <a href="http://ohsh.habrahabr.ru/blog/86794/">http://ohsh.habrahabr.ru/blog/86794/</a> <br><br>  already went to the savings bank prepared.  I asked the girl to make a ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù deposit for me, sign a universal bank service agreement and connect the entire farm with my card to Sberbank Online.  Okay, the girl turned out to be in the subject, did not make round eyes, signed all the papers and got hands on logins and passwords to Sberbank online.  Login for some reason two, the password is only one.  Here I would have to doubt, but I decided that I would sort it out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I waited for the three working days - so much information from the savings bank they have ‚Äúwhere it is necessary‚Äù.  I drove into Yandex "Sberbank online", Yandex found the site as the first item

      <a href="https://esk.sbrf.ru/">https://esk.sbrf.ru</a> <br><br>  Great, I entered my username and password, entered.  I see my cards, deposits - no.  But it is impossible to carry out the operations I need in Sberbank-online only from deposits, from cards.  Such is their system.  You can pay for a communal, but only Moscow. <br><br>  I call support, I'm interested in what the problem is.  The support replies that I have not signed a universal banking service agreement.  How is it - I specifically asked the girl to do it, and even signed something.  Again I go to the savings bank, there is already another girl who looks into the base and sees that I really don‚Äôt have this contract.  Just for the first time, the operations officer broke through my full names on the base, and there were 250 people in the base with such full names, and among them there were at least a dozen who signed the contract.  She didn‚Äôt think to compare passport data, she asked me too, and I was left without a contract.  With difficulty pulling a smile, I ask you to still make this ill-fated contract.  Signed. <br><br>  I wait three days, I go to the site - the picture is the same.  Cards see deposits - no.  Calling support again.  The support is perplexed and offers to leave a request, which will be considered within <b>30 (!)</b> Days.  I leave the application, the support calls back of course not after 30 days, but only after a week, on Sunday late in the evening.  It turns out that esk.sbrf.ru is an experimental interface, and I had to go to another address.  I go to the address specified by the support - my login and password are not suitable.  I call the support again, the support is surprised and asks if I have another login.  I say that there is a login, but there is no password for it, since a password can only be obtained from an ATM, and an ATM issues a completely different login.  To this the support calmly replies that after entering the login it was necessary to press ‚ÄúI forgot the password‚Äù and then the password would come by SMS. <br><br>  Are you still not hysterical?  Then we continue.  After receiving the password, I went to the correct interface.  I finally see my contributions.  BUT.  I do not see the cards.  Accordingly, I can not transfer anything from the card to the deposit in order to transfer money from the deposit to the place I need.  And from the card - it is impossible and that's it. <br><br>  I go to the savings bank again.  After about an hour of research it turns out that the base is stored on cards in Moscow.  And on deposits - in Yaroslavl.  Therefore, I cannot see my cards and my accounts in one interface.  Only separately.  Accordingly, I will not be able to transfer money from a card to a deposit and will not be able to use the functions of Sberbank-Online until I replenish the deposit in cash in the savings bank, which puts an end to the whole plan. <br><br>  The result: two weeks, three one-hour visits to the savings bank, an hour and a half waiting for the phone for support answers, and the result is zero. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99339/</a></p>
