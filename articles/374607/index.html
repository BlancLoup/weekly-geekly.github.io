In this material, only domestic satellites are considered, excluding the withdrawal of foreign payload by Russian missiles.  All in all, about 11 launches are planned for launching foreign satellites.

      In the process of writing the article, the launches of some devices were moved to the following years.  Many of the satellites scheduled for launch this year migrated from previous years.  Unfortunately, this is a common practice in astronautics, and not only do we rarely have truly objective scientific, technical, political, and economic reasons.  But still we hope that all scheduled launches will be implemented!  And what awaits us - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5b/be3/8ce/a5bbe38ce7004671b7d0bf92aa561976.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Electro-L</i> <br><br><h2>  Earth Observation </h2><br>  Approximately in June Electro-L No. 2 should fly.  The transfer of the launch from 2014 is associated with the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/218545/">problems of</a> its predecessor.  According to the director of the NGO them.  Lavochkin, Comrade Khartov V.V., the satellite <a href="http://itar-tass.com/kosmos/1578890">has undergone a serious modernization</a> and will have to work in a regular mode for the whole period of guaranteed active existence.  The tasks of the satellite are similar to his brother and are <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/185796/">covered</a> in some <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/167865/">detail</a> on the GT.  Electro-L No. 2 should occupy the 77.8 g standing next to No. 1.  vd  The device has already been tested and is awaiting readiness for shipment to the launch pad of the Baikonur cosmodrome, from which, <i>if there are no difficulties</i> , the Zenit launch vehicle will be launched.  In total for 3 years it is planned to bring the grouping of devices up to 3 pieces: Electro-L No. 3 with a point of standing of 14.5 w.  and Electro-L No. 4 with a standing point of 166 east <br><br>  The space complex of the hydrometeorological and oceanographic support <a href="http://www.vniiem.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D472:-l-3r%26catid%3D37:spaceprograms%26Itemid%3D62">Meteor-3M</a> continues to grow.  This year, the launch of the second unit Meteor-M No. 2-1, developed by VNIIEM, is expected.  As a payload on the satellite, 7 monitoring devices are installed, which should study our Earth in various spectral and frequency ranges: visible, infrared, microwave.  All these devices allow to obtain data on the underlying surface, cloudiness, temperature and humidity and allow you to monitor the ice and snow conditions, even in cloudy conditions. <br><br>  In one carrier rocket with Meteor-M, the twin satellites Ionosphere, also developed by VNIIEM, should fly.  These devices will fly in a solar-synchronous orbit, and study the processes in the upper atmosphere (magnetosphere, ionosphere) and solar activity. <br><br>  Along the way, the same launch should also deliver 2 small Perseus-O vehicles developed by the private international company Dauria Aerospace.  The satellite format is CubeSat (6U); three medium resolution imaging cameras are used as payloads.  Detailed first-hand <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dauria/blog/223771/">article</a> . <br><br>  At the end of the year is expected to launch the third in a row spacecraft remote sensing of the Earth <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/184706/">Resurs-P</a> high resolution.  The satellite has characteristics similar to its predecessors.  The previous two vehicles are now in the same orbital plane and are separated in phase by 180 degrees.  in order to ensure the best periodicity.  Developer - TsSKB-Progress. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Missed vehicles</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Also this year it is planned to launch a meteorological satellite Kanopus-ST, a spacecraft for monitoring emergencies Kanopus-V-IK and a satellite tracking the Arctic situation with the same name ‚ÄúArctic-M‚Äù.  But, unfortunately, the information is contradictory, and the history of their creation lasts a long time, so my opinion is that you should not count on them.  Let's hope I'm wrong. </div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/01e/6ee/0b301e6ee8554a6c826c18c5cfe3ba36.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Resource-P</i> <br><br><h2>  Military </h2><br>  The capabilities of the scouts can be replenished with the Persona No. 3 optical-electronic spacecraft (the third in a row, the second in fact: the first has not begun to function) and the photographic spacecraft Yantar-4K2M, aka Cobalt-M.  Yes, unfortunately, we still use the film to increase the efficiency of species intelligence.  The reset of the captured information occurs three times - first two capsules with a film are lowered, and then the device itself - and this takes about 3 months of work in orbit.  Although the final image and has a resolution of about 30 cm on film, low efficiency and the need to translate into digital form, with a high probability of deterioration, negates all the advantages.  Arsenal and TsSKB-Progress are engaged in production. <br><br>  Person more advanced apparatus.  The optoelectronic equipment records the signal to an on-board storage device, and the satellite carries out radio information reset sessions directly to ground receiving stations or via repeater satellites.  Official characteristics are classified, but for certain indirect evidence, one can judge about the sub-meter spatial resolution.  The head performer is TsSKB Progress. <br><br>  Special Personnel Military Repeaters ‚ÄúHarpoon‚Äù are engaged in the rapid transfer of data from Persons.  One of them is already at 80  and this year is expected to launch another instance.  Developer - ISS Reshetnev. <br><br>  Also on February 21 is expected to launch a satellite in the interests of the military-topographic management of Bars-M.  For solving satellite mapping problems, a set of optics for a space-based stereo lens for remote sensing of the Earth has been installed.  Prior to this, photographic satellites from the Comet series were used for these tasks.  Developer - TsSKB-Progress. <br><br>  The defense capability <s>(in this word of 7 letters ‚Äúo‚Äù) of the</s> country will increase with the launch of the Tundra ballistic missile launch satellite into orbit.  Unlike its predecessor, the OKO-1, this spacecraft will not only detect the fact of launching a ballistic or other missile, but also determine the trajectory of movement and, if necessary, a signal can be sent through the device to retaliate.  The satellite will conduct its patrols in a very interesting highly elliptical orbit of the same name - Tundra.  The platform was developed at RSC Energy, the payload is the Central Research Institute Comet. <br><br>  Another task: the determination of the global geodetic parameters of the PZ-90 system will be decided by the military Geo-IK-2.  The satellite is needed to clarify the shape of the Earth, the parameters of its gravitational field and speed of rotation, as well as to determine the movements of continental plates, earth tides and the coordinates of the poles.  All this is necessary for a more accurate mathematical description of our geoid and increase the accuracy of determining the coordinates.  Developer - ISS Reshetnev. <br><br><h2>  Connected </h2><br>  The launches of two satellites of the Express family were also shifted this year.  The main purpose of the devices: digital broadcasting, telephony, video conferencing, data transmission, access to the Internet, as well as to create communication networks based on VSAT technology <br><br>  Approximately March 19 is expected to launch Express AM7.  The satellite is being created by the European aerospace concern Airbus Defense &amp; Space (formerly EADS Astrium) on the basis of the Eurosat 3000 platform, as well as the previous, unsuccessfully launched counterparts: Express AM4 and AM4R.  <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/node/87447">Evil tongues</a> claim that the spacecraft was subject to sanctions and the delivery to the Russian Federation was not made, but due to the lack of official comments from the GP of the CS and a number of inaccuracies in the article, I think you shouldn‚Äôt trust such sources and hopefully the launch will take place. <br><br>  Following April 6, Express AM8 should fly.  The production platform of this instance is engaged in the ISS Reshetnev JSC, and the payload is manufactured by the French company Thales Alenia Space.  Such a joint partnership scheme has already been successfully implemented on Express-AT1 and -AT2 devices launched in March 2014.  At the moment, the assembled device has passed thermal vacuum and vibration tests and is being tested in an anechoic chamber. <br><br>  In the second half of the year, AMU1 Express is expected to launch, which is also fully manufactured by Airbus Defense &amp; Space.  This device should be launched into the orbital position 36 gr, which is popular for the western part of the Russian Federation.  and will expand the broadcasting capabilities of the joint program with Eutelsat under the name 36C. <br><br>  A total of 9 Express satellites are currently operating, ordered by the Federal State Unitary Enterprise Space Communications.  The AM6 express, which was not quite successfully bred at the end of 2014, still gets to its place 53 grams.  vd  and, presumably, will be put into operation on June 1, 2015. The reason for the protracted journey was the 24-second flaw in the Briz-M upper stage, as a result of which the satellite did not reach the estimated orbit and spend additional fuel. <br><br>  Now there are a lot of rumors and speculations about the implementation of programs in connection with sanctions measures and the possible classification of a number of satellites and electronic components under the ‚Äúdual purpose‚Äù.  Nevertheless, the representative of Airbus Defense and Space in the countries of the Russian Federation and the CIS, Vladimir Terekhov, announced that <a href="http://www.rscc.ru/news/news_company/1716.html">there were no bans</a> on the supply of civilian communication satellites, as well as equipment and components for their production from Europe to Russia. <br><br>  In March, the Russian satellite communications system Gonets (data and communications) should be replenished with three Gonets-M satellites.  Currently, the composition of the orbital group consists of 9 spacecraft Gonets-M and 1 spacecraft Gonets-D1.  All in all, the normal operation of the first stage requires 12 devices, so that in case of a successful launch, the full operation of the system is possible.  Such a composition of the orbital grouping will provide full coverage of northern latitudes and almost uninterrupted reception in middle latitudes.  For global coverage, it is planned to implement the second stage, which involves the launch of another 12 Gonets-M1 satellites.  In this case, we can talk about sustainable coverage of the entire territory of Russia and most of the globe. <br><br>  The satellite operator is <a href="http://www.gonets.ru/">OAO Gonets Satellite System</a> .  Developer - ISS Reshetnev. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/f14/7ae/99ff147aee284afb9b7d8f1f83975d68.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Express AM5</i> <br><br><h2>  Navigation </h2><br>  The domestic global navigation system GLONASS plans to replenish with 7 spacecraft.  This year, 2 cluster launches of three Proton-M space vehicles are scheduled for May and a single launch of the Soyuz 2.1b LV for the first half of the year.  Currently, the orbital constellation includes 28 vehicles, of which 24 are used for their intended purpose, there are 2 copies on flight tests, one satellite in the orbital reserve and one on the study of the Chief Designer.  The last replenishment of the satellite constellation was in 2011, when three launches during the year resulted in 5 vehicles.  The developer of the devices is ISC Reshetnev JSC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/5b4/e04/0e55b4e045e54af98b83f612ca3a6ae3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Glonass-K</i> <br><br><h2>  ISS </h2><br>  During the year, four manned flights of the Soyuz spacecraft are planned to take place on the ISS.  In addition to regular work at the station, 2015 may be marked by a number of interesting events. <br><br>  This year it is planned to conduct the first experiment with an annual mission: Mikhail Kornienko and Scott Kelly will work at the station during the year.  This is done to check how the human body will behave, being in a state of weightlessness for a long time.  Even with the current ‚Äústandard‚Äù semi-annual missions, the body experiences a sufficient effect: astronauts become 3-5 cm higher due to spinal column stretching, so the muscles of the whole body without atrophy gradually become atrophied and the astronauts have to constantly engage in simulators, and the heart <a href="http://www.space.com/25452-zero-gravity-affects-astronauts-hearts.html">becomes more rounded</a> . <br><br>  Another interesting fact is that Scott Kelly has a twin brother, who is also an astronaut, and scientists have a unique opportunity to compare the effect of weightlessness on similar organisms.  In fairness, it is worth noting that for humanity this will not be the first experience of a long stay in space.  The world record belongs to Valery Polyakov: he spent 437 days at the Mir station in 1994-1995. <br><br>  But this year another record can be broken: in terms of the total duration of your stay in space.  At the moment, this achievement belongs to Sergey Krikalev, who for a total of 6 flights to the Mir space stations and the ISS spent 803 days in space.  A new champion can be Gennady Padalka, who already has 710 days of stay in space on his account and, if he joins the crew of the ISS 43/44, he will spend another six months in orbit. <br><br>  After a five-year break this year, the ISS is planning to visit the 8th space tourist - Sarah Brightman, who will stay at the station for 10 days.  She is currently undergoing training in the CPK name Yu.A.  Gagarin.  During his time in space, a series of experiments with vocal chords will be performed - Sarah plans to perform several songs of her repertoire. <br><br>  Ensuring the necessary supply of fuel, water and food, as well as various equipment, according to tradition, will be handled by the Progress series transport and cargo spacecraft.  A total of 4 launches are planned for the first time and a new upgraded <a href="http://ria.ru/space/20140122/990573100.html">Progress MS</a> will be tested for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/236/390/c39236390b6d48cf9145795c3318dabf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>ISS and Union</i> <br><br><h2>  University </h2><br>  The creation of such devices allows us to solve a number of educational, scientific, technical and experimental problems.  First of all, this is the training of highly qualified and interested specialists for the rocket and space industry, who, as students, receive unique experience in the development, manufacture and operation of a real spacecraft. <br><br>  The small apparatus ‚ÄúBaumanets-2‚Äù was created by JSC ‚ÄúMIC‚Äú NPO Mashinostroyenia ‚Äùand the Youth Space Center of MSTU.  N.E.  Bauman.  In addition to various scientific equipment developed exclusively by students of MSTU, medium-resolution imaging equipment with a 38-meter pixel projection is installed on the satellite. <br><br>  The oldest Russian university of Moscow State University, which, together with VNIIEM, is developing its own satellite Lomonosov, is not far behind its colleagues.  It is based on the Canopus platform, and seven different detectors will be installed as a payload, which will allow the satellite to conduct studies of extremely high energy cosmic rays and fast processes in the optical, X-ray and gamma wavelengths occurring in the upper atmosphere of the Earth and in the universe.  More on the official website: <a href="http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/">lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru</a> <br><br>  Together with the MSU satellite, it is planned to launch the second creation of the Samara State Aerospace University - the small spacecraft "Aist" No. 2.  The satellite, respectively, is being developed jointly with TsSKB-Progress.  Scientific equipment for the apparatus "Aist" was developed and manufactured by students, graduate students and teachers of SSAU.  Within the framework of the project, scientific experiments are being conducted: measuring the magnetic field of the Earth and working out the system for measuring and compensating for microaccelerations of the apparatus (MAGKOM scientific equipment);  study of the behavior of high-speed mechanical particles of natural and artificial origin (METEOR equipment) and a number of others.  Also with this device the SamSat-218 nanosatellite will be launched.  The main task of this satellite is the demonstration of navigation and control technologies.  Studies aimed at improving the reliability of the equipment, will make space experiments more efficient <br><br>  The development and design of DOSAAF-85, like its predecessors Yubileyny and Mir, are carried out by Residnev ISS together with students and young scientists of the Siberian State Aerospace University.  The satellite is designed to provide amateur radio communications, as well as the development of promising technologies and the flight qualification of instruments. <br><br>  Of course, these are not the only universities that develop space programs on their basis.  The same work is carried out by the St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, together with the FSUE KB "Arsenal" and the Tomsk Polytechnic University, together with the STC "Cosmonite" and the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Amur State University and other educational institutions of the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/53a/06e/e7353a06e1c243b6a88aad1d5820152a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Baumanets-2</i> <br><br><h2>  Cosmodrome </h2><br>  The year should end perhaps the most discussed event - the launch of the Soyuz 2.1A Union from the new Vostochny cosmodrome.  As a payload, the above mentioned satellites will be put into orbit: Lomonosov, Aist-2 and Samsat-218.  The cosmodrome is located in the Amur Region, not far from the Free Spaceport, which ceased to exist.  The start of construction is July 2012, the first launch is December 2015. For reference, about 2.5 years have passed since the construction of the Baikonur Cosmodrome began until the first launch of the R-7 with the first PS-1 Earth satellite.  However, it should be borne in mind that the new cosmodrome is more technological in terms of capital facilities.  In total, 2 launch pads of the Union of the Light and Middle Class rocket and a platform for the Angara-5 heavy rocket will be built.  It will also be an interesting decision that all the facilities of the assembly and test complex will be united by a common gallery, which will shorten the time of preparing the rocket for launch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f4/104/6a9/3f41046a90324350a6360b5eafc0eddb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Launch pad for Soyuz rocket</i> <br><br>  So the year should be quite intense, not counting foreign programs, but this is a separate issue.  Let's hope that all launches will take place in a regular mode and without incident. <br><br>  I express my gratitude to the user of the <b>GK</b> <a href="http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/">cosmonautics news</a> forum, who for several years has been conducting <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0AtceJ_4vZ7mSdDV4QWVVdEY0RXRFQUc0X05RZjFpN1E">a launch plan</a> with weekly edits. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374607/</a></p>
