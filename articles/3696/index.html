Each cardholder (cardholder) must know that he must protect his card as the pupil of the eyes of the powers in the pin-code and other data.  But often these simple measures are not enough.  I will not delve into the banking terminology and tell on behalf of the card, so to speak in a generally accessible language.  After all, often a simple operation of withdrawing cash from an ATM can end in tears for your pocket.  The purpose of the article is to find out in advance what you still risk, and to be ready for concrete actions.  First, I will tell you about the most common ways of taking possession and holding with someone else's cards.  In their chronology, these methods are both primitive and often ridiculous, as well as thought out using special technical means. <br>  The most common method is to extract card details for the purpose of their further use for purchases in online stores.  It is not necessary to make a copy of the card, but it is very pleasant to spend other people's money, isn't it? <br><br>  The next way is to copy credit cards with the help of special software and hardware, in collusion with store employees.  In Russia, this method is the least common, since there are many nuances: check the documents for the authenticity of the cardholder, verify signatures, call the bank that issued the card (issuing bank) <br>  Also, a very rare method is collusion with bank employees, people working in banks can submit (sell) the necessary information to cardholders.  And from this, alas, no one is immune. <br>  On the issue of so-called ingenuity, some ‚Äúscammers‚Äù install webcams on ATMs. <br>  Also, there are funny cases.  For example, in my memory there were rumors that the "scammers" installed their own in portable places in places with a large crowd of people.  Yes, yes, you heard right, this is not a typo, but such sophisticated methods are still encountered.  I want to note that this method is very expensive, but one hundred percent true.  The ATM does not work naturally, it simply reads the necessary information from the card, and then one day it is removed. <br><br>  In Russia, the scale of the activity of carders (people engaged in scams with plastic cards) is small.  Maybe due to the fact that most Russian carders do not work in the country where they live.  This is a kind of moral principle, and on the other hand a pledge of security is not to be seized by our valiant bodies. <br>  While I abstractly explained the most common methods of fraud, without delving into the terminology, the benefit of the article is written not only for people interested in this (newcomers carders), but also for mere "mortals."  I would like to talk a little about carders in general.  You probably think about the question ‚Äúwho are such carders?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy do they do it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo they have any principles?‚Äù, I will try to explain these and other questions to you. <br>  Carder is first and foremost a person who is fluent in computers, well, so to speak above average.  What pushes people to such a specific type of income, I do not even know.  Probably, this is everyone‚Äôs business, how and how to earn a living.  I want to note that the cadres are divided into so-called unspoken categories.  I start down the hierarchy.

      In the first place, the so-called "gurus", maybe this word sounds too defiant, but after what is written below you will draw conclusions.  These are well-known, respected and honest to people whom everyone is trying to imitate.  Whose opinion is taken into account and whose words are perceived almost as an axiom.  These are very experienced people, often with higher education (and not just one), although there are so-called ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù.  Often they don‚Äôt have to bother themselves with work, they do it for them, those people who are hired (mostly novice carders) and bring them a good income.  These people have extensive knowledge, even in their own way, of professionals who have advanced security features and the most sophisticated cryptography.  Such people are professionals in everything, this also applies to banking structures.  Also, there are experienced programmers who receive income from their ‚Äúcreations‚Äù.  Believe me, and the income of such people is fabulous numbers.  These are the people who deserve the recognition of society, as a kind of elite carding. <br>  Next come experienced people, that is, those people who earn decently on their craft, and also mastered all the "charms" of the card to perfection.  Novices also work for such people.  As in the first case, these are people with an impeccable reputation in society.  Yes, yes, I again did not make a reservation, carding means a society (community) under itself with moral and ethical principles and rules. <br>  Next are people for whom carding is a kind of hobby, mostly experienced people who have work, and even more than one.  Such people are very, very much. <br>  Well, finally it came to the most painful topic - this is NEW.  I think it is not necessary to explain who they are.  These are people who are ‚Äúinterested‚Äù as it were and who vacillate between law and money.  Most of them will consider in which field of carding they will work.  And as it should be in a civilized society, the older ones help.  I can say that newcomers often come across to our power structures.  Perhaps because of his naivety and not caution, the desire to make money quickly by spending a minimum of time and money using any means of caution.  I want to note that the age limit for such people ranges from 15 to 18 years, and rarely exceeds 20, mostly ‚Äúschoolchildren‚Äù.  Often these people without the eliminative representation of the law, and without the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe legal basis of the country. <br><br>  And finally, as in any society, there is a kind of negative - this is ‚Äúscammers‚Äù.  That is, people with a minimum of knowledge, and simply deciding to make easy money in the most sophisticated way is the deception of their fellow "shop".  But the action of such people is stopped, and everything possible is done so that this does not happen again. <br>  So I told a little about the hierarchy of the carder community, and, noting the most significant nuances, and there are also other people who are part of the so-called ‚Äúfamily‚Äù.  These are hackers, programmers, lawyers, designers, but we will look at this in other articles. <br>  It pushes such people to do this, as I mentioned before for various reasons.  These are mainly material problems.  You must agree, everyone wants a beautiful life, ride beautiful cars, live in beautiful conditions.  Why is it so common in Russia?  I think this question will have many opinions.  Maybe because of the specifics of the Russian people, after all, you must agree, everyone says democracy, democracy, and we have the most that does not eat grist.  And looking at the people of the rich and successful a little bit the hunt to live like them.  Why can they live like that, but can't we?  After all, it turns out there is fraud, and here, only some of them do not shun morality and principles.  Maybe this is a spoken misunderstanding and dislike of someone else, against the background of the collapse of the USSR, and what they did with Russia in subsequent years.  Basically, the goal of Russian carders is America, but lately Europie has suffered from us.  Why?  That is why everyone decides for himself, and is guided by his principles.  Carders have their own secret code of honor, which everyone understands in his own way.  You probably think that these are people deprived of any concept of justice, but not here.  We often help orphans, people with disabilities and just the people who need it.  Let not all people, but for someone this help is tangible.  There are many such examples, but I will not go into details, but often this help can brighten up someone‚Äôs life, and sometimes gives a chance to live.  In this dismiss, but we do not shun money for the sake of helping those in need.  Let basically everything passes secretly, but we also do not need publicity, in view of the specification of our craft.  And coping with us is not so easy, in our legislation there are a lot of holes and nuances that we often use.  And the security forces squander their pants in the offices and bite their nails because of their inability to influence us.  As long as there is Internet, and information technology will be us, hackers and other similar people.  While there is progress, we are progressing too!  Demand, as you know, always gives rise to supply.  And the petty genius and villainy are very common things. <br>  Now let's talk about the purpose of our article, this is how to protect yourself. <br>  How to make my data not stole carders ... The most simple rules. <br><br>  If for a counterfeiter the most important thing is to forge a drawing on a bill, then for a card reader it is necessary to copy the information contained in the magnetic strip of a credit card.  Moreover, this procedure does not require any special qualifications - it is enough to be able to use a regular computer and have certain hardware and software to put on the strip a set of codes for which any ATM anywhere in the world will read what client is in front of him, in which bank his account and how much money is on it.  This information package is also called a dump. <br><br>  Dumps are stored in banks or companies that operate international payment systems, and are protected from prying eyes by dozens of security programs with passwords known to a very narrow circle of people.  Carder must somehow penetrate the database of the bank.  Therefore, it is easy to guess that without an accomplice on the other side of the "window" he can not do. <br>  If you are a victim of carders - do not despair.  Despite the seemingly hopeless situation, you have a good chance to get your money back.  The first thing to do if you find your credit card is missing is to call the bank and block it. <br>  Often, in a card issue agreement, Russian banks state that after a declaration of the loss / loss of a card, all financial costs are borne by the bank.  So you should hurry, and as soon as possible to inform the bank about the loss.  If a card is stolen from you, then the less time you give the criminal, the more money you have left in the account.  It may also be the case that you, as a bona fide cardholder, keep it with you, not having performed any operations, and suddenly, on the day when the account-statement should arrive, you notice with surprise that the funds on your card have "diminished."  In this case, you must immediately call the bank and report suspicious transactions.  In turn, it will be necessary to block the card, for one simple reason that the details of your card have become known to the fraudster, and there is a great danger of repeated transactions. <br><br>  Then you go to the bank, and write a statement of disagreement with the transaction.  In the application, in addition to the standard data (last name, first name, patronymic, contact information, type of your payment card, its number and expiration date), you will need to specify the currency and amount of the disputed operation, the date of its execution and the number in the payment system, and also the name or code of the store or terminal where it was held.  All this can be found in the account statement, which you need to take with you.  After you sign the application, the bank will accept it for consideration.  First of all, the bank will try to establish who is responsible for the fraudulent transaction.  There are two options: the issuing bank that issued the card for the client and the acquirer bank servicing the outlet where the operation took place.  The acquiring bank is responsible for the fraudulent operation if it was paid off with a card stolen from you in ‚Äúit‚Äù and the signature on the check clearly does not look like yours.  In this case, the bank will return the stolen amount, and then it will deal with the store or restaurant, whose employee served the fraudsters.  In addition, the acquiring bank is responsible for operations conducted on the Internet.  It is much less likely to return the money if the issuing bank is recognized as the responsible party.  This happens, for example, when the signature is on the check, even remotely resembling yours. <br><br>  As a rule, in such situations the responsibility is borne by the issuing bank.  And he, according to the card issuance agreement, has the full right to refuse the client claims for all transactions made before the card is blocked.  Often, banks do not want to lose customers, and to quarrel from the hut by demonstrating their oversight.  The money will be returned only if the bank does not have the slightest doubt about your honesty.  And these doubts can appear if, for example, you have previously applied to the bank with a statement about a fraudulent transaction.  But on the other hand, the chances of compensation for the stolen goods are increased if the money was withdrawn from an ATM of another country, while at the same time you did not go anywhere.  In this case, the statement of claim must include all documents that can confirm that you did not perform this operation: you signed checks on card transactions (they will confirm that the card was with you), medical certificates, certificate of employment and t. n ... But if your application was refused, then do not despair, but simply go to court.  According to the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Procedure for Issuing Credit Cards by Credit Institutions and Making Settlements for Transactions Made with Their Use, on any document confirming a card transaction, there must be a client's list.  And the bank has no right to debit money from the cardholder‚Äôs account if this document is not available or has been forged.  In this case, the court is likely to take the side of the client, not taking into account any clauses of the contract. <br>  If the contested operation was conducted, say, at an ATM or via the Internet (now many banks offer cardholders to manage their account using the Internet), then the signature will be a pin code or a special digital password - an analog of a handwritten signature.  To challenge in court a transaction signed is not easy, but possible.  After all, ‚ÄúAccording to Art.  7 of the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights", the consumer has the right to provide him with safe services.  It was to this article that the client to whom our bank refused to compensate the stolen money referred.  In this case, such a service was not provided to the client, since the fraudsters managed to forge a card.  And the court ordered the bank to return the stolen money. "So in this case, the banks suffer mainly from the actions of carders. <br>  In Russia, an increase in the number of electronic attacks on information resources of banking structures is observed.  Now we will try to figure out how to understand that carders have taken possession of your data.  This question today is very relevant, because more and more people use bank cards.  Often you can find out this only one way, is to pay with a card in a store or try to withdraw cash from an ATM, but to your surprise it turns out that your money has ‚Äúevaporated‚Äù.  As I wrote earlier, first of all, it is necessary to contact not the police with a statement about the theft or loss of the card, but to your bank so that the criminals do not have the opportunity to withdraw all the money from your card.  According to bankers, copying is the most common and painful phenomenon for banks.  There are several countries that are the most dangerous: Australia, Bulgaria, Venezuela, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and South Africa.  But for Russian holders the most popular are the favorite vacation spots - Thailand and Turkey.  Strangely enough, Ukraine, which is close to us, has become a particular risk zone for the Russians in this regard.  Moreover, in addition to copying the magnetic stripe, fraudsters recognize the PIN of the card holder, this happens when the holder uses his card at an ATM.  According to unofficial information, employees of Ukrainian banks and processing centers were implicated in this.  Last summer, by the way, some Russian banks completely closed Ukraine for their holders, operations from there were simply not allowed.  But, according to law enforcement agencies, there are far more cybercrimes committed in the banking sector than fixed.  This is primarily due to the reluctance of banks and payment systems to report successful attacks on customer accounts.  Thereby, scaring off their customers.  How to protect yourself?  Hmm ... the question is ridiculous for me as for a card, as long as there is internet, and high technologies we keep up with the times by coming up with all new and sophisticated methods of data theft from cards.  Well, let me tell you the most important aspects of how to protect yourself from "cyber thieves."  Russian banks, in turn, offer holders to take care of the impossibility of withdrawing money from their accounts, taking half the costs associated with the use of SMS messages.  In most banks, the cardholder can connect to the card transaction information system using short messages that will be sent to his mobile phone.  This allows you not only to immediately find out about an unauthorized card transaction, but also to block it yourself.  In addition, it is possible to manage card limits.  That is, you can make the daily withdrawal limit to about 10 thousand rubles.            ,      100 . .,     .   ,   ,    ,      . <br><br>      .     , ,      ,      . ,       ,          .           ,         .  ,            ,      -. , , ,         . <br>  ‚Äî   -     , : <br> 1.     ,    ,        <br> 2.
