With this device you can control the temperature, ozone, pH, lighting, pump operation, dispensing items, feeding and more.  This device makes it much easier to care for the aquarium, not to spend a lot of time on this, but to enjoy the direct result of breeding fish or corals.  However, Apex AquaController helps prevent accidents such as overheating, leakage, spills, etc. The device takes possible actions and sends a notification to the user.  And, leaving home for 2 hours or 2 weeks, you will no longer worry as much as before. <br>  The device consists of a base unit, which is essentially a microcomputer with a 32-bit microprocessor and an embedded web-server.  This allows you to configure and control the device remotely via the Internet from a computer or mobile device on iOS or Android.  The base unit connects to the power supply and to the network (cable to the existing router will most likely require port forwarding), and various sensors and devices are connected to the device, including a pH probe, a durable temperature sensor, a display module (display), controllers power and other components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/bf6/832/f1fbf683265b3083fc23693351523314.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The manufacturer guarantees a simple installation according to the instructions, but in principle you can use the help of the forum or technical support.  For advanced users, Apex has a powerful but easy-to-learn programming language.  This allows each user to come up with new ways to use the controller, including with ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù devices. <br>  Kit prices start at $ 219, you can also purchase missing accessories.  It is quite an acceptable amount, considering how much this device can save money, for example, to repair floors in case of leakage prevention. <br><br><h4>  Devices for plants </h4><br><br><h5>  FlowerPower </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdb/a7b/f0c/cdba7bf0cb043eece99f85ecd92ee152.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.parrot.com/flowerpower/en">Parrot</a> 's <a href="http://www.parrot.com/flowerpower/en">FlowerPower</a> is a device for plants from France that will not let you forget about watering.  In general, the company Parrot develops and sells consumer goods for smartphones and tablets, as well as high-tech solutions for the automotive market and the market for unmanned aerial vehicles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/524/3a0/aeb/5243a0aeb04dbf2d1f7a7db8aefbbf12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device is simply stuck into the soil next to the plant and is intended for use both indoors and outdoors.  It is essentially a set of sensors.  Structurally, FlowerPower consists of an underground part in which a dielectric humidity sensor is installed, a sensor for monitoring the ionic composition of the soil to monitor fertilizers, and one of the thermistors measuring the temperature of the soil;  and the aboveground part, in which a second thermistor is installed, measuring the air temperature, a sunlight sensor, a Bluetooth LE communication module and an AAA battery (for about 6 months of operation).  The aboveground part is available in three colors to choose from: blue, brown and green-gray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b79/802/b74/b79802b7474edfd4887c5075cf8f48f1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For interaction, you need to install the application on iOS or Android-smartphone, which contains a library of more than 7000 plants with detailed descriptions, photos, tables and instructions for care.  The application in real time builds graphs characterizing the health of the plant, issues recommendations about what the plant needs at the moment and provides a forecast for the coming days. <br>  FlowerPower is sold for 49 euros in the collection with the battery. <br><br><h5>  Lono </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a9/11a/a40/0a911aa40699baa7ac834ca7f77e7c18.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://lono.io/">Lono</a> - the controller for sprinklers (sprinklers of the irrigation system). <br>  The device is a control unit in a small package with an LED display.  It is allowed to use the device only indoors.  The Lono scheme is based on the ATmega328 microprocessor, there are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth modules, a backup battery and slots for connecting separate irrigation zones. <br>  The first synchronization of the smartphone and the device occurs automatically, but after that a password is required to enter and authorize another phone.  Management is carried out both from a mobile application and using a web application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc9/3fe/81b/dc93fe81b4dbdb4de452c04d386d252e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device is programmed for 20 irrigation zones, if more zones need to be programmed, the manufacturer advises to purchase several Lono devices that can be managed from one account.  Watering is carried out both according to the schedule and in manual mode, including remotely.  The system may take into account the local weather forecast and postpone watering, but this feature may be disabled.  In addition, third-party rain sensors can also be integrated into the system to automatically shut off irrigation. <br>  According to the developers, the system will save the owner from 20 to 70% of water consumption, and will also be indispensable for preserving the health of the watering plants. <br>  The Lono project in December 2013 completed a fundraiser at the Kickstarter site.  Instead of the declared 75 thousand dollars more than 155 thousand were collected.  Now you can pre-order the device for $ 199.99 with delivery in July 2014. <br><br><h4>  Monitoring and home security devices </h4><br><br><h5>  Canary </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83c/09e/2a9/83c09e2a93ffe3272e1ecb1601d3c3d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://canary.is/">Canary</a> is a multifunctional device.  Inside the case of an unusual shape, a high-quality video camera with a wide-angle lens and a night-vision function is installed, with which you can carry out remote monitoring at any time, as well as a siren and sensors that can track movement, temperature, humidity, atmospheric air quality, vibrations and sounds.  These parameters are recorded, statistics are kept, and in case of detection of something unusual, the device gives an alarm signal.  At the same time, the device is comparable in size to a half-liter plastic bottle. <br>  The project began to raise funds at the site Indiegogo in July 2013 and collected almost $ 2 million for the month instead of the declared 100 thousand.  Then pre-orders moved to the company's own website.  Delivery of devices is expected in November 2014.  Price pre-order - $ 199. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0e/522/346/a0e5223469f52321d4a983a4779ac9a6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The device can keep a video and audio archive, remembers your actions and automatically adjusts the basic settings according to your habits, which should reduce the number of false positives.  The device connects to your home Wi-Fi network.  Management is carried out from a smartphone, and you can register several smartphones for all family members.  And all smartphones will receive notifications about some extraordinary events.  In addition, your phone can also act as an identifier for the Geofence function, for arming when it is removed for a certain distance and for disabling this mode when approaching. <br>  Provides encryption at the level of bank encryption.  The device will be available in white, black, metallic body colors. <br><br><h5>  Mother </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d2/625/e8f/4d2625e8f4c63baa9f115442b981512c.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://sen.se/">Mother</a> is a programmable device that turns all ordinary objects into smart ones.  The device looks like a white plastic nesting doll (or, as we can see in an English-language press, a Russian Doll) with LEDs at the place of the eyes and mouth.  Mother was represented at CES 2014 in Las Vegas and enjoyed success with journalists. <br>  The creators of the device called it that because the device, like the mother, takes care of you.  You decide what aspects of life it controls, and it is customized to your needs.  How does this happen?  Mother is the head of a family of multi-purpose autonomous sensors that connect and determine movement, temperature, and more.  The sensors are called cookies, which means cookies, but for obvious reasons, they are usually not translated.  For example, if you attached a sensor to the door of the first-aid kit, but one day you forgot to open the door to take medicine, the device will remind you until you remember - just like your own mother.  And this is just one example of the 12 uses that the company has prepared. <br>  Some technical details.  The parent unit is connected to the home router with a cable.  Communication between the unit and the sensors is carried out on a proprietary radio standard at different frequencies for North America and Europe.  Up to 24 sensors can be connected to one unit, one sensor can be connected to only one unit.  The sensors operate on a replaceable CR2016 battery for about a year.  If the connection to the parent unit is lost, the sensor remembers the information for 10 days and later transmits data when the connection is restored. <br>  Device management is carried out using a downloadable smartphone application that is available for iOS and Android.  It was originally planned to sell one device with 4 sensors from February 2014 for $ 222, an additional set of 4 sensors - for $ 99.  At the moment, when visiting the site, the company determines a potential client from Russia and offers to reserve a set for 242 euros with payment on readiness for shipment, without specific dates. <br><br><h5>  Scout </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e6/dc4/63f/3e6dc463f8c59388aad47c859d5016ba.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://www.scoutalarm.com/">Scout</a> is a new generation home security system, as the manufacturer characterizes the device, or easy home security.  Indeed, probably there was still no such security system, which was installed so quickly and cost only from $ 130. <br>  The system consists of a base unit and three different devices ordered in different quantities depending on the customer‚Äôs needs: a door panel, an opening sensor and a motion sensor.  These devices are installed without any wires.  All blocks are made in the same style in three colors - white, black and wood.  They are easy to install and easy to remove, making it convenient to use the system for tenants. <br>  The base unit connects to your home Wi-Fi network.  Communication between the unit and devices is carried out according to the Zigbee specification.  You can keep track of your home from your computer or smartphone (iOS or Android) for free or pay to have your security monitored.  If you choose a paid professional monitoring plan, the system itself may call the police / security guard, otherwise you will receive a notification and decide for yourself where to call.  Remotely you can provide access to the house for any person.  If you have lost your phone, you can disarm the house using a computer or an RFID keychain. <br>  Scout uses 128-bit AES encryption.  The system has a backup power supply and a cellular 3G communication chip via VPN (activation is required) in case there is no network voltage or no Internet access.  The backup power of the base unit will work for about a week, the sensor batteries will last about 12 months during normal use. <br>  The project itself, without Kickstarter or IndieGoGo held a crowdfunding on its website.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now on the company's website you can pre-order the set with delivery in the second quarter of 2014, the pre-orders for the first production batch are closed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The base unit costs $ 99, the door panel is $ 69, the opening sensor is $ 29, and the motion sensor is $ 49 (prices without shipping and taxes). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Optionally, you can subscribe to one of the tariff plans for monitoring at a cost of $ 19.99.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Locks </font></font></h4><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Lockitron </font></font></h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d37/10c/858/d3710c85877e455600bd4cb320b817ae.png" alt="image"><br><br> <a href="https://lockitron.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lockitron</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is a smart door lock. Using the phone you can very easily open the lock from anywhere in the world. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lockitron looks like a regular invoice box mortise lock on the inside of the door. The device is installed on an existing door lock using a cross-head screwdriver (supplied), provided that the lock and the device are mechanically compatible. The device operates on four batteries for about a year and notifies itself of the need to replace them.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The device is connected to the home Wi-Fi network, and a special application is downloaded on the Android or iOS phone. Using this application, you can send electronic keys and control who is currently opening the door. If you have an iPhone 4S or newer, you can configure Lockitron so that it will work from your approximation alone, having received a command via Bluetooth 4.0. And if your smartphone supports NFC technology, then you can open the lock by attaching the smartphone to the lock. And, of course, in extreme cases, the lock can be opened with a regular key. At the same time, for opening via Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC, Wi-Fi is not needed, and the key can be opened even when the batteries are drained.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a7/9e3/390/9a79e33902dafb24f13f6030c7069bf5.png" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All Lockitron traffic goes over HTTPS.

The project was founded by people from Apple, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers.  The Google giant recently acquired this project at an impressive price of $ 3.2 billion. <br>  The thermostat is a device in the form of a tablet with a diameter of 3.2 inches (81 mm), a thickness of 1.44 inches (36.6 mm) and a mass of 150 g. Temperature, humidity, movement and light sensors as well as a rechargeable battery are built into the case.  Information is displayed on the device display, which occupies the entire front panel.  The red color of the display indicates the heating mode of the room, blue indicates air conditioning, large numbers indicate the temperature, the image of green leaves indicates the energy saving mode.  Control is carried out using an external rotary ring and a display button. <br>  Installing a thermostat is very simple.  First, the old thermostat is dismantled (Nest is compatible with the vast majority of existing climate systems).  Then install the base panel.  The base panel has a built-in bubble level that will help ensure that the panel will be installed correctly.  There are additional mounting plates that will help hide any openings from previous thermostats.  The next step is to connect the wires, and the following terminals can be connected: heating system (boiler), air conditioning system (air conditioning), heat pump, humidifiers and air dryers, fan.  And finally, the device itself is installed with a display.  Nest has a built-in Wi-Fi module that connects to your home network during installation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d28/c84/ddd/d28c84ddd0adae7787df7345d12d382a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By installing and connecting the thermostat, the owner starts to control it in manual mode - raise, lower the temperature, turn off at the exit from the house, set a comfortable temperature for the night, etc. After about a week of training, the thermostat remembers the habits and mode of the owner and begins to regulate the air condition in the house .  The thermostat itself determines that the owner is not at home and includes an energy saving mode.  Self-study does not negate the possibility of manual adjustment of parameters, in addition, the parameters can be changed remotely from a mobile device using an installed application or from a computer on the company's website.  Also on the site you can see the history of energy consumption, the amount of energy saved through Nest and get useful recommendations. <br>  In the US, the thermostat is sold for $ 249 with free shipping. <br><br><h5>  tado ¬∞ </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/651/c36/218/651c3621802938b84e6ad27d295cd6ea.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.tado.com/de-en/">tado ¬∞</a> - thermostat from German developers from Munich, which determines where you are, and accordingly sets the temperature in the house. <br>  The key element of the system is the tado ¬∞ Box device, which is a control unit that is connected to the heating system.  It replaces the existing thermostat on the wall or is attached directly to the heating boiler.  In the second case, an additional temperature sensor tado ¬∞ temperature sensor is added to the system, which is connected to the control unit via a radio channel.  Data from the control unit is sent through a special tado ¬∞ gateway device (it is connected by cable to an existing router) and an existing home Internet connection to the owner's smartphone.  The tado ¬∞ App (App Store (iOS), Google Play (Android)) installed on the smartphone automatically exchanges location information with the control unit, and the heating system is controlled depending on this information.  In addition, the owner can remotely control power consumption and manually control it.  tado ¬∞ adapts to the owner, home and weather, taking into account various factors.  All this can be done using a web application, as well as manage your account, receive reports, set up a schedule for other residents of the house. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fa/859/952/4fa859952ba8e7064d82e2aa44e87c88.png" alt="image"><br>  The developers have conducted tests and argue that savings in heating costs can reach 31% or about 300 euros per year.
