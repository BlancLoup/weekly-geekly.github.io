  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Julian Assange: Google is not what it seems (part four)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working with young people is very important.  This is well understood in the government, and Jared Cohen understands this very well.  In addition to Google Ideas, Cohen consists and manages several more ‚Äúnon-governmental‚Äù organizations that are focused on working with young activists from around the world.  He began working with young people in the same year, when he negotiated with the Afghan PPSCs about moving towers, literally at the beginning of his global career.  About these youth get-togethers and will be discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e9/fae/d62/2e9faed62f334f30a766d71fb8089e4d.png"><br>  <em>Jared Cohen on stage with delegates from the New York Grand Summit of the Alliance of Youth Movements, 2008</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The world of Jared Cohen looks like a series of endless parties for mutual enrichment of influence between the elites and their vassals, and is served under the sauce of "civil society".  In developed capitalist societies, there is an erroneous judgment that there is a certain organized ‚Äúcivil society sector‚Äù in which public institutions form themselves and unite to express the interests and will of the citizens.  The fable says that the boundaries of this sector are honored by the state and the "private sector", which leave safe space for non-governmental and non-profit organizations so that they can defend such things as civil law, freedom of speech and accountable government. <br><br>  Sounds like a great idea.  But if it was all true, it would not exist for decades.  At least since the 1970s, such participants in ‚Äúcivil society‚Äù as trade unions and churches fell under the constant onslaught of free-market etatism, which turned this ‚Äúcivil society‚Äù into a consumer market for political factions and corporate interests, allowing them to influence at a distance arm outstretched.  Over the past forty years, there has been a marked spread of research centers and government non-governmental organizations whose goal, hidden by all their verbiage, is to carry out political programs by agreement.

      And this is not only the obvious leading groups like the <a href="http://archive.is/JSUHq">Foreign Policy Initiative</a> .  It also includes senseless Western organizations, such as Freedom House, where the naive but well-intentioned careers of nonprofit workers are knotted by government funding streams, denouncing human rights violations outside the West, leaving local abuses of blind spots.  Civic conferences ‚Äî that activists in developing countries around the world hold hundreds of times a year to bless an unholy alliance between ‚Äúgovernment and private actors‚Äù at geopolitical events like the Stockholm Internet Forum (Stockholm Internet Forum) simply couldn‚Äôt exist did not support the infusion of millions of government dollars annually. <br><br>  If you look at the lists of members of the largest American think tanks and institutions, they will skip the same names.  Save Summit, where Cohen went to sow AVE or AgainstViolentExtremism.org is a long-term enterprise whose main supporter, not counting Google Ideas, is Gen Next Foundation.  The <a href="http://archive.is/p91bd">website of</a> this institution says that it is ‚Äúan organization with limited membership and a platform for successful individuals,‚Äù which aims to ‚Äúsocial change‚Äù, driven by venture capital funding.  Jared Cohen is an executive member there. <br><br>  <a href="http://archive.is/oVlqH">Gen Next</a> also supports the NGO, launched by Cohen closer to the end of his term in the State Department to attract democratic Internet activists from around the world under the auspices of the network of the US Foreign Ministry.  This organization originated on the basis of the Alliance of Youth Movements, at the summit in 2008, with the support of the State Department and a handful of sponsors, the logos of which were inlaid.  The summit brought together carefully selected social media activists from ‚Äúproblem areas‚Äù, like Venezuela and Cuba, to watch performances by Obama‚Äôs campaign headquarters and State Department employee James Glassman and to work together with public relations consultants, ‚Äúbenefactors And American media people.  In addition, two more summits on invites in London and Mexico City were held, and at the last, even Hillary Clinton directly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOcBG7B6sgOk">addressed the</a> delegates via video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOcBG7B6sgOk">call</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  You are the vanguard of the younger generation of civic activists.  [...] And that makes you the leaders we need. <br></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/49f/f07/91b49ff07d0247ee8ac91fcb3062302e.png"><br>  <em>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses delegates to the annual Alliance of Youth Movement summit in Mexico City, 2009</em> <br><br>  In 2011, the Alliance of Youth Movements was renamed Movements.org.  In 2012, Movements.org became a unit of Advancing Human Rights, a new NGO created by Robert L. Bernstein (Robert L. Bernstein), after his resignation from Human Rights Watch (which he created) because he felt that this organization should not concern human rights violations in Israel and the States.  Advancing Human Rights had to correct what was wrong with Human Rights Watch, focusing exclusively on ‚Äúdictatorships‚Äù.  Cohen said the merger of his Movements.org and Advancing Human Rights was ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù, calling the latter as ‚Äúan extraordinary organization of cyber-activists in the Middle East and North Africa.‚Äù  He then joined the Advancing Human Rights Council, which also included Richard Kemp, the former commander of British forces in occupied Afghanistan.  In its current guise, Movements.org continues to receive funding from Gen Next, as well as from Google, MSNBC, and pr-giant <a href="http://www.edelman.com/">Edelman</a> , including General Electric, Boeing, and Shell [app.  Edelman is known for its fake campaigns for Big Tabacco and Walmart, giving the impression of public support for these companies, while paying people who pretend to provide this very support]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/559/d3a/d90/559d3ad904954d08a3e7840054a3b99d.png"><br>  <em>Screenshot of the sponsors <a href="http://archive.is/DQo19">page</a> on movements.org</em> <br><br>  Google Ideas is larger, but subject to the same rules of the game.  Let us glance briefly at the <a href="http://archive.is/Ed8rA">list of</a> speakers for their annual party by invitation, such as Crisis in a Connected World in October 2013. Theorists and activists from social networks give this event some external touch of authenticity, but in fact This is a toxic pinata from other people present: US officials, telecommunication magnates, security consultants, financial capitalists, and foreign vultures like Alec Ross (Alec Ross, another Cohen from the State Department).  And at the origins - the hands of contractors and military careerists: an active American cyber team of leaders ("Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCommand chieftains") and even an admiral responsible for US military operations in Latin America in 2006-2009.  And, to the eyeballs, Jared Cohen and Eric Schmidt. <br><br>  I began to think that Eric Schmidt was a brilliant but politically unlucky Californian billionaire who was used in American foreign policy by the very types that he gathered around him to communicate with official Washington - an illustration of the Eastern and West coast customer dilemmas [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>‚ÄúPrincipal-agent problem‚Äù or ‚Äúagency dilemma‚Äù, a situation where one side, the customer (principal), addresses the other side, the contractor (agent), with an order to do something on behalf of someone else‚Äôs name, but their interests are not equivalent and the contractor begins to exploit the customer.</em>  <em>A classic example is when a lawyer makes a decision from which he will benefit, and not his client].</em> <br><br>  I was wrong. <br><br>  <b>More information:</b> <br>  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems">Original</a> excerpt on WikiLeaks <br>  "When Google Met WikiLeaks" in <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/when-google-met-wikileaks/%3Futm_source%3Dnewsweek%26utm_medium%3Dserial%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle_met_wikileaks">its entirety</a> ($ 10) <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOcBG7B6sgOk">Video</a> of Hillary Clinton's appeal in the Mexican forum <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24752/">The first</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24814/">The second</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24850/">Third</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24950/">Fifth</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25078/">Sixth</a> part of the translation <br><br>  For clarifying and editing thanks to <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/netbug/" class="user_link">NetBUG</a> and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ugrum/" class="user_link">Ugrum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299456/</a></p>
