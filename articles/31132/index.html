  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Killing processes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Disobedient users are a nightmare.  Any function that introduces changes to the well-established order of things is a precursor of popular unrest and a barrage of calls to technical support.  Sometimes the user can even invent a way around the new function, and then this method will be passed on from grandfathers to grandchildren, undergoing office folklore, undergoing changes made by each narrator.  The ancient tribes, who found the creation of the world 6,000 years ago, passed on the legends of Mother Earth to each other.  And today we give each other the mysteries of hot keys. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Jess B. worked several years ago with banking software.  Since banks control huge amounts of money (other people's money), then they set the rules.  Jess was busy supporting an application for cashiers and bank clerks.  It was allocated to tune and improve the system of one particular bank. <br><br>  The contact person from the bank was Sherry.  She was great able to filter the requirements and changes put forward by the bank in such a way that they became clear to the developers.  Jess was used to their weekly meetings, and he liked them. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But once Sherry came with a problem that the bank was suffering from.  Notice, I did not say "users", the problem occurred in the whole bank.  Sherry explained, "Totals do not match when cashiers cancel cash counting dialogue." <br><br>  It was a huge chilling blood of the worst problem.  It influenced the total sums accumulated over the entire day of the work of the cashiers: the money came, the money went away, the checks came, the traveler checks went away, and all that.  If these amounts did not converge at the end of the day, then determining the source of the problem became the highest priority.  And therefore, Jess immediately dropped everything and began to investigate. <br><br>  To begin with, he remembered the description of the problem from Sherry: "The final amounts do not coincide when the cashiers cancel the cash counting dialogue."  This dialogue was a window that popped up after a transaction exceeding a certain limit, say $ 1000.  It worked in the same way as one of your first programming labs: saying how much to give change of each note (for example, 4 notes of $ 20 each, 1 note of $ 10, 0 quarters, 2 dimers ...) and asked cashier in the same form to enter the amount of money given.  This irritated users, but was a requirement of the bank, which allowed to avoid mistakes.  In fact, the bank also demanded that all methods of canceling the dialogue be removed, there should not have been any crosses in the corners, or the Cancel button.  Nothing at all. <br><br>  Jess was confused.  Users had no way to cancel the conversation, except to complete the transaction.  He called Sherry and asked her to explain.  ‚ÄúThey use Ctrl + Alt + Delete,‚Äù she said confidently.  After a few moments filled with an awkward pause, she continued, ‚ÄúWe are going to the task manager, to the‚Äú Processes ‚Äùscreen, and cancel the cash counting dialogue in this way.  This is faster than filling in all these fields in the dialogue. ‚Äù <br><br>  I will bring clarity, Jess was not joking at all when he spoke about the completion of the processes.  In the end, this corporate software was not some kind of programmer who could afford to be distracted by requests for "Completing the Task."  No, the process had only to destroy. <br><br>  Jess explained that this ‚Äúcanceling the dialogue‚Äù directly distorts the final reporting due to the sudden end of the application.  Sherry, however, behaved coolly.  ‚ÄúOh, maybe we should better treat all of this as shortcomings in training.‚Äù <br><br>  Translation: Evgeny Vigovsky </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31132/</a></p>
