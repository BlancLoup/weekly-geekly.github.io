      I want to start my letter with the words "this is not spam."  I'm afraid no matter how lazy they look through him, without looking at the essence.  Sorry this trick is no longer working.  But still, I will send it to all the blogs and communities that I have time. <br><br>  Classmates, my circle, in contact ... All these social networks spread very quickly.  Millions of sums for projects that freelance programmers wrote for a couple of hundred webmoney.  And then came the new era of social networking. <br><br>  The state network "People" has become the most widespread phenomenon of the runet.  All are registered in it.  Children, adults, young and old.  The link to the passport and the state approach to the matter played a role.  All kinship relations, all educational and work ties, all social circles of acquaintances are easily viewed on this network.  You know all this very well.  With this it was impossible to fight. <br><br>  A few years ago I received an order - to write an algorithm for finding closed social circles.  That is, to find in the network "People" groups that are connected only with each other.  As usual, I managed to do it overnight, and the remaining time spent on network research, using the access to the server that I was given to work.  Curiosity is my crime. <br><br>  By chance, I found a report folder on some kind of secret conference of big buds.  The conference was about a certain <i>social</i> program "Elimination".  The program proposed the destruction of people who are connected only with each other.  If they disappear, no one in the world will notice.  The table described in detail the benefits of "Elimination".  The material and information benefits of people are already worth a lot.  Apartments, cars.  Blood and organs.  The income from eliminating thousands of people was very impressive.  Someone in addition considered it a much better way to combat the problem of overpopulation than birth control. <br>  Then I thought it was nonsense. <br><br>  Today, when I woke up, I did not see a single missed message or call on the communicator.  All people in my contact list jabber offline.  The Internet works, bots hang.  One and a half hundred friends and acquaintances disappeared from the network.  I immediately guessed what was the matter, but still made a couple of useless calls to friends. <br><br>  Having rummaged in archive, I found the script for the closed circles.  Chased him away from his contact.  The circle closed on the number 3329. In the ‚ÄúElimination‚Äù program, much more modest limits were named.  It looks like the program they liked so much that the scale of the action has been increased. <br><br>  Even then, thinking about privacy, I entered into the script the substitution of information about me, apparently that part of the code remained unnoticed, the comments ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but it works, it‚Äôs better not to touch it‚Äù always came out.  I think it saved me. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how much time will pass before the Dismantlers get to me anyway.  I really hope that the message will be picked up by Internet users and people will find out the truth.  Someone has to stop them ... <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15758/</a></p>
