(c)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On May 18, 2007, the second <a href="http://www.sp-ik.ru/">St. Petersburg Internet Conference (SPIK)</a> was held at the Olgino Hotel.  It's time to share your impressions! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I would like to say that no minor organizational shortcomings compare with the useful and relevant flow of information that has befallen the audience.  Many were hurt that 4 sections run parallel to each other, because I want to be in time at once for everything.  But first things first. <br><br>  Like everyone else, I didn‚Äôt have time for everything, so I‚Äôll highlight a number of reports and speeches from what I was able to see. <br><br>  Firstly, the section ‚ÄúSecurity in the Internet‚Äù was incredibly relevant and useful.  She gathered not many listeners, and, in my opinion, in vain.  I will highlight the last two reports - "Legal analysis of problems related to the detection and investigation of information offenses on the Internet."  The report by Sofia Grunyushkina was very voluminous, but the topic, as it turned out, is very broad.  Students learned about the procedures for protecting information in the network.  The problem was highlighted that often companies simply do not submit a banal application to the police and the prosecutor‚Äôs office in cases of hacking, but this is a natural step and so far is a sign of an insufficient level of literacy in this area.  In the near future, a presentation of her report will appear and I recommend everyone to get acquainted with it. <br>  Also in this section, in the remaining time, another report was presented by Andrei Vorobiev ‚ÄúRisks associated with the loss of a domain‚Äù.  It was about how to protect domains (both from attackers and in controversial cases related to ownership (trademarks, etc.). I also recommend.

      Secondly, I will note two more sections: ‚ÄúSearch Engine Optimization‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvesting in the Internet‚Äù.  The speeches of Mikhail Kozlov (Ashmanov and partners) and Roman Yushko (TRINET) were most likely directed to novice optimizers and customers who are poorly familiar with this sphere, but the structured report and the freshness of ideas should have been enjoyed by everyone. <br>  As for the section "Investing in the Internet", then all 3 reports were undoubtedly bright and incredibly relevant.  I would especially note the report of the Internet bourgeoisie Andrei Ryabykh "Investing in St. Petersburg Internet: Tips for Investors and Startups."  The story was clearly on the stated topic.  Let me give you what I remember the most.  Andrei asked a simple question.  There is a site Fontanka.ru.  What is the second site in St. Petersburg?  No one said.  There is a site DP.  Name the second site.  Silence again.  Now draw conclusions, is there a field for investment.  ‚ÄúOf course there is!‚Äù - the answer suggests itself. <br><br>  So, we speak, we share our thoughts.  We are waiting for podcasts and presentations. <br><br>  UPD!  <a href="http://www.sp-ik.ru/doklad/">www.sp-ik.ru/doklad</a> - conference materials (presentations of the speakers) <br><br>  UPD1: <a href="http://www.romver.ru/my/my.php%3Frazdel%3D175">www.romver.ru/my/my.php?razdel=175</a> - here is the live broadcast, photo essay and opinions.
