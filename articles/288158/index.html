  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Billionaires bloggers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>They are rich, they are powerful and they like to talk.</i> <br><br>  When on November 17, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Internet billionaire Mark Cuban of illegal operations with securities, the tycoon's followers knew where to look for the <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/11/30/the-sec-2/">best comment</a> .  These were neither newspapers nor cable television, but a blog mogul's blogmaverick.com. <br><br>  On November 18, Cuban published 2 statements on the blog and, through its lawyers, appealed against the SEC statements.  In one day, traffic to his blog has tripled.

      This was not the first precedent.  In 2006, during the NBA finals, washing the bones of his native Dallas Mavericks against the San Antonio Spurs, he published a critical note about the game organizers and was immediately fined by the League $ 200,000. <br><br>  Cuban is hardly the only online journalist with a constant audience of 112 million people, but among billionaires with their vast wealth, power and, as a rule, a great desire for the secret private life, it is rare. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So far, we have found 13 billionaires from 1,125 in our list who are active bloggers.  We did not consider single posts, for example, George Soros in The Huffington Post, but searched for those who write to the blog regularly, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs work or simple life posts.  The age of billionaire bloggers almost completely covers the age scale ranging from 24 years old (Mark Zuckerberg) to 80 years old (T. Boone Pickens).  Their blogs cover 5 industries, including media, technology and finance.  The billionaire blogs do not resemble each other, but intersecting, allocate several topics. <br><br>  The most obvious are personal blogs, in which billionaires do not deny themselves self-promotion.  For example, Donald Trump oversees three blogs that have joined his personal brand: the blog of his TV show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù, the blog of the maestro of marketing and his personal blog of Trump. <br><br>  T. Boone Pickens, despite his 80 years, started a blog to help push his pro-wind power Pickens Plan into the minds of Americans.  The blog of the Russian metallurgical magnate Mikhail Prokhorov resembles a fake MySpace page with his video of skiing and a gallery of glamor photos. <br><br>  Some billionaires use blogs to communicate with a wide audience and demonstrate their usualness, thereby forming their real image, compensating for the shortcomings of traditional means of communication with the public.  The owner of the Marriott hotel chain, Bill Marriott, in his blog, is caring and ‚Äúsalt of the earth‚Äù (bibl. Note of Yandex), with his book preferences and praising the staff of Marriott.  Last summer, TV star Oprah Winfrey told in detail about the 21 days of fasting in his blog on Oprah.com, explaining in detail the daily highs and lows of eating on a vegetarian diet for his fans.  Beloved by many JK Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, answers his readers' questions about how to be published on jkrowling.com. <br><br>  For some billionaires, blogs have become an effective tool to support their ideas, allowing them to become opinion leaders and thereby influence the thinking of others.  Well-known shareholder Carl Icahn, for example, devotes numerous blog posts to his thoughts on corporate governance, while Dubai-based construction magnate Khalaf Al Habtoor once again began to talk about the acute threat to the securities market in Iran on his website AlShindagah.com.  Call it a political position, but who would, what did not write, and bloggers billionaires proof of this, the Internet - the most democratic place on the planet. <br><br>  <i>For translation please do not hit, I am not a professional translator, but I really wanted to show the article to more people.</i>  <i>This article is a crosspost from a personal blog, but that's not the point.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288158/</a></p>
