Over the years, it took place in Moscow, Kiev and St. Petersburg.  The conference attracts Perl-professionals from different cities and countries to share experiences, make new contacts in their field and communicate with like-minded people in an informal and pleasant atmosphere.  The program of the meeting is waiting for you under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>10.00 - gathering guests</b> <br><br>  <b>11.00 - Elena Shishkina, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>Validators of complex structures, or how we made a new API</b>

      <b>11.45 - Ksenia Bobrova, ACI Worldwide.</b>  <b>Continuous integration of Perl code with Jenkins and Gerrit</b> <br>  This report will explain how to use Gerrit Code Review and Jenkins to automate the delivery of Perl-code from the local development machine to production. <br><br>  <b>12.30 - Nikolay Mishin, "Master Domino".</b>  <b>Using Eclipse as a Perl Editor</b> <br><br>  <b>12.55 - Evgeny Vancevich, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>Perl memory analysis.</b>  <b>Tips &amp; Tricks</b> <br>  Sooner or later, a situation arises when the application starts to take up a lot of memory, or starts flowing.  Eugene's report is devoted to what to do in such situations, and how to avoid them.  The tools for analyzing memory in Perl will be reviewed, starting with what the process memory is used for, evaluating the data overhead, and ending with searching for memory leaks.  The knowledge gained will be applied in practice. <br><br>  <b>14.00 - LUNCH</b> <br><br>  <b>14.30 - Alexey Melezhik, EPAM Systems.</b>  <b>Sparrow - reusable automation scripts</b> <br>  Sparrow is a distributed multipurpose scripting system that allows you to quickly create and reuse any automation scripts.  Scope: deployment, configuration management, automated testing, auditing and monitoring.  You create your scripts and upload them as plugins to the central SparrowHub repository, while others can use them.  The system is written in Perl5.  Scripts (plugins) are written in Perl, Bash, Ruby - your choice.  There is an internal DSL to verify the operation of scripts (Outthentic :: DSL).  Script reports are provided as TAP.  The system can be used independently with the help of the console client, and also easily integrated (using other means as "transport") with existing configuration management systems such as chef, ansible, rex. <br><br>  <b>15.15 - Alexey Mashanov, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>Perl faster than Perl</b> <br>  The use of interpreted languages, such as Perl, to develop complex high-load Web services sometimes poses complex tasks for developers.  First, it is necessary to have time to respond to customer requests for a comfortable time for the user (no more than 300 ms), and secondly, to process all incoming requests using the minimum number of servers.  Because of these two factors, tasks that are often solved, for example, on the pros, are implemented in Perl with a big creak.  The talk focuses on possible evolutionary / revolutionary ways to improve the performance of a project, mostly written in Perl. <br><br>  <b>15.40 - Pavel Limorenko, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>Monitoring: a demon that reads logs</b> <br>  Imagine that you have a lot of services running on your machine, each of which constantly (and intensively) writes something in /var/log/service_name.log.  How to keep track of their work?  And you want to do it in real time!  And now let's complicate the task: you have a farm of 500 such machines.  And 50 colleagues, and everyone wants to look for something in their logs.  We in Mail.Ru learned how to cope with this and wrote a convenient tool in Perl, the principle of which we want to share with you. <br><br>  <b>16.25 - Nikolay Mishin, "Master Domino".</b>  <b>Implementing the Observer Pattern on Moose</b> <br><br>  <b>16.50 - Ivan Panchenko, Postgres Professional.</b>  <b>How to work asynchronously from Perl with PostgreSQL</b> <br>  Wonderful AnyEvent :: HTTP :: Server of the highly respected Mons allows you to build very compact and efficient pearl-barley microservices.  Once I needed to raise such a service as an interface to PostgreSQL (even to several).  Of course, there are good alternative non-perforated solutions ‚Äî C2H5ON or simply the ngx_postgres module.  But as you know, Perl is more flexible.  With PostgreSQL from Perl, everyone is used to working with DBI - and it is not suitable for asynchronous work.  It turns out there is an alternative.  In this short report, it will be shown how using AnyEvent to build asynchronous microservices, within which is PostgreSQL. <br><br>  <b>17.15 - COFFEE BREAK</b> <br><br>  <b>17.30 - Mikhail Ozerov, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>The implementation of the state machine for working with complex payment system scenarios (and not only)</b> <br><br>  <b>18.15 - Andrey Enshin, Mail.Ru Group.</b>  <b>Perl method invocation</b> <br><br>  <b>18.40 - Lighting Talks</b> <br><br>  <b>20.00 - After Party</b> <br><br>  For all those who can not attend, we will organize a live <a href="https://it.mail.ru/broadcasts/35/">video broadcast</a> . <br><br>  Participation is free, but you must <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/social/login/mailitauth/%3Fnext%3D/ru/it/event/registration/222/">register</a> . <br><br>  Address: Moscow, Leningradsky pr. 39, p. 79, office of Mail.Ru Group. <br><br>  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303856/</a></p>
