Hosting Tracker offers a number of interesting offers for hosting partners. <br><br>  Becoming a partner of the <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">Host-Tracker service is</a> quite simple.  To do this, simply fill out the registration form of partner hosting and provide the service with a dedicated virtual Windows hosting that meets the requirements of Host-Tracker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03f/7c3/a30/03f7c3a305b3445bbb097e97d9591dcf.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Key directions for the development of the Host-Tracker network </h4><br>  Host-Tracker develops a monitoring network in two directions.  One of the directions is the purchase of hosting at the most important points by the company itself.  Another direction of the network development is the invitation to partnership of companies interested in monitoring resources and other provided buns. <br><br>  This approach allows Host-Tracker to naturally increase its monitoring network.  At the same time, partners of the company receive a number of benefits from cooperation with a popular monitoring service.  It is possible to become a hosting partner through the provision of dedicated hosting or VPS.  Host-Tracker will include them in its monitoring network. <br><br><h4>  Pursued goals </h4><br>  Host-Tracker already has an extensive monitoring network, the resources of which are located throughout the world - more than 50 agents in all inhabited continents.  However, the existing network for some functions is not enough.  For example, one of the goals is to create in the selected region a pool of servers that are close enough to the client so that he can get a set of checking servers whose location approximately corresponds to the target audience of his sites. <br><br>  The logic of the monitoring system is as follows: to obtain the most correct assessment, the result of checking from several agents is necessary.  It is for such multi-checks that each agent should be geographically located in the same region where the main audience of users of the checked website is located.  Otherwise, in terms of response time, speed and other parameters, there can be a strong scatter. <br><br><h4>  Partner Benefits </h4><br>  Partnership with Host-Tracker will bring a number of benefits to service partners, which will reduce the cost of using the monitoring service, as well as get an additional audience of users.  Among the benefits that hosting partners can expect: <br><ul><li>  Significant discounts on all services of the service; </li><li>  Participation in other affiliate programs - an opportunity, for example, to become a reseller </li><li>  Relevant link to hosting partner; </li><li>  Improving the reputation of the company. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Virtual hosting options </h4><br>  The shared hosting selected for monitoring purposes must meet the minimum requirements in terms of its resources.  This should be Windows hosting with the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  Support ASP.NET 4.0; </li><li>  Installed IIS web server </li><li>  Disk space of 100 MB; </li><li>  From 20 to 30 GB of traffic per month; </li><li>  Support for ftp and http protocols. </li></ul><br><br>  The requirements for RAM and processor are minimal.  Host Tracker will not load server hosting partner heavily.  As a rule, requirements for hosting characteristics do not exceed the minimum packages of services offered by hosting to their customers. <br><br>  Access to a dedicated hosting can be provided by any domain name or even just by IP-address.  Host-Tracker for a domain name sets conditions of a recommendation only.  The domain can be an address of the form [city] -ht. [Customer_company_domain]. <br><br>  For coordination of details and on the occasion of the questions, please contact us at <i>ht2support@host-tracker.com</i> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266053/</a></p>
