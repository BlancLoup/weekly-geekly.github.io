  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What should be a home telecommunications system?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I propose to consider, think about the concept of a home telecommunications system (Home Telecommunication System, HTS), and more specifically, its infrastructure. <br>  Why do you need?  In order to use their gadgets, PCs and other various electronic devices, at least somehow using (or potentially capable of) information flows, whether it be data transmission in all its forms or various analog audio, video, ... <br>  And how to do it?  It is possible (and necessary! But impossible on the knees, even if only because of the concept) to assemble from all the already existing enterprise solutions. <br>  For the time being, very common words sound;  a little more detailed and concrete thought on the tree will flow further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The purpose of the article: to create the most understandable representation of what should be modern HTS;  throw grains :). <br>  HTS Stack - Classic: <br>  1) physical infrastructure of data transmission, ore infrastructure. <br>  2) intellectual management of this infrastructure, system (and, possibly, user) services. <br>  These are basic, basic tasks.  The rest will grow over them already.  The rest is existing and future software and devices, which will do, as it seems to me, the main features for the user and cash for software / device manufacturers.  The analogy with computers is quite acceptable: a technically standardized market, on the basis of which a huge amount (including in $) of software and related hardware has grown.  In other words: computers are HTS, software on computers are applications in HTS and a bunch of devices.  He brought the analogy with the computers also because it clearly shows how HTS can be turned into a tangible product for producers and consumers from the next manila period (I will sometimes broadcast it with stamps). <br>  HTS is just the next step in the way people work with information around a person in their home environment.  And the next stage is the work of a single HTS network (Global HTS, GHTS). <br><br>  By default, we are talking about the space inside the apartment, cottage, private house (hereinafter referred to as all types types ‚Äúhome‚Äù) and the surrounding space.  We consider everything for the household market, the home user. <br>  First, typical user scenarios and their solution (disordered and non-systemic, with intersections). <br><br><h3>  1. User requests </h3><br><h4>  1.1.  Freedom of movement (mobility) </h4><br>  Task: Move around your home with WiFi, Bluetooth devices (including stationary), without thinking about the location of the equipment (access points, AP), collisions with other equipment, their own household appliances and neighbors ... <br>  Solution: WiFi and Bluetooth (BT) networks with controller and AP.

    <h4>  1.2.  Freedom of Multimedia </h4><br>  Task: To watch, listen and even transfer media content with minimal gestures, almost without thinking where to which regular audio-video (AV) cable to throw, how to set up broadcast over the network, etc. <br>  Solution: (and here, briefly again, only common words) The introduction (and refinement) of surviving and promising standards relating to the transmission and playback of multimedia on various devices. <br>  Banal household example: playing audio stream from a smartphone.  The smartphone clings to BT headphones.  Went around the corner, "unsuccessfully" turned away - and that's all.  How to change the situation, without changing anything in user devices?  In the house, there is a BT network, and the headphones and the smartphone are connected not to each other, but to the BT network;  further obvious. <br><br><h4>  1.3.  Access to the outside world (where the Internet, of course, the main) </h4><br>  Task: To have the fastest and most reliable communication with the outside world, not scoring, through what is better here and now - your cable Internet, 4G, up to public WiFi, the neighboring network (if there is also HTS) ... <br>  Solution: Find, analyze and optimally use all available resources (= communication channels) with the outside world. <br><br><h4>  1.4.  Communication people </h4><br>  Task: Communicate with text, voice, video, without hesitation (further - see p.3). <br>  Solution: On top of the decision p.3 <br><br><h4>  1.5.  Data storage </h4><br>  Task: Securely store your (and not your) diverse data. <br>  Solution: DSS using all available internal and external resources. <br><br><h4>  1.6.  Smart House </h4><br>  Task: (auto) management of engineering systems at home. <br>  Solution: you need a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù with connection to these engineering systems. <br><br>  [what else is needed at home?] <br><br><h3>  2. Reality + small perspective view </h3><br>  Quickly go through each item that we have today for each part. <br><h4>  2.1.  Mobility </h4><br>  Here iron realization interests - suddenly the bike is already there;  Data transmission technology can not yet be discussed: we have onboard WiFi, BT. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Properties </th><th>  Home router </th><th>  + repeaters </th><th>  Smart systems </th><th>  Budget from corporate ( <acronym>Small Medium Business</acronym> ) </th></tr><tr><td>  Functional </td><td>  1 AP </td><td colspan="2">  several APs (mesh, but not always): poor use of <abbr title="Frequency Band, frequency range">FBand</abbr> , lower speed </td><td>  Most likely, there is no network auto-optimization </td></tr><tr><td>  Difficulty of use </td><td>  almost plug'n'play </td><td>  relatively simple setup </td><td>  plug'n'play </td><td>  qualification required </td></tr><tr><td>  Cost of </td><td>  $ </td><td>  $$ </td><td>  $$$ </td><td>  $$$$ </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Only full-fledged WiFi controllers that can fully interact with clients, listen to interference and other people's networks are suitable for our task, then, based on all the data received on the autopilot, optimally distribute power, frequencies and even radiation directivity of their APs (phase antennas).  The closest are non-cheap systems from the SMB segment, in which the functionality has been cut.  As far as I understand, now smart systems are gradually occupying a niche ( <a href="https://lumahome.com/">for example</a> , and there is no longer a mesh). <br>  There are no network solutions for BT.  If there is, then a unique, non-standard, approximately as in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/288820/">article</a> <a href="https://habr.com/users/tarson/" class="user_link">Tarson</a> and in the comments to it. <br><br><h4>  2.2.  Multimedia </h4><br>  Unlike the previous paragraph, here, on the contrary, it is not the devices that are interested, but the standards and protocols used ‚Äî what the infrastructure should support. <br>  Well, there is a decent set of technologies, from conditionally standard / universal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast">Miracast</a> ), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a> ) to vendor / proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay">AirPlay</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cast">Google Cast</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiDi">WiDi</a> and (for now?) Exotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Home_Digital_Interface">WHDI</a> .  Looking into a ghostly future, if protocols such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance">WiGig are</a> launched, multimedia standards will drastically change / be created. <br>  Total: we have a zoo without a clear leader. <br><br><h4>  2.3.  Communication with the outside world </h4><br>  They are also interested in the protocols / standards by which our house looks outside (and outside they look at our house).  You can, if desired, to do the classification, for example: wired and wireless, digital and analog, etc.  While it is enough to list. <br>  1. Of course, copper Ethernet, which is 10/100 / 1000Base-T.  And even 10G. <br>  2. The same, but optics.  Here we remember the built-in and SFP-interfaces.  The latter are not present in the equipment for the house, but why not. <br>  3. We slightly grab the responsibility of the operator / provider - various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network">xPONs</a> , as well as various branches / developments like GEPON. <br>  4. Gradually dying off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line">xDSL</a> .  I suspect that technology is alive and well in many places on the planet, so we leave it. <br>  5. Mobile (which is cellular) communication.  Generations from 2G to 4G with a 5G sight (short label - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network">at the bottom of the article</a> ).  In addition to the standards themselves, we also remember about the variations of frequencies used by countries. <br>  6. Satellite communication.  Within our system - as another (Ethernet) channel. <br>  7. Public WiFi.  Visible open WiFi networks. <br>  8. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television">Digital TV broadcast</a> , five groups of formats ATSC, DMB, DTMB, DVB, ISDB.  Looking ahead, we can immediately say - we drop the analog broadcasting, it is too expensive in terms of processing resources to push it into the home system. <br>  9. Analog telephone lines (FXO). <br><br><h4>  2.4.  Communication people </h4><br>  Communication takes place through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network">PSTN</a> , today including from analog lines to mobile operators, and the Internet has not yet been regulated by government bureaucracies.  User terminals, from hardware to software: analog devices, mobile phones, specialized (video, SIP, DECT, etc.) terminals, software on devices. <br>  At the moment, an average family has a decent variety of hardware and software clients that are almost completely unrelated to each other and work on virtually all internal and external communication channels.  Each person has a whole set of devices, and even if one discards all the little / rarely used ones and leaves the smartphone, then there is a zoo of applications on it. <br><br><h4>  2.5.  Data storage </h4><br>  Typical: in smartphones (photo), on computers (everything), for advanced - ‚Äúclouds‚Äù.  Particularly advanced (% shares) are able to synchronize semi- and automatically. <br>  There are no solutions for the average user, which allows to store and use their data qualitatively (reliably, quickly, safely, on different devices, etc.) without recesses in the IT world. <br><br><h4>  2.6.  Smart House </h4><br>  For all the previous tasks there is some kind of understanding, quite understandable sets and combinations of technologies, devices.  Immediately, once again bumping into another article about the smart home, something like ‚Äúdamn both your homes‚Äù is usually pulled out.  Who in what is ready, and what just is not invented by the devil knows how many strange (for the house) technologies.  All solutions out of the box are reduced to about a light bulb / outlet, controlled from a telephone (oh yeah, smart home!).  Everything else looks monstrous, not replicable, expensive. <br>  So far with a stretch, more like the future than the present, purely software solutions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa">Alexa (Amazon)</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri (Apple)</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant">Google Assistant</a> , <a href="https://alice.yandex.ru/">Alice (Yandex)</a> can be counted as smart home.  Very similar to the fact that such a smart home control in the coming years should be de facto.  So far, practical implementations, for example, <a href="http://diskmag.ru/tehnologii/home-sapiens-russkoyazychnaya-sistema.html">Home Sapiens</a> (thanks for the hint to readers), have not fired. <br><br>  So, what we have.  User requirements are poorly correlated with real implementations.  There is no complete solution.  The situation for each type of functionality is approximately the same as in the tablet about WiFi. <br><br><h3>  3. System Description </h3><br>  How does the HTS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ea/_g/tu/ea_gtuw-ibth45oemzxrkfxxgog.png"><br><br><h4>  3.1.  Schematic topology </h4><br>  The complex is built according to the principles of software-defined (SDx) systems under AI control (I use it not for the sake of convenience, but only for the essence of the truth for the sake of).  Basically, HTS should work no longer in the traditional paradigm (especially with handles of stuffed) templates, but in real-time, to dynamically provide the optimal telecom.  Wednesday at any time. <br>  HTS combines elements of both a centralized system (there is a core) and a decentralized one (the components have some autonomy).  Within the framework of GHTS, respectively, there is a common interaction logic within the GHTS and there is a full autonomy mode of HTS. <br><br>  All system management is performed by the main and mandatory component of the <b>MainBox</b> ;  it is the core and brain of the system.  The remaining components (denoted as xBox) are optional, have their own specializations, contain a minimum of intelligence, but sufficient, for example, to work in the current mode when the kernel rolls off. <br>  <b>WLBox</b> provides all possible wireless interfaces. <br>  <b>MediaBox is</b> designed to connect media devices (TV, monitors, computers) in HTS. <br>  <b>OutWLBox</b> is the <b>WLBox</b> option for installation as close as possible to the edges of the room, and for private households and outside the house.  Among other things, provides communication with mobile operators. <br>  <b>mWLBox</b> is a truncated version of the <b>WLBox</b> to support the most common WiFi and BT protocols.  The more of them in the house, the better. <br>  All interfaces between all HTS components ‚Äî 1 / 2.5 / 5 / 10G Ethernet, WiFi, and HomePlug ‚Äî work as one communication channel.  Each HTS component has these three sets of interfaces on board. <br>  All external wired communications are also via <b>MainBox</b> , wireless - primarily through <b>OutWLBox</b> .  The larger the AP, the less their transmit power, the more segmented the radio band. <br>  Each wireless interface of each component operates within its own distributed network.  Network controllers (which are in <b>MainBox</b> ) know about each other and use this info (there is a conditional "supercontroller").  We get: <br>  - optimal use of the radio frequency range within the HTS; <br>  - no collisions within each network and between HTS networks; <br>  - minimizing problems with other (unmanaged HTS) sources of interference; <br>  - individual monitoring of the state of each user device, providing it with the maximum channel capacity; <br>  - automatic roaming and handover; <br>  - And still a number of specific and not very opportunities. <br>  Wireless networks require minimization of the distances between components due to the characteristics of the BT and WiFi protocols.  In particular, small areas of maximum data transfer rate.  Especially for this purpose - <b>mWLBox</b> . <br>  In the ideal case, when your HTSs are also deployed in neighboring apartments and there is a connection between them (the higher-speed, the better), all the listed features work even more efficiently - all neighboring HTSs automatically not only agree with each other about the use of the radio band, but also they are trying to create a single network (taking into account certain restrictions, for example, prohibiting or severely limiting the use of external connections of a neighboring HTS with limited traffic). <br>  On top of this topology, a distributed storage and file transfer system (let's call it DSSEF - Distributed System Storage and Exchange File) is launched, acting for the benefit of both users and operator (s) GHTS.  Current types of DSSEF - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> , <a href="https://denet.pro/">DeNet</a> <br><br><h4>  3.2.  Components </h4><br>  Common to all HTS components: <br>  - food both from the power supply network, and on PoE (except the <b>MainBox</b> itself); <br>  - interfaces for work in the HTS network - 1 / 2.5 / 5 / 10G Ethernet, WiFi and HomePlug; <br>  - have the most common interfaces for working with user devices, such as WiFi and BT; <br>  - stuffing (except for <b>MainBox</b> ) - bundles of SoC + FPGA; <br>  - On board a set of Big Brother to work smart home;  something like this: camera, microphone, speaker, various sensors (movement, temperature, humidity, light, etc.);  there is also a separate serious section for study; <br>  - all the logic of radio interfaces, from management to radio modules - reprogrammable ( <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr">an example of a</a> similar ideology), which will allow eliminating bugs, choosing regional patterns, changing parameters when changing regional standards without changing iron and without user input; <br>  - the mode of preserving the maximum efficiency with the loss of the kernel <br><br><h5>  3.2.1.  <b>Mainbox</b> </h5><br>  It includes a server, a switch, a set of wireless interfaces and a UPS. <br>  On the server to spin the entire set of software - virtual (s) / OS, controllers, etc.  The composition of iron (processor, memory) will be clear after specifying tasks, understanding the composition of software.  Very pre-desktop processor level Core i5 / i7, Ryzen 5/7. <br>  The switch, as in all other components, works on the principle of SDN.  Ethernet ports looking inside an HTS network are no worse than PoE + (30 W).  Ideally, 60 watts.  Also through it are all wired connections outside to service providers (Communications service provider, CSP). <br>  UPS provides the entire complex with power supply.  It is built on the ideology of online transformation (perhaps something similar to the study of <a href="https://habr.com/users/r4abi/" class="user_link">R4ABI</a> ). <br><br><h5>  3.2.2.  <b>Wlbox</b> </h5><br>  Component providing network connections: <br>  - inside HTS; <br>  - HTS with home devices; <br>  - between HTSs within GHTS. <br><br>  A kit like this: <br>  - WiFi: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac">802.11ac</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">802.11n</a> with development to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax">ax</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance">ad</a> with development to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ay">ay</a> , aj, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11af">af</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ah">ah</a> ; <br>  - BT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">BT 5</a> ; <br>  - IoT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave">Z-Wave</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN">LPWAN</a> Kit; <br>  - DECT; <br>  - Ethernet: autosense 1 / 2.5 / 5 / 10G (PoE 802.3bt Type 4 - for <b>MainBox</b> exactly; perhaps for the components that the user will plug into the power grid).  For a network of HTS components and for connecting home devices; <br>  - HomePlug: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePlug">HomePlug AV2</a> ; <br>  - Femtocell (or Picocell): under a big question (you have to dig). <br>  Lists the desired specification.  There is a convention broken down by groups;  for example, part of the WiFi standards are also used for IoT.  All protocols / standards are in maximum implementation.  The result should be a compromise, first of all, between the technical functionality, size, compatibility.  An antenna-feeder system covering all (or the vast majority) implementations of the interfaces used should be designed.  Requires serious R &amp; D. <br><br><h5>  3.2.3.  <b>mWLBox</b> </h5><br>  Strongly truncated version of the <b>WLBox</b> with the most common interfaces (WiFi, BT) for installation in conditional "white" spots.  The more installed in the house, the better. <br><br><h5>  3.2.4.  <b>Outwlbox</b> </h5><br>  It provides the operation of user devices at the border of the house, communication with external wireless networks: cellular operators, satellite navigation systems.  Main tasks: <br>  - coverage of internal and immediate external borders of the house; <br>  - communication with user devices outside the house, their allocation from a high-speed intrahouse network; <br>  - voice communication and data transmission over networks of cellular operators; <br>  - geolocation on satellite navigation systems; <br>  - connect with neighboring HTS; <br>  - connection with adjacent open WiFi networks (backup channel in case of main accident). <br>  Mounted on the edge of the house;  options: <br>  - flat: by the window, on the balcony / loggia; <br>  - private house: by the window, from the outside of the wall. <br>  The set of interfaces is similar to the <b>WLBox</b> with a smaller number of Ethernet and USB ports, plus cellular operators ( <b>3/4</b> / 5G) satellite global and regional navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, ...). <br>  In the future, for private homes, you can develop a separate version of <b>OutWLBox</b> for installation on the roof. <br><br><h5>  3.2.5.  <b>Mediabox</b> </h5><br>  Component that provides media devices in the HTS.  In fact, consists of two parts: a set of wireless interfaces and <b>MediaCenter</b> .  The composition of the set of wireless interfaces is similar to the <b>WLBox</b> with possible minor adjustments.  If a <b>MediaBox is</b> installed in the room, then <b>WLBox</b> in the same room will most likely be redundant. <br>  <b>MediaCenter</b> Tasks: <br>  - transfer of multimedia (audio, video) stream to display / voice devices (monitors, TV, projectors, various audio amplifiers) via standard multimedia interfaces (HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, analog audio); <br>  - work on wireless standardized and vendor protocols with their supporting devices (see p.2.2); <br>  - receiving multimedia stream through standard interfaces from user devices. <br><br><h3>  4. General reflections </h3><br><br>  The system is very complex in terms of hardware, and especially software.  Soft, eat-but, must be accompanied.  And all this should be sold on a large scale, and not within the limits of one country. <br>  It seems to me that the development of such a system can be pulled only by giants of the type (in alphabetical and not probabilistic order) of Cisco, Google, HP, Huawei and the like [in a couple of these offices threw up their offer (in another form, it eats but :)) - full ignore].  Why - the reason has already been said: even the components are very difficult to implement, and what can we say about the system in the complex?  For example, just look at how long and painfully these same companies build only their WiFi solutions.  Similar to network monitoring.  And when did the concept of SDN appear, and where is it now?  And so you can go through many key things. <br>  On the other hand, there are a number of reasons why the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãHTS inside these offices most likely will not shoot. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa company from scratch to implement (at least, development) HTS is tempting.  In addition to decent financial investments and competent (yes, it is already ridiculous, but let me fantasize) the management will remain the most important thing - sales. <br><br>  Above is just one of the options for the system.  Good for its huge potential, bad cumbersome because of the fundamental approach, similar to large corporate systems.  Most likely, such systems will evolve differently, in the opposite direction - from small to large.  Now you can see the first shoots, very slowly approaching from all sides.  Gradually, a large number of disparate conditionally ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices appear, from the glorified light bulb to more or less complex smart homes. <br>  One of the options for starting the implementation of the idea is to develop the architecture of the entire solution, but to create and implement a system consisting only of the first kernel version as a router with some minimal set of functionality and <b>mWLBox</b> with the expectation that only the full-featured kernel will be replaced later.  Further, the system can be upgraded with different components, whether it be power outlets, various clocks, small audio speakers, and numerous other devices that already exist and surrounding us ‚Äî you can embed a lot of HTS components into them. <br><br>  As I see it, HTS, especially GHTS, which implements "smart" telecom.  The infrastructure of the house has a huge mutually beneficial potential for all participants in the system (hardware and software manufacturers, vendors, network and service operators, and, of course, users). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370853/</a></p>
