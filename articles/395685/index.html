  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking Caliber</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This spring, in connection with the expansion of the project team Web-payment.ru, we are faced with the need to search for a functional office space in Moscow.  In addition to the reasonable cost of renting and the quality of the internal infrastructure of the premises, an important component for us was also proximity to the third transport ring and the metro.  In the process of searching, I saw the whole, as it seemed to me then, palette of Moscow commercial real estate offers for rent: low-cost, but dilapidated, dilapidated and completely unsuitable for work industrial buildings near the Third Transport Ring, as well as rather expensive offices and co-workers at MIBC ‚ÄúMoscow- City "and other business centers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6e/c15/997/d6ec1599798e42b397cd3e8764f16c81.jpg" align="left" width="450">  At some point, during the next round of Internet surfing, I caught sight of a February note about a three-story co-working shop that opened on the territory of the Kaliber Technopark, located within walking distance from the Alekseevskaya metro station.  The article highlighted the current concept of coworking, allegedly borrowed from the Silicon Valley IT companies.  To be honest, I never really trusted such announcements in the media, and the very word ‚Äútechnopark‚Äù, as applied to the territory of the former Soviet plant, rather caused skepticism.  But after reading the information on the site, I nevertheless decided to go to work on a test day in <a href="http://kalibr.co/">co-</a> working <a href="http://kalibr.co/">"Caliber"</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My way to the ‚ÄúCaliber‚Äù from the metro was about 7 minutes.  At the checkpoint, where I entered from Godovikov Street, I issued a one-time pass and, having passed the turnstiles, found myself in the factory.  The three-story coworking itself, as it turned out, was located at the back of the Caliber.  Passing past several business buildings, to the left of the road I saw a three-story building with large, floor-to-ceiling windows.  Behind the glass entrance doors I was waiting for the common room with the reception, conference room and mini-coffee shop.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the interior space was quite bright and pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness, modern design and freshness of decoration.  In the interior, elements that corresponded to the appearance of the Silicon Valley IT companies were indeed captured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/872/510/0ee872510f4c42e38d2baf9392e5c50e.jpg"><br>  <i>Hall of the first floor</i>

      For me, we had a tour and showed both the total space of coworking and individual mini-offices.  The 2nd floor is arranged in the openspace format, where the working area for the co-workers is divided into two parts: fixed seats and empty seats.  An important plus to which I paid attention is that all rooms are equipped with ventilation and air conditioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f84/4d2/ba5/f844d2ba57bf4cc287324d4cea0693da.jpg"><br>  <i>Working openspace zone</i> <br><br>  Inquiring about the rental price, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the price of a non-fixed workplace in the Caliber co-working is <b>6500 rubles.</b>  <b>in months</b>  In addition, this price also includes a locker designed for storing valuable things for the period when the tenant is not at work.  In addition, the cost of renting a workplace also includes a ‚Äútransparent‚Äù list of services available to the landlord: unlimited scanning of documents, printing up to 80 sheets per month, 2 hours of free guest‚Äôs stay per day (in case a client or partner visits you) and 2 negotiation hours per month.  Of course, at the same time, the recreation area with a microwave, cooler, tea, coffee and cookies is at arm's length.  The combination of all these seemingly unimportant details, for me, became a confirmation that at this place victory was finally won by order, practicality and common sense. <br><br>  On the third floor, I looked at several separate rooms (one of which we later moved after several months of rent at the simplest rate) and drew attention to the open veranda.  Such a space would be perfect for lovers to sit comfortably on a ottoman or at a table in a chair and work outdoors outside the office walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fb/217/1a4/7fb2171a425c4e98a8abc8bccbe297c2.jpg"><br>  <i>Our mini office</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/887/636/21f88763604e4427b16ce0f8e4ac1c70.jpg"><br>  <i>Veranda</i> <br><br>  Another interesting feature of Calibra also seemed to me to be the regular organization of business events - for example, <a href="http://kalibr.co/archives/321">Creative Mornings</a> , etc. By the way, the rental prices for conference halls were pleasantly surprised - just 12,000 rubles.  4 hours and 21 000 rubles.  in 8 hours.  With a capacity of 80 people, for a minute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e21/6aa/17a/e216aa17ab1a490fa67256f1e762e656.jpg"><br>  <i>Speech by Arkady Moreynis</i> <br><br>  For ages the marketing shell coincided with the actual content.  Coworking "Caliber".  In the best way corresponds to my ideas about comfortable and inexpensive office space, therefore I recommend this place to all Habravchanians who are in search of office space.  Personally, I would like this coworking to become a permanent gathering place and parties of habrajitel, because  such a place is not enough.  Therefore, I invite everyone interested to come to work on a free test day.
