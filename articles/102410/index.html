  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tale of how I received my sight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is unlikely for someone to be the news that there are a lot of people with any vision problems.  It can be a small minus, it can be very big.  And everyone for himself begins to look for ways to ‚Äúreturn edinichki‚Äù, very few people leave it to chance.  Too often it is required to look with full eyes: at work, driving, etc.  And now, almost everywhere they have switched to spreadsheets, and stupidly remembering ‚ÄúShb mnk Yymbsh‚Äù no longer works. <br><br>  I had 0.16, of course I wore glasses.  Lenses could not tolerate.  The people were usually not the topic that I saw badly right away, and did not work sitting in computers or vypayvaya small details, mocked me, it was all on the drum.  I honestly tried many ways to recover from holey glasses to a gymnast.  But what does it mean to <i>restore the vision</i> , if your reference point was still not one? <br><br>  And I would live in a constant fog further, until I tried it.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Lasik </h4><br><br>  To begin with, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK">Lasik</a> is an operation.  The operation is done semi-automatically and corrects a lot of imperfections of both optics and retina (for myopic, this is relevant).  After the operation, a person gets a "super vision", but do not forget that once the vision was not perfect.  The image shows the progress of the operation: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/dd/46/dd46c02b68fa606d9410950327c6cc8d.jpg"></div><br><br>  In <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK">Wikipedia,</a> you can read more, retelling everything does not make sense.  The essence is precisely in cutting a small piece of the cornea's surface, heating the cornea with a laser (I thought the smell would be more unpleasant) and returning the cut layer back.  All this time the patient is in a horizontal position and looks at the red point with a wide-open eye.  The operation is painless, quick, but partly unpleasant.  At such a moment it is better to disengage from what is happening and focus on the red dot, otherwise you can spoil everything. <br><br>  After the operation, the eyes will be dry for some time, there will be a great desire to scratch them, wash them and soon read the Habr.  But all this can not be done on the first day.  It is necessary to endure, and on the second day you can feel alive. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><ul><li>  After the operation, I immediately saw it well and for a long time, which cannot be said about other methods. </li><li>  I improved my vision to 1.2 (120%), now I see better than ordinary people! </li><li>  No problems with glasses such as misting, soiling, etc ... All because glasses are no longer needed!  (similarly, the corresponding lens problems disappeared). </li><li>  I walked around the city and began to notice how beautiful he really was.  I understand that walking around the city and rejoicing for a long time is impossible, they may not understand, but this is all nonsense when everything is so beautiful! </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><ul><li>  You will have to take care of yourself for some time: not to beat your head, not to take a bath, to walk in dark glasses and so on.  You can‚Äôt jump here. </li><li>  Corrective glasses gave some charm, +5 years to the age and authority, and now everyone saw my big nose!  Oh.. </li><li>  Not yet invented what to do with a driver's license.  There is a mark "vision correction", and I‚Äôm going to drive without glasses. </li></ul><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  So that the opponents of the operation would not think, so that the supporters would not bring them, I decided for myself and did it, now I feel very well.  Of course, out of habit, all the time I want to fix the glasses constantly slipping from my nose.  It will soon pass. <br><br>  I will try to answer some questions about the procedure, if something remains unresolved, in the comments, but I am not going to persuade or discourage anyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102410/</a></p>
