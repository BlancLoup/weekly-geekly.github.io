  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to go to the service center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently, many people stumble upon the skillful excuses of workers of service centers.  And, most often through their own fault.  But if you calculate everything in advance, you can get it pretty quickly.  In this article I will try to briefly describe which rules are best followed, so as not to <br>  stay in the cold <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Getting ready or home stage.</b> <br><br>  Firstly, before thinking about going to a service center, ideally, you should <b>read the warranty cards and find out your and their (service) obligations</b> .  If you have a guarantee in the form of a small piece of paper on which it is written that in the event of a fracture in half, the product is not accepted for repair - I advise you to refer to the laws, and specifically to the zono <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/popular/consumerism/">"On Consumer Protection"</a> .  There is already your warranty capabilities depend on the type of product. <br><br>  Secondly, we must try to avoid any warranty stumble.  Since the officials and receivers with the masters in the service centers simply adore building themselves silly and claiming that it was you who messed up your player with the Dima Bilan track there.  And you can not prove that this <s>music</s> does not spoil the player.  No one :). <br>  The main thing - BEFORE THE ARRIVAL in the service center to remove all mortal guarantee sins.  Carry the keyboard - <b>erase mayonnaise from the keys, the monitor is also better to scrub</b> .  In principle, I think it is not necessary to explain that the workers of the service centers (the majority of them) refer to any flaws, in most cases they are right and the arguments are legitimate. <br>  The problem with computers of more or less advanced users is very relevant nowadays.  <b>The problem of unlicensed OS</b> .  Remember, if you bring a computer with an installed system, without a license, you <b>can be removed from the guarantee</b> without any questions.  Let you bought it a day ago.  Before the hike, it is ideal to install the OS on the computer that came with it, wiping the old one clean and installing all the necessary drivers, recreating the malfunction, if it is software and hardware. <br>  <i>\\ Perhaps at this stage, the need to contact the service will disappear by itself.</i> <br>  Also, if you carry a laptop to a service center, and it is clogged with dust and therefore turns off - you can easily be removed from the warranty and offer cleaning for N rubles. <br>  <i>\\ Most laptops in manuals written in black and white that installing a laptop on a soft fleecy surface violates the cooling conditions and failure to comply with this prohibition entails a departure from the guarantee. It should be remembered that lovers will lie in bed with their beloved friend. laptop, is designed as a vacuum cleaner and the master will not be difficult to find traces of your crime \\</i> <br>  At best, just offer cleaning.  Although it all depends on the situation.  Most likely, they will act with you as it is more profitable for them to get rid of you faster.  Ie, if your product has reached the end of the warranty period - they can even clean the dust for free, sometimes it happens.

      <b>We go to the service center.</b> <br><br>  The main thing in this stage, I believe, is to be patient.  Without it, if you expect to defend your rights in the SC can not go.  If you hurry and do something stupid - they can use it and you simply lose the guarantee or do not receive a proper repair. <br>  <i>\\ Therefore, do not try to shout at the door and it is generally advisable not to give the impression of an inadequate personality. \\</i> <br>  Before going to the service center, <b>you need to collect all the necessary papers on the device</b> .  It is also advisable to clean the case from dust or other pollutants and generally give the product a presentation (forgive the pun). <br>  <i>\\ And in general, the repairman is also a man.</i>  <i>Would you want to pick your hands in the dirt?</i>  <i>In addition, zachuhany view of your property will cause great doubts that you carefully complied with the terms of the guarantee. \\</i> <br>  For those who are very worried about the future - you can take a pen, suddenly they will give you <br>  application form, and pens will not give? <br>  We reserve patience, courtesy, make a smile and go. <br><br>  <b>In the service center.</b> <br><br>  I think that it is not worth talking about the fact that it is better not to push ahead and not disturb others.  The main thing in the service center is <b>cultural communication with receivers or other people</b> who come into contact with you. <br>  In order not to get into prosak, it <b>is</b> necessary to <b>accurately formulate the fault / lack of goods</b> .  From personal experience, I can say that after some walking between the services of my communicator Glofiish X500 <br>  the malfunction in the form of clicks instead of sounds for any actions turned into ‚Äúnoises in the sound path‚Äù, and later turned out to be ‚Äúbroken headphone jack‚Äù in general, although there could not be any talk about headphones. <br>  <i>\\ Therefore, remember the ‚Äúgreat and mighty‚Äù in order not to fall into the difference of the wording of the type: distortion of sound \ image \ loss of sound \ image \ sounds like, but the essence is different \\</i> <br>  Not less important - a <b>competent substantiation of their presentations</b> .  Clever is not worth it, but to show that you know what you say may be useful.  Literate customers to breed more difficult and sometimes unprofitable.  Again, I can give an example: they handed over a laptop, the webcam in Skype stopped working.  The first time they called said that the repair was done and returned the laptop with the words that Skype is an unsupported application.  After a clear explanation of how webcams work, that if it is determined by Skype via the API - it should work in it - the laptop was repaired in two days. <br>  During the reception of the goods to the service center, <b>you must issue a receipt or other similar document confirming that you have transferred the goods</b> specified in it in the configuration indicated therein and with the indicated faults.  In modern stores, all information is clogged in the database and printed out in the form of a receipt, which is given to you in two copies, one of which should be given to you.  Again, do not rush to sign and escape from this room.  <b>Carefully re-read everything despite the queue.</b>  Pay special attention to the configuration, recorded complaints and conditions for receiving / issuing goods.  If you notice any inconsistencies, even the smallest ones, ask the service employee to fix them, otherwise your ‚Äúclicks‚Äù may turn into a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù ‚Äúconnector‚Äù. <br>  <i>\\ Perhaps you were simply misunderstood, perhaps your ‚Äúgreat and mighty‚Äù is guilty, but perhaps before you, this is also not impossible, a young and very intelligent representative of the human race imagined himself to be a great specialist for 3 months of work in the service and decided to pull down guarantees of the next "sucker".</i>  <i>So do not hesitate to insist on your wording in the description of the defect. \\</i> <br>  <b>Do not forget to require a copy of all documents on hand</b> .  Basically, all receipts and other documents are issued to you for signature in two copies, one of which remains for you, but this is not always the case.  And, of course, compare instances. <br>  After <b>you have to call back \ send SMS \ letter</b> in the specified time with the service or law.  In these cases, there are slippery situations and if, for example, you are told that an SMS was sent to you with a notification about the start of repair, and you left the goods for diagnosis and did not receive anything, you can safely not pay for repairs, because  SMS is not a personal notice, although it is more difficult here, follow the description of the order in the receipt. <br>  Taking the goods <b>MUST verify the absence of a malfunction</b> , preferably several times.  If you put the painting - it means the fault is eliminated and you have no complaints about the service.  If you find any flaws or changes for the worse, you must immediately notify the receiver (or other person) of this fact and arrange for further repair of the goods.  Naturally, in case of detection of any shortcomings, it should be documented so that you have a copy of the documents. <br><br>  Note: <br>  <i>\\ As a person who has worked for a long time in the service, I can vouch for the services - most of the workers are decent people. And as a person who has used the services of various services many times, I can often conclude that we ourselves are often the source of our troubles.</i>  <i>Many probably know the situation: the beloved mobile is a month after the purchase of sour and does not show signs of life.</i>  <i>We come to the service and after a while we get the answer: it cannot be repaired under warranty - there are traces of water ingress \ or there are mechanical damages in the form of microcracks.</i>  <i>But we did not drop it and did not drown it, hence the conclusion - they deceive you, you bastards!</i>  <i>It is possible if the store and service one owner.</i>  <i>BUT!</i>  <i>I advise you to remember how many times in a month (especially if it was winter), you took out a mobile phone from a warm pocket and after talking removed it that had cooled down back to heat.</i>  <i>Traces of condensate, if not the first time, but still do their dirty deed.</i>  <i>The same thing happens in the heat with a mobile phone in a sweaty pocket.</i>  <i>And how many times have I come home, hurrying to the toilet / bath, washing off the sweat, etc.?</i>  <i>- we threw it on the sofa, on the armchair, on the bed. But modern technology is thin in every sense - lack of progress: the more complex the technique, the less reliable it is (the standard of reliability since the Stone Age is an ax) - this is the source of microcracks.</i>  <i>So if you have trouble and the service has kicked you off - try to honestly and soberly find out if this is fair.</i>  <i>Well, if you come to the conclusion that there is not - only then declare war, not forgetting that all hostilities require strong rears.</i>  <i>Therefore, all further negotiations with the "enemy" lead in writing, it will save your nerves and leave in your hands the documents that in the extreme case can be presented in court! \\</i> <br><br>  I was with you, and my father, a former employee of SC, gave <i>comments in the "\\"</i> . <br>  Good luck in the battle for your rights! <br><br>  PS This is my first more or less serious article, please do not judge very strictly. <br><br>  PPS Transferred to Consumer Protection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72501/</a></p>
