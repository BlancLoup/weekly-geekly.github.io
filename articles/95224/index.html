      <br>
      In the game we have 2 things to do: survive and construct (well, or just survive). <br><br>  After creating the character, which includes choosing the gender, name and entry point into the game, we find ourselves in the big game world (yes, someone wrote that he passed from end to end in 6+ hours, but since then, it seems , the world expanded) almost without knowing how, with almost no food and ammunition. <br><br>  And here it begins the most. <br><br><h4>  Survival </h4><br>  After a few minutes of the game, it becomes clear that the character eventually wants to eat more.  The consequence of this is the search for food (which in the game is a bunch, you just need to know where to get it).  Food grows on trees (apples, berries, nuts), swims in the river (fish), runs on the ground (rabbits at the beginning of the game, but later other animals), but most importantly, food can be grown and cooked, but more on that later . <br><br>  After the character has gorged on, it becomes clear that for almost every action he is given experience points.  And you can distribute it on all sorts of skills.  Skills are divided into 2 types: one-time purchased and constantly upgraded. <br><br>  One-time purchase allows, say, to learn how to build a house, or learn how to hunt, or learn how to sew clothes, or ... well, etc., there are many of them. <br><br>  Constantly increased your different characteristics increase: the quality of the prepared food, the force of the blow, the number of found mushrooms ... <br><br>  Having dealt with the skills a bit, we begin to understand the variety of actions that will open in time for us, and proceed to ... <br><br><h4>  Construction, production, agriculture </h4><br>  It becomes clear that it is difficult to survive without dwelling and furniture.  The construction of the house begins.  By the way, this is a whole story: first you need to plow the ground, then pave it with a stone, then make an ax from a branch and a stone, and a saw from a branch and a bone, chop up wooden blanks and cut boards, bring it all into one place and a few minutes build a house.  Needless to say, with such work, the character begins to want to eat more than when walking through the woods? <br><br>  Then we swing, we find all kinds of grain crops, and it‚Äôs gone - eat-plow-plant-collect-cook-eat-build-eat, etc. <br><br><h4>  Farming and food </h4><br>  The moment comes to move from gathering to the food of his salting. <br>  Food <s>POT !!!! 111 a</s> lot.  Different.  Bread, buns, pies, cheeses, sausages, grilled meat, fried fish, raw vegetables. <br>  Saplings can still be raised in quality, by planting the best seeds. <br><br>  Food in the game is used for leveling parameters (strength dexterity, etc.).  Each edible object adds a percentage to increase one parameter or another.  When 100% of the ‚Äúroll dice‚Äù is typed and one of the parameters involved in the roll is raised. <br><br>  But do not think that the meaning lies only in food (although in the end it all comes down to one global meaning, I‚Äôll say this at the end).  Food is a means, not a goal. <br><br><h4>  War never changes </h4><br>  Sooner or later, if you are lucky, you will find deposits of metal ore.  And here the fun begins, as the ore creates great opportunities and rather big problems. <br><br>  Opportunities - better tools.  You'll plow, cut, chop faster ... <br><br>  Problems - your neighbors will want your ore.  To prevent this, you need to swing the character-warrior, arm him and punish the adversaries who want to profit by your good. <br><br>  But you yourself can become that adversary and choose the path of a thief, but if you rob a well-developed character who is not lazy, he will be able to track you down (even if you are offline) and punish you for theft or other illegal act. <br><br><h4>  Sandbox. </h4><br>  By and large, HH is a sandbox.  Big such a diverse sandbox.  The goal of the game, as you probably understood, is the same: to cut other players.  Sooner or later you will build all the buildings, grow all sorts of cereals, eat all kinds of food, catch all the fish, and you will be bored (personally, I did not reach this stage and stopped playing, waiting for new content). <br><br>  And you begin to eat off into war.  And nakuete weapons.  And you will go to punish all for insults or you will offend all by yourself.  And somehow the creation ended. <br><br>  Well, or just hang out with your neighbors and apply ingenuity for a varied pastime. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Although this game will not take you for many years, but playing it at least a week is definitely worth it, it will give you many pleasant hours. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  A funny story: quite a long time ago (about half a year ago), when online games were about 30 people, the inhabitants of the douche publicized about the game, and, as they <s>usually</s> do, decided to <s>play for</s> fun.  But there were too many of them in the game and the server (calculated for 30-50 people) began to lag a lot.  The old men were unhappy with the lags, and went to cut out all the new arrivals.  The Russians fled around and began to partisan.  After a while, everything settled down and the Russians began to ask the admins to introduce into the game tame bears (to protect the villages) and moonshine (to mourn their comrades who fell in battle).  Admins answered: "working on it".  The truth is not entered. <br><br><h4>  Afterword "useful links" </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.havenandhearth.com/portal/">The site of the game.</a> <br>  <a href="http://havenandhearth.wikia.com/wiki/Haven_and_Hearth_Wiki">Wiki on the game.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95224/</a></p>
