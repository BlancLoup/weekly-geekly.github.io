So, at the moment we have a situation where: <br><br>  - special services use technology to spy on ordinary citizens, and governments <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/202426/">allow</a> them to do this, and even gentlemen, regulators are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198374/">connected</a> . <br>  - the time of the great Russian firewall is inexorably approaching, the nuts are gradually tightening, the rights and freedoms are becoming less and less. <br>  - on the other hand, we have the government that we have, cuts, kickbacks, the Olympics in Sochi and so on.

      At the same time, the stratification of those who can (politicians, oligarchs, special services), and those who cannot (ordinary citizens), is reinforced not even by day, but by the hour. <br><br>  At the moment, the development of society has reached the point when the situation needs to be corrected, and the development of technology - up to the moment when this situation can be at least partially corrected.  And only two steps separate us from this moment, and the geeks will have to take the first step.  Or rather, for the first step, it remains to write one rather thick (in terms of code) programmable. <br><br>  Anyone who is interested in what kind of steps and what program is needed, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Personally, I do not even bother to calculate the entire computational power of the entire amount of computers, laptops, servers, etc., which is idle most of the time.  One thing is for sure - if you use at least 5% of this power in the right direction, it will be impossible for any special services to control such a network. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the idea</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing popular computing resources is simple ‚Äî popular resources are popular to work for the benefit of this very people.  What would an ordinary person have with a computer?  On the same, on which the majority of people always subscribed - on the idea.  The Soviet Union was built on the idea alone.  The United States 80 years ago got out of the problems with crime and corruption, when the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinternal and external security of the country became the main activity of the special services.  Singapore for 30 years has changed the status of a fishing village to one of the most developed countries of the East, when the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness development and the fight against corruption became the main direction of reform. <br><br>  In our country, there is no common idea for a long time, and I don‚Äôt see any sense in retelling what comes out of it - so I‚Äôve already written a lot of obvious things, Cap is already nervously smoking on the sidelines. <br></div></div><br>  So, the obvious idea that a native country would live better without corruption, cuts, kickbacks, etc., was scrolled in the head by anyone who was even slightly aware of the ‚Äúexploits‚Äù of our officials.  And everyone understood that to realize it in our conditions is almost unreal.  The eternal question ‚Äúwho will control the controller?‚Äù For a long time did not find solutions adequate to our conditions.  But now everything can change in connection with the development of technology.  How? <br><br>  Prerequisites for solving the problem: <br><br>  - special services control almost everyone using <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/maxifier/blog/201798/">data mining</a> and other, less legal, methods; <br>  - Distributed decentralized networks (Bitcoin) completely uncontrolled to individual organizations have appeared; <br>  - while the computational resources that most ordinary people own are idle most of the time. <br><br>  The solution of the problem consists of these three points - it is necessary to organize a distributed decentralized network, and the main focus of its work should be: <br><br>  - distributed decentralized collection of information on any socially significant activities of officials, their relations with organizations, both legal and illegal, and any other information of social importance; <br>  - analysis, systematization and accumulation of this information, its structuring and logical processing in order to identify abuses of entrusted powers, corruption and other factors hindering the normal economic development; <br>  - and most importantly - the publication of the information received and the logical conclusions made on the basis of it among the participants of this most decentralized network. <br><br>  Thus, if there are at least about a million participants in the network, this will allow: <br><br>  - to concentrate on this area huge computational resources, which will allow the entire network to achieve such results that are not available even to well-known supercomputers; <br>  - implement the most distributed collection of information, which will lead to the impossibility of tracking and controlling the participants of the network itself.  An example of such an implementation might look something like this: From one of the users of the network, a query is sent to the search engine of the official A., the most relevant news is selected about the innovation being introduced by him.  From another user of the network, not connected in any way with the first one, a request is issued about official and family ties of officer A., ‚Äã‚Äãa third user receives a request for the emergence of new commercial organizations in any way connected with official A. or his relatives and acquaintances.  Next, the code that analyzes the information contained in the database of the abuse scheme is already connected, the computing resources of the network are connected, but the point is that the interrelation of these requests cannot be traced, especially if they are issued in random order at random time intervals.  The reliability of the information received can be checked by repeated requests from completely different users of the network.  Search can be carried out through completely different sources: through the website of government orders, LinkedIn business network, periodicals and so on.  A sort of RosPil with extended powers that can not be banned. <br><br>  Naturally, all information must be encrypted and repeatedly re-checked, as is now done on the Bitcoin network.  Further actions after receiving useful information will have to be done by people.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/202654/">Only someone</a> can decide to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/202654/">order someone for bitcoins</a> or use the information obtained in some other way.  And the fact that it can be used, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/202416/">no doubt</a> . <br><br>  The requirements for such a network are obvious to most Habr's readers, but I still list them: <br><br>  - fully decentralized distributed network; <br>  - all information is encrypted in the most reliable ways and is visible only within the network; <br>  - fully open source program, structured in such a way as to maximize the exclusion of backdoors; <br>  - internal ethical barriers implemented in the program code.  It can be said that the whole manifesto of the ethical components that restrict the freedom to use the program (so as not to go into privacy and violate the basic laws on information recognized by the community as adequate in modern conditions - nobody really cares about all these intrigues with prostitutes for prosecutors and etc.). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About privacy</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In general, many may have a question about the violation of privacy and the like nonsense.  Only here is not the situation.  As once, a traffic police inspector sued my friend for the fact that this friend posted a video recorded on the recorder, in which the valiant inspector violated a bunch of legal procedures and tried to deflate more money.  The essence of the claim was that the driver thus violated the privacy of the inspector‚Äôs privacy.  Naturally, we could not talk about any private life, since the inspector carried out his official duties, and this, in essence, could not be kept private.  The same can be said about any other officials who perform their duties - their work in general should be completely public.  In such circumstances, the level of corruption and abuse of official duties can be reduced by an order of magnitude.  Information leaks in such situations repeatedly led to bad consequences for violators.  And we also need this - so that everyone can see everything, moreover, in a convenient and unseen form. <br></div></div><br><br>  - the ability to automatically select applicants for control, taking into account the social importance of these people.  That is, plumber Vasya Pupkin does not have a big impact on society, therefore, information about him in this context is not interesting.  But the governor of the Nskaya oblast has a great influence on the life of this very area, can use this influence for his own personal interests, which means this comrade should be taken on a pencil and wool any information that appears to his soul. <br><br>  At first glance, such a social filter is quite difficult to implement programmatically, but in fact there are not so many criteria for such an assessment. <br><br>  These include the frequency of mentioning the person‚Äôs surname in the media and the Internet, the height of the position held in the hierarchical structure of the organization, and the authority of the organization itself in terms of regulating socially significant parameters. <br><br>  - built-in capabilities for semantic analysis of the information received.  Also, at first glance, it seems difficult to capture in the program, but, first, the keywords in such cases are not much more than those of the FBI with their ‚Äúbomb, president, allah, etc.‚Äù, they are just different - ‚Äúmade a decision‚Äù , ‚ÄúSigned an order‚Äù, ‚Äúoffered to introduce‚Äù, etc.  And secondly, we do not forget, when a large number of people are connected to the network, its computing power will reach a level when such calculations will click like nuts. <br><br>  In general, the requirements are actually much more; one person cannot afford to foresee everything.  This can only be done by the community through numerous discussions.  That is, we need an extensive forum for discussing the components of the program, preferably located immediately on the I2P network (for any fireman, in order to avoid possible prohibitions, etc.).  Yes, and the network itself can be organized on the principle of I2P, although here, probably, professionals will correct me - the principle of I2P itself may not give the desired exchange rate for the effective operation of the program.  There is also an idea to push the developers forum into the program interface from the very beginning of its development.  That is, the start could be the development of a separate interface for a forum that is not related to browsers.  Although maybe such interfaces are already there, knowledgeable people will correct me. <br><br>  Anyway, the technical implementation of the People‚Äôs Prism is not the only problem for its effective work.  The question arises of volunteers who, for the sake of such an idea, are ready to provide their resources without fear of the state.  You can take into account all possible laws on privacy protection and so on, but most people who are not IT-savvy will be afraid or even lazy to participate in it.  The main driving force at the beginning of the development of the program will be only geeks who like this idea.  In our country, such people, I think, is not enough.  Here in Germany, for example, not only geeks but also a large percentage of the population will join.  People there are.  but this is also a topic for separate discussion. <br><br>  In any case, such development can not be biased in anyone's favor, and therefore there can be no question of any commercialization.  All participants must be prepared to work for the sake of the idea.  True, I myself would not have refused such a hobby, for that matter. <br><br>  In one of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/205052/">the Bitcoin discussions,</a> he was called "a possible shift in the financial paradigm, which is due to technology, not politics."  So, I would like to use technology to shift the paradigm of class relationships.  In order to replace the revolutions of different degrees of orangeness, something new has come ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357520/</a></p>
