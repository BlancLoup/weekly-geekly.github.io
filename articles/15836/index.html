  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gphone, the subscriber is temporarily unavailable. Fantasy and facts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past year, Google has actively begun to buy various companies and online services around the world.  Thanks to Google‚Äôs ‚Äúsecretive‚Äù policy, there have always been a lot of rumors around the company, but recently their number has increased and you can meet the latest news on the company literally every day, interspersed with speculation and fantasy.  Since the most discussed news of this season is the release by the company of its own mobile phone (even someone on the runet blinded the site <a href="http://g-phone.ru/">http://g-phone.ru/</a> ), then I decided to dream up a little on this topic, especially as the Internet threw I have a lot of information.  And before the release of the tube, as <a href="http://blog.wbsv.ru/%3Fp%3D272">reported by the</a> press services of Taiwanese developers, who actually are engaged in the development of the GooglePhone, wait a long time, right up to the first half of 2008. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is no data on how the phone looks like so far, on various websites dedicated to gadgets completely different photos are hung, usually suspiciously similar to those already sold by HTP communicators.  All assumptions are built on the fact that someone said something there, showed someone somewhere, and so on ... From which it can be concluded that no one knows anything, but I really would like to ... <br><br>  But this is all speculation, I would like in my fantasies to rely on real facts, like the letter from Google, which he sent to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with a proposal to buy out a 700 MHz radio frequency band for $ 4.6 billion. The frequency auction will be held until January 28, 2008, and if the company wins, then perhaps the future phone models from Google will work at this frequency (but of course only in the US), but for now 3G support is announced (and only EDGE is bad if the situation is bad). <br>  It is expected that the applications will be integrated with online services, of which Google has plenty: <br><ul><li>  Tables and Documents (and now also <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/14/google-presently-powerpoint-clone-could-be-days-away/">Online Presentations</a> ), especially since the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/google/27773.html">mobile version of the google office</a> has already appeared </li><li>  GoogleMaps - recently, <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-of-world-for-you-to-explore.html">support for maps of 54 new countries</a> was announced, and in the middle of September of this year, <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/telecommunication/31861.html">Billine provided its subscribers with a map service based on GoogleMaps</a> and adapted specifically for the phone as a java application </li><li>  <a href="http://gmail.com/app">Gmail</a> , Calendar, RSS Reader, GoogleTalk, Bookmarks, Picasa Web Album, YouTube.com video hosting and Blogger.com blog hosting, and in general, as they say, God himself ordered convenient access to these applications in the handset 5 Internet surfer </li></ul>

      It has long been rumored that Google plans to release its <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/08/16/tak-vsyo-taki-budet-li-google-browser/">own browser</a> , even registered the domain name gbrowser.com.  But we should not exclude the possibility that it is planned <b><i>mobile</i></b> browser, because in this area there is no clear advantage of Microsoft, and the winner will be the most convenient and usable client.  Moreover, the mobile versions of some of the services mentioned above are already actively functioning, but as a rule, in a truncated mode and in English. <br><br>  In early November, Google <a href="http://www.onliner.by/news/05.11.2007/19.40/">announced</a> that work was underway on the Android mobile platform, which gave rise to the idea that there would be no promised phone, but I would not make premature conclusions regarding the marketing steps of the search giant, I would rather continue to fantasize.  Android is a full-featured platform consisting of an operating system, middleware, a user interface, and a set of applications.  An open and free software platform will be available under an open source license.  This will allow operators and developers to modify the system without significant restrictions.  Developer libraries will be presented on November 12, and the first devices will appear in the second half of 2008. <br><br>  The most interesting question when talking about GPhone is the cost of calls.  Many are happy with the theme, that the owners of the phone are expected to receive free service, and the company will earn money through advertising, especially since in September 2007, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml%3F2007/09/13/266003">it was announced that Google Mobile Ads mobile advertising service was launched</a> . <br><br>  You can also count on the fact that in the near future will be the implementation of <a href="http://rublicon.ru/articles/370.html">mobile payment system Google Checkout</a> .  But again, it will take a long time to wait for her in Russia.  And in light of the fact that information has appeared on <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/business/2007/10/09/mobplat.html">the Mobile Payments program</a> , within which a platform will be created for remotely paying for goods and services using a cell phone, payment systems in Russia may have a serious competitor. <br><br>  Recently there has <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2007/09/11/google_books.html">been information</a> that Google will begin to provide full access to online books for money.  <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/macuser/news/124392/google-to-start-charging-for-online-books.html">According to the</a> New York Times, publishers will be able to set prices for their books and share revenue with Google.  Which, together with Amazon <a href="http://rublicon.ru/articles/403.html">are going to release a device for reading digital literature</a> .  This may well spread to mobile devices (and Gphone), given the love of smartphone owners and communicators to reading in public transport.  It is pleasant that a similar service can break even to domestic readers, since Google has already managed to digitize 24 thousand books published by the publishing house ‚ÄúOLMA Media Group‚Äù. <br><br>  Probably the most interesting thing is that Gphone can be an excellent testing ground for building social networks of a completely new level: the company has a blog and video hosting services, a mapping service, because the presence of a GPS receiver in the receiver will allow real-time integration of video, photo, audio and textual information, the geography of the event and the relationship to the event in real time.  Moreover, recently virtual worlds have become very popular, virtual cities made similar to real ones, the basis of which will be the textual and media content of users.  I mean games like <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> or real cities on Google Maps ( <a href="http://www.google.com/maps">Street View</a> ). <br><br>  PS After reading the last paragraph, I myself become funny, but some facts are obvious.  The main task of large companies is to make money, and on the Internet money is first of all advertising.  Google is already <a href="http://www.seoweblog.ru/archives/113">thinking of</a> starting to make money on Google Maps, placing ads on the roofs of houses (virtually, of course), and what will happen when thousands and millions of users of social networks rush through virtual cities?  They will bring the company another billions. <br><br>  <a href="http://cvbhyjd.livejournal.com/2235.html">Via</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15836/</a></p>
