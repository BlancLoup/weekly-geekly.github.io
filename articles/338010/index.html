In stock, it is important that the quality and seamlessness of the coating be in order for the tag and barcode scanners to work.  And in the trading rooms often have difficulty with supplying power to the routers and there are separate requirements for appearance. <br><br>  In this article, we will designate several typical situations and show where and which of our corporate-class models will be most relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fee/9b2/5c6/fee9b25c6b4449228bc8e1d6a1cb4aec.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Accounting for turnover, updating data in the database of the availability of goods, as well as working with other internal corporate systems are simply impossible without the constant access of mobile terminals and other equipment to the corporate network.

      Of course, for the operation of mobile terminals, the most convenient connection technology will be Wi-Fi.  Obviously, not any equipment is suitable for the conditions of trading halls and warehouses - for each type of premises you need to select the appropriate device models. <br><br>  Commercial premises usually do not imply difficult conditions in terms of temperature and humidity, while storage and production facilities may limit the choice of equipment to models for outdoor use.  On the other hand, if the appearance of the equipment is not critical for production and warehouses, in the trade premises it is he who can play a primary role.  There are other restrictions in shopping centers.  For example, the coordination of laying power lines for non-standard (the same ceiling) equipment may require a lot of time and resources, or it may not be possible at all.  Accordingly, in such cases, the choice of equipment comes down to the list of models with PoE support. <br><br><h2>  Auranet </h2><br>  Auranet is our attempt to take into account all the nuances.  In this line you can find models for both indoor and outdoor installation.  The use of equipment from one manufacturer for all possible scenarios greatly simplifies the setup and further administration of the network, respectively, reduces the cost of both implementation and support.  In the lineup two series: EAP and CAP.  In more detail we will stop on each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/558/662/6f7/5586626f7e4f4c1bb8f64010f9b823af.jpg"><br>  <i>Access Points CAP300 and EAP225</i> <br><br>  The series are very similar: both models have single and dual-band models. <br>  and devices for internal and external use.  EAP and CAP differ primarily in design.  In addition, in CAP, you can use hardware controllers that support up to 500 managed access points, while in the EAP series - a software controller, which is very functional and at the same time completely free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2e3/e87/9c1/2e3e879c18ea4d068e72e353b9a32afa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c01/af0/b8f/c01af0b8f810440cb7e16ccc9b1d94ac.png"><br><br>  Any series allows you to create a network for premises as well as for outdoor and warehouse conditions with low temperature and high humidity. <br><br><h2>  Typical infrastructure on TP-Link equipment </h2><br>  In fact, in practice, the use of a single network based on the equipment of one line is very convenient.  On the equipment of one vendor, it is much easier to organize a single access to the network with a constant coverage area.  In addition, since part of the equipment used by employees requires a constant connection to the network, it is important not only to provide sufficient network coverage, but also the possibility of roaming. <br><br>  Barcode scanner terminals today have become the main instrument for accounting for goods, and for prompt tracking of turnover they must have constant access to the corporate network.  Moreover, when moving from the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãone access point to the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãanother, they should be automatically and quickly reconnected, without requiring any actions from users.  Only such a scenario will allow to avoid problems in work, loss of staff time and the lack of relevant information on the availability of goods and their prices in the database.  And, as a result, additional costs and meaningless losses. <br><br>  By the way, in the near future, the CAP1200 access point will appear in our product range, supporting seamless roaming protocols 802.11k and 802.11v, and later support for 802.11r will be added.  With the new access point, connections will become even more stable, and work will be more convenient. <br><br>  Typical network infrastructure for retail and logistics companies in most cases is quite traditional.  The customer comes to the introduction of a wireless network, either partly with his equipment, which he plans to use in the infrastructure, or without it.  Of course, it is always easier and more convenient to build a network from scratch.  In any case, a typical set of equipment will consist of several access points for indoor or outdoor use, a controller (possibly software, if you decide to use our EAP series), as well as a PoE switch needed to connect and power access points, and often other equipment. <br><br>  Among the switch models, <a href="http://www.tp-linkru.com/products/details/cat-42_TL-SG1008PE.html">TL-SG1008PE</a> , which has eight gigabit ports with PoE + support (up to 30 W per port), is in high demand.  This model has earned popularity due to its low price, excellent quality, as well as a sufficient number of ports for use in small warehouses and stores.  In general, switches with PoE support are one of the main components for which demand is constantly growing.  The increased cost of PoE switches is compensated for by the absence of the need to route power cables to all, even the most distant places where equipment is installed, such as access points.  PoE is also used to power surveillance cameras, IP phones and many other devices, but more on that another time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e7b/2a5/842/e7b2a5842e2946d193c2b1c40bd712ca.png"><br>  <i>PoE switch TL-SG1008PE</i> <br><br><h2>  Selection of access points and controllers </h2><br>  The main parameters that are taken into account when choosing access points differ from project to project.  The priorities are the way to connect power and support standards for wireless data transmission.  So, in shopping centers it is preferable to choose models with PoE and wireless network in the 5 GHz band.  In addition, sometimes there are situations when 2.4 GHz equipment interferes with existing equipment operating in the same range, for example, a network of sensors used to monitor the conditions of warehouses.  Then we have to limit ourselves to using network equipment with network support in the 5 GHz band. <br><br>  Other features of access points include Beamforming.  It allows you to increase the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe network due to the formation of a radiation pattern using specific transmission settings and antenna configuration. <br><br>  The selection of controllers is somewhat easier.  Here, either the software solution for the EAP series is chosen, which is free and allows you to manage hundreds of access points, or hardware controllers of the CAP series ( <a href="http://www.tp-linkru.com/products/details/cat-5697_AC500.html">AC500</a> or <a href="http://www.tp-linkru.com/products/details/cat-5697_AC50.html">AC50</a> , supporting up to 500 or up to 50 access points, respectively). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad2/d58/d8d/ad2d58d8dbd948cca1ec81f98edd9e88.png"><br>  <i>EAP Software Controller</i> <br><br>  Each solution has its advantages, disadvantages, cost, and device support.  So when choosing, you should also carefully study the specifications and take into account the scalability of the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bbe/507/262/bbe50726276b43e6978b9857e9143777.png"><br>  <i>Wi-Fi controller Auranet AC500</i> <br><br>  The initial detailed design of the network, taking into account its potential growth and the number of connected devices, makes it possible to select the right equipment at an early stage.  And we must not forget about him. <br><br><h2>  Implemented projects with our clients </h2><br>  Not today, many retail companies use our equipment in their trade zones and logistics complexes, which partners periodically inform us about.  Among them, Zenden, Nanolek (warehouses), Letual, MYuZ, Magnit, Crossroads and several others.  Some of them, having tested the equipment in pilot projects at one or several of their own sites, are moving to a large-scale implementation at all their points of presence. <br><br>  Projects of deployment of wireless networks in the production and warehouse premises of customers often have a number of interesting features.  They are used to provide terminal equipment access to a single corporate accounting system for goods.  And then there is the task of covering large areas with difficult conditions of the distribution of the wireless signal.  In such cases, you have to use a large number of access points and work out their layout. <br><br>  In one of the recent projects, we had to seriously invest in the development of the network structure precisely in the light of the difficult conditions and the geometry of the premises.  Fortunately, the storage areas in which the network was mainly located did not require the use of outdoor equipment everywhere, because the customer‚Äôs warehouses maintain a temperature of about 20 degrees, although there are also cold rooms with a temperature regime of 4 or 8 degrees.  At the same time, humidity conditions were favorable everywhere and did not require moisture protection.  As a result, EAP225 access points and EAP controller for central control were selected for network deployment.  At the same time, the EAP115 points were initially tested, but they had to be abandoned due to the operation of other equipment in the same frequency range (2.4 GHz).  The company used various sensors and devices to monitor the temperature in the warehouse, which, after installing EAP115 access points, began to work unstably. <br><br>  As a result, the main goal - ensuring the operation of the bar code scanning equipment - was achieved.  In the process of implementation, our employees helped to quickly solve emerging non-trivial tasks, so that the project did not drag out, but was implemented in a very short time. <br><br>  Another good example is using PoE technology.  In a recent project, our partners were faced with a situation where the overhead arrangement of the access point was possible only with the use of power over Ethernet cables, since bringing a separate power line would require many approvals and additional work.  Thanks to PoE, it was possible to significantly accelerate the completion of the pilot project and significantly simplify the further maintenance of such a solution.  At the moment, the equipment according to a similar scheme is already installed in 30 stores of this customer.  In the near future, they plan to deploy Wi-Fi networks in a few hundred retail premises across Russia, using the experience of a pilot project performed on EAP115 and EAP245 access points and PoE TL-SG1008PE switches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae7/e87/3d9/ae7e873d91d0433ba4bd7979eb02f6bf.jpg"><br>  <i>Access Point EAP-115 Wall</i> <br><br>  In general, these are rather simple examples, which we gave more likely to show that our office also takes an active part in working with clients and partners.  Most often we advise, we accept feedback and even add new functions to the firmware for individual requests.  What we describe in detail in one of the following posts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338010/</a></p>
