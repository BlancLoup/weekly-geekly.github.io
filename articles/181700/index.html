That is, their entire business model is described in these three words - <b>access money</b> . <br><br>  <i>Here, by the way, there is a typical substitution of concepts - they want money and they are fighting for access.</i>  <i>Because whoever has a girlfriend dinner, he dances her.</i>  <i>If you lose access to a monopoly, you lose (due to zero copying) money.</i> <br><br>  What is the alternative?  Alas, the bulk of the proposals comes down to the search - <b>who will pay for access for us.</b>  As this regrettable fact reached me, I decided to put forward my crazy idea to the court of the habrasocial community.  Despite the fact that I have nothing to do with copiersta.

Why pay more? <br><br>  For the same reason, the horror stories ‚Äúauthors will stop writing books‚Äù do not work.  Why?  Yes, because professional literature and study is not going anywhere, as a matter of prime need (they will not cease to study and work).  There are quite local publishers here, and publishers a la safari books, Oreili and others are needed and perform a lot of useful functions.  At least - provide the minimum quality of textbooks. <br><br>  But detectives and other fantasy - this is <i>entertainment</i> , that is, <i>entertaining</i> .  If Perumov doesn‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôll start reading Exler, because there will be no less graphomania, will he?  This (in the opinion of many - overly bloated circulations "below the plinth") is in danger.  It is here that the epic battle of the <s>bubble with the evil of</s> copywriters and consumers goes. <br><br>  Pay for <i>fun</i> voluntarily?  What are you, crazy?  If such conscious will be at least 1% - this will be a complete victory of the new world over mossy bureaucrats, who do not see the difference between a record and a file on the Internet.  Let me refer to the experiments Lukyanenko - very revealing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a3/71b/942/9a371b942d07f6251f533cfcb859fc6b.png" alt="image" align="left"><br><h4>  And what is offered? </h4><br>  Yes, something terrible. <br><br>  Authors have nothing to eat?  Let them lay out books online and set themselves <i>advildy</i> !  Aha, aha - and with these kopecks pay the proofreader, the editor and the artist. <br><br>  And let's for what I read books - the provider pays!  Or we will introduce such a tax.  What is really there, let's calculate it right from pensions.  Do old ladies read books?  Doom!  And when the well-known <i>Migalkov</i> goes this way - we get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãindignation and other turbulence. <br><br><img src="http://2qt2bstr8.ru/ifib8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or so.  Let's each - for a ruble!  Therefore, one will download and watch cool pictures 24 hours a day (which the slacker parents feed), and the hard workers will stand at the machine, and they will read a newspaper before bedtime for happiness.  But all in business. <br><br>  Well, or a classic - I'll cry later.  Someday.  Here I will read three more books in the series - and then I will list 100 rubles.  It does not matter that already rendered <i>entertainment</i> service costs little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae5/8b5/1de/ae58b51de6763737cdcd4eb2b7670359.png" alt="image" align="left"><br><h4>  Hope not? </h4><br><br>  There is a very important point that few people pay attention to.  Namely, the consumer will agree tomorrow on what he will not agree "never-never" today.  The question of price is what the consumer will get from this.  Today we perceive with hostility ‚Äúbooks only online‚Äù or ‚Äúreader with DRM‚Äù. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  Because not only is it less convenient to say ‚Äúmeans‚Äù in these materials than in (to substitute your favorite reader), so also these inconveniences are not in themselves, and the fee for restricting our rights <b>to read is comfortable</b> (not easy to read, This is an important nuance). <br><br>  That is, in order to make copywriting easier, we, as consumers, get hemorrhoids for our own money.  Here in dvd-shke from pirates already foolish inscriptions in red on black, which are still not flushed out (classic), are carefully cut off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f8/bd7/247/1f8bd724726324371220421d9a5b8616.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The same situation with the books.  Search no, a lot of restrictions, even copy the picture - it is a victory.  And when under the guise of a book they actually sell linearized PDFFs (that is, a set of pictures) ... And this is for money?  Are you kidding me? <br><br>  Although modern approaches to books can simply amaze the imagination. <br><br>  Here are some examples <b>from the social field</b> that require reading online. <br><br><ul><li>  collective reading (subtraction, correction, commenting) </li><li>  detailed annotation simultaneously by a group of readers </li><li>  book exchange and rental </li><li>  access to series and discounts, gifts, exchanges </li><li>  automatic search and joining those who read this book too </li></ul><br><br>  But - the <b>book offline is</b> <b>not fully readable</b> (in a new way). <br><br>  And here <b>are some technological examples</b> that an <i>electronic dummy</i> can provide himself (with the Internet available) <br><br><ul><li>  will provide a selection of books of similar subjects </li><li>  annotates the book itself, making links to wikipedia c dbpedia </li><li>  compile a list of key concepts and navigate through them </li><li>  interactive navigation through annotations and comments </li><li>  interactive navigation through series books, autoswitches and autolinks </li><li>  automatically built extended navigation between chapters, sections, callouts and other </li><li>  - build a preview of the books - it will be possible to get acquainted without even going into the reading room, right in the browser </li><li>  for textbooks - a bunch of additional bonuses, ranging from auto-questionnaires to read a la EGE, and ending with a personal "mentatom" who will build a whole training course individually for the reader. </li></ul><br><br>  But - the <b>book offline is</b> <b>not fully readable</b> (in a new way). <br><br>  In this regard, the opinion of the habrasoobshchestva is interesting, and then suddenly I smoked something bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181700/</a></p>
