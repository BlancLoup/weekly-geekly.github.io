  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vending: three criminal ways not to go hungry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I first learned what a vending machine is in England.  I was in the land of fogs while still a schoolboy.  And the event itself was called the "practice of the English language."  Neither my experience nor the experience of the parents who paid for the event implied any knowledge of distant countries.  What will be there, how it will be there - nobody knew.  The strangest assumptions were put forward, the strangest things were issued on a trip.  So, for example, almost all Maltsov were supplied with sachets of Soviet money, for which time they were no longer in circulation.  What for?  I do not remember.  It seems the idea was to change with local coin collectors. <br><br>  The apparatus stood in the building of the English school, where classes were held.  The classes were almost senseless, and would-be students suffered from boredom.  Automatic caused emotions.  Same thing: you go there a pound, and he'll give you a chocolate bar. <br><br>  It is unlikely that those who placed the machine in the English school, assumed the invasion of Russian children. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you may have guessed, Russian children began to feed Soviet money into the machine.  Pyataks and pennies easily skipped - the machine they stubbornly did not accept.  But, he ‚Äúate‚Äù coins of twenty and ten kopecks and flashed on the scoreboard pleasant numbers in pounds and pence.

      The event did not have any consequences.  No one was looking for Russian children in the school and was not trying to figure out where the strange coins appeared in the receiver of the machine.  But I remember this story as an example of the imperfection of technology. <br><br>  The second such incident occurred in an Internet club, where I was brought to work.  It was the first course of the institute.  Technical knowledge has already begun to accumulate in the head and seeping into skills.  I already had a reputation as a ‚Äúcomputer geek‚Äù, and it seemed to me that I should try myself. <br><br>  We worked both day and night - as it should.  In shifts  Worked in pairs: admin and intern.  I brought the night shift from home to eat.  Admin acted differently. <br><br>  At the beginning of each shift, the hall was closed.  Money was recalculated, computers rebooted and looked through for problems.  Admin took the tape and went to the unit.  With a small strip of adhesive tape, he sealed the opening for making purchases from the inside.  Automatic stopped issuing bought.  Yes, chocolates fell from their seats in the hole.  Inside the machine could be heard their whispering.  But they did not fall into the tray. <br><br>  Dissatisfied customers came to us and complained.  The admin responded: "This is not our automat, I know nothing about it." <br><br>  At the shift change, when the visitors left, and the hall closed again, the admin again went to the machine, took off the scotch tape and stuffed his pockets with food.  I marveled at the human acumen. <br><br>  The third time I ran into theft at school.  For a modest fee, I tried to conduct evening math courses.  I say schoolchildren are worse than students.  The student will still be polite.  It can be easily interested.  You can push it.  A schoolboy is a creature without complexes, without goals, and often without a rational mind. <br><br>  At recess I went to smoke.  The time is about eight in the evening.  The school is deserted and dull.  Virtually no one.  The guard makes a round.  The four of them take an automaton, lift it up and start shaking.  Chocolate strewed by the river. <br><br>  Here are three ways to get food out of the machine.  They are all criminal.  But they say a lot. <br>  Not so long ago, I wanted to get two automatic machines myself, put one in the lobby of an office building, and the other with coffee in a smoking room. <br>  But he soon abandoned this idea when he saw this picture: a disgruntled uncle banged his hand on the terminal screen.  Maybe I made a mistake in the phone number when I deposited money.  Maybe something else. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90555/</a></p>
