  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I don't care - I'm in a tank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The activity of a creative person who creates something from nothing is life in constant fear, reflection and self-flagellation.  And what if this is someone invented?  And what if it was already someone who wrote, painted, composed?  Globalization has increased the neurosis of the creator a hundredfold.  If earlier the creator created in his hut on the edge of the earth and did not know what was happening around, now he knows everything: catalogs, forums, blogs, communities, contests, television, magazines, podcasts.  Gigabytes of information, hundreds of other people's work before the eyes and in the subconscious.  It seems that everything, absolutely everything is invented.  It seems that you constantly steal something from someone.  It seems that it would be better to go to the wipers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I know adults who have been in the lives of people who spend hours in front of the monitor biting their lips, read what anonymous commentators and reviewers write about their work.  I know dozens of colleagues who will be terribly worried if someone suddenly blurs out ‚ÄúI have seen something like this already‚Äù.  I have repeatedly witnessed a situation where a good idea was cut by the art director, customer or the author himself only because it seemed to them (!) That it was similar to something.  The absurdity is that no one at the same time remembers the goals, objectives or terms of reference. <br><br>  How much time, how much attention is spent by the creator on experiences about non-uniqueness and non-originality of his work.  How much energy goes on trying to invent a spherical bike in a vacuum.  And all these games in postmodernism are also a manifestation of a design inferiority complex, the fear of inventing something that has already been invented.  You see, Helvetica is too primitive for them, but simple forms, you see, have already disassembled everything. <br><br>  The designer, who realized the senselessness of such experiences, gradually decreases the sensitivity to all unsolicited opinions and evaluations of his work.  He focuses on work, not on the analysis of material developed before him.  Aerobatics - to reach the state of the tanker: there are tasks - I solve them;  I look at the world only straight ahead, through a narrow slit in a ten-centimeter armor, not trying to embrace the immense;  I‚Äôm not turning off instrumentation, I don‚Äôt pay attention to the barking of village dogs;  I try not to think about The Hague and the Convention on Human Rights;  I know for sure that the shell does not get into the same funnel twice, even if I myself really want this. </div>
