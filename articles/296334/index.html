  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotion of mobile applications. Google conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>November 12, a conference was held in the Google office in Moscow.</b>  <b>The conference was dedicated to the promotion of mobile applications.</b>  <b>More precisely, the tools for this.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9d/5bc/09e/a9d5bc09ef4743da954afa3e5e2e07c0.jpg"><br><br>  You probably know that we are preparing a major update of <a href="">our application</a> , and, with it, an Android version.  In connection with these events, it was decided to meet with those who understand Android and promotion in PlayMarket.  With google. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that is important to say is that all advertising campaigns are a very individual matter.  What is suitable for advertising in a huge corporation is absolutely not suitable for a startup.  The corporation has a name.  In addition to the startup idea, really, nothing. <br>  Goolge AdWords is a tool for large companies.  The speech of the AdWords specialist said the following: to test the tool, you need to run a small advertising campaign, no more than $ 100 / day.  For a startup, but God forbid, it is also free, it is very heavy money. <br>  In our experience: <br>  The test launch of this service did not bring anything, the ad very quickly used up the entire demonstrative resource.  Downloads not increased.  Yes, the budget was very different from what the guys from Google advise, but I remind you that there was no result. <br>  AdWords advertising company should not be short and low budget.  That is, an advertising campaign should last at least a week, and a daily budget of at least $ 50 / day.  The total is $ 350.  This is, let's say, the cost of living.  However, even this amount is difficult to collect, and even if you raise funds, it‚Äôs not a fact that you will get the desired result.  Too many factors for successful promotion need to be considered. <br>  An interesting feature from Google, part of AdWords, is the <b>display of ads in the top of the list</b> . <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What it looks like</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a5/3a5/13b/8a53a513b0b5451cb01ed110c5430a9f.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  What do we get?  Our application is shown first in the list of search results.  Keywords are set, of course, in the AdWords menu, which is remarkable.  The keywords may include the names of competing companies, and, most strikingly, Google is fine with this.  For example, the user enters in the search box "* ndeks.Taksi" and gets your application Ge * t or * ber first.  Yes, if a person is looking for something specific, then he scrolls further to the desired application.  But if a person is just looking for a taxi client, he will not even pay attention to the yellow plate with the words ‚ÄúAD‚Äù and click on your application.  Top, as is commonly believed, does not advise the bad.  Here from the point of view of the developers, Google made a good promotion decision.  In relation to the user, this is like sites, the title of articles on which changes depending on the query in the search bar.  As they say, get used to it.

      <b>Google play lists</b> <br>  Another feature that Google Play moderators offer is collections and various collections of apps.  For the World Cup, for example, Google is preparing a collection of applications on football topics.  In PlayMarket, as in the AppStore, there are collections of applications, for example, ‚ÄúTop New Free‚Äù, ‚ÄúTravel and Places‚Äù, ‚ÄúHealthy Lifestyle‚Äù or even ‚ÄúLive Wallpaper‚Äù.  What do we see?  We see that each store has its own collection, even for highly specialized applications.  This collection is a kind of top, only in your category. <br>  One of the most important criteria for getting into such a collection or a list is Material Design - this is what the editorial staff like now.  It is also very important that your application solves the user's problem.  That is, the next Tetris and the ball-blade to get there is difficult. <br><br>  Another interesting tool, really for re-marketing, is the <b>ability to add Deep-link</b> to advertisements.  This tool allows you to return previously attracted users.  How it works?  For example, a user searches for flights in your application, finds them, but does not make an order.  Later, while surfing the Internet, Google advertising prompts the user to complete the order.  By clicking on such an announcement, the user gets to the screen on which there is information about his order.  What does this give?  This is a targeted advertising that allows you to return the user to your application.  This tool can be used both in gaming applications and in social ones or in the way it is used in the example above.  A versatile tool that works as well as an email distribution and allows you to retain users. <br><br>  Until the next article, gentlemen. <br><br>  PS Feed cookies and put on souvenirs! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photo souvenirs</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/561/4b4/0db/5614b40dba80491c93e720233241d171.jpg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296334/</a></p>
