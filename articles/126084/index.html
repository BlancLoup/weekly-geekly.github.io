This is a natural body of the site, developed in the historical context of the development of the Internet and sites in general.  But today it‚Äôs just a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">rudiment</a> that doesn‚Äôt annoy people, but pushes your site in the rankings and lowers the amount of numbers on the counters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Are you sure you understand the essence of the problem? </h5><br>  In the world of modern technology, virtually any information can be found on the Internet.  And what usually happens is disappointment, mixed with mild annoyance, when only one process separates you from the coveted file - registration.  Most often, registration causes a lot of negative emotions and annoyance: you have to fill in the fields once again, refresh the page and wait for a response from the server, and eventually receive a disappointing message - such a user already exists, incorrectly typed e-mail, invalid characters, too short password and fill in all the fields again, then wait for the activation letter ... Familiar situation?  Do you think if the Internet has alternatives to your site or service, the user will go through this, or will he simply return to the search result in Google, and try another site?  How are you doing? <br><br>  Another situation when looking for an answer to a question.  And along the way you find different branches of the discussions on the forms.  It's one thing to just read and find the answer there, and another to write thanks for the answer.  Or give an answer.  It often happens that when looking for something you come across unsolved problems, the answer to which you know, and it will not be difficult for you to write one sentence and solve the problem to a person on the forum, but you don‚Äôt do that because you do not want to register just to leave message in a place that can never return.

      Sometimes I just wonder why forum owners don‚Äôt open public access (that means no registration) to add posts to a topic.  Didn‚Äôt they create this site for this?  So that someone, stumbled upon it by chance on the Internet, got involved in a dialogue.  To someone left a question, get an answer or review?  What do you select 100 registered people in the database or 1000 forum users? <br><br>  Perhaps, creating registration by site owners is motivated by good intentions - to find out more information about their users, to have a guarantor when making a deal, or simply to get enough data for analysis, however, registration most often delivers negative emotions to users.  And what to do in such a situation that the wolves were full and the sheep are safe? <br><br><h5>  Get rid of registration </h5><br>  Strangely enough it sounds, but the most important and most useful advice that can be given is to get rid of registration.  Allow people everything - leave comments, create records, add files - without registration.  It will be perfect if you give the opportunity to even make payments without registration, because many sites have already come to this and are working successfully, for example <a href="http://templatemonster.com/">TemplateMonster.com</a> . <br><br>  Let registration for your users be a special advantage to exchange private messages or have your avatar, signature. <br><br>  Use the technique of "engagement".  First, a person visits the site.  Leaves a message or posts something, then begins to receive notifications that his post has been commented out, or evaluated, and anything else to return it to the site.  He comes back, visits again, comments, votes (all unregistered) and receives even more notifications that his comment is rated and his rating was important ... And in the end, he will want to personalize and register. <br><br><h5>  But even then make sure that the registration ... </h5><br>  But if you still can not do without registration, then make it quick and completely simple, so that the user spends a minimum of his time on this process.  Below are some unified tips to streamline the registration process and thus take care of your users.  The main essence of all the advice is to ensure that you must provide a choice to your users, and not to force them to pass registration: <br><br>  1. The first and most important thing is the possibility of authorization through the social profiles of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="http://my.mail.ru/">Mail.RU</a> , <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and others.  This is probably the most important tip.  If it is, then all other items can not be read.  Honestly, I would not do registration on my site at all.  Only the possibility of social authorization.  And it's great that this trend has already begun to appear and there are already sites or services that have completely refused registration and successfully use only social authorization.  For example, the <a href="http://www.angeldesk.com/ru">AngelDesk</a> feedback system. <br><br>  I probably even predict that after 5 years, about 20% of sites will not have their own registration system.  After all, ahead of us is waiting for another global user account holder as Google+. <br><br>  2. On the registration page, be sure to indicate what benefits the user will have if they register.  This will be an additional incentive. <br><br>  3. Minimize the number of required fields.  You can make a form with several dozens of questions, but make a mandatory 2-5 questions.  Most users do not like being obliged to do something and even more so to provide additional information.  However, on their own, without feeling pressure from outside, they can fill in all the fields. <br><br>  4. Required fields must have simple input.  If you have created such fields, then these should be radio buttons, checkboxes or drop-down lists.  It‚Äôs not a good idea to force a user to enter text in a required field. <br><br>  5. Refuse to confirm by mail.  Such confirmations only cause irritation, and registration takes more time than the user expected - after all, he will also have to check email, follow the link, and in some cases, also enter additional code.  Another noticeable disadvantage of such registration is that emails can be qualified as spam by the mail server and not received. <br><br>  But, in some cases, confirmation is necessary.  In this case, you can use the confirmation via e-mail with a delay.  Those.  allow the user to enter the site immediately after registration, but if he doesn‚Äôt confirm the email for only 2-3 days, then suspend access. <br><br>  6. Use solutions that allow you to instantly check the correctness of filling fields (technology <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> ).  For example: the uniqueness of the login, e-mail or the correctness of entering any data, etc. This will allow you not to refresh the page several times and significantly speed up the registration process. <br><br>  7. Immediately after completing the registration, make an automatic entry for newly registered users and redirect to a page that facilitates further work and familiarization with the site (for example, rules, site map or payment methods) or to the page with welcome text or to the page on which he wanted to enter, but was sent for registration. <br><br>  8. Refuse automatic checking for password complexity.  At first glance it seems that this is a very useful feature that makes the user think about security.  But most often it happens that the user has 2-3 passwords, which he uses during registration.  And the ultimatum requirement to change one of them to a more complex one leads not only to the possible loss of a new password and loss of time during its recovery, but also to an outflow of potential customers from the site. <br><br>  9. Allow the user to upload an avatar and other personal information, the presence of which is more important for the user than for you.  This can be a great incentive to register and get the opportunity to express yourself among other users of the site. <br><br>  Perhaps all these recommendations will seem to you too ‚Äúideal‚Äù and impossible, however, the modern rhythm of life and the permanent acceleration of processes make it clear that time is the most important value.  That is why it is worth thinking about the reduction of time costs absolutely in all processes, even in such seemingly ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù as registration.  After all, where you find yourself tomorrow depends on today's decisions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126084/</a></p>
