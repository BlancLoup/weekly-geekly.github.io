The games developed by the company will be presented for more than half a billion fans of the club. <br><br>  Currently, KamaGames has an audience of 70 million players worldwide, and more than a million of them are active daily.  The company expects a significant increase in these indicators as a result of using the logo and elements of the corporate style of a football club.

      Manchester United Managing Director Richard Arnold stated: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe club was lucky to have a huge army of fans, and we realize the need to entertain our fans.  KamaGames and their innovative products make it possible to do this in new, interesting ways.  We are pleased to introduce KamaGames as our first official global social casino.  We look forward to successful cooperation over the years. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Samsung's long-awaited Tizen smartphone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc5/7c3/f85/bc57c3f85a244c4b815bbebac0c9a2dc.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung, being the world leader in sales of smartphones, receives almost nothing from the sale of applications, as most of the mobile devices produced by the company run on Android.  The solution to this problem was the development of its own (can afford!) Tizen mobile operating system. <br><br>  The first launch of the operating system took place more than two years ago, but the first smartphone working under Tizen was released just a few days ago.  They <a href="http://www.livebusiness.ru/news/12103/">became the device of the</a> average price category Samsung Z1. <br><br>  Samsung, of course, has no plans to transfer its smartphones to Tizen - the Android competition is too big.  But the new OS still has one promising advantage.  It is planned that Tizen can be put not only on smartphones, but also on watches, TVs and other household appliances, thus developing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù. <br><br><br><h4>  Apple Swift entered the top thirty of the most popular programming languages </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc8/a6c/261/cc8a6c261a3c4b6d93ca9ac0d3f297a7.jpg"><br><br>  Back in July 2014, the object-oriented programming language Swift by Apple in January 2014 <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/01/apple-swift/%3Ffrom%3Drss">turned out</a> to <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/01/apple-swift/%3Ffrom%3Drss">be</a> in 22nd place in a rating published by research firm RedMonk.  The company's rating does not reflect how common the language is among companies or is in demand in the labor market.  It is based on only two indicators: the number of lines of code placed on the service for hosting IT projects GitHub, and the number of questions relating to the language on the question and answer site Stack Overflow.  But even this information may be enough to decide on which languages ‚Äã‚Äãto use for their new projects. <br><br>  The Google Go language, introduced in 2009, also reached the top twenty this quarter, due in part to its popularity in China.  Meanwhile, the leaders, Java and Oracle, continue to maintain their positions, but Wired believes that the growth rates of languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike Swift and Go can compete with the dominant platforms. <br><br><br><h4>  Kabam bought two studios in Los Angeles </h4><br>  Kabam is slowly but surely breaking through into the leaders of the mobile game industry, recently <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/60643/kabam-buys-tapzen-and-magic-pixel-games/">announced</a> the purchase of two game studios TapZen and Magic Pixel Games, which will be merged into a single studio.  In total, since 2010, 9 developers have already been purchased. <br><br>  In addition, veteran gamedev Mike Verdu, founder of TapZen, former COO Zynga and vice president of Electronic Arts Los Angeles, joined the company. <br><br>  ‚ÄúJoining Kabam is an opportunity that we could not miss,‚Äù said Mike.  ‚ÄúMike Verdu will strengthen our team and strengthen relationships with Hollywood partners,‚Äù said Kabam co-founder and CEO Kevin Chou. <br><br>  Both teams already have experience of working together on This Means War! Strategy, which allows us to hope that the unification will be as simple as possible. <br><br><br><h4>  Monetization and retention of F2P players by Mark Robinson </h4><br>  Mark Robinson, CEO of the Game Analytics Platform, <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/comment-and-opinion/60649/sponsored-feature-killer-insights-to-monetize-your-players-revealed/">shares</a> with us data about F2P projects. <br><br>  Statistics show that if a player has paid once, then it is likely that he will pay more.  Approximately half of the players (52%) pay only once, a fifth of the players (18%) will make two game purchases, and the rest make three or more payments.  If those who make only one purchase show an average check of $ 8, then the average check of players who pay three or more times is $ 21. <br><br>  It is also concluded that the later the player pays, the greater the amount of the payment.  If a game can hold a player for quite a long time, then you shouldn‚Äôt put pressure on him with offers to make a purchase.  You should try as soon as possible to bring him to the need to make the first payment, without which it will be very difficult for the player to continue the game, but he cannot leave the game and progress so easily, because so much time and effort was spent!  The average check on the first day of the game is 13 dollars, on the second already 17 dollars, and the third and further - more than 20 dollars. <br><br>  Broken to pieces and down social media.  According to statistics, only 22% of all players connect to social networks, and 4% invite friends to the game.  In this case, those who connect in the first days of the game, much less actively use the invitation of friends than those who connected on the third day or later. <br><br>  If the player has installed the game after 9 pm, then the probability that he will return on the second day is 27% higher than the probability of returning for the player who installed the game in the morning or at lunch.  Also, time affects the probability of purchase - in the evening, the probability of a purchase is 8% higher than during the day.  Although the tools that can control the time of the day, in which the player will play, the developers are not so much ... <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
