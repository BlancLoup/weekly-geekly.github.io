  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to launch Landing Page in 4 minutes?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  This post is about how we, solving our own problem, created a service that already today solves the problems of hundreds of entrepreneurs.  But first things first. </h4><br><br>  In early 2012, while working on a gift project, we first encountered the problem of low conversion.  Users visited the site, uploaded their photos, but the conversion in the payment was only 0,024%.  From such figures not only the mood worsened, but also the financial condition of the whole company.  At that time, we were residents of the <a href="http://chelny.itpark-kazan.ru/">business incubator of the IT park of</a> Naberezhnye Chelny and within the educational program we attended the <a href="http://www.risventures.com/startingarage">Start in Garage</a> course.  There, for the first time, we were told in detail about the Landing Page: what problems they solve and how they work.  We decided to try this technology in our project.  In just 4 days, after working through a few simple Landing Page options, we were able to increase the conversion in payments to 2.1%.  Inspired by this achievement, we made several selling pages for our friends - the result was good: the number of applications from direct increased 1.5-4 times. <br><br>  Then we decided to try our hand at the commercial development of the Landing Page.  After several months of work, we encountered the following problem: we made the landing page, got paid, a week later the client asked to change the title, then the color of the button, then put a comma, etc.  We tell him: ‚ÄúGive access to ftp‚Äù, - and he is surprised and does not understand what is at stake.  And we spend half a day working on getting access and making minor edits. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  There was no tool on the market where all the Landing Page were accessible from a single account, and both developers and clients would have access to them.  It was necessary to have a solution that would allow editing the layout through the html-editor and have it shared.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/cfd/a4d/14fcfda4d65d47c589ace9246323a8bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For 3 weeks we developed the first version of the service, where we placed the Landing Page of some of our clients.  Added domain binding, invitation of participants and implemented a simple html-editor.  This development appealed to our customers - they began to make changes on their own, without distracting us from the workflow.  At the same time, we launched a small selling page describing the possibilities of the project for collecting contact information - we were wondering who else needed such a service.  And when after 5 days the number of people wishing to use the product exceeded 100, it became clear to us that LPCloud needs to be developed. <br><br>  Based on the requests of the first users, we have compiled a list of necessary functions that need to be implemented before launching the beta version of the service: <br><br>  - a small CRM to account for applications with email notifications; <br>  - download the layout and work with it in the online html-editor; <br>  - Editing Landing Page through a visual editor; <br>  - AB testing; <br>  - sharing mode; <br>  - Gallery of free Landing Page templates; <br>  - analytics; <br>  - domain binding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e5/b65/b9c/8e5b65b9c2b54316bb16284604e11483.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Initially, we did not immediately develop all the planned functionality, but decided to carry out the development iteratively with testing on the first users.  Thanks to this, it now takes only 4 minutes to create the Landing Page: <br><br>  1) load your layout (LPCloud works with statics); <br>  2) the forms are set up automatically; <br>  3) bind your domain; <br>  4) invite, if necessary, users (for example: web designers, marketers, etc.); <br>  5) Landing Page is ready to use. <br><br>  If you want to quickly test some hypothesis, you can use ready-made templates from our gallery.  All templates are free and have responsive layout.  Using a visual or html editor, edit the template, bind the domain and start testing. <br><br>  In total, the development of the project took us 5 months.  In the next post we will talk about the technical intricacies of the development of the service.  In the meantime, we will be happy to see you among users of the open beta version of LPCloud.  <a href="http://lpcloudapp.com/%3Futm_campaign%3Dstart%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_source%3Dhabr">Try what you have now</a> , express your ideas, wishes and comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235309/</a></p>
