  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create a good quest - useful tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Greetings to all readers!  We want to share the thoughts that have arisen among us and fellow craftsmen while working in the field of quests. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Most recently, we finally finally launched the <a href="http://surprizeme.ru/">Surprise Me</a> quest designer, where everyone can create quests and tours from any device from anywhere in the world.  For more than two months, the constructor of quests was used for different purposes: some create quests for birthdays, others create quests, being representatives of museums, schools for learning foreign languages, event agencies and others.  When communicating with users and receiving feedback, we often stumble upon pain that does not leave us indifferent. </p><br><p>  Most users make mistakes that prevent quest participants from reaching the end and discourage them from completing quests.  We want to share with you tips on how to avoid the most common mistakes and create a really cool online quest or quest in reality: </p><br><p>  <b>The player is always right</b> <br>  Any game or quest is created primarily for the player, so the most important thing in creating games is the player.  When you make a design, forget that you are a designer, think like a player. </p><br><p>  <b>Tips should not be too transparent</b> <br>  Of course, any hint or advice to the player should be veiled, but sometimes the creators hide the true meaning so that the player cannot understand what is wanted of him, and he simply has a desire to finish the game.  No one wants to feel stupid! </p><br><p>  <b>The participant must be able to win and reach the end, having no experience in similar games.</b> <br>  If you indicated the place of the next task without a good clue about his whereabouts and think that the player will go to look for him there without any clues just because this is the most popular place - you are wrong.  On quests go different people - both beginners, and professionals, and amateurs!  Take care of the participants and give the opportunity to complete the quest to all, even those who first appear in this place or learn about the existence of quests. </p><br><p>  <b>The player can not predict events, leave the opportunity to return</b> <br>  For example, if in a task you need to remember some fact from the past action, not having the opportunity to return, and then again the problems - how to remember what happened before?  Take care of the players and let them return to the previous level, even if he misses the most obvious things. </p><br><p>  That is why in the Surprise Me application we save all previous events and leave the opportunity to see them again. </p><br><p>  <b>Do not give the player a job that does not have a chance to perform</b> <br>  For example, do not force the player to ask passers-by about things he may not know.  There are people who find it difficult to start communicating with others, and sometimes the Internet is not at hand.  If the player can answer the answer in a logical puzzle, then, of course, then such a decision is more justified. </p><br><p>  <b>Do not force the player to perform boring tasks purely for the sake of boring tasks</b> <br>  This does not mean that only dynamic quests take place, and logical games are not in the subject.  The point is that the following should follow each task, or the task should be the key.  A player can collect a large puzzle to find out the code that must be entered in the last event, but do not force the player to collect a large puzzle just to collect this puzzle, and even better - make the puzzle small!  Sorry for the exclamation mark, my heart bleeds </p><br><p>  <b>If the otgadka word - do not program only one spelling</b> <br>  Often the mistake of the creators of quests is the creation of only one variant of writing the word-guess. </p><br><p>  If you are creating a logical game - then add to the possible answers the derivatives of this word, as well as its singular and plural, and in all cases.  So consider all the options for entering an answer, for example, to question 2 + 2, the answer may be "4" or "four." </p><br><p>  <b>Do not forget about synonyms</b> <br>  Addition to the previous item.  You know that the same things are called differently?  The player knows this too.  So enter the word in the answer, and all possible synonyms that the player can use and will be right. </p><br><p>  <b>Let the player understand the clues</b> <br>  Do not share tips only for engineers or for those who understand football.  Everyone should understand your clues.  Or let the players use the Internet to find out some fact from there. </p><br><p>  We hope the tips have been helpful for quest lovers and their creators. <br>  If you have never tried to create quests, then we recommend, it is not at all difficult, the main thing is to give free rein to your imagination!  By the way, we also launched an <a href="http://surprizeme.ru/partnerskaya-programma/">affiliate program,</a> and if you feel that you are able to create interesting quests, the program can show quite attractive. </p><br><p>  We are warm and motivated by the understanding that we help people reflect their own interesting finds in different parts of the world and create congratulations or gifts "with their own brains" using quests.  Delight your friends and relatives, it's easier than it seems! </p></div>
