Part 1 - Accounting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Moscow market of <nobr>business services is</nobr> extremely rich and rich.  We have to carefully study its flora and fauna, because <a href="http://knopka.com/">our service company</a> is not the only way to get good service.  We recently did a little research, popularized accounting and legal support, studied the proposals of secretaries and <nobr>business assistants</nobr> .  Typically, marketers keep the results of research in secret, but we decided to tell about them.  I want to believe that this will save entrepreneurs a couple of hours in search of a service option suitable for their company.  Let's start with accounting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/969/408/dc2/969408dc22b247933ecee1037eb10005.png"><br><br>  We explored accounting options that suit businesses from small to medium.  It turned out only 7 categories, each of which we tried to give an objective description, determine the price plug and highlight the most noticeable (read, advertised) proposals. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Stuffing documents </h4><br>  These tools are quite simple and perform exactly one task: they help to quickly and almost free of charge prepare standard accounting and legal documents, <nobr>such as</nobr> bills, acts or contracts.  One of these packs can be shamelessly handed to your employees: customer service managers, accountants, and in case of urgent need - use them yourself, spending a little time to figure out the details and texture. <br><br>  The program <a href="http://www.pvision.ru/bp">Business Pack</a> , the most well-known in a professional environment, is a time-tested free utility that allows you to work with a bunch of different forms, from familiar to all, to checks, prices and payment requirements.  You will have to get used to the interface, but this is rather a common problem of frivolous software.  All data at once are exported to 1SK for further processing by an accountant.  The only minus but serious enough for 2014 is that the program is installed locally and works only under Windows. <br><br>  Fashionable cloud services nowadays are deprived of this minus and give access to the created documents from any device and from anywhere in the world.  <a href="http://formz.ru/">Formz.ru</a> and <a href="http://freshdoc.ru/">freshdoc.ru</a> seem to be the most interesting: they allow you to work with a huge number of forms and templates, and the second one, in addition, has a fun papkuyu interface with pleasant animations. <br><br>  In the rearguard of cloud-based work with documents, single-tasking packing of accounts, such as <a href="http://naoplatu.ru/">naoplatu.ru</a> and <a href="http://invoicer.ru/">invoicer.ru, is wobbling</a> .  However, they perform their functions perfectly, allowing for a couple of clicks to prepare an invoice for payment and send it to your client.  There are probably a whole bunch of such services, we chose the most visible ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bc/c1c/2c5/6bcc1c2c551b05f4028ceb9f0622ae01.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Anyone who needs to quickly invoice, create a contract or any other simple document.  Will help those whom the chief has bothered to work with documents, and in the Excel lazily poking around. <br><br><h6>  How much are </h6>  Free or for little money: from 100 to 1 000 rubles per month. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.pvision.ru/bp">Business Pak</a> , <a href="http://formz.ru/">formz.ru</a> , <a href="http://freshdoc.ru/">freshdoc.ru</a> , <a href="http://naoplatu.ru/">naoplatu.ru</a> , <a href="http://invoicer.ru/">invoicer.ru</a> <br><br><h4>  Accounting software </h4><br>  The name of the main domestic vendor of accounting programs is familiar even to those who are far from bookkeeping, business and computers in general.  The great and terrible <a href="http://www.1c.ru/">1C</a> reigns in this market almost completely, taking advantage of the inescapable demand among professional accountants.  What a sin to conceal, we ourselves conduct the accounting of our clients with the help of solutions from the company of Boris Georgievich Nuraliev.  1C is more than a software company; it is a whole phenomenon that gave rise to a separate profession of <nobr>1C programmers</nobr> .  There are slightly fewer custom builds of this program than the installed legal copies. <br><br>  Alas, long-term communication of an ordinary person with 1C threatens to result in sleep disturbances and emotional breakdowns.  In addition, the company's sales policy sometimes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215545/">raises questions</a> , and the cost of implementation and maintenance varies from a couple of thousands to incredible transcendental amounts.  1C is installed locally or on the terminal, but there are companies that provide access to this solution through a browser. <br><br>  In 1C there are a lot of followers and analogs: <a href="http://www.parus.com/solutions/corporate/system/">Sail</a> , <a href="http://www.bestnet.ru/programs/best-5/">Best</a> , <a href="https://kontur.ru/kontur-buhgalteria-activ"><nobr>Contour-Accounting Active</nobr></a> , but they are attracted only by the price.  Unique <nobr>enterprise solutions</nobr> like those offered by SAP will find you when you earn your first instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eeb/a7e/960/eeba7e960d0613e5d722854d3cb86206.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Professional accountants and especially stubborn business owners who are ready to independently explore the rocky bottom of accounting. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  From 3,000 (for the version for IP on special modes) to infinity plus the cost of maintenance and installation of updates.  The full cost will help calculate the regional distributor.  Or a favorite <nobr>torrent tracker</nobr> :) <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.1c.ru/">1C</a> , <a href="https://1cfresh.com/">1C Fresh</a> , <a href="http://www.parus.com/solutions/corporate/system/">Sail</a> , <a href="http://www.bestnet.ru/programs/best-5/">Best</a> , <a href="https://kontur.ru/kontur-buhgalteria-activ"><nobr>Contour-Accounting Asset</nobr></a> , <a href="http://www.buhgalter20.ru/"><i>First</i> online accounting</a> <br><br><h4>  <nobr>Online Accounting</nobr> </h4><br>  With this increasingly popular phenomenon, we are familiar firsthand.  Many Button employees have worked in the past on <a href="http://e-kontur.ru/">Elbe</a> , an <nobr>online accounting office</nobr> for SKB Kontur.  Today, there are a great number of such services: <a href="http://moedelo.org/">My Business</a> , <a href="http://nebopro.ru/">Sky</a> , <a href="http://assistentpro.ru/">AssistantPro</a> , <a href="http://my-fin.ru/">My Finance</a> , <a href="http://imboss.ru/">ImBoss</a> and their ilk.  Their functionality is almost identical: they help to independently keep records, count taxes, submit reports and work with documents.  They are suitable for small companies on USN and UTII and are quite cheap. <br><br>  <nobr>Online accounting</nobr> is a great solution for start-ups.  If the service is done well (like Elba), then after 15 minutes, a person who is not even familiar with the term ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù will be able to get comfortable with it.  Another pleasant side effect: after a couple of months of work, a businessman will begin to understand a little about the intricacies of tax accounting and reporting, which does not hurt when the business starts to grow, and the owner will have to communicate with a live accountant or an accounting company. <br><br>  Some services, for example, My Business and ImBoss go a little further and offer partial accounting outsourcing to the user.  In this case, they themselves keep records and submit reports on the basis of documents and transactions reflected by the user in the personal account.  The rest of the <nobr>online accounting</nobr> is still limited to expert advice and useful educational content in their blozhikah and social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/888/f8b/1bd/888f8b1bd04d01bbff3bb358f631ac09.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Small companies will help save some money at the start, graduates of accounting courses will make them feel like real professionals who do everything exactly and on time. <br><br><h6>  How much are </h6><ul><li>  from 400 to 5 000 rubles per month depending on a set of options (for example, reporting via the Internet, payroll, work with documents); </li><li>  from 1,000 to 10,000 rubles in excess of this amount for accounting outsourcing; </li><li>  many services have free fares for the smallest ones, but we recommend supporting the guys with a specie - they deserve it :) </li></ul><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://e-kontur.ru/">Elba</a> , <a href="http://moedelo.org/">My Business</a> , <a href="http://nebopro.ru/">Sky</a> , <a href="http://assistentpro.ru/">AssistantPro</a> , <a href="http://my-fin.ru/">My Finance</a> , <a href="http://imboss.ru/">ImBoss</a> <br><br><h4>  Community Access Points </h4><br>  What to do if there is no time or desire to mess around with services, there is no need to wait for help from where, and you need to hand over the reporting right now?  This situation is familiar to many, so enterprising colleagues came up with PKD - a place where you can come with your tsiferki and pieces of paper, knock around a bit in a queue, conjure a point with the employee over the report and send it by proxy via the Internet, breathing easier at the exit.  The situation is saved! <br><br>  Some advanced PCDs are able to receive reports via e-mail: this saves you from walking and long lines, but you have to create reports yourself.  In this case, it is easier to use any of the <nobr>web services</nobr> described above, but it is still vital for many to get their hands on the analog media confirming the report sending, and in case of problems, come to the service provider‚Äôs office and thoroughly quarrel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/159/cbc/31c/159cbc31ca6f1e464374248120f6586b.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  The main contingent of such establishments is amateurs to pull up to the deadline, accountants, whom an evil chief does not give money for a system for sending electronic reporting, and Old Believers who are afraid to entrust such an important matter to our Internet. <br><br><h6>  How much are </h6>  From 300 rubles for one report (depending on the complexity).  Add here the money equivalent of the time spent and get the final price tag. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.agneko.ru/access-points">Agneko</a> , in Moscow, Google does not give out other options.  The fact is that these guys are much more efficiently moving in offline, catching the flow of taxpayers right next to the tax. <br><br><h4>  <nobr>Freelance accountant</nobr> </h4><br>  This representative of the world of accounting services is found on hunting portals and <nobr>freelance resources</nobr> .  He knows everything that a regular staff member does, but does not disdain even one-time work.  Over 10 000‚Äì20 000 rubles will keep accounts, take taxes and submit reports all year round.  You will only have to send him papers and periodically monitor the work so that the controlling authorities do not have a desire to monitor the activities of your enterprise. <br><br>  The risks of this option are obvious - relationships with a freelancer are built on an honest word, salary is sometimes paid in black cash, and assessment of professional qualities is based on the number of unfamiliar abbreviations in the resume.  If you're lucky, you will find a good accountant who simply cannot work full time for reasons related, for example, to a sudden and rapid continuation of the family.  Otherwise, you can come across an ordinary lover of easy money.  Be careful, ask the contacts of trusted people from friends or on thematic forums. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/c74/84e/4a3c7484ef2669829b8ccccdaeb85be8.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Anyone who prefers to communicate with a specific living person, even a stranger, loves personal approach, but is not yet ready to hire an accountant for the staff. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  1,000‚Äì5,000 rubles for preparing and sending one report; </li><li>  10 000‚Äì30 000 rubles per month for accounting support; </li><li>  when your business grows, the amount may increase.

There will definitely be no problems with finding a bukhkompaniya: the market is packed with similar offers a little more than full.  Outsourcers are happy to take away your accounting, preparing and sending reports, keep records, help with tax optimization and give you full advice on telephone and email. <br><br>  Unlike a freelancer, a accounting company will give more confidence, supported by a normal, competent contract, but in most cases it will not be able to provide that very individual approach.  A lot of accountants work in such establishments, they exchange experience and help each other, so you will not find yourself in a situation where reporting is tomorrow, and boo went to justify his short name, became ill with inflammation of procrastination, or even disappeared in an unknown direction with the original accounting documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/337/1fe/5f3/3371fe5f3068cc3804ede07ad60e3580.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  To give accounting to outsourcing is the ideal solution in terms of price / quality ratio, if you are not yet Yandex or Mail.ru.  Feel free to recommend, but we advise you to take a responsible approach to the choice and, if possible, ask for advice from familiar entrepreneurs. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  2,000‚Äì7,000 rubles per month for small entrepreneurs on special modes </li><li>  10 000‚Äì20 000 for businesses with normal turnover </li><li>  30,000‚Äì70,000 will be given away by successful businesses (or those who do not count money very well) </li></ul><br>  In addition to the base rate, there are decreasing and increasing factors.  You can reduce the cost of maintenance if you take over some of the operations or assign them to your own employees (for example, warehouse accounting or some accounting documents).  If the organization conducts foreign economic activity or, for example, sells excisable goods, the cost of servicing will be increased. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.vash-bugalter.ru/"><nobr>vash-bugalter</nobr> .ru</a> , <a href="http://www.stnalog.ru/">stnalog.ru</a> , <a href="http://financeconsulting5.ru/">financeconsulting5.ru</a> , <a href="http://tby.ru/">tby.ru</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">thousands of them</a> . <br><br><h4>  State accountant </h4><br>  A caricature aunt with painted tow, busily correcting glasses with a huge diopter to get a better look at the cards in solitaire - this is a myth.  These, too, are found, but if you carefully go through the hunting portals, you will find a sweet and sincere person who will devote all his time only to your business.  We have become adept in hiring classroom accountants and will easily give a couple of tips if you ask in the comments. <br><br>  The advantages of an accountant in the state are obvious: he is always at his side, you can talk with him, hold his hand, or hurt him with a keyboard for an untimely report.  He (and more often, she) will always tell and advise the winning option, because his emotional balance, stability of position and salary directly depend on the success of your business.  A happy accountant will reciprocate.  This level of service for other categories, unfortunately, is unattainable :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/b70/eb9/230b70eb97f84590a303233c63725d38.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Glavbukh is vital for successful businesses with vigorous activity, a large number of operations and a complex accounting kitchen, which requires a deep knowledge of a specialist in <nobr>business processes</nobr> .  Small businesses need an accountant only if kinesthetics and warm, friendly gatherings are important for a cup of tea. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  Looking at the salaries of Moscow accountants, we are a little jealous and shyly count the bills in our wallets.  A competent chief accountant will take for full time from 70,000 to 150,000 rubles a month (or even more), will require a comfortable workplace, a good assembly of 1C, an electronic document management system, love and recognition.  And sometimes they can ask for a couple of helpers who will work with papers and bring hot tea. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://hh.ru/resumesearch/result%3Fa%3D1%26text%3D%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%26from%3DCLUSTER_SPECIALIZATION%26pos%3Dfull_text%26logic%3Dnormal%26profArea%3D2">headhunter.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.superjob.ru/resume/search_resume.html%3Fsbmit%3D1%26show_refused%3D0%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bkeys%255D%3D%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bsrws%255D%3D7%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bskwc%255D%3Dand%26t%255B0%255D%3D4%26order_by%255Brank%255D%3Ddesc%26search_hesh%3D3509901997068250%26main%3D1">superjob.ru</a> <br><br><h4>  What place does Button occupy? </h4><br>  A button is an accounting company.
