Approximately at the same time, the Ministry of Defense transferred the remaining four ships of the Selena type to the NPO measuring equipment of the Russian Space Agency. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCosmonaut George Dobrovolsky‚Äù and ‚ÄúCosmonaut Viktor Patsayev‚Äù were equipped with TM measurement and communication equipment, and two ships - ‚ÄúCosmonaut Vladislav Volkov‚Äù and ‚ÄúCosmonaut Pavel Belyaev‚Äù - without scientific equipment, since  Former owners managed to remove special equipment and some equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/602/20c/d7b/60220cd7b95145c64b295127147531c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the second half of the 1990s, the Cosmonaut Georgy Dobrovolsky was prepared for use in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">Sea Launch project</a> as a spacecraft measurement complex. <br><br>  According to the original scheme, it should have telemetry from a rocket in the most critical areas: separation of the stages, separation of the upper stage, launching the object into orbit. <br><br>  Until October 1998, everything was moving according to plan.  Additional equipment of the vessel was held for Russian money, taking into account that the Americans will sign a contract.  Indeed, they even allocated a bit of finance in advance.  But at the last moment they unexpectedly changed their minds and offered to abandon his services, equipping the rocket with an American satellite relay unit, and use their TDRS satellite for transmitting telemetry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdb/2ce/8cc/cdb2ce8cc840f18f285078fe35e00967.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Maybe this is true from the point of view of a business decision: the day of operation of a telemetric vessel cost only $ 10,000. <br><br>  <i>This includes the cost of fuel, water, food, navigation services and only a small proportion of the salary of Russian personnel.</i> <br><br>  However, the savings of Americans did not take into account that the launch of the Zenit launch vehicle from the Sea Launch platform has a number of features: <br><blockquote>  - for the first time, a land-based PH will start from an ocean platform; <br>  - for the first time, refueling and storage of fuel components will be carried out in the ocean on a platform from which the launch vehicle starts; <br>  - for the first time, the volume of telemetry adopted for normal operation at the tested RN will be reduced for transmission via the TDRS radio link; <br>  - for the first time on the tested complex in the first launch, an experimental telemetry measurement system based on the use of TDRS will be used. <br>  - The savings offered by the Americans cannot be compared with the possible losses.  --- Telemetry information is vital for commercial launches.  Its absence ‚Äúhits the pocket‚Äù: in case of unsuccessful start-up, insurers do not pay compensation until they unequivocally determine the cause of the accident. </blockquote>  <sup>[2]</sup> <br>  Russian partners advocated the use of Selena, at least in the first launches.  The negotiations ended in nothing.  In March 1998, the Zenit launch vehicle launched a spacecraft from the platform without the involvement of the Selena-M telemetric vessel. <br><br>  To prevent the ships from disappearing, their crew, at every opportunity, took the ships out to sea, performing many tasks, including working with the Mir station. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  A possible way out of the impasse was outlined, as always, ‚Äúat the junction of two elements‚Äù - the sea and space, the ship and the rocket. </h3></blockquote><br>  The project of the FSUE ‚ÄúScientific and Production Association of Measuring Equipment‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.npoit.ru/">NPO IT</a> ) was very simple and low-cost.  In the docks of Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg there were two of the three remaining (in Soviet times there were 11) vessels of the Selena-M series intended for space communications, Cosmonaut Viktor Patsayev and Cosmonaut Georgy Dobrovolsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b8/f4d/95f/0b8f4d95ff4ad15e1f2e20f114bba64d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  NPO IT specialists suggested one of them to re-equip to launch launch vehicles ( <sup>corrected on</sup> March 13, <sup>17 on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/sticks/" class="user_link">sticks</a> from <s>launch vehicles</s></sup> ) type ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and ‚ÄúStart-1‚Äù.  During launch, the second vessel was to provide telemetric tracking of the process of launching spacecraft into orbit. <br><br>  The ships could be based anywhere from the Baltic to the Canary Islands - as more convenient for the customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64f/d87/9a1/64fd879a1657e09472cc59d4647fb3cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference is only in the speed of reaching the starting point (closer to the equator): in the first case it is two or three weeks, in the second - up to 10 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d1/536/bc1/0d1536bc1a5dc406ad22e83868a17c08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More benefits: <br><br>  <i>- in the geographical breadth of the launch.</i>  <i>Starting from the equator, in the vicinity of which the floating cosmodrome can easily be located, allows you to increase the mass of the satellite being put into orbit and the lower the orbit, the greater the difference in mass: for example, two hundred-kilometer height can be sent from the Plesetsk to 535 kg, and from the equator - 742.</i> <br>  <i>- some specific-purpose satellites cannot be launched from the territory of the Russian Federation:</i> <br>  <i>- - The law of conditions for the export of high technology from 1979;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- - Military items controlled by the US Munitions List</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- - Dual-use items, the list of which is defined by the US Commercial Control List.</i> <br>  - great difficulty in carrying out commercial launches from Baikonur or Plesetsk is represented by customs procedures (duties on the import of foreign satellites for launches by Russian missiles constitute a significant fraction of the cost of the launch itself). <br><br>  <a href="">EAEC EA: 10% duty and 18% VAT.</a> <br><br>  The mobile complex, which independently arrives at the customer‚Äôs port, plunges aboard the spacecraft together with the escort team and, under its own power, goes to the launch point of the Offshore and is relieved of such a moth. <br><br>  Comfortable conditions on board (single and double cabins) make it possible to accommodate customer representatives, even the most demanding ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/016/22f/8db/01622f8dbc5a1ffc6e102cc9ebe8423d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Of course there are also disadvantages </h3><br>  The main one: the sea launch was losing (at that time), and even now it loses (Space X is the same) in price to the earth cosmodromes.  Sea launch is more expensive by about $ 2-4 million ($ 12-14 million versus $ 10 million from the launch site). <br><br>  Partial ‚Äúdifference‚Äù was paid by extra satellite kilograms launched from the equator. <br><br>  Launch class launch vehicles ( <sup>corrected on</sup> March 13, 177 by <sup><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/sticks/" class="user_link">sticks</a> with <s>boosters</s></sup> ) are solid propellant ones that do not require refueling on site, which simplified launch and maintenance teams. <br><br>  ILV (conversion version RT-2PM / 15Zh58 (SS-25 SICKLE)) are compact in size and have an acceptable mass, which made it possible to place two missiles on the ship at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e57/802/00a/e5780200a3d42991f5314a8036deab8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88e/81e/63e/88e81e63ef89445d5ec24d5f4b3b7cd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e8/4fc/e7f/7e84fce7fde25d5becd52246d234b2aa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The degree of automation of prelaunch preparation is very high (at 100%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd3/3af/5c8/cd33af5c8ca0319a09c1aebbcc0b082a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The total cost of the project "easy" sea launch: 20-25 million dollars (almost the price of one space tour), which includes a complete re-equipment of the spaceport, the output of two ships at sea and their work. <br><br>  For the year, according to the designers, you can make up to 10 starts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/560/2bf/19d/5602bf19d9cd9ed3a1eb6321eaf663d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also a security problem: the ship is a land site of the cosmodrome. <br><br>  The designers used the ‚Äúmortar‚Äù principle of launch in the ICBM: the <i>charge of the TPK in which the rocket is located will be the first to fire and fire it into the air, then the main engines of the launch vehicle turn on at a safe height ( <sup>corrected on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/sticks/" class="user_link">March 13, 17 sticks</a> from the <s>launch vehicle</s></sup> ).</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REch529LjsY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For complete safety, the option of a remote launch without the presence of the crew was also provided: the legacy of the combat ICBM. <br><br>  The marine launch complex, called Selena, includes a transportable rocket-space complex with a solid launch rocket of the Start family, a Selena-M project transport and launch vessel, a complex of rocket launch process measurement systems and a ground-based technical base for preparation and assembly of the RKK in the port of registry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdc/04f/0c6/cdc04f0c6dbb10edc9235488e02f017d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The current measuring points are completely different.  Places on the ships of this class will be a lot.  <b>The trouble ships almost gone.</b> <br><br>  Mobile measuring points (MIPs) are developed and exist.
