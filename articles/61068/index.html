      In steps: <br>  1. You study the goods (Ya.Market, requests to Direct, the nearest market) on the subject ‚Äúthat such is not too bored and competitive, but at the same time easy to deliver, and that hemorrhoids with smaller guarantees / licenses. <br>  Hint: souvenirs, toys, collectors of all stripes <strong>.</strong>  <strong>Take one / several specific niches for training.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>No need to take the construction, windows, appliances / electronics.</strong>  <strong>Where kokurent dofiga.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  2. Go to the nearest market, shopping complex, and better industry exhibition (where the people are larger and denser). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3. We get acquainted with businessmen.  We are interested in whether it is necessary to increase sales, how things are in general.  What they think about the Internet.  Hold at least 10 meetings.  You can submit a novice specialist in the field of sites. <br><br>  4. We propose to raise sales at our own responsibility, on the Internet by creating and developing an online store.  Profit from the Internet in half.  Consider better fixed% of turnover.  Additional discounts and wholesale prices by entrepreneurs are often knocked out at the expense of precious nerve cells, and you have no reason to get into this kitchen. <br><br>  5. The condition for the participation of entrepreneurs is the availability of normal goods in warehouses or in daily availability, <br>  <strong>the presence of a legal entity, the ability to knock out checks</strong> , ideally the possibility of a return. <br><br>  6. Take a soap box and photograph the goods of your partner, unless of course there are no ready-made catalogs in pdf / pictures on the disk. <br><br>  7. Google <strong>free</strong> oscommerce, see it or clones, which one you like or if you can do it yourself - put your simple catalog with an order.  <strong>Design is not necessary!</strong>  Design, etc. trinkets only with profits. <br><br>  8. Domain out of respect for the partner can be registered on it to remove the excess voltage at the beginning.  There are a lot of problems.  At the same time you will be advising in detail on computer-Internet issues. <br><br>  9. Customize for the evening the site, domain, start to drive goods.  <strong>Pocket money for the domain and hosting does not count</strong> , does it?  :) <br><br>  10. The primary microscopic traffic will go through the low frequency after the full indexation of the site.  You can speed up the process of the first sale, throwing 50-100 bucks on the direct and then on the laying of subwoofers in Sapa.  If you don‚Äôt have your 100 per ad, <strong>after the site</strong> you‚Äôve <strong>made,</strong> your partner will most likely give you future profits.  For business, it's not money at all.  Like you on the shuttle bus back and forth. <br>  Take at once such topics where there are less than 10 competitors and a lot of woofers according to the articles.  Often will be on the first page below without attachments.  If the product is completely rotten off-line, it is better not to take it on the Internet for the first time. <br><br>  11. You can take the first orders yourself to get a feel for the moment, and then find the first delivery workers and operator.  <strong>With profits.</strong>  If there are no sales, your mobile phone may hang on the site.  In the evening, punch checks and pick up the goods for the next day, as well as hand over the money for the previous one. <br><br>  12 * Your partner will most likely have a bunch of unused and idle resources, including  possibly by advertising. <br>  We must talk, look for opportunities to apply what is.  Explanatory people are usually a wild drawback, but at the same time there are good discounts on advertising or who can owe money, but donate them with iron.  etc. <br><br>  13 * For certain groups of goods, mail delivery throughout Russia works well. <br><br>  Don't expect gold mountains right away from such a scheme, but the <strong>first turnovers and first experience will really go.</strong>  And then there is an immense number of techniques that you have to implement and test, as the main person concerned. <br>  Just crowds of small entrepreneurs are now running all in the soap because of the crisis and sit without online sales.  Due to the download is not able to find the time to deal with online.  <strong>So help them.</strong> <br><br>  * If everything goes bad.  No one loses anything.  You have gained real experience in exchange for time, but experience is not wasted. <br>  ** Well, if all of a sudden everything is good and the partner feels that there is too much ‚Äúinvested‚Äù and too much ‚Äúgives away‚Äù - donate this store and have your own project <strong>in another similar niche</strong> .  After all, you will already have experience and money in this case. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Exhibition "ELECTRO-2009", June 8‚Äì11, <a href="http://www.expocentr.ru/ru/expocentre/elektro/">www.expocentr.ru/ru/expocentre/elektro</a> <br>  Exhibition ‚ÄúHunting and Fishing in Russia‚Äù, September 11-14, <a href="http://www.vvcentre.ru/exhibitions/show/%3F1105">www.vvcentre.ru/exhibitions/show/?1105</a> <br><br>  I will go to study and get acquainted for cooperation in online. <br>  Are you% username%?
