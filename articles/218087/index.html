Windows Phone 8.1 update will begin for all existing users in the coming months.  Starting next month, the update will be pre-installed on new phones.  Registered developers will have the opportunity to install the update before the end of next week. <br><br>  To demonstrate browser capabilities on various platforms, we also launch two new services: <a href="http://t.22tracks.com/">22Tracks</a> and <a href="http://www.3dfishgl.com/">FishGL</a> .  With them, you can explore and evaluate the new features of IE11 for Windows and Windows Phone.

      Today, people work on the Internet on several devices - laptops, tablets and phones - alternately using them throughout the day.  Updating Internet Explorer for Windows and Windows Phone will allow you to switch between devices with maximum convenience, thanks to the synchronization of open tabs and favorites.  Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 uses the same engine, and supports all modern web standards: this will allow developers to create websites and services that are equally useful when working on different devices.  For example, Internet Explorer for Windows Phone 8.1 now supports hardware acceleration for the latest (stable) WebGL specification, as well as professional-quality video in HTML5 with the ability to use captions and adaptive media streaming and rights management. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f5/0d5/95e/0f50d595e21d49e283b6906c001c8d82.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Introducing IE11 for Windows Phone 8.1</b> <br>  With IE11, Windows Phone 8.1 users have the opportunity to use the most modern and full-featured browser for smartphones.  In addition to the already mentioned tools for rendering and synchronizing favorites and bookmarks between devices, with the new browser, Windows Phone offers a number of features previously available to Internet Explorer users on Windows-based devices.  With IE11 for Windows Phone, you have the opportunity to consolidate sites on the start screen in the form of ‚Äúlive‚Äù tiles with updated information.  The browser also supports Reading Mode, which optimizes texts on the Internet for reading on a smartphone and voice commands for quick access to sites using voice. <br><br>  In addition, IE11 for Windows Phone now supports InPrivate mode and the built-in SmartScreen filter to protect against malicious programs implemented by social engineering and phishing attacks.  Another new mode will be Saving Mode, which allows you to control traffic and reduce the amount of downloaded data by 60-80% due to the refusal of downloading images and the ability to view only those elements of the page that interest you. <br><br>  <b>IE11 updates for Windows 8.1</b> <br>  From today, the updated IE11 adapts to the user's individual requirements, automatically determining which device he uses - an 8-inch touchpad or a 24-inch candybar with a mouse and keyboard.  The updated browser will allow you to individually customize the display of sites and the interface: to determine the number of tabs displayed on a single screen, the size of fonts and menus.  Also, you can now control the settings for switching to full-screen mode by determining when browser controls are hidden or remain on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a49/53e/17c/a4953e17cb905d8afb2ff707d4f63dda.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>F12 Advanced Developer Tools</b> <br>  One of the differences between IE11 was a set of developer tools that allow you to create, diagnose and optimize websites and applications during the creation process.  During the time that has passed since the release of the browser, developers using the F12 tools have expressed a number of suggestions and suggestions for improving these tools, many of which are implemented in the updated version.  The changes affected the toolbar shortcuts, as well as the emulation mode of different versions of IE.  In addition, the UI and memory tools, as well as the debugger tools, have been improved.  A full list of improvements is available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589512(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">on the MSDN website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/293/270/937/293270937981c7b431628e565e3c3aee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Enterprise Mode for improved performance with a modern browser</b> <br>  With the new enterprise mode, business users will be able to appreciate all the benefits of supporting modern web standards, performance and increased security of Internet Explorer 11, without ceasing to justify the investments made in already outdated web applications.  Independence from older versions of Internet Explorer will also make it much easier for companies to upgrade to the latest version of Windows, switch to using new services, such as Office 365, and modern devices, such as Sony Vaio Tap. <br><br>  IT professionals can learn more about the benefits and capabilities of Enterprise Mode for IE <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/%3Flinkid%3D9845620">in the IE developer blog</a> , as well as by visiting <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/ie">TechNet</a> for technical documentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c72/3d5/aa8/c723d5aa8f11dc9a254e5f80ba663e4f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/international/b/russia/archive/2014/04/03/stay_2d00_up_2d00_to_2d00_date_2d00_with_2d00_enterprise_2d00_mode_2d00_for_2d00_internet_2d00_explorer_2d00_11.aspx">Read more about Enterprise Mode here.</a> <br><br>  <b>22tracks and FishGL: speed, beauty and perfect touch control support</b> <br>  <a href="http://t.22tracks.com/">22Tracks</a> and <a href="http://www.3dfishgl.com/">FishGL</a> will help demonstrate the benefits of the updated IE11 on all devices.  22Tracks is a service for searching for modern music with the participation of the best DJs in Europe, which also demonstrates to developers the ability to create functional websites that are fully scaled for use on Windows Phone and tablets with a single line of code.  Detailed information on the creation and operation of <a href="http://t.22tracks.com/">22Tracks</a> is available <a href="http://blog.22tracks.com/">on the developer blog</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/939/7fd/4af9397fd80e74a2f790ecaf414d4a87.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In turn, the interactive demonstration <a href="http://www.3dfishgl.com/">FishGL</a> demonstrates the new possibilities of using WebGL in developing websites and services for Windows and Windows Phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/2c3/9cc/7b92c39cccd325df84c3ca089ed99a23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Looking to the future</b> <br>  Announcing today's update, we also announce that we are ready for the next round: work on further improvements and additions to the browser.  In this regard, we are interested in the maximum interaction of users and developers with our team.  We also use the possibility of feedback through <a href="https://twitter.com/IEDevChat">@IEDevChat</a> , conferences and forums in which we want to get more information about your wishes for future versions of IE. <br>  Users of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 will begin to receive an IE11 update automatically starting April 8, 2014.  Those who want to install it earlier can download the update from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a> or <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/">TechNet</a> , starting April 2. <br><br>  Sam George <br>  Partner Group Program Manager, Internet Explorer </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218087/</a></p>
