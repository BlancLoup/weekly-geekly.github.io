      Now a little about the recent list of "5 x 5", which IBM has been presenting for the fifth year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1. <b>Three-dimensional</b> </h5><br>  A few days ago, NVIDIA presented the first site where visitors can share 3D content.  A recent exhibition CES 2011 confirmed that three-dimensional video and photos firmly bites into the life of the consumer.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether he is wearing shutter glasses or sitting motionless in front of the screen with three-dimensional images.  Say more: the first holographic TV from InnoVision Labs was presented at the same exhibition in Las Vegas.  But its lightest model weighs 16 kg. <br><br>  And when such holographs fit in the palm of your hand (and technologies now eat a lot and grow quickly, you know), then the three-dimensionality will ‚Äúspread out through the thought‚Äù of information technology. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Mobile smartphones, for example, will not require points.</i>  <i>The 3D effect is achieved by directing the ray into the pupils of the operator, giving a sense of 3D space and sending the corresponding signal to the brain.</i>  <i>We believe this will enhance the personalized aspects of communication,</i> "- J. K. <br><br><h5>  2. <b>self-charging battery</b> </h5><br>  Once it was fashionable to reflect on what thing is worth taking, going to an uninhabited island.  And if it all came down to the commonplace ‚Äúsalt and matches and a knife,‚Äù why cann‚Äôt the battery be the cornerstone of IT today?  Energy is expensive. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Our chemists are testing a lithium-air battery.</i>  <i>It charges, breathing in the air - just like you and me.</i>  <i>Your gadget will fully recharge while you sleep.</i>  <i>And in the case of an electric car, our system will allow a tenfold increase in energy density.</i>  <i>That is, the battery can work 10 times longer without recharging.</i>  <i>In addition, it will reduce the load on the habitat - now getting rid of such garbage is expensive</i> ‚Äù, - J. K. <br><br>  In the same January in Detroit there was a <s>ball</s> showroom.  And at the auto show about hybrids and electric cars talked, if not constantly, then everywhere.  I will say more: the guys from Toyota, together with the guys from Tesla Motors, have assembled a cheap electric motor from thousands of laptop batteries and are going (sic!) To use them in their hybrids, thus saving well.  Such a motor in "Toyota" will cost three times less than that of competitors. <br><br>  Now fold the horse in ‚Äútenfold‚Äù and triple ‚Äúcheers‚Äù for the guys from Toyota - we‚Äôll get a self-charging electric car. <br><br><h5>  3. <b>Recycling computer heat</b> </h5><br>  On nine square meters, four laptops warm as good as Vesuvius in his prime in a cold winter day.  IBM is going to recycle the heat generated by iron lungs and computer chips. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>We all know that computers radiate heat.</i>  <i>While it is not used.</i>  <i>But if microchannels are drilled in the chips, you can remove heat and use it to heat - or cool - the rooms</i> ‚Äù, - J. K. <br><br>  It is unlikely that a leading IBM expert would begin to speak unfoundedly about some kind of warmth of the chips, rather they have the power of the power stations.  I repeat: energy is expensive, but is it enough to include the potential heat production of chips in the list of the five most expected innovations of the future? <br><br><h5>  4. <b>Healing roads and motorists with IBM methods.</b> </h5><br>  The problem, which was written in the last century, is expensive, of course.  And while Moscow is in a traffic jam, in the Swedish town of Malmo open automated car rental.  At the auto show in Detroit was presented a raw two-wheeled electric car, able to independently take a couple of people to their destination.  Through a mobile phone, GPS and heaps of sensitive (albeit damp) sensors. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Now the global positioning system (GPS) warns about what is happening on the route of your route.</i>  <i>Our engineers are developing a system designed to predict the situation.</i>  <i>The system takes into account the individual driving characteristics of an individual, the time of arrival of trains, airplanes, etc., the end or beginning of the working day and a host of other data for issuing individual instructions.</i>  <i>Thus, instead of warnings about the traffic jam ahead and tips on its detour, we will be able to prevent traffic congestion and make it easier for everyone to drive</i> , ‚Äù- J. K. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPredicting the situation‚Äù is a tempting affair, but will IBM cope with this noble mission, albeit in five years? <br><br><h5>  5. <b>Combining information flows</b> </h5><br>  John Cohn said that IBM wants to combine a variety of warning systems, starting with seismographs and ending with an alarm clock, into one gadget.  Will it be a cell phone, a smartphone, a tablet, a TV, or a holographic miracle clock rolled into a roll, time will tell.  Or maybe implants?  Pay attention to his last words: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>It is necessary to integrate information flows.</i>  <i>All modern gadgets - laptops, camera phones, cars - collect data that alerts habitat, traffic, seismic activity.</i>  <i>Your cell phone will signal an earthquake and tsunami, possibly before the corresponding instruments detect them.</i>  <i>Together, we are a cyber network of citizens of the planet.</i>  <i>How can you leave her without attention?</i>  "- J. K. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112312/</a></p>
