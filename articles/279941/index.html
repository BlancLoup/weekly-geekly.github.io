  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The market for virtual PBX and ITooLabs. Results of 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year was rich in events in the telecom industry and in the life of our company.  Summing up at the end of March is probably not quite usual, but we needed some time to aggregate all the results.  Finally, we were able to prepare an interesting infographic for telecom operators, where we talk about our main successes and reveal the analytics of the Virtual PBX market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64a/527/059/64a527059ac341c081048cf6dd24a416.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the achievements.  2015 has become a landmark for us: our partners have made us the best-selling <a href="http://itoolabs.com/">Virtual PBX platform</a> among vendors!  Yes, and the number of operators has almost doubled.  Moreover, a significant inflow was given by regional operators - yet in the regions cloud services are still poorly developed.  Interestingly, all operators had some kind of a VATS solution (their own or from a vendor), but it sold poorly - users did not understand anything, VATS did not solve their business problems.  With whatever we were not compared, the test sales of our VATS exceeded all expectations.  It‚Äôs still one thing to buy WATS from the vendor ‚Äúto the heap‚Äù, another thing is to choose thoughtfully and with an eye on real customers. <br><br>  Another interesting thing to note is the interest in our platform abroad.  We participated in several international conferences and concluded a number of treaties.  More than a quarter of the revenue we brought exactly foreign sales, but we look forward to a significant increase in 2016.  Of course, the weakening of the ruble played a role here.  Here it is, the correct import substitution - export.

In 2016, we open at least 2 new directions, which will be discussed soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/75d/169/ad975d169e624137a9ad8b423cbc1388.png"><br><br>  There is no need to say again that each operator should have a Virtual PBX and preferably on our platform. :) As for sales, the crisis 2015 for the VATS market has become the most successful.  Yes, we can confirm the outflow correlation with Rosstat data, small business began to shut down more often, but our inflow increased.  Nevertheless, the end customer has few alternatives: the cost of iron solutions has doubled, and a small business cannot keep a staff of its own telephone operator.  We also associate such a serious growth with the development of the functionality of our platform: we rolled out a new interface, announced new integrations and opportunities, and also taught salespeople of operators how to sell correctly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d57/8a4/110/d578a41100cb4153b828f87c2510062c.png"><br><br>  It is very interesting that by the end of 2015, the average client has become a bit bigger.  This is again connected with the growing trust of medium and large companies (from 30 employees) to cloud services.  It was rather unexpected to find that we have become a serious substitute for foreign softswitches in large companies.  Therefore, this year we will not be able to ignore the wishes of large clients and call centers.  Separately, it is worth noting the incredible popularity of advanced functionality of Virtual PBX.  Over 40% of customers pay operators more for options that help solve their business problems. <br><br>  It would also be worth adding about the real FMC boom.  We finally made a full-fledged FMC in our platform and even a separate interface for working with SIM cards.  Users respond very well to this and in December already every fourth account was added along with the SIM card.  There is no problem to implement ITC-based FMC / MVNO very quickly.  We will tell about it in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/166/c78/2b8/166c782b852d4a6e9783192b14d13ec5.png"><br><br>  The largest project of the year in terms of VAS services was the introduction of our voice mail platform into the network of one of the largest operators in Southeast Asia.  Today, over 70 million subscribers use it, and at the peak, as many as 1,500 calls per second! <br><br>  Even a funny story happened here.  The CEO of this Asian operator was very pleased with our work on replacing the old voice mail platform and decided to better promote its service in the country, showing it as an advantage over the operators (yes, they really actively use voice mail there!).  He came up with the following scheme: if you call a subscriber of this operator and you dial the voice mail for the first time, he welcomes the client: ‚ÄúHello!  I am the CEO of this beautiful operator.  Welcome to the best voicemail of the country.  Leave your message after the signal and I guarantee that we will deliver it to your comrade. ‚ÄùOnly in melodious Asian language.  You would know how it affected sales and the popularity of the service!  Well, we consider these words as an assessment of their work.  By the way, be sure to tell about this case in more detail, but everything has its time. <br><br>  From professional services, we note confident development of the project on DPI for telecom operators and the development of functionality for large companies and call centers.  Most often it is the integration of various softswitches with different CRM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/a7c/881/71ca7c881fd147a38bc924cd67031441.png"><br><br>  Well, some interesting facts related to 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cd/ed6/bdd/8cded6bdd80d44bdb7c16ac00b281b54.png"><br><br>  That was our 2015th.  Soon - new articles on current projects, as well as the upcoming update of <a href="http://itoolabs.com/">our site</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279941/</a></p>
