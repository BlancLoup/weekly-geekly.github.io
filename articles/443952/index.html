The authors are Senator Lyudmila Bokova, Senator Andrei Klishas and Deputy Andrei Lugovoi. <br><br>  For the second reading a number of amendments were prepared for the document, including one very important.  The costs of communication operators for the purchase and maintenance of equipment <b>will be reimbursed from the budget</b> .  This was <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/16/03/2019/5c8930709a7947b028b88868">told by</a> one of the authors of the bill, Senator Lyudmila Bokova. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, the bill <a href="http://sozd.parliament.gov.ru/bill/608767-7">number 608767-7</a> imposes new obligations on telecom operators and owners of traffic exchange points and gives additional powers to Roskomnadzor.

      In particular, telecom operators are obliged to: <br><br><ol><li>  Follow the routing rules established by Roskomnadzor. </li><li>  Correct routing as requested by Roskomnadzor. </li><li>  When resolving domain names, use software and hardware approved by Roskomnadzor, as well as the national domain name system. </li><li>  Use only traffic exchange points from the traffic exchange registry. </li><li>  To promptly inform Roskomnadzor about their network addresses, telecommunication message routes, software and hardware tools used to resolve domain names and communication network infrastructure. </li></ol><br>  Article 66.1 of the Law "On Communications" is proposed to be added, including the following paragraph: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the event of threats to the integrity, stability and security of functioning on the territory of the Russian Federation of the Internet and public communication networks, the public <b>communication network of the</b> federal executive body responsible for monitoring and supervising the media can be <b>centralized</b> , communications, information technology and communications, in a manner determined by the Government of the Russian Federation, including, inter alia, measures to eliminate  NIJ Threat integrity, stability and safety of the territory of the Russian Federation, the network '' internet 'and public communication networks. <br>  ... <br>  Centralized management of a public telecommunications network is carried out by managing technical means to counter threats and (or) by transmitting binding instructions to telecom operators, owners or owners of technological communication networks, as well as to other persons having an autonomous system number. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  As stated in the explanatory note, ‚Äúthe draft federal law has been prepared taking into account the aggressive nature of the US National Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity Strategy adopted in September 2018‚Äù. <br><br>  In December, the working group ‚ÄúSvyaz and IT‚Äù of the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434292/">prepared a response</a> to the text of the draft law.  According to experts, only one-time costs can reach 25 billion rubles.  for research and development work, the creation and maintenance of a registry of traffic exchange points, the expansion of staff under Roscomnadzor‚Äôs structures and the conduct of exercises.  In addition, compensation will be required for telecom operators in the event of network disruptions, the risk of which is estimated by industry participants as high.  They should be provided in the federal budget at the level of up to 10% of the market volume, that is 134 billion rubles.  in year. <br><br>  Initially it was assumed that the introduction of the law does not require budgetary funds.  But it soon became clear that this is not the case.  This year, the Russian government published a review of the bill criticizing the financial and economic justification, which is contained in the accompanying note to it.  The criticism is caused by the fact that the financial and economic rationale ‚Äúdid not define the sources and the order of execution of the new type of expenditure commitments‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor the time being, we know one thing - that such [budget] funds will be required, and at present the costs are being estimated.  Understandably, we need to present them also in dynamics.  Because any control systems, protection systems are linked, among other things, to the load - and to the load dynamics and network capacity, and it is growing almost explosively now, and every year there is a very significant increase in traffic and power demand, ‚Äùthe Vice Chairman <a href="https://ria.ru/20190205/1550426499.html">said</a> on February 5 Government of the Russian Federation Maxim Akimov. <br><br>  And now we see how the authors solve the problem.  If they had initially declared that the bill would require significant budget expenditures, the document could be expanded in the economic committee (theoretically) - it would not have reached the State Duma at all.  But they said that isolating Runet would not require any budget expenditures.  The bill was passed on first reading.  And now the authors are amending that this initiative will still be funded from the budget. <br><br>  Compensation from the budget is ‚Äúthe only option,‚Äù explained Senator Bokova.  Otherwise, telecom operators will have to incur additional costs.  ‚ÄúSince the technical equipment planned for installation will be purchased at the expense of the budget, the maintenance of these devices should also be compensated from the budget,‚Äù she said. <br><br><h4>  Exemption from liability </h4><br>  Another amendment concerns the release of providers from responsibility to customers if the network has experienced failures due to the work of "special means to counter threats." <br><br>  Exemption from liability is provided in the bill initially.  But it was not clear who would then compensate for the possible losses of users.  Senator Bokova proposes that these costs be borne by the state budget.  According to her, if the possibility of compensation for losses at the expense of the state is provided for, ‚Äúofficials will think before making a decision on interfering with the network‚Äù. <br><br>  "Before turning on the switch - think ten times how it will affect the networks, whether sensitive services will suffer - telehealth, payments, data transfer, where it happens via the Internet," said the senator. <br><br>  According to the last words of the senator (about the breaker), one can make an assumption that the system is introduced not for protective, but for active actions by the authorities. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443952/</a></p>
