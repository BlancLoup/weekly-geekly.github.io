Now, our foundation, after nearly a year of reviews, has received official status (you can find documentation on the website <a href="http://www.radidobra.ru/">www.radidobra.ru</a> ).  Therefore, we can now turn to the public - in this case, to you, the community of free professionals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>To begin, briefly outline the essence of our problem, and what methods we are going to solve it.</b>

      At the moment in Russia there is an extremely difficult situation with charity.  Especially on the Internet.  Each of us received letters of help supported by documents and photographs, detailed descriptions of problems.  But three of the four cases are fraudsters who copy data from real sites and issue their bills to raise funds. <br><br>  Because of this, the credibility of the information provided by charities falls.  Only 6% of Russians participate in charity through official organizations.  This is critically low.  However, about 30% of Russians in one way or another gave money to those in need if they personally encountered their problems.  It turns out that a private initiative is five times more effective.  But it is clear that civil charity is, as a rule, an occasional emotional outburst.  And, unfortunately, this way it is impossible to systematically help all (or at least a noticeable part) of the suffering.  Think about it, what is the probability that a person faced with a problem requiring the collection of considerable funds will meet personally with the necessary number of people?  Negligible. <br><br>  Of course, there are charity funds from large organizations, state funds, etc., which could solve this problem.  But it‚Äôs like with the construction of roads: billions of budgets are allocated, and how many eventually reach the roads - we all know perfectly well.  Information about finances is usually limited or completely closed.  At the same time, corporate charity in Russia is 70%!  That is, most of the funds can not be analyzed or verified. <br><br>  <i>For comparison.</i>  <i>In America, private donations make up more than 90% of all donations ($ 270 billion a year), unlike Russia, where the total amount of donations is $ 3 billion a year.</i>  <i>In this case, we note that the welfare of citizens does not affect the total percentage of donating.</i>  <i>For example, the highest level of activity in charity events is registered in Malta (far from the richest country).</i>  <i>More than 83% (!) Of the Maltese at least once participated in charity events.</i> <br><br>  Another problem of Russian charity.  It is often demonstrative "for show".  It happens this way: large companies are obliged to bear "civil liability", then spend certain amounts on charity or social programs.  As a result, public events are held, which are conveniently inserted into the statements (for example, the arrival of artists to children with cancer).  It is beautiful, it is expensive and the necessary amounts are spent.  But ... as a rule, it is completely useless. <br>  Of course, we are not talking about all the funds, there are organizations that provide strong support to those in need.  For example, Rusfond, Advita, etc.  But this is just a small part.  And of course, alone, they are not able to fill the huge lack of attention to existing problems. <br><br>  <i>As a result, we come to the conclusion that the most effective in our state can be civil charity, which exists according to the principle ‚ÄúI personally see who I help and know what the result is‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  <b>So, our tasks.</b> <br><br>  1) Bring individual donors to people in need.  That is to increase the likelihood that a person who has a problem will meet as many people as possible who can help. <br>  2) Increase the credibility of the problems published on the Internet (and therefore make it a controlled expenditure of funds). <br>  3) Facilitate the donation process via the Internet. <br><br>  Our system allows us to attract the maximum number of interested people to each problem.  It is to attract, and not just to distribute a link to another page with a petition.  The personal participation of volunteers in our project allows us to consider each human problem as a task that needs to be solved together.  The detailed mechanism is fully described in the booklet on the site of our foundation.  In addition, we have thought through a system of complete reporting and certification of every donation.  Any event on the site has a report that is available to any visitor. <br><br>  <b>We implement three key ideas on the site:</b> <br><br>  1. I see who I help <br>  2. I can check the accuracy of the information <br>  3. I get feedback on how my involvement changed this issue. <br><br>  <b>Our goal is to increase the percentage of private donations to 30% and transform chaotic, emotional actions into well-organized help for solving specific problems.</b> <br><br>  At the moment we exist solely due to the personal enthusiasm of the project participants.  And we are looking for like-minded people.  We do not ask for money, the essence of our system is precisely that it is possible to help not financially, but simply with our participation.  We urgently need the help of professionals.  Designers, translators and copywriters are urgently needed now.  If you feel that this is close to you - we will be very happy to help. <br><br>  <i>In addition, when contacting different institutions, statistics are very important to us: the number of applications for alpha accounts, as an indicator of the relevance of the problem and the response from the potential audience.</i>  <i>You can get an alpha account on our website via the link <a href="http://radidobra.ru/form.php">radidobra.ru/form.php</a></i> <br><br>  In general - help than you can. <br>  Thank you so much! <br><br>  <b><a href="http://radidobra.ru/booklet_web.pdf">Download the booklet to PDF</a></b> <br><img src="http://radidobra.ru/img/booklet.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132697/</a></p>
