  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY: dumbbells as a way to store DVDs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At my house, like most of those present here, a bunch of CDs and DVDs are lying around.  A sort of suitcase without a handle - and to store without confusion, and throw a pity.  Some backups, bootable and live CDs, old toys (which I‚Äôm going to play for ten years, just tackle things), a couple of dozen music albums (long established in the player).  In general, not for me to tell you. <br><br>  All this stuff, not only that takes place, so also dust collects.  But throw, again, hands do not rise.  Therefore, when the eighth of March loomed on the horizon, I decided to combine business with pleasure - to give my wife an unusual gift, and free up some space from the CD deposits. <br><br>  <b>So the idea</b> .  My wife does exercises in the morning.  During the classes she uses small dumbbells of 2-3 kg each (I don‚Äôt know why, but in the women's fitness small weights are used).  In general, I thought, why not hang dumb-bells with discs?  Weigh them appropriately.  Let the benefits bring, than idle dust.  And simply, it should turn out funny.

      <b>UPD: habrasoosedi, if you are minus, then you can at least explain why?</b>  <b>This is a joke, is it really incomprehensible?</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5c/849/740/a5c84974098df605ca892f0c36bd2041.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will say right away that the idea is not quite original and was peeped <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/18499/zhenskie-ganteli-kak-mesto-hraniya-cd-i-dvd/">here</a> .  It matured for more than a year and a half, and then modified a little.  But that, so to speak, is the lyrics.  And now let's go. <br><br>  The basis was to take the old Soviet dumbbells with the ability to fasten pancakes.  Removed all the extra drives and left only pancakes with threaded caps.  Two compartments of 25 blanks are taken as compartments for the discs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f49/da6/434/f49da6434c01f99d8b5e147d6acfd8ca.jpg"><br><br>  The cans had a spindle on which the discs were held.  After that, the hole is slightly widened with a knife and sub-aligned files.  There is also a hole on the lid itself, but it didn‚Äôt take anything to expand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e8/d0a/0c6/4e8d0a0c68270a0728ad2b263e618d33.jpg"><br><br>  Drives climbed like a glove.  Those.  if the thread is thicker even half a millimeter, the idea would not have worked.  By the way, an interesting point.  My brother and I have a set of such dumbbells, once donated by my parents.  So, he climbs drives, but I do not.  So the party is different from the party and my brother and I just exchanged sets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/142/548/28f/14254828facfaeb9b5bfeb7e1b78ff06.jpg"><br><br>  Now about the scales.  One disk weighs from 14 to 16 grams.  In other words, a bank of 25 disks weighs 375-400 grams + the weight of the can itself (about 50 grams).  Together pulls on 450 grams (almost 0.5 kg).  Considering that the dumbbell itself with a hand and two pancakes-zags, weighs 1900 grams (somehow they did not reach), in total, each shell weighs from 2.5 to 2.8 kg - depending on how many disks to put, and boxing for 10 or 25 disks to use.  So it turned out almost exactly :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56b/943/9ac/56b9439ac7ee1cc4ae0fd0cb3866c4ea.jpg"><br><br>  Just in case, I want to say that I had another, normal gift.  The dumbbells were a pleasant joke, an introduction to the main surprise.  But my wife really liked this one, and even more than the main one.  It cannot be said that she uses it constantly (more than a month has passed since March 8), but she periodically takes out these dumbbells to raise our spirits.  I think it was worth it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177595/</a></p>
