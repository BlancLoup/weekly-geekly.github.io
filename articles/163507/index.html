  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Print out the popcorn, it's time for a movie</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Veeam ONE offers the most significant opportunities for administrators of the virtual environment to build reports and monitor both virtual infrastructure and backup infrastructure. <br><br>  When Veeam ONE version 6.5 was released last month, it contained a lot of innovations and improvements.  Of the most notable, we added advanced monitoring, reporting and predictive resource utilization for the backup infrastructure.  Today we want to tell about one interesting report, which, perhaps, is not immediately noticeable in the product - <b>Infrastructure Growth report</b> , which we ‚Äúhid‚Äù in the <b>Offline report pack</b> .  Designed for Adobe Flash, this report is like a movie about your virtual environment, where you can watch events such as creating clusters, adding hosts, and moving or deleting virtual machines. <br><br>  Your virtual environment is dynamic.  New virtual machines (VMs) are created temporarily, others are launched into the work environment on an ongoing basis.  Servers are being replaced, new equipment is being added, forcing you to constantly monitor changes and periodically rebalance your virtual environment.

      How wonderful would it be if you had an easy way to generate an image of your changing virtual environment?  You could see which VMs are installed among your hosts and check the growth of different clusters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With the Infrastructure Growth report for Veeam ONE, you get the opportunity to do so.  Designed for Adobe Flash, this report allows you to see what is happening in your environment, for example, adding, moving or deleting clusters, hosts or VMs.  This report even allows you to filter out VMs that are not running, so the image you see accurately reflects what is actually happening in your virtual environment. <br><br>  Just pick a moment in time, sit back and watch.  Maybe you would like to return to some point in time, for example, by the time the host crashes and see what happened to the VM after it was moved to other hosts or even reinstalled to a new hardware.  And how wonderful it would be to show the management how you avoided a catastrophe and finally solved the problem. <br><br>  An example of a report that we created in one of our R &amp; D laboratories: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuCqLR_bvNU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  True, a report like this is not very interesting when you first install Veeam ONE, because by that time the data about your infrastructure is just starting to be collected, and the report needs data in a historical perspective.  However, about a month later, the ‚Äúcinema‚Äù becomes more substantial! .. And as a bonus to our regular customers: despite the fact that this report is new and appeared in only 6.5, we started collecting data for it in the product database from the moment of Veeam ONE 6.0, (its release took place in April of this year).  Thus, if you are one of our many customers who have already installed 6.0, you can already now see a ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù about your infrastructure. <br><br>  The Infrastructure Growth report is available in both Veeam ONE editions - paid and free. <br><br>  If you have not had time to try Veeam ONE, you can view the 30-day <a href="http://www.veeam.com/virtualization-management-one-solution.html">trial version</a> , or the <a href="http://www.veeam.com/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free.html">free version of the product</a> (with some functional limitations). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163507/</a></p>
