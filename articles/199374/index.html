      I foresee a world full of centers of a unique community in which each person is helped to explore the world and do what he likes.  Centers where everyone is inspired by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa real education or who seeks to learn in order to live the life he wants to live.  Centers where everyone supports this community for its further prosperity.  That's what the Hackspace community means.  And it is already flourishing all over the planet. <br><br>  How do I know about this? <br><br>  Yes, because this is the life I live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every night for a whole year.  Over the past 63 months, more than 1,100 Hackspaces have appeared around the world.  Unnoticed, out of nowhere and in strange and unexpected places. <br><br>  What's going on here?  Why do they appear? <br><br>  The fact is that the Hackspace community provides two important and deep universal needs, two needs that have been so much feared for so long: <b>community</b> and <b>creative expression</b> . <br><br>  We all develop as a species on the planet in order to survive in a hectic environment, supporting each other in society.  We need a society.  This is built into our DNA.  Earlier in society, we got together to do cool things and share them, and now we just buy everything.  But this does not mean that we do not need to create, because the drive of creativity lies in our DNA.  Hackspace members provide this magical combination: creative expression plus community.  They mix them up so that dreams turn into reality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hackspace is a real-life physical space, such as a store center in Los Angeles or a warehouse in Detroit, where people support each other in research and things they like thanks to hacking.  Hacking is when you take something that really exists, improve it and share it.  Since everything, even the most modern, can be improved, we can hack everything, not only computers and electronics, but also art, craft, math, science.  You can ‚Äúhack‚Äù yourself, and society, and the planet.  We can do everything. <br><br>  The decisions we make have a big impact on our lives.  I began to live a small and depressed child, but now I am a crazy designer of jet planes who likes his life!  I began this transformation by making good and bad decisions.  I learned from my mistakes and successes, studied and grew with all my might, and eventually shared it.  That's what hacking means, and it works!  Even if it was not so easy.  Even if it is not easy now.  But it's worth it.  Ultimately, this allowed me to do what I love, for example, turning off televisions in public places.  I invented a similar key chain, which does it, and I earn money from it.  Life is a strange thing. <br><br>  But this project led me to the first Hackspace conference.  Imagine a world in which, by contrast, people do what they love.  He is incredibly tall.  This was my experience at the first Hackspace conference.  I did not want it to end, but, like all conferences, it came to an end.  I wanted more, and I did it.  It happened six months later in the ‚ÄúCamp of Chaos Communication 2007‚Äù, in a huge camp near Berlin.  No one then knew this, but it became the foundation of the Hackspace movement.  By that time, there were only 50 hackspeys, mostly from Germany.  But in this camp there was everything: art, craft, technology, and lasers, but most importantly, people sharing their projects.  They teach, learn, and share - a great supportive community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66b/09e/5e6/66b09e5e6918f704b7375c3dc507b460.jpg"><br><br>  There were wonderful speeches and presentations.  One speech particularly touched me.  Several German hackers talked about how to create their own Hackspace community.  It was so obvious.  No one had to wait for the next conference.  We could have such energy all day, all night, all year, and also Hackerspace in my hometown.  I was not the only one who was inspired by this idea.  A company of children from North America gathered and decided that we will create this community when we get home.  We did it. <br><br>  We did it the way every Hackspace is being created now: you imagine the culture of which you want to be a part;  you create it, and it attracts many people;  you choose a name, website, logo and business cards;  you advertise the community and you can not stop talking about it;  you meet every Thursday and discuss the details of future projects, and then find a place.  It worked for us in Neusbridge, created in San Francisco.  We talked about this for a year and found a place.  Everyone was so excited, because we collected $ 12,000 for rent in 24 hours and have never been in debt since that time.  Over the next weeks, we raised money for our own kitchen, our machine shop with modern equipment.  We have a lot of sewing machines, tables, lamps. <br><br>  As a result, we were joined by wonderful people with cool projects.  They taught, taught and shared.  We have a vibrant community.  Also, we started to appear in parallel in other parts of North America, and in collaboration with the Hackspaces in Europe, we created the site hackerspace.com, which served as an example for the rest of the world, after which many similar communities appeared all over the planet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7a/623/548/f7a6235481a99a9d248039399ee9dd43.jpg"><br><br>  And from that time, wherever I was, I visited local Hackspaces.  If they wanted, then I did what I love - I taught them how to solder and how to do cool things thanks to electronics.  It seems to me that it is very fun for people of any age and skill level.  That was my way of sharing what you love to develop a community.  Here is a photo of me in a workshop in a local Hackspace in Brussels.  In general, there are several of these companies in this city, so ask. <br><br>  I want to share with you the projects that were created in Hackspaces.  They all came from people who do what they love.  These projects are open source or open source, so you can share and improve them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08a/1d4/52d/08a1d452dc8be08f347314f83ae04f00.jpg"><br><br>  I saw a similar project in Berlin before attending my first conference, Hackspace.  I wanted to know what they are doing there.  This project has forever fascinated me.  The government of the city of Berlin gave access to this building for the computer club in which the company Hackerspace is located.  Hackspace participants installed bright lighting in each window and connected it to a computer to turn the building into a huge display.  They posted a special program to operate these windows on the Internet, and each person could reprogram it, thus changing the image on the building.  It all started with simple images, and then there were animations and moving text.  And then two people were able to play ping-pong "right on the building."  This is a great public art! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/b14/bda/ae7b14bdad7c6e83a1b982c5ed9ef927.jpg"><br><br>  Several hackspacers from Neusbridge decided that it would be cool to get a picture of the Earth.  It took only $ 250 and 6 weeks to launch a balloon into space and get a picture.  They filmed it all on video and posted it on the Internet, and after hundreds of launches in other Hackspaces, simple schoolchildren could do it.  They could show this project at school science fairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a6/86f/021/5a686f021772a2454b75d98a34059257.jpg"><br><br>  This led to the space program Hackerspace, a very ambitious goal: ‚ÄúHackerspace on the Moon by 2023?‚Äù.  Can we do this?  It does not matter.  Think about what you can learn in the course of this project, as happened after the first space program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14e/1a4/b55/14e1a4b556c9c72ebd3b97457bbce3fd.jpg"><br><br>  MakerBot is a 3D printer.  It was invented by only one person from New York, who thought it would be cool to create a machine that could make objects.  This has led to a huge company creating 3D printers that can print any kind of plastic.  They have a website where you can download any object you want to print.  This printer is so cheap that it is in almost every Hackspace.  Some of these companies have laser [3D] printers, even laser cutters.  These are very complex machines, on which you can cut objects with incredible precision.  But the people who created such a robot in Philadelphia decided that business cards could be made by engraving advertising right on pieces of meat.  Many companies liked this, so hackspacers do similar projects for them. <br><br>  Here is another interesting thing.  The guys from Artisan's Asylum in Boston decided that it would be cool to ride a robot.  This robot weighs 1,800 pounds [approximately 816 kilograms].  He is so big that he can walk on the roofs of cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/571/0d2/698/5710d2698adbd3008c00fca8acce18ae.jpg"><br><br>  Last year, after the Fukushima incident, everyone was disappointed by the lack of information from the Japanese government.  Therefore, Tokyo hackspacers made homemade Geiger counters.  They could distribute them so that each resident could calculate the amount of radiation in a certain area.  The problem was that no one knew what level of radiation was in the normal range.  That is why hackspacers from Los Angeles made similar Geiger counters and distributed them to city residents, in order to put the results in an Internet database where you can see the approximate level of radiation.  We hope that this database will always work online.  This is urban science in action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/529/f59/a28529f5971a680a0b5abfc53e0bb722.jpg"><br><br>  Hackspace also innovates traditional things that are considered expensive, and makes counterparts that cost much less and are more affordable.  We will talk about it later.  BioCurious is the biological Hackspace in San Francisco, where people invented OpenPCR.  This PCR machine (poly dimensional chain reaction), accessible to all, allows you to duplicate your DNA on a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/afc/ab5/d69afcab5f515dfb332a020ee8b4c00e.jpg"><br><br>  And in conclusion, I would like to talk about Code Hero from Neusbridge.  This is a cool computer game with a kind of graphics, available for people of all ages.  You can not only play it, but also make your own game. <br><br>  This is only a very small part of those projects that were created in the Hackspace communities by people who do what they love. <br><br>  Hackspaces are also sources of good things that can improve both your life and the lives of people around the world. <br><br>  I want to especially note two such phenomena: <br><br>  The first is that <b>there is real education</b> in the Hackspace communities.  While our bureaucratic education continues to disappoint us, the Hackspaces fill this void with people who teach, because they like to teach, people who learn, because they like to learn.  Hackspaces are designed to help you live the life you want to live. <br><br>  The second point is that the private economy is developing in the Hackspace communities.  Hackspace supports everyone in research and helps people do what they like.  Think about it: if you do what you love, then it is likely that someone else will like it, and in a capitalist society, the situation is that if someone likes what you do, they will pay you for that!  Many companies have flourished because of this, including mine.  If your company is developing and if you need help, then you can hire people from the local community.  This will create a private economy that fits all. <br><br>  The future of the economy must be creative, and <b>Hackspace is a great place to develop your creativity</b> . <br><br>  I hope that you have already seen that Hackspace is cool.  And I hope you want to know where they are.  They may be close to you.  Just look on the internet and find it.  If there is not a single Hackspace, then organize it!  This is the only way to develop a community.  People will love it if you create it.  Get started! <br><br>  Your city needs Hackspace!  Unable to create it right or wrong.  <b>Create it the way you want</b> , because it can be done in different ways. <br><br>  I will give you one example that is close to me.  We created Neusbridge.  This is a non-profit community in which decisions are made in concert.  We have only one rule: be kind to each other.  Everyone is welcome, people of any age.  You do not have to be a member of the community to do anything at Neusbridge, study there or teach, use tools.  You don‚Äôt even need to be in our community to get the key from Neusbridge.  I have a few keys with me.  If someone wants, then you can take it.  Take it!  I seriously tell you that we will welcome you in Neusbridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8e/c18/d39/b8ec18d39eb70aed17a7672cb541c369.jpg"><br><br>  And wherever you go, check to see if there is a Hackspace nearby.  On the screen, you see a map with 1100 Hackspaces around the world on hackerspace.org. <br><br>  We invite you. <br><br>  Get new friends, explore and create a community that you like.  We all need a society to flourish in the world.  The world is counting on us.  In Hackspace you get support, you can do what you love.  If we choose what we love, our life becomes better.  If we share this with the others, then the lives of all those around us become better.  If enough people support this, then the world will be better.  It depends on you and only on you. <br><br>  You choose how you spend your time in this world.  Please make the right choice. <br><br><h4>  <b>From the editor</b> </h4><br><br>  I want to thank Maxim Kalinichenko, who completed the translation (1st year student of the Department of Linguistics and Professional Communication in Foreign Languages, SPU UrFU). <br><br>  I asked him to tell him about his impressions, and this is what he replied: <br><br><blockquote>  Thank you for such an interesting job!  The talk about Hackspace was exciting, especially given that Mitch Altman himself was talking about everything with love for his work.  In fact, it's nice to see people enjoying their work. <br><br>  There were not many difficulties.  Basically - some momentum, which was hard to adequately reproduce in Russian.  It was my first full translation from the video, so it was not very easy at first, but it was only a temporary difficulty.  I must say that I really liked this kind of translation, as it is very interesting to translate text that is read emotionally. </blockquote><br><br>  I would also like to express my gratitude for the translation into Russian and the creation of subtitles for Oleksandr Ostapenko from Kiev Hackspace.  In addition to translation, he made subtitles, and this is very hard work!  You can <a href="http://www.hackerspace.com.ua/post/25992">see the</a> result of his work <a href="http://www.hackerspace.com.ua/post/25992">here</a> . <br><br>  It so happened that the transfers were carried out independently and almost in parallel - but this means that interest in the Hackspace movement is increasing. <br><br>  Original video: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWkiX7R1-kaY">The Hackerspace Movement: Mitch Altman at TEDxBrussels</a> <br><br>  This translation is posted on <a href="https://github.com/robotclass/translations/tree/master/mitch-altman-the-hackerspace-movement">github</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199374/</a></p>
