  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúKitchen is a small hosting company‚Äù - a replica</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Read recently this article on Habr√© <a href="http://ur6imf.habrahabr.ru/blog/96523/">Kitchen a small hosting company</a> .  I liked the article very much and I am ready to subscribe to every word of the author himself.  But still, after reading the article, there is a feeling of incompleteness.  The fact is that the author has considered only one of the possible schemes for creating a ‚Äúsmall hosting company‚Äù.  I would like in this article to consider another possible scenario for the creation and development of a hosting company, namely a company based on so-called reseller hosting. <br><br>  As everyone knows, opening a reseller account in most hosting companies means that you pay the company the Nth sum of money for a certain number of megabytes on their server, the allowed number of domains, MySQL, FTP accounts, mail, and so on ... Next "happy" the reseller, as in the case of the server, divides the available space and everything else into tariffs and silently saying ‚Äúcatch a big and small fish‚Äù brings all this to the market.  In this case, as a rule, those support completely falls on the shoulders of the reseller.  "Maternal" hosting company does not even know about the presence of customers of the reseller, so it‚Äôs useless to ask for help from her, the customer of the reseller.  This means that, as in the case of the server, in the absence of payments from the reseller, the hosting company cuts down everyone and everyone who was involved in an unscrupulous reseller. <br><br>  But this does not mean that all start-up hosting companies follow this reseller scheme.  There is a very important point is the correct choice of the "parent" hosting company.  I'll tell you on the example of the company <a href="http://yeaphost.com/">YeapHost.com</a> , which I represent.  Having the experience of creating numerous Internet sites, and constantly using the services of Russian hosting companies, it was decided to purchase a reseller account to host all of their projects, and the sale of unclaimed resources, to beat off some of the money.  When there was a question about choosing a hosting provider, we realized that none of the Russian hosting companies could satisfy our requirements, which included price-performance ratio, adequate support service, availability, reselling system itself, and so on ... Then we began to select among those behind the ‚Äúiron curtain‚Äù, choosing one English company.  First of all, our attention was attracted by the availability of sites hosted on their servers ( <a href="http://just-ping.com/index.php%3Fvh%3Dyeaphost.com%26c%3D%26s%3Dping%2521">just-ping.com</a> ), secondly, the fact that the reseller‚Äôs client is visible to the ‚Äúparent‚Äù hosting company, which means that support is available to them, and that in the event of a reseller bankruptcy, customers will not be left with nothing.

      <br>
      What, then, is our advantage, and why should the client give preference to <a href="http://yeaphost.com/">YeapHost.com,</a> while it might as well become a direct client of the ‚Äúparent‚Äù company host?  To begin with, we provide Russian-language support.  Secondly, our tariffs are different from what the ‚Äúparent‚Äù hosting company offers, and are focused on the needs of the Russian Internet.  Thirdly, webmoney payment system, convenient for ru-neta, and not foreign PayPal or bank cards. <br><br>  So, the initial costs of $ 150 cited in the article to which I referred at the beginning can be used more efficiently: advertising, customer support, and this means that the influx of customers is greater. <br><br>  I invite everyone to test our hosting.  For these purposes, the <a href="http://yeaphost.com/node/7">Test</a> was created.  Let's listen to any criticism. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that hosting is really a troublesome business, but ‚ÄúOnly a person will manage the road‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103136/</a></p>
