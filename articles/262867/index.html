Who has won?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/401/4e3/07f4014e3ce84d29bdeb543126f8c3f7.jpg"><br><br>  Last weekend, July 11 and 12, 2015, the Russian stage of the world's largest hackathon, AngelHack Moscow, took place.  The event brought together more than 200 programmers, designers and authors of ideas, who presented to the Russian and American experts 40 developed application prototypes from scratch in 5 nominations.  The winner of the main nomination - the House Keeper team - will go to represent Russia in the final AngelHack, which will be held in San Francisco. <br><br>  AngelHack is called the largest and most diversified global hackathon.  One of the objectives of the event is to help the international technology community to build ties with Silicon Valley.  And in Russia, in Moscow, this competition of minds is being held for the second time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The partners of AngelHack Moscow 2015 were: IBM, KORUS Consulting CIS, Microsoft, Mail.Ru Group, Clusterpoint, Amazon, Branch.  IBM as one of the tasks for developers proposed to create a web or mobile application that demonstrates the capabilities of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/">IBM Bluemix</a> platform in full.  The team that completed this task received a great prize.

    <h3>  Grand Prize </h3><br>  The main prize - a trip home to AngelHack - was won by the House Keeper team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d85/829/b61/d85829b61974490887bbd3af42b32423.png"><br><br>  House Keeper is a project that manages appliances.  It allows you to search for instructions by taking a picture of the barcode of the device, and also reminds you of the need, for example, to replace the filter in the washing machine and tell you how best to do it. <br><br>  The project developers will take part in the global Demo Day along with the winners AngelHack from all participating countries.  The winning team is also given the opportunity to participate in the HACKcelerator 12-week training program. <br><br><h3>  Winners in local nominations from KORUS Consulting LLC: </h3><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ New services for a tablet-based banking product - CVPicker </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45c/8d9/ffc/45c8d9ffc83a435da8806a2d11f4859a.png"><br><br>  CVPicker is a service designed to simplify the process of hiring a specialist by adding mandatory real-time testing with full monitoring of performance, but without the participation of the interviewer.  After the applicants have submitted a resume and passed the test, the employer can view the results and videos of the test at a convenient pace. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, because it corresponds to the task: to create a banking service that helps improve the efficiency of companies,‚Äù comments Mikhail Malakhov, Director of the Office for Development of Remote Service Channels, Sberbank of Russia.  ‚ÄúFrom our point of view, the CVPicker project will significantly increase the productivity of large and small companies by analyzing remote video surveys, and thereby reduce the time for job seekers by 80%.‚Äù <br>  The team received a certificate for 250,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ Interaction with corporate clients in social networks - Social Rocket </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/742/f95/0b3/742f950b33fe4d18aaa9e9a80d5b4e15.png"><br><br>  Social Rocket is a project for analyzing social networks for mentioning the organization and profile of readers and subscribers of official groups and company pages, which provides in a user-friendly form (with the possibility of ‚Äúhot buttons‚Äù answer) all information about a person and the history of correspondence with him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur decision in this nomination may seem unexpected, but for us it was obvious,‚Äù shared <b>Vladimir Makarov, project director, Sberbank of Russia</b> .  - After all, what does an entrepreneur want?  - So that everything is fast, simple, and that he is not distracted from his main business, including interaction with his partners and clients in social networks.  We were surprised and captivated by the ingenuity and effectiveness of this application for solving these problems. ‚Äù <br><br>  The team received a certificate for 250,000 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Winners in global nominations and prizes: </h3><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ IBM Science and Technology Center staff congratulated the team that presented the best application demonstrating the innovative use of IBM Bluemix services - Leecero </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a09/e80/fcb/a09e80fcbd064447817effaaaf7b32c1.jpg"><br><br>  Leecero is a service for the simple creation of automated channels of interaction with customers using the popular Telegram messenger.  The service allows you to draw a script to communicate with the user and immediately create a bot that will work on this scenario.  Using the capabilities provided by the IBM Bluemix platform services, Leecero extends the capabilities of bots: they parse messages in natural language, can extract date, time, names and addresses from a request, and also perform web requests to third-party services. <br><br>  Leecero was awarded a grant of $ 12,000 (which, under certain conditions, could increase to $ 120,000) under the Program, Entrepreneurship program through which the company will be able to pay for the use of IBM cloud resources. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ The best integration of Branch services in a mobile application - Gym Joy </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51e/58b/7e9/51e58b7e95e243df80ff7f4db95f8764.jpg"><br><br>  Gym Joy is a must-have app for everyone who is engaged in the gym (experienced athletes and beginners, boys and girls).  The application allows you to enter the results of training;  view statistics;  get tips on what to do and with what weight;  rest as much as you need. <br><br>  In addition, the application already has a basic set of exercises for effective training. <br><br>  All participants received a special prize from Amazon Web Services and Clusterpoint.  Microsoft gave all developers a grant to participate in the Microsoft BizSpark program. <br><br>  The event was hosted by <b>Grigori Petrov</b> (Voximplant), well-known in the IT environment. <br><br>  AngelHack hackathon winners were chosen by authoritative and well-known IT industry experts, representatives of venture funds and successful start-up projects: Mikhail Malakhov (Sberbank of Russia), Vladimir Makarov (Sberbank of Russia), Dmitry Kalaev (FRII), Anatoly Sharifulin (AppFollow), Sergey Kulinkovich ( Art. Lebedev Studio), Alexander Vasilyev (Apps4All), Konstantin Vinogradov (Runa Capital), Yuri Chizhov (Red Keds), Maxim Efimov (Redmadrobot). <br><br>  ‚ÄúI was on the other side of the barricade, and now I happened to evaluate projects,‚Äù comments Anatoly Sharifulin, winner of AngelHack Moscow 2013 and founder of AppFollow.  - I hope that the winning team will also vote in a jury for the best projects and ideas in a year or two.  All the teams are great, because they were able to realize in 24 hours the idea that they carried in themselves, maybe for months, and maybe for years.  As planned, House Keeper is very similar to Alerter, an iOS application that sends personalized push notifications.  I would like to wish the guys not to stop at what has been accomplished and turn the hack into a full-fledged project or even a company. ‚Äù <br>  The official website of the event in Russia: <a href="http://angelhack.moscow/">http://angelhack.moscow/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262867/</a></p>
