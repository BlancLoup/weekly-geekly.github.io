  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work with OSM under Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The project <a href="http://www.osm.org/" title="Openstreetmap">OpenStreetMap</a> involves the creation by the community of freely distributed map data using the means of the free software.  Let's consider what software is offered for editing maps, and as a distribution we take Ubuntu Linux 9.10. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the OSM format is open, there is no restriction on the use of various editors, so you have the opportunity to write your own editor that will satisfy your exact needs.  The most popular editors that are available on desktop computers are: <br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit" title="Poltach">Poltach</a></b> , working in a browser and built on adobe flash technology, <br></li><li>  <b><a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/" title="Josm">JOSM</a></b> , written in Java, <br></li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.merkaartor.org/" title="Merkaartor">Merkaartor</a></b> <br></li></ul> Next, we will consider working with an easy-to-learn, use and at the same time powerful JOSM editor (Java OpenStreetMap editor), which is fully Russified, supports the connection of modules, in the development of which a large number of professionals participate. <br>  JOSM and Merkaartor editors are available to Ubuntu users directly from the "Application Installation Center", but installing in this way you most likely get the old version of the software.  New software versions fix bugs and add functionality, so it would be better to have the latest version of the editor. <br>  For the editor to work, you will need an installed Java package.  To install it, call the terminal window (Applications&gt; Accessories-&gt; Terminal) and type: <br><br> <code>sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre</code> <br> <br>  After pressing the Enter key, the system will ask you for the user's password that you set when installing the operating system, enter it. <br>  Now you can <a href="" title="download the latest version of the editor">download the latest version of the editor</a> and launch it simply by double-clicking the josm-lastest.jar file, but in this case you will not be able to specify additional parameters of the work.  To specify the parameters, you must run the editor from the terminal, or create a button on the desktop.  To do this, right-click on an empty place on the desktop and select "create a launch button ...", enter a name (for example, JOSM), in the "command" line enter: <br><br> <code>java -Xmx512M -jar "../josm-latest.jar"</code> <br> <br>  where <i>"../josmlatelate.jar"</i> is the path to the editor file you downloaded, for example <i>"/ home / user / desktop / josm-latest.jar"</i> , <br>  <i>-Xmx512M</i> - indicating the maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) allocated for Java. <br>  If you use a proxy, you can specify: <br>  <i>-Dhttp.proxyHost =</i> IP address of your proxy server <br>  <i>-Dhttp.proxyPort</i> = proxy port. <br>  And so, everything is prepared to launch the editor and you can do it by double clicking on the launch button we created. <br>  After the first launch, you need to enter the editor settings (F12 key). <br>  Initially, you need to enter your username and password in the connection parameters, as well as add modules at your discretion (in the process, you will understand what you need), but validator modules, which check data before sending them to the server and wmsplugin, which can display satellite images in the substrate are desirable. <br>  What does the work of the mapper consist of in general? <br><ul><li>  Data collection, <br></li><li>  Convert them to the appropriate format, <br></li><li>  Putting them in a common base, <br></li><li>  Formation and use of the map. <br></li></ul>  In order to make data on the map OpenStreetMap, you must first get this data.  A free license implies that all data entered into the database, from which the card is worth, must be free as well, that is, obtained in a license-clean way. <br>  It is forbidden to copy and use data from other cards, even if they are free, the licensing policy of which is contrary to <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_License" title="OSM licenses">the OSM license</a> .  Among those from which it is impossible to copy, there are practically all maps and services existing for Russia on the provision of maps in the Internet.  However, the OSM community has reached an agreement with the Yahoo! Maps service to provide satellite images for drawing on them, but rather detailed, highly detailed images are available for a small number of cities.  The Russian partner of OSM, Kosmosnimki.ru, has provided its images of the territory of Russia for the OSM community. <br>  The clearest data source is GPS tracks from navigation devices and nameplates on homes.  JOSM editor allows you to automate the input of such data. <br>  Moving around the area where you plan to make a map, turn on the recording on your GPS device, take pictures of street name plates.  If there is such an opportunity, then take a picture of the GPS clock, it will help to further calculate the time difference between track points and photos. <br>  Then save the data and transfer them to the computer.  Data must be converted to GPX (GPS Exchange) format, this format is supported by the editor and the OpenStreetMap database.  It should be noted that the server only accepts files with time stamps, in this case, depending on your privacy settings, other users will be able to see your tracks. <br>  If your GPS device records tracks in a different format, then you can use the <a href="http://gebabbel.sourceforge.net/">Gebabbel</a> program, which allows you to convert tracks.  You can install this program directly from the Ubuntu Application Center. <br>  In the left window you add source files, specify their format.  On average, filters are specified, in the right-hand results (GPX), you need to specify the bottom with what data you need to do the work, we are interested in tracks and waypoints.  To convert you need to click the Execute button. <br>  Now launch the JOSM editor and open the GPX file, it will be displayed in the central part of the working screen. <br>  The work area is divided into 5 parts. <br>  The horizontal part at the top is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe menu, basic controls and templates, <br>  The vertical bar on the left is the tool selection area, <br>  The main part is in the middle of the working area, <br>  The columns on the left are the properties and additional parameters area. <br>  The horizontal bar below is the status bar. <br>  In the OSM format, there are several basic objects that you can create, correct, or delete, these are: <br><ul><li>  point, <br></li><li>  line between several points, has direction, <br></li><li>  closed line (polygon), <br></li><li>  A relationship that describes the relationships of other objects (including other relationships). <br></li></ul>  Parameters and their values, so-called tags, can be added to these elements.  So, for example, you need to add a highway tag to a point object (road, parameter) = traffic_signals (traffic light, value), highway = residential can be applied to the road, building = yes (building) and etc. <br>  The peculiarity of the OpenStreetMap project is that all users make edits to one database, therefore, most likely, some data will already exist along your track, they need to be loaded by clicking on the corresponding key of the main menu (down arrow). <br>  After that, using the selection tools, drawing, applying templates make the necessary changes to the map, then you need to check the data for errors and upload the data to the server (the arrow in the vvehr).  If necessary, enter your username and password, as well as a brief description of the edits you made. <br>  Now, after uploading data, you can use the jointly created OpenStreetMap map using a web map at <a href="http://www.osm.org/">www.osm.org</a> , or by installing one of the programs.  The main programs that can use OSM cards are: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.tangogps.org/" title="tangoGPS">tangoGPS</a> , available directly from the application installation center, <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.navit-project.org/" title="Navit-Project">Navit-Project</a> , supports routing, <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.gpsdrive.de/" title="GPS Drive">GpsDrive</a> . </li></ul></div>
