  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to buy on the Internet and not get into the scam network?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The bank card market in Russia is quite young.  For a long period of time, the majority of "plastic" cards issued by Russian banks were so-called "salary" cards issued jointly with organizations and enterprises.  According to experts of such cards in the country about 95% of the total.  Recently, there has been an increase in the issue of credit cards with a revolving credit line, which allows us to speak not only about an increase in demand for bank cards in general, but also about the development of the entire banking sector.  In connection with the increase in the number of cards, the number of fraudulent transactions with their use increases.  In total in the world in 2011, according to various estimates, $ 9 billion was stolen from card accounts.  In Russia, more than 2.3 billion rubles were withdrawn from accounts tied to bank cards in 2011, unauthorized.  At the same time, the amount of the average fraudulent Internet operation amounted to 6 thousand rubles.  In general, in the world the most risky segment in which the majority of illegal operations with bank cards are performed is the Internet.  In Russia, these are fraudulent operations in POS terminals used in retail purchases of goods (58% of the total number of fraudulent transactions using bank cards), ATMs (40%), and this ‚Äúrating‚Äù of the Internet (2%) closes. <br>  Judging by the world practice and the growth of electronic commerce in Russia (an increase of 30% per year), the share of illegal operations using plastic cards on the Internet may increase several times.  How to protect your money when paying online? <br><br><img src="http://www.payu.ru/view/smarty/uploaded_images/120202124946-fraud.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, the majority of online stores in Russia carry out online acquiring of bank cards (payment using a bank card on the Internet) in cooperation with integrator companies that accumulate a number of payment systems, both international (Visa and MasterCard), and Russian (e-wallets: Yandex.Money, QIWI, Dengi@Mail.ru, QIWI, mobile payments and payment by means of terminals). <br>  Few of the Russian companies offering these services can boast of international experience, and only one - a significant share of the e-commerce market in Europe.  PayU, an international payment integrator processing electronic payments for online store customers, is one of the market leaders in Eastern Europe. <br>  Aggregators and banks that provide Internet acquiring services serve as a system for protecting online store customers from fraudulent transactions.  The security system should include the identification of the payer using the latest systems, such as 3D Secure, which allows you to confirm the identity of the buyer using SMS notifications.  This allows you to prevent the purchase with a stolen bank card. <br>  All operations must go through customizable filters and an anti-fraud monitoring system, in the presence of which a specialist of a payment integrator company manually checks the compliance of the filled fields with real information and, if necessary, requests documentary confirmation from the buyer (for example, a passport scan).  Unfortunately, today many companies offering electronic payment processing services for online stores do not have this system.  This leads to the fact that fraudsters can use the data of the cardholder for purchases on the Internet until the cardholder himself notices this.  PayU, having an antifraud monitoring system, for the last two years has reduced the number of fraudulent transactions using bank cards on the Internet to 0.02% in Poland. <br>  The entire process of transferring the buyer's confidential data from the online store to the payment system should be carried out using the latest data encryption protocol, which minimizes the possibility of intercepting the personal information of the bank card holder and using it for illegal purposes.  To protect customers, PayU transfers all personal information of the cardholder via SSL (Extended Validation Secure Sockets Layer) SSL (SSL) protocol, which is the latest solution in this area. <br>  To prevent situations involving fraudulent actions, you should be more attentive not only to the choice of an online store, but also to take into account the reputation of its partners who make online payments.  If you are a victim of fraud on the Internet, you need to contact the internal affairs department of Russia - Office "K", which carries out the fight against crimes in the field of information technology. </div>
