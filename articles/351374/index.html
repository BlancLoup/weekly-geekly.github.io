  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Barcode scanners for USAIS: myths and reality, selection criteria</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last article, we wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/scanport/blog/349820/">about the new version of the</a> Unified State Automated Information System <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/scanport/blog/349820/">3.0</a> and the introduction of mandatory mark accounting of alcohol products in Russia.  Now entrepreneurs are seriously puzzled by the problem of automation in accordance with the law. <br><br>  There are a lot of myths about what reading equipment is suitable for working with the Unified State Automated Information System, from specific mistakes in recommendations on the websites of regulatory bodies, to marketing manipulations of the mind, which are used by equipment suppliers.  In this article we will describe in detail what the equipment for the Unified State Automated Information System actually is. <br><br><img title="Any 2D scanner can read excise mark barcode - PDF417" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/kq/kh/yakqkhs2m9tvh6oj53tjeqc3jk8.jpeg" alt="   -   2D "><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Let's start with barcode scanners </h2><br>  Hand on heart, excitement and lack of awareness of entrepreneurs we, as a supplier of equipment, only on hand.  Nalepil red bun with the inscription "for the Unified State Automated Information System" on the appropriate scanner in the catalog and catch the frightened customers in these five magic letters.  This is also used by many suppliers, raising sales of certain models.  From the outside, it seems that a scanner labeled ‚Äúfor the USAIS‚Äù is a rare beast, specially sharpened for working with the state system, and the types of such equipment can be counted on fingers.  We want to restore justice and tell that the choice of scanners for the Unified State Automated Information System is huge, and the main thing is the free choice of the entrepreneur himself.

    <h2>  What to believe </h2><br>  In the equipment catalog <a href="https://scanport.ru/">on our website</a> , there are subsections in the corresponding sections, for example, <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/skanery-dlya-egais/">‚ÄúScanners for EGAIS‚Äù</a> .  This does not mean that only these scanners are suitable for automating trade according to the Unified State Automated Information System.  There we collected the most popular models with the necessary characteristics, with the best ratio "price-quality".  We did this for ease of navigation, no more.  And not all possible options are collected in this section. <br><br>  When automating the work on EGAIS using a scanner, you need to know only one rule: the scanner for the EGAIS is a 2D scanner (that is, a PDF417 reading code).  There are no other rules, all other characteristics, form factor, connection interfaces, etc.  - all this refers exclusively to the requirements of the business processes of the enterprise and its internal commodity accounting system. <br><br>  And if you see somewhere some special recommendations for the Unified State Automated Information System on any other grounds, except for the possibility of reading a 2D code - do not be fooled. <br>  By the way, the site of the FS PAP ( <a href="http://egais.ru/tehnicheskie_sredstva">http://egais.ru/tehnicheskie_sredstva</a> ) in the list of recommended scanners generally featured a model of a laser 1D scanner <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/ruchnye-provodnye-skanery/MK9520/">MS9520</a> , which is not suitable for working with , because  It does not actually read PDF417, but only with a special firmware, for a very long time (it is required to pens slowly with a laser on the barcode), and not all PDF417 barcodes are considered.  And absolutely exactly, this scanner will not read DataMatrix (barcode of the brand‚Äôs series), which is absolutely not suitable for working with EGAIS. <br><br><img title="At the checkout, the excise stamp must be read and transferred to the UTM" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/lf/dk/nrlfdkdtjwplq5vkspllkwycs70.jpeg" alt="      -: PDF417  DataMatrix"><br><br><h2>  Recommended scanners for USAIS </h2><br>  If someone is not too lazy to plunge deeper into the choice of a scanner for USAIS from dozens of 2D scanner models, he will notice that two-dimensional scanners of the same manufacturer with almost identical characteristics may have a double or triple difference in price.  Let's see why. <br><br>  As soon as the EGAIS bill went through the rustle and it became clear what technical means it would need to be automated, the leading scanner manufacturers quickly put two plus two together.  The main task of the manufacturer was to provide the Russian market with a suitable competitive 2D scanner model and eat off the maximum market share.  And while our entrepreneurs here complained about the law, manufacturers of equipment over the hill already fought the idea is not childish.  They developed new products and started to release optimized scanner models.  We needed scanners with excellent 2D optics, while the cost price had to be cheaper.  And the size of the Russian alcohol market required well-thought-out production plans and logistics. <br><br><img title="Competition for market share led to lower prices for barcode scanners for USAIS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/dy/np/srdynpr_wen50yszr3sjmbicpbe.jpeg" alt="  ,  - "><br><br>  Leading scanner manufacturers (Honeywell, Datalogic, Zebra, and others) have released scanner models, focusing on this Russian project, and positioning them as scanners for USAIS.  In these scanners, software-optimized barcode processing is optimized, the device better recognizes damaged, worn excise or federal stamps, thanks to special algorithms and a matrix of increased resolution.  But not without victims.  To reduce the cost, manufacturers sacrificed multi-interface, bundling or packaging costs. <br><br><h2>  Examples of scanners for USAIS </h2><br>  Scanners, which are recommended for USIS, have image-scanning technology for working with shabby, small codes at a distance of up to 20 cm, as well as glued on the convex parts of the goods.  If you take the "big three" manufacturers Honeywell, Datalogic, Zebra, then their promotional offers wired hand scanners for the Russian alcohol market look like this: <br><table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td>  Barcode Scanners </td><td>  <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/ruchnye-provodnye-skanery/HoneywellHH400/">Honeywell hh400</a> </td><td>  <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/ruchnye-provodnye-skanery/ZebraDS2208/">Zebra DS2208</a> </td><td>  <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/ruchnye-provodnye-skanery/Datalogic%2520QuickScan%2520Lite%2520QW2420/">Datalogic QuickScan Lite QW2420</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Scan resolution </td><td>  Code 39 - 4.0 mil;  Code 128 - 4.0 mil;  Data Matrix - 6.0 mil;  QR Code - 6.8 mil </td><td>  Code 39 - 4.0 mil;  Code 128 - 4.0 mil;  Data Matrix - 6.0 mil;  QR Code - 6.7 mil </td><td>  Code 39: 4.0 mil;  PDF417: 6.6 mil;  QR / Data Matrix: 7.5 mil </td></tr><tr><td>  Working temperature </td><td>  from 0 to 50 ¬∞ C </td><td>  from 0 to 50 ¬∞ C </td><td>  from 0 to 50 ¬∞ C </td></tr><tr><td>  Protection class </td><td>  IP42 </td><td>  IP42 </td><td>  IP42 </td></tr><tr><td>  Average retail price </td><td>  65 USD </td><td>  65 USD </td><td>  75 USD (with stand) </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As you can see, the main characteristics are almost identical, as well as the price.  Similarly, the case will be with the <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/skanery-dlya-egais/besprovodnye-skanery-dlya-egais/">wireless models for the Unified State Automated Information System</a> , and with the <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/skanery-dlya-egais/staczionarnye-skanery-dlya-egais/">combined (presentation) scanners</a> . <br><br><h2>  How to choose a scanner for USAIS </h2><br>  The choice is wide, but the rule is only one - the scanner should read PDF417.  Manufacturers have taken care to make such models with optimally low price - they should be paid attention first of all. <br><br>  When selecting equipment, we recommend to give preference to reliable manufacturers who offer models with decent technical specifications to the market.  If you buy more than one scanner, and automate the retail network, equipment vendors may suggest that you test the scanner in action (evaluate ergonomics, read quality and speed, etc.). <br><br>  When choosing a scanner for USAIS, pay attention to the warranty conditions from the manufacturer, they may be different (1 year, 3 years or 5 years).  And also, we recommend paying attention to the quality of the scanner and its design. <br><br><img title="Barcode scanner Datalogic QuickScan Lite QW2420 is suitable for work with EGAIS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6g/ln/2p/6gln2pu8pk20fhrsrm2mf52ukaa.jpeg" alt=" - Datalogic QuickScan Lite QW2420     "><br><blockquote><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  In this article we covered the main points: <br><br><ul><li>  scanner for USAIS - is any 2D scanner </li><li>  the clause "for USAIS" in the scanner model indicates its market positioning by the supplier, not more than </li><li>  We looked at the models of hand-held wire scanners from leading manufacturers, developed with reference to the Russian consumer and the requirements of our market, traced the identity of the parameters </li></ul></blockquote>  We hope that this information will help you to better navigate in the mass of disparate information from various sources, to understand that the recommendations of the governing bodies and sellers of equipment are only recommendations, and not restrictions.  In subsequent articles, we will expand on the topic of <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">data collection terminals for the Unified State Automated Information System</a> , tell you about the erroneous opinions about CheckMark2, touch upon the objectivity of the recommendations related to this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351374/</a></p>
