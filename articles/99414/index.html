At the same time, not many people have a clear understanding of what models of such cars should be about to appear in the ‚Äúarena‚Äù of the automotive industry.  As it turned out, these cars are not so few, more than a dozen.  Let's see what kind of cars, and which manufacturers are responsible for the appearance of each model.  By the way, some of them have already entered the market, but in a certain region, and for the whole world such models will be available for a couple of years. <br><br>  And yes, <b>this review only shows real projects</b> that are either already implemented or will be completed within two years.  All sorts of concepts, before the realization of which even years and years, were not included in this brief review.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>RAV4 EV</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/RAV4_EV_1040271450_efc083c306_1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This car is being developed jointly by Toyota and Tesla Motors.  The car includes the development of both companies - body design and chassis - Toyota, the electrical component - Tesla Motors.  On a full battery, this model can travel about 200 km.  In the market RAV4 EV will appear no earlier than 2012. <br><br>  <b>Nissan leaf</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/leaf_red_33.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another electric vehicle that can travel about 200 kilometers on a single battery charge.  Externally, this is a regular compact car that has several buns for owners.  The fact is that manufacturers have equipped cars with the possibility of fast charging (this function is already in the public electric filling stations of new models).  That is completely the battery of this car can be charged in just half an hour (!). <br><br>  Connecting to the usual outlet with a voltage of 120 volts will allow you to replenish the battery charge for a period of time from 16 to 18 hours, or 8 hours at 240 volts. <br><br>  The cost of the car will be about 25 thousand US dollars, and Nissan Leaf will be available next year.  However, only for the regions of the United States, where there is a suitable infrastructure for electric vehicles.  What about Europe is not yet clear. <br><br>  <b>Chevy volt</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/volt11_540x329.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This electric car is closer to hybrids than to electric cars proper.  He is able to do 100 kilometers on one battery charge, after which the fuel engine turns on, replenishing the battery charge.  The manufacturer claims that such a car will be good for regions where there is no special infrastructure for charging electric vehicles. <br><br>  Model cost, predictably, will make no more than 40 thousand US dollars.  Next year the car will go on sale. <br><br>  <b>Ford Focus</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/FordBEV_08_HR_540x304.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ford does not bother to create a new model range of electric vehicles, instead, the developers equip existing models of cars with electric filling. <br><br>  Like many analogs, the electric Ford Focus will be able to travel 200 kilometers on a single charge.  It will be available at the end of 2011, the cost of the car is still unknown. <br><br>  <b>Toyota Prius</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/PluginPriusLaMonica_540x361.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Interestingly, in addition to the development of new electric vehicles in the company with Tesla Motors, Toyota also does independent work on the creation of ‚Äúclean cars‚Äù.  Thus, the company plans to release a new Toyota Prius later this year, plus another fully electric mini-car will be released (the model has not yet been named). <br><br>  <b>Model S from Tesla Motors</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/Model_Slifestyle4_540x401.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, Tesla Motors also does not stop independent work on the Tesla Motors Model S electric car project. The nice sedan, which will cost 57,400 US dollars, will be able to travel 600 kilomtres on one battery charge (!).  This is three times more than what other electric vehicles are capable of. <br><br>  Tesla Motors' Model S will be ready by 2012, having gone on sale at the above price.  In addition, Tesla will release other models, including a convertible, a minivan and an SUV. <br><br>  <b>Karma from Fisker Automotive</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/Fisker03_440.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like one of the models mentioned above, Fisker Automotive has, in addition to an electric engine, a gasoline engine that will allow cars to go where there is no infrastructure for electric vehicles.  On a single battery charge, the car can travel about 100 kilometers, which is very little. <br><br>  In general, this is an advanced hybrid, not an electric car in the full sense of the word.  The manufacturing company promises that only 1 liter of fuel will leave for 50 km. <br><br>  Karma model will be available at the end of this year, however, the number of cars will be limited. <br><br>  <b>Mini-E from BMW</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/MiniELaMonica_540x359.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  BMW has already completed work on this model of car, capable of doing 200 km of travel on a single battery charge.  Electric cars have already appeared in the United States, but the full sale will begin only next year. <br><br>  <b>Smart ForTwo by Daimler</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/10C641_013_540x311.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, this smart company has been transformed into an electric car, which will be ideal for urban conditions.  Smart ForTwo's maximum speed is 140 kilometers per hour, and on a full charge it is able to travel about 170 kilometers, which is not enough.  This year, a pilot version of Smart ForTwo will be released for the United States. <br><br>  In Europe, sales of the model will begin for some reason only in 2012, at the end of the year. <br><br>  <b>Think city</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/ThinkCityLaMonica2.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  This economical electric car was created by the specialists of a Norwegian company that Ford bought.  The maximum speed of the car is 130 kilometers per hour, the maximum range of movement on a full battery charge is 200 kilometers.  This year, cars have already appeared in Europe, next they will be delivered to the United States. <br><br>  <b>iMiev from Mitsubishi</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/imiev2_540x240.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Another small electric car from a well-known company, which is already sold in Japan.  The cost of the car is not so high - 35 thousand US dollars, iMiev from Mitsubishi is able to drive 160 kilometers on a single battery charge. <br><br>  In the US, the model will appear closer to 2011. <br><br>  <b>Coda</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/Coda_sedanLaMonica_540x363.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This electric car can travel on one charge a little longer than its competitors (except for cars from Tesla) - about 250 kilometers.  Its cost is 35 thousand dollars.  Car - American, will be available from the beginning of 2012. <br><br>  <b>E6 from BYD</b> <br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/07/16/BYDe6.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The list also includes Chinese manufacturers who have created an e6 model that can travel up to 400 kilometers on a single battery charge.  According to the developers, such cars are equipped with more economical than competitors, batteries, the cost of production of which is significantly lower than those of the same competitors. <br><br>  In general, the Chinese have long been known for the ability to reduce prices, so long as it does not affect the quality of the car. <br><br>  Here is the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2300-11128_3-10004136-11.html%3Ftag%3Dmncol">source</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99414/</a></p>
