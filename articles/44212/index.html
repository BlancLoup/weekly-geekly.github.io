  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The global crisis is a chance for an Internet entrepreneur. Do we expect an advertising boom?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Outside the financial crisis.  He was scared, but so far, fortunately, he almost did not touch mere mortals (I hope that he didn‚Äôt seriously touch them), but he had a hard and hard hit on entrepreneurs planning to build a new or expand a working business.  There is no free money, the loans are expensive, the risks are high.  Pretty often the companies of the real sector are rolling out projects, reducing staff, going bankrupt.  It would seem that the time has come for the regular ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù, but now not only in the USA, but all over the world.  However, there is still a ‚Äúlight in the window‚Äù and this ‚Äúlight‚Äù for an entrepreneur seems to me to be the Global Network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hundreds of thousands of companies around the world have already discovered here unique and sometimes very profitable opportunities for implementing new projects or expanding and developing existing businesses.  And it is they who today are least exposed to financial tsunami walking around the planet.  For the sake of fairness, I must say that, of course, the crisis has also affected the online business, but, first of all, the non-optimal enterprises were affected.  In web commerce, the crisis made a kind of ‚Äúforest orderlies‚Äù - forced the strong to gather, and the weak set up the need to restructure or curtail business. <br><br>  It is believed that in the coming months, precisely due to the financial crisis, the Internet expects an advertising boom.  Already today, companies in the real sector everywhere are cutting advertising budgets, and their ‚Äúadvertisers,‚Äù who, anyway, have been looking to the Network, are beginning to send advertising money more boldly to the Internet.  So far, most of them have a habit of viewing the Internet as an auxiliary platform, but now there are good reasons to reconsider their views.  Indeed, unlike the times of large-scale injections into television, outdoor, print, radio advertising, today these managers have to operate with relatively small budgets.  And the Internet just allows, working with such budgets, to achieve high efficiency, accurately track the efficiency of each advertising campaign, targeting it to a clearly defined group of users.  Add to this the possibilities for interactive ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù of the buyer, carrying out the process of purchasing and calculating remotely ... In a word, deprived of the opportunity to manage significant budgets, advertising experts have already begun to more closely examine the possibilities offered by the Internet, and many of them are pleasant surprises.  And the Internet is waiting for gradually increasing flow of advertising money. <br><br>  Moreover, according to sensations, today the Internet is almost the only industry that, despite the global crisis, continues to evolve.  And it will continue its vigorous development for many more years, since the opportunities and benefits provided by the Global Network to the consumer are too obvious, and the number of uncovered ‚Äúusers‚Äù amounts to hundreds of millions.  All these people gradually come to the Internet and become its regular users, and therefore, someone's customers.  Only in Russia in the coming years, according to forecasts, several dozens of millions more will be added to the already existing 35-40 million.  That is, the growth potential for the Internet in the coming years is so great that mediocre companies doing business here simply become prosperous due to this ‚Äúgrowth wave‚Äù, and companies entering the market with a unique idea and a strong team of intelligent managers grow into millions or even billions of corporations.

      Why it happens?  The environment is favorable for growth.  From the point of view of business organization, the Internet today is a place where you can start with a relatively small initial capital.  At the same time, at each stage of development, the Internet company can be ‚Äúflexibly‚Äù adjusted to the changing needs and requests of the client in a flexible and relatively low cost.  Web commerce is a business in which a promising idea realized gives a powerful financial return. It is a process that requires a relatively small staff of specialists, but which can be easily scaled and maintained throughout Russia, brought to other countries, to the global market. <br><br>  I am not inclined to sing the praises of online commerce.  All of the above - the facts and their analysis.  As a summary - it seems that many entrepreneurs, if they have not already done so, it is time to take a closer look at the Internet.  Here today lie new opportunities and perspectives.  And if you approach the matter thoughtfully and with understanding, the chances of success are great. <br><br>  The source is the <a href="http://spiridonov.ru/">blog of Internet producer Maxim Spiridonov</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44212/</a></p>
