  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex will search for pirates with the help of a robot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yandex will soon introduce a new way to remove more links to pirated content from search results, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2019/03/14/796426-yandeks-robota">reported</a> by Vedomosti.  The company has created and has already launched a specialized robot program that searches the web for content pages similar to those already in the ‚Äúpirated registry‚Äù.  To improve efficiency, the program uses the principles of machine learning. <br><br>  Last year, the largest Russian media companies called for a more active fight against piracy.  Thus, media holdings, online cinemas and producers signed a memorandum on combating piracy with Internet companies.  One of the provisions of the memorandum indicates the need for an extra-judicial procedure to remove from the search results links to pages with pirated copies of films and TV shows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the producers and TV channels, it is through search engines that users search and find pirated sites with illegal content.  Now the copyright holders send the found links to pirated content to Yandex, these links are entered into a single registry. <br><br>  By mid-March, Yandex removed more than 100,000 links from a search, as told by representatives of a domestic Internet company.  The registry already has more than 140,000 links, which is confirmed by the staff of two media companies that have access to this list.

      In a short time, Yandex found several million pages with pirated content, and this was achieved thanks to a new program for the robot.  Found an order of magnitude more pages with illegal content than contained in the registry. <br><br>  "We expect that our development will speed up the process of forming the registry, and the fight against piracy will become more efficient," says Greg Abovski, operations and financial director of the company.  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù promised before the end of this week to send the first list of pages found by the robot holders for review and reconciliation.  If the right holders agree that the system is working correctly, then Yandex will regularly transmit the pages found by the robot already from April.  Copyright holders will be able to make them to the registry for later deletion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the behavior of a socially responsible business.  We look forward to seeing the new system, ‚Äùcommented Vadim Vereshchagin, general director of Central Partnership (CPSH).  There are less optimistic views on the situation.  For example, Amediateka CEO Dmitry Sychugov has a slightly different opinion: ‚ÄúThe Yandex‚Äôs own initiative to actively clean up the search from pirated links looks amazing.  The industry is not yet familiar with the new search engine software solution.  I want to study it. ‚Äù <br><br>  In addition, right holders believe that instead of being removed from the list of links, in most cases new ones will immediately appear.  And a radical drop in traffic from search engines to pirated sites does not occur. <br><br>  By the way, the other day, the Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky, <a href="https://tass.ru/kultura/6222653">said</a> that it was precisely because of the pirated content that is widely hosted on the network that Russia cannot create its counterparts of such services, Netflix and HBO. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is necessary to overcome crime in the movie industry, by crime I mean the theft of private property, the theft of films on the Internet and the organized sale of it on the thieves' platforms, which are pirated websites.  Moreover, all this is being filled with advertising by online casinos, that is, some thieves sponsor other thieves.  We will not create our own Netflix, and we will not create HBO, ‚Äùsaid Medinsky. <br><br>  Earlier, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443916/">he said</a> that the Ministry of Culture had prepared several proposals on changes in legislation in terms of dealing with sites that distributed pirated video content.  One of the proposals made is the introduction to the work of a list of information that the site owner should post about himself.  For example, the name and surname, address, location, email address.  In addition, it is proposed to shorten the time frame for making court decisions on violations regarding the observance of content rights in the network, plus to allow the right holders to contact the provider directly with a statement about the removal of illegal content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443972/</a></p>
