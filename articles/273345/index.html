      It was written to discuss the problems that have arisen, since the EMC did not receive a response.  Yes, the system was deployed on a test stand, there is no technical support from the manufacturer for the licensing terms.  But the search on the world wide web did not bring the desired result. <br><br><h4>  Actually, the characteristics of the test bench </h4><br><ul><li>  two nodes with the role of <b>MDM</b> (primary and secondary) </li><li>  one node with the role of <b>Tie Breaker</b> .  It also has a GUI for monitoring and administration. </li><li>  three nodes with the role of <b>Data Server</b> .  On each of them, the storage devices ( <i>device</i> ) were organized as follows: two devices ‚Äî <i>raw</i> partitions on disks connected via iSCSI protocol.  One device was represented by a large file. </li><li>  Windows 2012 standard acted as an operating system on each node.  The amount of RAM 4 GB.  Network - 1 GB </li></ul><br>  The first neponyatka happened after the installation of Meta Data Manager on the first node.  So that it could be configured, we had to restart the OS, because when I tried to execute the <i>--add_primary_mdm</i> command immediately after the installation process, a connection error was persistently displayed, although all the necessary ports were in the <i>LISTENING</i> state and all the necessary services were started. <br><br>  Then the process of attaching the second node and cluster configuration, the installation of the <i>Data Server</i> roles went smoothly. <br><br>  For each <i>Data Server</i> node, two storage devices were successfully connected as RAW partitions on disks connected via iSCSI and one large file on a local disk. <br><br>  The connection feature of iSCSI disks was that the sources of these disks were computers on the network that were turned on / off haphazardly, unpredictably, which helped to fully verify such declared fault-tolerant technologies as: <i>Rebuild</i> , <i>Rebalance</i> .  In the course of monitoring the system for two weeks, there were no complaints about these aspects of the work.  Everything worked out with a bang. <br><br>  Problems began when trying to increase the number of connected <i>devices</i> on each of the <i>Data Server</i> nodes.  I couldn‚Äôt find out why new devices were not connected with the <i>--add_sds_device</i> command or through the GUI.  All operations ended with the error "Comminication error".  And so for each node.  In addition, each of the connected devices is available in the OS as a block device, does not oppose formatting, creation of file objects on it, and work with it using the SMB protocol. <br><br>  However, the most critical error surfaced only after a couple of weeks. <br><br>  One day I noticed that the cluster is in the <i>degraded</i> status.  At night there were problems with electricity and the network was partially not working.  Both <i>Data Manager</i> nodes were in <i>Secondary</i> status.  At the same time, the <i>Tie breaker</i> node was available on the network from both nodes. <br><br>  Forced translation of the node in the <i>Primary is</i> not possible, the administrative port is not listening, it is impossible to upload the cluster settings to a file. <br><br>  That is, all nodes of the <i>Data Server</i> , <i>Data Client</i> are working, sharing information with each other at the network level, the disk partition provided to the client is available, the integrity of the information is not compromised. <br><br>  But the situation is a dead end: neither change the configuration, nor add new nodes. <br><br>  I tried to raise a new <i>Primary Data Manger</i> , create a new cluster and connect an existing <i>Secondary</i> node to it.  The ghostly hope died without being born - the new cluster was clean (in principle, it was understandable from the very beginning). <br><br>  Another small drawback is the inability to adjust the size of the GUI to the size of the current monitor resolution - the size of the GUI is fixed and designed for a resolution of at least 1280x1024. <br><br>  Spent a lot of time talking to Google, nothing adequate could not be found. <br><br>  I decided to go to the EMC website, and there the online consultant window.  I asked to contact someone from technical support and wrote him a letter describing the problems identified. <br><br>  In the reply letter (in Russian) I was asked clarifying questions.  I answered them and promised to answer me after a while.  Without waiting for a response within a week, I reminded myself in a letter, but so far I have not received anything in return. <br><br><h4>  My findings </h4><br>  The result of the testing described in the article on the second link at the beginning of the article states that <blockquote>  Failover tests were successful </blockquote><br>  I can not agree with that.  This is the first software-defined distributed storage I tested.  Gradually I will test others.  According to the results I will unsubscribe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273345/</a></p>
