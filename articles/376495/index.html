  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Looking to the future: What the headquarters of large IT companies will look like</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Giants of the IT industry not only create our life on the Internet, but also try to influence our life in the real world.  Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are building new headquarters for their companies, which design and infrastructure are more like small cities from science fiction magazines of the twentieth century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/879/06f/6aa/87906f6aac2f401193ea9f573fc7f897.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main goal of creating such futuristic campuses is to demonstrate to the world an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ideal space and innovations that can later be used in the cities of the future.  Now we will briefly consider what each of the future projects represents, and what contribution it can make to further technical progress.

    <h4>  Google and developed infrastructure </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/502/468/ea550246836440749a4b6fa1717bdbe1.jpg"><br><br>  The history of the main headquarters of Google, located in Mountain View, dates back to 1998.  Then it was a small office with 50 employees located in Silicon Valley.  Now Googleplex includes 2 million square meters.  office space, and this year it is planned to build another 1 million square meters.  m. square.  The entire complex of buildings Googleplex created for maximum comfort for both employees and guests of the company.  Recreation centers, swimming pools, fitness centers, cafes and much more can be found in this place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e88/099/17c/e8809917c024466f916b0739063f7996.jpg"><br><br>  Up to this point, the company did not engage in its own construction, but only rented buildings.  Thus, the current complex includes five rented buildings originally built for Silicon Graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/ed9/7a9/841ed97a97d44532be6dd677f8cdd9b5.jpg"><br><br>  The new project, which will be built by the same NBBJ, will be primarily aimed at creating an efficient workflow and its own infrastructure.  The building will be made 42 transition for quick interaction of employees.  There will also be a private airport and a bridge connecting it to Google‚Äôs headquarters. <br><br><h4>  Closed Apple Campus </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3f/f92/8c8/b3ff928c88484642be8239f0592b8d89.jpg"><br><br>  Shortly before his death, Steve Jobs agreed to build a new Apple Campus 2 headquarters. Steve's main phrase in time for a call to future project designer Norman Foster was: "Don't think of me as a client, consider me a member of your team."  Jobs wanted the future campus to match the company's ideology ‚Äî embody functionality and have perfect form.  The design of the project was developed by Norman Foster, and construction is scheduled for 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f36/60f/189/f3660f18917642c1ab738da8585fe1d3.jpg"><br><br>  After the presentation of the presentation video, the new campus in the press was dubbed the name ‚ÄúSpaceship‚Äù.  Indeed, the new headquarters area of ‚Äã‚Äã260 thousand square meters.  m. made in the form of a curved glass building that forms a kind of security ring looks fantastic.  Apple Campus 2 is a closed system, the purpose of which is to create ideal conditions for workers, so that they do not leave the campus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32d/d2e/686/32dd2e686f614e53aec72d9d0a3fc81f.jpg"><br><br>  The construction will work on the principle of a smart home.  With the help of solar and wind energy, the campus will be fully supplied with renewable energy.  The building will use its own ventilation and heating. <br><br><h4>  Amazon Environmental Space </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/fbb/d01/4ddfbbd018c44cdda850407b18cb2373.jpg"><br><br>  Among the stamped multi-storey buildings of Seattle, decorated with iron and glass, it is so pleasant to look at something that extends beyond the boundaries of global architectural thought.  That is the creation of the new headquarters of Amazon, whose construction began in January 2014.  The complex will include three office buildings, as well as an eco-center - a 25-meter building consisting of three glass transparent spheres. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e14/a5e/fcd/e14a5efcdf0e48f584f7112c2b8951fc.jpg"><br><br>  The project designer is the famous architectural bureau NBBJ.  The eco-center will be equipped with work offices, retail outlets, conference halls, recreation areas, but the main asset will undoubtedly be an atrium of rare plants and trees from around the world, creating the most comfortable microclimate for a person.  Thus, the future headquarters of Amazon will be not only a place for 2 thousand employees of the company, but also a public place where everyone can have a good time.  Completion of the project is scheduled for the end of 2016. <br><br><h4>  Facebook and creative atmosphere </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a51/3d1/45c/a513d145c3eb48cdbd77068c8ba9c53a.jpg"><br><br>  According to Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, innovations are born in the process of interaction of a large number of people.  To implement this idea, Facebook commissioned the construction of a new headquarters to the famous architect Frank Gehry.  The building will be an ideal factory of ideas: no walls and windows, offices for top management and other infrastructure.  In a modest space without borders there will be many places for spontaneous intersection of employees, and consequently the birth of a new solution.  The five buildings of the complex are interconnected by landscaping with a roof with walking paths.  At first glance, the new campus is a rather modest work of the great architect, but, according to Zuckerberg, fully corresponds to the spirit of the company. <br><br><h4>  Is the game worth the candle? </h4><br>  Of course, companies spend billions of dollars on such projects.  ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù - you ask?  After all, this money could be invested in inventing more new and even more high-tech equipment.  But, as we have already written above, the main goal of any large company is to demonstrate its perfection to the world, and such projects serve as good advertising.  However, it cannot be said that this is just a window dressing or a struggle for the championship.  Indeed, recently the main purpose of many IT giants has been the massive use of renewable energy and environmental technologies, which in the future can play a good service to humanity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376495/</a></p>
