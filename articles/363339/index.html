      Over the past year, the governments of Colombia, Mozambique, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Maldives, Palau, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Vanuatu, and several other tiny states received letters from Peter Thiel, co-founder of Seastanding Institute, and Patry Friedman, a former Google engineer and grandson of the famous economist Milton Friedman, with a proposal how to escape from the state in the ocean waters by building his small technological island.  Or a group of islands.  Floating City. <br><br>  More information can be found <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/floating-city-project/">on the project page</a> or <a href="http://apparat.cc/world/floating-city/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  In science fiction, floating cities are strictly bored.  However, it is not allowed in the atmosphere. <br><br>  <i>Wikipedia</i> </blockquote><br><br>  I have long been with manic persistence collecting information about various conflicts of the Old World and the New (let's call it the IT world), in order, naturally, to write a book.  I like retro-futuristic plans to create a city in Antarctica (just like Bryusov‚Äôs - yes, the classic poet wrote a small fantastic story in his best years), I also, like everyone, pay from laws in all countries that deprive We are informational freedom (from the public Roscom ** Zorro, I also cry), I study the texts of experts on hybrid wars, comparing them with books on the civil war (White Guard, Sholokhov).  I am trying to get to the bottom of the truth in the patent wars and the confrontation of copywriters and pirates (is it more correct to call ‚Äúclashes‚Äù?) <br><br>  The material has accumulated so much that the support of Evernote calls me the third person by the number of records from those who applied to support, but for now it became clear that my book should be about people who are trying to hide from the anti-progressives and try to create that New World. <br><br>  Before that, I had already met similar ideas that are trying to materialize in the real world (server barges Google, the story of the Pirate Bay servers, again, the story from the Cryptomicon, those guys who are building a programmer village near Moscow), but somehow I came across blog on an island on this article about the <a href="http://ostrovok.ru/blog/xatt-river-instrukciya-po-sozdaniyu-samoprovozglashyonnogo-mini-gosudarstva/">Hutt River</a> . <br><br>  Another story, closer to my idea.  Already in '72, in the coral reefs, freshly established on coral reefs near the island of Fiji, with the money of the American millionaire Michael Oliver, the Republic of Minerava tried to establish a state full of liberal ideas.  Unfortunately, they, like the small dreamers from the same small parties in the 17th year, were dispersed. <br><br>  I also found stories about microstates in collages - <a href="https://kuno4ka.livejournal.com/126866.html">Eleven stories about separatism</a> .  Then it turned out that the author, Olga Lavrentyeva, on VKontakte also has micro stories about other understate states - Shvambrania, the Maltese Order, ISIS, Melchizedek Dominion.  <a href="https://kuno4ka.livejournal.com/143231.html">By the</a> way, she also decided to print these comics in small editions and distribute them <a href="https://kuno4ka.livejournal.com/143231.html">on preorder</a> - I strongly advise that it is now fashionable to support good people with crowdfunding. <br><br>  My most favorite story is about the guys from Sealand, who, with the help of a pair of rifles and the mistakes of the parochial judge, in fact received recognition of independence from such a big country as England. <br><br>  Against the background of all these velvet-orange-spring revolutions over the past year, rallies and protests, occupations and simply speaking out against prohibition, the very Friedman and Til from the beginning of the post design a floating city, a technological ‚Äúisland of freedom‚Äù.  I will give from there one quote that has become a feature of non-return for the plot of my book (which, of course, is not written on the table). <br><br><blockquote>  Floating City in the future will consist of many islands, whole archipelagoes with different governments.  If you do not like one state, you can disconnect your house from the island and sail to another.  There is only one unifying principle for all island governments - libertarianism, which is based on the prohibition of aggressive violence.  With this principle a huge number of legal systems can coexist, from democracy to communism, but there are invariable values: freedom of speech, religion, sexual and political orientation;  lack of total state control - no cameras in the streets, NSA and FSB reading your personal correspondence. <br><br>  The rest depends on the immigrants.  For example, if anarcho-capitalists come to power, there will be no state at all.  This political movement believes that government structures only complicate a person‚Äôs life, and antitrust law and the tax system are aggressive violence and should be eliminated.  On Floating City they will have the opportunity to test their theory.  As a result, we can wait for the city with legal circulation of drugs and weapons or bitcoins as the main monetary unit. <br><br>  The authors of the project themselves do not yet have a clue what will happen in the end: ‚ÄúI want to see democracy 2.0, and maybe socialism 2.0.  We just try, and then decide which system is better, ‚Äùsays Randolph Hanken, director and ideologist of the Seasteading Institute. </blockquote><br><br>  Utopia?  Yes.  I, of course, immediately come to mind "Robinson Crusoe", and "Village" by Cyrus Bulychev, and "When sysadmins ruled the Earth" from Doctorow, and "Lord of the Flies", and that same "Beach", but - suddenly I understood that after so many years of scholarship I want to ask you exactly: <br><br>  <b>How do you see such a state?</b> <br><br>  Does he have a future? <br><br>  Maybe it will not be a state, but simply a city like the Anthill of Gibson? <br><br>  Even if you don‚Äôt believe in utopia on artificial islands, where crackers and coders, prankers and seeders, lepers and dwoƒçers, architects and designers want to live, just freelancers and maybe even manage without an MBA manager, please write why . <br><br>  And further.  Are you as <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/why-thousands-people-are-willing-die-mars%3Fdom%3DPSC%26loc%3Dslider%26lnk%3D3%26con%3Dwhy-thousands-of-people-are-willing-to-die-on-mars">crazy as 200 people from the Mars One program</a> to go live in such a state? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363339/</a></p>
