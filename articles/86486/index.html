  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bank Trust: How to work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The circumstances were such that I had to take a loan for two years.  This loan was kindly provided to me by the then little-known Bank Trust. <br>  The following describes our relationship with him consisting of several stages. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Getting a loan </h4><br>  When the bank happily informed me that they were ready to give me a loan, I had come early in the morning to one of the bank branches.  It‚Äôs good that I was the first in the queue ... A female cashier prepared my documents for 40 minutes!  My back clearly felt the gazing of ten people standing behind me, nervous and suggesting that the procedure with each of them would not be faster. <br>  The operator slowly, scoring something into the computer, typing on a printer, letting me sign, scoring again, typing again, I signed again ... Glory to Allah, it was all over, I was given a pack of documents with a payment schedule and a plastic card that everyone had to month to put money, that they were written off. <br><br><h4>  2. Payments </h4><br>  When the time came for the first payment, I arrived at the nearest Flial and started communicating with an ATM.  He swallowed the card, asked the pin-code, asked if I wanted to deposit money on the card.  Naturally, I replied that I wanted.  The ATM asked a few more questions and only then threw out some kind of mistake and which I realized that the ATM stupidly did not have a tray for receiving money.  Really not.  My cant.  But one wonders what for me to offer to deposit money on the card, if there is nothing to accept them?  Just the firmware on all ATMs is one and the companies are too lazy to edit it in order to prevent such jambs.  Okay.  I went to another ATM, put the money, everything is in order. <br>  After some time, another feature emerged.  She looked like this: <br>  Suppose the deadline for making a contribution is 21st.  I bring 16 money.  On the 18th, I receive a text message that, as of 14 (!!!), I have not enough funds on my account.  Honestly, it makes me nervous. <br>  It also annoyed me that the pin-code on the card was asked at the very beginning of the operations, and when you were standing and pressing various buttons for five minutes, the ATM could tell you that the pin-code was wrong and you had to start all over again. <br>  But the last straw was the fact that I came to the ATM twice a day and every two days, and both times the ATM informed me that ‚ÄúSorry, the ATM is not working‚Äù.  It brought me to the end, because the ATM had previously worked one time, but that was too much. <br>  In an angry mood, I scribbled an e-mail to the bank, where I was indignant at all these circumstances in rather harsh terms and promised not only myself not to contact them anymore, but also to bequeath all my friends and acquaintances to this. <br>  To its credit, it is worth noting that my letter was not only not thrown out, but even reacted to it.  On a clear Sunday, a girl from the bank called me and answered in a calm, measured voice that: <br>  a) ATM without a bill acceptor offers to deposit money in cash?  We do not know these, but check it out. <br>  b) Stupid SMS?  We will solve. <br>  c) The pin-code is asked at the beginning - this is the algorithm of the work and you will not change anything here (party policy). <br>  d) Does an ATM often work?  Well, we don‚Äôt know ... well, it happens of course, but we quickly repair them, and if your deadlines are tight, then we can be postponed for a couple of days. <br>  In the promise, so cute talked. <br>  What was done: <br>  a) did not check. <br>  b) Instead of correcting the server request algorithm, the SMS notifications were stupidly turned off. <br>  c) remains as before <br>  d) The ATM began to work like a clock. <br><br>  Anyway.  Somehow they reacted well.

      So much time has passed. <br><br><h4>  3. Out of card. </h4><br>  I remembered the bank with bad words, when trying to make another installment, the ATM first spat out a five-thousandth bill and said that it was useless, then said that the pin-code was not correct and only after 10 minutes of struggle, he happily told me that my period cards already over!  Hurt yourself.  I look at the map - it really did end on December 31 now past year. <br>  I didn‚Äôt have time to clear up the relationship, postponed the showdown for the weekend. <br>  Saturday I come to the branch office, take an electronic queue ticket, take a chair, sit, wait.  Of the 6 potential jobs, half actually works.  One and a half, because one of the girls periodically somewhere for a long time away.  People are indignant at what they get the answer, saying that it‚Äôs not we who decided that so many people should work on Saturday.  One man tried to quarrel with his superiors, to which he received an answer - there are no Heads, will be on weekdays, you can only call the call center, where the complaint will be received and considered on weekdays in order of priority.  In short, impenetrable wall. <br>  The queue does not move at all.  While sitting, I paid attention to the electronic clock on the wall.  Nobody had time to translate the time for them in the winter.  Somewhere in about forty minutes, it turns out that the system is completely frozen and when it droops it is unknown.  I had time, but there was nowhere to go, so I remained to wait.  Somewhere in another 30 minutes, when almost everyone who was sitting in front of me lost patience and ran away, the system started working.  Another 20 minutes later I was called.  The operator again typed something on the computer, pressed it with the mouse, and after about 10 minutes, I finally received an application for issuing a new card, where I HAD to write my full name and the number of the old card.  OK.  I wrote.  When the girl accepted the statement, a logical question followed: <br>  - Do you pay the fee as you wait for the cards or right now through the cashier? <br>  - And when will the card be ready? <br>  - In two weeks. <br>  - Then it turns out that I have no choice. <br>  - Just then, please note that our payment through the cashier costs a hundred rubles. <br>  Super.  I fight in orgasm.  Nowhere to go - paid. <br><br><h4>  4. Closing a loan. </h4><br>  It so happened that without waiting for a new card, I had extra money and I decided to pay the rest of the loan in full.  Well decided and decided. <br>  I am in the bank in the evening of the working day.  Thank God, the queue was not taken almost immediately.  To the operating system I tell my plans, to which I get the answer: <br>  - Call here on this number, there they will tell you up to a penny how much you owe, write down these numbers and come to me. <br>  - And you can not find out these numbers? <br>  - None. <br>  How lovely!  There is nothing to do, I call, there the operator asks me literally everything that can be asked what to identify a person up to the maiden name of my mother and gives, finally, the coveted numbers.  Surprisingly, the operative this time managed in five minutes.  I was given papers for the cash desk and was told that a piece of paper where it would be written that I did not owe them anything would be given to me after the next installment payment term, i.e.  a week later. <br>  Okay, it takes two weeks, I am in the bank and immediately with a question to the consultant at the entrance: - How, I say, can I get an induction house? <br>  A polite girl replies that they say this certificate is not easy, and therefore, if you order it today, it will be ready in 10 (!) Days.  Okay.  Nowhere to go, leave.  For reference: it was the fourth date. <br>  I arrive at 18 with the thought: Well, 10 days then exactly passed, now I will receive a certificate and a walk, Vasya.  Nope  I enter the bank, the electronic queue does not work, I don‚Äôt want anyone at the reception, I rush to the free operator.  So they say, and so, my certificate should be ready already, so the girl behind the reception last time promised, to which I get an answer, that once the girl promised, now with her I ask when she comes. <br>  Well, I waited 5 minutes, I came.  The other.  But in the know.  He told her again the essence of the problem.  It turned out that an interesting detail turned out that when they say ‚Äú10 days‚Äù they mean ‚Äú10 working days‚Äù, but even if you count the workers, then 10 days have passed anyway.  Nevertheless, she did not find the certificate, but she promised to call me when she was ready. <br>  Think someone called me?  Yeah.  Schazzzz ... On the 31st I call the bank myself on the general telephone.  The young man listens to me and politely sends a call directly to the bank and gives respectively two phones that you can reach.  Yes you can.  If you have patience.  For two hours I called on both phones 10 times, but there was either busy or no one there.  Finally, when I phoned, I asked for clarification on the availability of the certificate and I was happily informed that it was ready and I could come for it.  In the evening of the same day, I went to the bank and received the desired paper.  Do you think that this was a 50-page document with many stamps and signatures?  Nothing like that.  One page, a bit of text, the usual seal of the bank and the signature of the operator.  And they did this for more than three weeks ?? <br><br><h4>  In connection with the above, I have questions: </h4><br><br>  1. Why do I need to apply for a loan for 40 minutes?  Is there really no information about me in the database?  Why a bunch of graph need to fill stupidly hammering the text with your hands?  Is it possible that in addition to my data in the system is something non-standard? <br>  2. Is it really difficult to fix the program in an ATM, so that he would not ask if I want to deposit money in cash if he does not have a receiving tray? <br>  3. Is it really so difficult to change the program of the autoinformer, which reminds of depositing money in such a way that the check would be on the day of the notice, and not 5 days before? <br>  4. Is it really so difficult to adjust the work of an ATM, so that it does not break in a day?  Well, or at least next to the ATM to hang a sign with the phone of the bank, where you can call, tell about the breakdown and ask where I can drive up at the moment, so that you can still pay another installment? <br>  5. Is it really difficult to set up the card verification program in such a way that it would first ask if it was overdue, and then check the PIN code?  Or give me a card for the entire loan period.  Or by sms one month prior to the expiry of the card, inform me that the card will soon be kirdyk. <br>  6. Why on Saturday the branch cannot be provided with the necessary number of employees?  Even a forty-minute system hang wouldn‚Äôt have pissed off customers if they hadn‚Äôt been in the queue for an hour.  And is it really difficult to change the clock to winter time? <br>  7. Why should I pay a hundred rubles for depositing money through the cashier, if it is not my fault that they will be doing the card for two weeks? <br>  8. Why, being in a bank, should I find out about my debt by phone?  Can a girl at the other end of the wire identify me much more precisely than the one that sits and looks at me? <br>  9. Why the program can not be so corrected that in case of early repayment it was not necessary to wait for the next term of cancellation, but to close the contract immediately and immediately issue a certificate about it? <br>  10. Why the simplest certificate with one signature and stamp should be prepared for three weeks?  Why, since it is so long, not to inform the client about the readiness of the help by SMS? <br>  11. Why, in the end, everything is not so convenient ??? <br><br>  In conclusion, I note that this bank still has advantages.  For example, they gave me a loan, while my beloved Alfabank did not even consider my application.  Yes.  And they have very polite and patient workers. <br><br>  Readers: Take loans from Trust, if you are ready to meet with the constant inconvenience and annoying little things.  However, the presence of an unpaid loan in itself is a cause for irritation.  :) <br><br>  Bank Trust: So you can not work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86486/</a></p>
