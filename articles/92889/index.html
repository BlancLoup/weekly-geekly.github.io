  <section class="page js-page"><h1>He started the development of the project and saw that it was good.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this issue we will have about Agile \ Scrum, bugtracking, version control systems and the initial stage of application development.  Without advice, conclusions and thoughts, just a transfer of experience. <br><br>  I gathered people, distributed tasks, all work, and everything seems to be fine.  And then the people began to wake up Wishlist.  They wanted themselves white people to feel that everything was civilized - and give them a bugtracking, and svn ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the Chukchi is in no hurry, the Chukchi sparrow shot, knows that the project is not alive with gadgets.  Although I caught myself too, I already wanted to put Git on, but I wasn‚Äôt going to.  Then someone in 5 minutes VisualSVN put which server part is free, and, as AnkhSVN client, a free extension for VS.  So this economy is not particularly useful.  Someone incorrectly configured the account, so they drove files by mail, and did not tell anyone.  And bazkampy any bourgeois-speaking - and in general I did not like.  Are we worse off?  We will write our own, and so that we could immediately discuss the inside, sculpt the pros / cons, charge the salary and leave a comment immediately in which direction to dig.  Well, plus, we have all the work at once on the corporate forum laid out - that‚Äôs all the bug tracking at once in the topic. <br><br>  Well, they decided with Wishlist, I felt like a big boss, I decided to see what other big bosses are doing.  And it turns out, they are engaged in methodologies.  Agile is a general approach, and scrum is one of its implementations.  I will not decipher, especially since there have already been articles on this subject, and the public here is considered to be intelligent and sophisticated.  All knowledge is valuable only on occasion, the need for an agile approach arises during team development of a project, in which everything is not clear.  I open, then, it means Wikipedia to clarify for myself the meaning of these wonderful overseas words.  Agile is a pure philosophy, no specific instructions, if you are a modern person, it will be close to you.  Scrum already contains rules, for example, the Product Owner (Owner), that is, the carrier of the vision.  I myself performed this role, but there was no Leader, I did not manage to find a sufficiently competent person.  Therefore, in two roles, I just sewn up.  There should be demonstrations, but there were no problems with this - right where it was laid out, it was discussed there.  Retrospectively as self-digging in the past, I found it redundant.  I also had sprints - I also started accounting periods, for myself I started the rule once a week to summarize the results, to arrange the reconciliation of the work done, although there was a separate person who was engaged in the work sheet.  It was for me the most tedious procedure of all.  Sometimes they also had a chat in skype chat - about the same thing three times, but it settles better in their heads.

      So, 20 good fellows undertook the project from different ends.  All right, I think, we will reduce, though, already forced to reflect.  The problem came from where I did not expect it - I could not break the task down into subtasks.  To build a bottom-up development principles did not allow, but I did not know how to build top-down.  Week went to the painful agonizing thoughts.  Then by chance I saw an article on Habr√© about object-oriented programming patterns.  It struck me - because I need an application architecture!  From the books, the situation has cleared up, but in reality this did not help.  No, I knew what classes and objects are, but there‚Äôs still no practical experience.  In general, another month was spent on comprehending the architecture.  Are you there by the way, fingers bent?  A month to develop a concept, a month for architecture, and after all, craftsmen promised me everything to be done in a week.  Maybe I did not agree in vain?  - it was already possible to bounce three releases. <br><br>  A confusion came out again, but who said that in real life there should be a plot, plot and outcome everywhere? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92889/</a></p>
