This is not surprising, it is difficult to find a sphere of interest where the largest Internet company would not impose its paw.  Earlier there were rumors that Google has hired a staff of experts in the development of mobile applications.  Then there were small notes in various online publications that Google began to develop Google Phone. <br><br>  Below I will give a translation of one of these publications: <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/51b/218/359/51b218359ceee80b73f37ef403d0f671.jpg" width="440" height="284" alt="google phone" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br><br>  Data:

      Most of the news regarding the phone from Google is not confirmed or based on rumors.  However, there are some things that we know for sure.  Here are some points of interest. <br>  * The mobile device is under development: Isabelle Aguler, the executive manager of Google confirms that Google is currently developing a mobile phone.  However, Isabel does not report that something will turn out from this project. <br><br>  * Google made some interesting purchases: In July 2005, Google acquired Android, a company that makes software for mobile phones. <br>  Also in 2005, Google bought Skia, a small company that focused on the development of 2D graphics engines for mobile devices.  Skia previously made a product called SGL, which is a ‚Äúportable graphics engine‚Äù. <br>  Google also acquired ReqWireless, an organization specializing in browsers and email software for mobile devices.  Many believe that Google has moved workforce from Android, Skia and ReqWireless to the Google phone development team. <br><br>  * Google plans to enter the field of data transfer protocols: Dave Gerard, vice president and general manager of Google, said that Google Talk will soon expand into VoIP and traditional phone systems.  Currently, Google Talk provides instant communication capabilities and allows users to make free PC to PC calls. <br><br>  * Google apps related to phones are shown everywhere: at the electronics show in Las Vegas, Samsung and Google announced that apps like Google search, Google Maps and Gmail will be built into Samsung phones.  This ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù seeks to develop the market from ‚Äúcomputer internet to mobile internet.‚Äù <br><br>  Motorola also noted.  They planned to sell devices with the Google logo, which will allow users to ‚Äúconnect directly to Google‚Äù for ‚Äúpersonalized personalized search.‚Äù The phones were scheduled to be released in early 2006, but so far this has not happened. <br><br>  Only a few months after the statement of Samsung, LG joined the leaders.  Their press release says, ‚ÄúLG ‚Äã‚Äãand Google will jointly sell LG-Google phones, and further expand their collaboration to develop more advanced digital products in the future.‚Äù <br><br>  * Google also presented interesting patents: In 2005, Google introduced a patent for an application that predicts what users will search based on their search history, geo-targeting and search time.  This functionality would apparently allow users to locate restaurants, entertainment centers, taxis, and the like that best fit them. <br><br>  In 2006, Google approved a patent for code division multiple access technology.  In other words, they have the technology to speed up the transfer of data through the phone and other mobile devices. <br><br>  Another patent describes technology that gives advertisements to mobile devices.  This advertisement, when activated, can make a call to the advertiser‚Äôs phone instead of directing the user to a new page. <br><br>  In April 2006, Google granted a patent for a technology that supports voice search.  This means that users can say out loud what they are looking for instead of typing it.  This functionality has been tested on PCs in Google labs, but they have the potential for mobile use. <br><br>  * Google attracts mobile experts: Google is looking for software developers and other new employees to promote the development of a ‚Äúnew innovative product.‚Äù <br><br>  * Executive Director Eric Schmidt knows that the mobile future is: when Eric Schmidt was asked about new technologies, he answered, ‚Äúmobile, mobile, mobile.‚Äù He noted that the mobile industry has the greatest prospects and areas of growth. <br><br>  Gossip: <br><br>  * More executive executives of Google speak of phone rumors: in less than a week later Isabel Aguilera confirmed that the mobile device was in research and development, other employees denied her words.  Richard Kimber stated: ‚ÄúAt the moment, we are more focused on software, not on the phone.‚Äù That is, the ‚Äúphone‚Äù exists. <br><br>  Vinton Cerf noted that this is outside of the active field for Google to undertake the development of a mobile device: ‚ÄúBecoming a hardware manufacturer is not our marketing model.‚Äù However, critics might argue that becoming an advertising giant is also outside the model for the company - which is also a software developer. <br><br>  The vice-president of R &amp; D at Google, Alan Eustace, confirmed the rumors about the phone, saying definitely, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make a mobile phone.‚Äù Rather, Eustace hoped to do something ‚Äúmore ... than another regular mobile phone,‚Äù and noted that Google thinking about how to use their applications in the mobile sector. <br><br>  * Analysts think that Google is developing software, not a cell phone: Gene Munster, an analyst at Jaffray, thought that Google is developing software for the iPhone and other mobile devices.  This software would include online search and maintenance, given the user's location.  This version coincides with the words of some representatives of Google, Samsung, Motorola and LG as well as with some of the patents that are presented by Google. <br><br>  Speculation: <br><br>  There is interesting information, but it has not been confirmed.  Despite the fact that the Google phone is not yet officially announced, there are a large number of assumptions on this topic.  What is real or not, only Google knows for sure. <br><br>  * Google has published a review about a phone designed by Samsung: the emblem in MobileBurn claims that it participated in a review for a Google phone designed by Samsung.  He ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to remove the snapshot with the specification of the phone, where it was clear that he had: Wi-Fi and a 2 megapixel camera.  Also on the other screenshots, you could see many details about the phone.  It includes: standard Google applications like Gmail, Maps, Blogger, a drop-down QWERTY keyboard and a screen that flips the image, depending on the position. <br><br>  * Google and Orange are negotiating: Orange, the European Telecommunications Group is negotiating with Google to conclude a ‚Äúmulti-billion-dollar‚Äú partnership ‚Äùto create a" GooglePhone " <br><br>  * High Tech Computer is currently producing a Google phone: DigiTimes reports that High Tech Computer (HTC) has begun to produce the GooglePhone, up to one million copies and a planned ending - the end of 2007. The phone will be released in 2008, with the support of Orange. <br><br>  * This is not a GPhone, this is ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù: <br>  Engadget announces the release of a phone that is a product of Google‚Äôs collaboration with Samsung.  The phone should have a touch screen, a universal system for Google Maps and Gtalk, which includes Gmail, text and instant messaging. <br><br>  * Google phone will be without internal memory: Engadget informs readers that an anonymous source said that the phone will not have any internal memory, which means that all applications will function via the Internet.  In this configuration, new applications can be connected to your account using the network interface. <br><br>  Venture capital investor Simeon Semenov quotes an internal source that says the phone will be similar to the Blackberry, with ‚Äúcore C ++,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimized for Java, and support VoIP. <br><br>  In general, if we analyze these facts and assumptions, then nothing concrete can be asserted.  In my opinion, Google will make advancements in the mobile sector, but whether this will result in a full-fledged mobile phone is not clear.  As they say time will tell ... </blockquote><br><br>  And just recently: <br><br>  <strong>Google is planning to announce its own mobile platform in the next two weeks.</strong>  <strong>It will be fully open and allow mobile device manufacturers to release Googlephone.</strong>  <strong>The release of the first such device is expected in mid-2008.</strong> <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2007/10/30/272725">Cnews</a> <br><br>  Thus, an official statement from Google should appear very soon.  Will wait‚Ä¶ <br><br>  via <a href="http://googlephones.ru/" title="Google phone">GooglePhones.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15660/</a></p>
