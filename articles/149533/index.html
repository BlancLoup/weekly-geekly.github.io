At least, there is such a model in the Sony Xperia lineup: this place is rightly occupied by 3.7-inch Sony Xperia Sola, which my hands finally reached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd0/130/df2/fd0130df21e81cd36f402f7ecc51da32.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Unlike the rest, emphasized 2012 Sony Xperia models of 2012, Xperia Sola is made in a more classical style - a model with such a design could enter the market a year or two ago - but at the same time Sola does not look like a guest from the past.  Surely many buyers will like this design - trendy design and outdated faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcd/985/cc5/dcd985cc5d9d04a50673c73de8b6137d.png">

      Form factor Sola is a two-volume monoblock.  The two-volume is achieved by the "outstanding" screen, under which a kind of "shelf" is formed.  This is not only stylish, but also convenient: it can be used as a thumb rest, to avoid accidentally pressing the ‚Äúhard‚Äù touch keys of the device, which could happen by chance while watching a video or during a game, for example. <br><br>  Along the perimeter of the display is framed by a strip of glossy plastic - this is the only, apart from the display itself, brand part of the smartphone.  The rest of the body is made of matte finish.  To the touch it is some kind of smooth soft-touch - the surface is not hard, but devoid of its noble velvety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cac/c45/851/cacc458510c973db87dce0c9bdcc1edc.png"><br><br>  Under the base of the display is an LED that blinks white when you turn on the screen or press any button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a4/2f0/867/5a42f0867dc10e3b9756b4980d3bf6b2.png"><br><br>  The volume buttons and the camera are located on the right, there is a microUSB connector located there: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/183/6a3/58e/1836a358eaddc68985c24112566f8863.png"><br><br>  On the left is only the power button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbd/a95/5c6/cbda955c6339c56604d03821763c2d2e.png"><br><br>  The upper end occupied a 3.5-mm audio jack, the bottom - a microphone and an eye for a strap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1b/56c/825/b1b56c825389026e350845f1d19153bf.png"><br><br>  On the back cover, at the very bottom, there is a speaker, a little higher - a sticker with the inscription NFC, orienting the user to the location of the NFC-module of the smartphone (Near Field Communication technology has a small radius of action, so this prompt will not be superfluous). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b6/de0/b2d/3b6de0b2d4a16cad6f0abc7e99708af3.png"><br><br>  Next to the camera lens is the second microphone, which is responsible for noise reduction.  The stamp around the camera is a little out of the general Sola style and looks, in my opinion, slightly archaic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a0/fdc/4df/5a0fdc4df67c0ef80ce4bf56c0dcaf9e.png"><br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a0/de6/957/7a0de69579b59a3629ca121824dbff8b.png"><br><br>  In a black and white case, in addition to the smartphone itself, were packed: <br>  1. Wired stereo headset <br>  2. Charger unit <br>  3. USB data cable and charging <br>  4. NFC tags Xperia SmartTags (2 pcs.) <br><br><h4>  Insides </h4><br>  With a slight movement of the hand we shift the cover 5 millimeters up and remove it.  Inside, there is a connector for a standard-size SIM-card (yes, now we have to clarify this) and - a rare guest in the Sony Xperia 2012 models - a connector for microSD.  Waited, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cb/14a/7ce/0cb14a7ce42d4e86e9b6bc9184007c58.png"><br><br>  The non-removable battery is already quite in the traditions of the current model year. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The Xperia Sola display has very decent characteristics for its class: 854x480 resolution with a 3.7 ‚Äùdiagonal allows you to fit enough content or applications on the screen, while ensuring no visible pixelation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c2/116/962/6c2116962bb5cf1c63a5a7ba6412dc31.png"><br><br>  The brightness is sufficient, but no more than that - it is not necessary to wait for miracles from the TFT-matrix. <br>  However, the main feature of the screen Sola in technology floating touch - touchscreen, controlled without direct touch. <br><br><h4>  Soaring touch </h4><br>  The soaring touch on Xperia Sola is used to highlight the links in the smartphone‚Äôs native browser without a direct touch: when the finger hovers over the link, it is highlighted as if you hover the cursor.  This solution should reduce the distance between desktop and mobile browsers for ease of navigation: first, due to the size of the screen of smartphones, you have to either poke links at random, or perform an additional action for a click - for example, increasing the page area with a link.  Secondly, one of the scenarios of using the mouse in desktop browsers is the detection of clickable elements on the page - highlighting the links in Xperia Sola allows you to do this in a mobile browser.  If you hold your finger over the page, the links ‚Äúblink‚Äù, as if you were just hovering over them.  Blinked - count selected.  This is especially well seen in the example of sites where hover links are highlighted in a contrasting color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e6/4f0/f8a/9e64f0f8a038fdf0e7ce827497ac6e66.png"><br><br>  On the example of Habr, with his two shades of pale, it would look, of course, worse, because  Links are highlighted or highlighted with an underscore not by the means of the browser, but on the side of the site itself - that is, targeting the link is noticeably just as much as its developers decided to make it. <br><br>  However, floating touch basically allows you to see which link the user clicks on.  The click itself is carried out traditionally - a short tap on the link. <br><br>  Technologies have room to grow: for example, it would be nice if the soaring touch, in addition to static highlighting of links, could be operated with simple gestures - for example, scrolling.  Also worth expanding the list of supported applications. <br><br><h4>  Xperia Smart Tags </h4><br>  Xperia Sola is part of a club of smartphones that support the NFC wireless protocol.  This is the fifth Sony model this year - NFC is also on Xperia S, Xperia P, Xperia acro S and Xperia ion.  However, Sony Xperia Sola is the first smartphone that got me to the test along with Smart Tags smart tags, so I can tell you more about them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6a/b9d/1f9/e6ab9d1f954c3c7f65994c06ed4cd6e7.png"><br><br>  All Xperia Sola are sold with the two NFC tags included.  Each label can be programmed to a number of functions that allow, if desired, completely change the configuration of the phone.  Labels are managed using a special widget that can be placed on one of the five Xperia Sola desktops. <br><br>  Turn on NFC, bring the smartphone to the part where the sticker with the inscription NFC is located (did you remember its location? - you can break it) to the label.  When you first start the application will ask you to set up a label-driven configuration. <br><br>  In the future, you just need to touch the label to activate the specified settings.  For example, at home you need Wi-Fi and the call sound turned on, and on the street - a vibrating alert and data transmission over a mobile network (3G / GSM).  No question: put in a pocket, say, jeans or a jacket, a label programmed for the ‚ÄúStreet‚Äù configuration (by default one label is called ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, the second is ‚ÄúBedroom‚Äù, but you can change the names, as you understand) - when going outside, put your Xperia Sola in your pocket, the street configuration of the settings will start. <br><br>  Came back home?  We touched the label "House".  Tags have an eyelet so that you can hang them on the strap.  Also included are two adhesive patches - stick a circle to the label, remove the protective film from the back side and now you can stick the label itself anywhere.  For example, I stuck the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù label on the doorphone receiver in the hallway ‚Äî very convenient: I went home, ran the phone next to it, and made my home settings.  Previously, always annoyed by the need to switch hands from 3G to wi-fi.  The only caveat: the screen of the smartphone must be unlocked, otherwise the label will not work.  A short blink of the vibration motor and a pop-up window with a report on the running functions will report the trigger: <br><br><h4>  NFC payments </h4><br>  Of course, managing the settings of a smartphone using tags does not limit NFC - you can transfer files with it, watch the rest of the trips on the travel card in the metro (Moscow at least) and, of course, make payments - we recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/144211/">wrote</a> about the NFC payments set MTS - a SIM-card with an MTS Money credit card attached to it.  Sony Xperia Sola was the first smartphone officially tested by MTS to support this service, and in one of the following reviews I will tell how it works in practice. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  <b>Antutu Benchmark measurement results:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4b/555/414/b4b555414c1af5e429b9a4167c2f84b6.png"><br><br>  On board the smartphone battery capacity of 1320 mAh.  It would be a crime against the truth of xazat, which is a lot, but Xperia Sola‚Äôs brutal appetite is no different, therefore, there is enough phone mode in moderate use for a day.  However, I have never been able to moderately use telephones, so I put the battery in about five hours.  However, I have included: 3G, player and auto-synchronization of mail + often maps or a browser work. <br><br>  <b>Battery test results:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c3/929/9d7/4c39299d7cf66399bb71b738e19682d2.png"><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 116 x 59 x 9.9 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 107 g <br>  <b>Display:</b> 3.7 ‚ÄùReality Display with Mobile BRAVIA Engine technology, scratch-resistant glass <br>  <b>Resolution:</b> 854 x 480 pixels <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Dual-Core 1 GHz STE U8500 <br>  <b>OS:</b> Google Android 2.3.7 with upcoming update to Android 4.0 <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 8 GB internal (5 GB user available) + microSD card support up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 5 MP, video up to 720p <br>  <b>Wireless protocols:</b> NFC <br>  <b>Body colors:</b> black, white or red <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  In this review, I decided to do without identifying the strengths of the Xperia Sola.  To bring out the pros and cons in his character is a rather difficult task, because  there are neither bright features nor serious failures.  He is not big and not small, not powerful and not weak, not a dandy, but also not a freak. <br><br>  The chip Xperia Sola is that it is just a smartphone.  Perhaps this is his main plus.  The screen, features, capabilities - all at the level that you expect from a respected brand of modern phone: no compromises, but without trying to jump above your head;  Four plus in all subjects.  He has everything he needs, but there is nothing superfluous, including those excesses that form the individuality of the product.  But you should not regret it.  Phones with a twist on the market enough.  Being practically at the forefront of the balance of price / quality, its consumer Sola is an almost perfect mass smartphone.  On average, on Yandex.Market it costs <a href="">10-11 tr.</a>  Looks good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149533/</a></p>
