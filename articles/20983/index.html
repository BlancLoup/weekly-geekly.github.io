  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to speed up Windows Vista</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of us are on duty or need to deal with the new operating system from Microsoft.  As you know, it is very demanding on system resources: video card, RAM, and processor speed.  However, the situation can be slightly corrected.  There are standard ways to speed up Windows Vista on the existing hardware.  These are generally well-known methods that are familiar to us from previous versions of Windows. <br><br>  Of course, no optimization will make Vista work as fast as on the fastest processor with several gigabytes of RAM and an expensive video card.  But if Windows XP worked fast on your computer and Vista was slow, these tips can help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Clean house </h1><br>  One of the main causes of ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù in the system is a lot of extraneous applications that run in the background and clog up RAM.  Need to get rid of all unnecessary. <br><br>  <b>Disable unnecessary services</b> <br>  Services are background processes that are activated completely unnoticed and without notice.  Since Vista is trying to start as many processes as possible by default, there are surely unnecessary ones among them.  To destroy them, run the command interface via <i>Start</i> - <i>Run</i> and run the <i>services.msc</i> command.  A list of services will appear on the screen.  Double-click to display the properties of each of them.  There you can change the download settings, including disable the default download. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Here are some examples of services that you hardly need: <i>Secondary Logon</i> , <i>Remote Registry</i> , <i>Computer Browser</i> , <i>KtmRm for Distributed Transaction Coordinator</i> , <i>Tablet PC Input Service</i> and <i>Distributed Link Tracking Client</i> .  There are dozens more.  Examine the list, use the search on the Internet by name. <br><br>  <b>Order on hard disk</b> <br>  Like most users, you probably have installed a lot of extraneous programs that eat up disk space.  To get rid of unnecessary programs, we can recommend the <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/">CCleaner</a> program, which works much faster and more qualitatively than the <i>Add / Remove application</i> tool native to Vista. <br><br>  <b>Load acceleration</b> <br>  When Vista starts, it automatically loads a bunch of programs, among which there are also unnecessary ones.  Using the <i>System Configuration Utility</i> or <i>Windows Defender,</i> you can restore order. <br><br>  In the first case, the procedure is as follows. <br>  1. Open <i>msconfig</i> (use the <i>Instant Search</i> function from the main menu: press the Windows key, type the word ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù and press Enter). <br>  2. Select the <i>Startup</i> tab. <br>  3. Disable objects that should not be loaded at system startup, and click <i>OK</i> . <br><br>  How to do the same with Windows Defender. <br>  1. Run Windows Defender. <br>  2. Select the <i>Tools</i> menu on the toolbar. <br>  3. Choose <i>Software Explorer</i> . <br>  4. <i>Show for All Users</i> . <br>  5. Select the application and the option for it: delete (Remove) or deactivate (Disable). <br><br>  <b>Defragment the hard drive</b> <br>  The fragmentation of files on the hard drive inevitably accumulates during the operation of the system.  Due to the fact that pieces of files are physically located in different places of the hard drive, the access time to files is slowed down, which depresses the work of the entire system.  Combining files into single clusters on a hard disk is called defragmentation. <br><br>  It must be said that Vista defaults in the background automatically once a week by default.  But it looks like a disservice, because the absolute majority of users do not need to defragment files so often, and this process greatly affects system performance.  Therefore, it is better to disable the automatic start of the process altogether and start the defragmentation manually as necessary. <br><br>  To manually start defragmentation, open the <i>My Computer</i> folder, right-click on the desired drive, select <i>Properties</i> and the <i>Tools</i> tab, where you will see the <i>Defragment Now</i> command. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the Vista Vista defragmenter is deprived of many additional important options that we are used to since XP, so for better defragmentation you need to resort to using specialized programs, for example, the free <a href="http://www.auslogics.com/en/software/disk-defrag/download">Disk Defrag</a> utility from Auslogics. <br><br><h1>  Use ReadyBoost </h1><br>  ReadyBoost is one of the most attractive features of Windows Vista.  Simply put, it allows you to use any external drive to store cache memory.  For example, you can take a fast USB flash drive and Vista will dump memory dumps on it.  All information is automatically encrypted, so even if the flash drive is lost, your secrets will remain with you. <br><br>  In some cases, the ReadyBoost feature can speed up the operating system, but this is not an alternative to upgrading the operating memory, of course. <br><br><h1>  Use vLite </h1><br>  To radically free up space on the hard drive, you can install the free program <a href="http://www.vlite.net/">vLite</a> .  It reduces the size of the distribution of the operating system by about two times, eliminates without a trace a number of components, such as Windows Media Player, Windows Mail, Windows Photo Viewer, MSN components, desktop wallpaper and SlideShow.  This saves gigabytes of hard disk space. <br><br><h1>  Acceleration "Vista" on old computers </h1><br>  Chic Vista graphical user interface is pleasing to the eye, but it gives a very heavy load on the central processor and video card.  Because of this, old computers can ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  It is not necessary to upgrade, you can simply change the system settings. <br><br>  * Get rid of Aero.  The operating system will disable this interface itself if it considers your computer's graphics card to be too weak.  However, this may not happen.  Then launch the <i>Window Color and Appearance</i> window (right click on the desktop) and select the item ‚Äú <i>Open classic appearance properties for more color options‚Äù</i> .  There you can choose other options besides Aero. <br><br>  * As a less radical option, simply turn off the <i>glass transparency</i> option, which is responsible for the bulk of memory usage. <br><br>  * Another option to reduce the load on resources is to disable animation and other visual effects. <br><br>  * Disable <i>Sidebar</i> , because the widgets also want to RAM, and disabling will allow even more speed up the operating system. <br><br>  via <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Speed_Up_Windows_Vista">Wired How-To Wiki</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20983/</a></p>
