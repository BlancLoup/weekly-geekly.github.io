Having comprehensively studied the stool specimens of the subjects, the scientists obtained an extensive knowledge base on how various foods affect the intestinal microflora and its effect on the health of people in general. <br><br>  The uniqueness of this study is the study of data on the state of the intestinal microflora in healthy people.  Previous work of this kind affected only patients with specific diseases.  In addition, the study involved an unusually many subjects.  The researchers also studied not one and not several species of microorganisms, but compiled a complete DNA analysis of the entire microflora.  The resulting database will help explore the many dependencies and bring scientists closer to understanding the principles of the body. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thanks to the data obtained, it is clearly seen how diet affects the state of the intestinal microflora.  For example, regular consumption of yogurt, buttermilk (low-fat cream), wine and coffee increases its diversity.  Whole milk or a high-calorie diet reduces the diversity of microflora.  In total, scientists found about 60 factors affecting the microflora. <br><br>  Researcher Alexandra Zhernakova, who participated in the work, explains that it is still difficult to draw final conclusions about the relationship between the components of diet and health - it is definitely only known that the higher the variety of microflora, the better for humans.

      In addition, the effect of 19 types of drugs on a variety of microflora has been found - moreover, these funds are among the very common ones.  For example, it has been established that antacids (agents for reducing acidity) reduce the diversity of microflora. <br><br>  The lead author, Cisca Wijmenga, comments on the findings: ‚ÄúDiseases are often the result of many factors.  Most of them, such as heredity or age, we can not change.  But we can change the diversity of microflora, changing diet or changing medication.  When we understand how this works, new opportunities will open up. ‚Äù <br><br>  It has long been known that the intestinal microflora greatly affects human health.  Recent experiments have shown that, for example, obesity can be controlled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_bacteriotherapy">fecal bacteriotherapy</a> .  Scientists secrete microflora colonies from the chair of slender people and inject them into the intestines of obese people, thereby achieving the desired result.  It is possible that the correct construction of the diet and the choice of drugs will be able to have a similar positive effect. <br><br>  The University of Groningen is one of the most prestigious and at the same time the largest and oldest universities in the Netherlands.  Located in the city of the same name.  Founded in 1614, has since graduated more than 100,000 students.  It has 9 faculties and 9 inter-faculty research centers and institutes.  He is a member of the Coimbra Group (an association of European universities, created in 1985 to develop ties and coordinate the educational process in line with the common European educational policy between the oldest and most important universities in Europe, which began functioning in 1987). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393747/</a></p>
