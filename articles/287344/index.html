  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rabbits as a media tool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Hollywood Reporter newspaper <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i3ed53000aa8dfb5170f08c316f851714">reported</a> on Thursday a new upcoming project from Yahoo.  The Internet giant plans to make its popular, but ‚Äúdry‚Äù information resource Yahoo News more ‚Äújuicy‚Äù by adding a prefix called Odd News Underground - a video podcast in which a professional journalist will talk about the news, dressing them in the form of songs of different clockwork genres. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yahoo spokesperson Scott Moore (Scott Moore) asked to take the project more seriously, although he promised that the presenter‚Äôs outstanding singing and stage talent would force listeners to ‚Äútap out‚Äù of his melody.  Although his identity is still kept secret, Moore said that this person is quite famous. <br><br>  News will be selected only positive.  And this is all that is known about the repertoire of the singer-reporter.  Whether he will sing about the US administration, the election campaign, Jobs and Gates, Windows and Linux, as well as dozens of other ‚Äúslippery‚Äù topics, or limited to obviously funny gossips and curiosities - this is still shrouded in mystery.

This name appeared and became a household name after the now defunct British TV channel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%2521VE_TV">L! VE TV appeared on the air of</a> one interesting news program. <br><br>  The program itself would be unremarkable if it were not for the hefty redhead with pink ears, which constantly loomed in the background during the narration of the announcer and the reports from the street.  His function (of course, he is a man dressed in a suit) was to emotionally paint the passionless words of the presenters: he showed his thumb and positively waved his paws if it was about something good, and wistfully lowered his eyes and hung his ears if the news was sad. <br><br>  During the three years of his life, the News Rabbit became famous all over Britain, managed to light up in one frame with the Prime Minister and a whole bunch of celebrities, and as a result he himself became known as the ancestor of a whole trend in television.  His "colleagues" later became girls in bikinis, throwing darts at a map of the country during meteorological forecasts, which the comic led, as well as other characters, designed to attract the audience to the poor but ambitious cable channel. <br><br>  Even before the closure of L! VE TV in 1999, television producers around the world tried to adopt the ideas of its creator Kelvin MacKenzie (Kelvin MacKenzie).  In Russia, the most famous such project was the ‚ÄúNaked Truth‚Äù program on the Moscow M1 channel, the host of which was slowly undressed during the news release.  But these ideas found wide popularity only with the development of broadband Internet and the Internet TV that came with it, when it became possible to get a wide audience for comparatively small money. <br><br>  And now even Yahoo itself took up the breeding of "rabbits".  Whether this company will be able to raise the business of turning news into entertainment to a qualitatively different level - we will find out about this in March. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287344/</a></p>
