We worked hard throughout the winter and prepared a rather large spring update.  It will take place in two stages and will be stretched in time for several weeks.  The first stage, which we decided to talk about today, is accompanied by a photo of a chocolate cake with the Habrahabr logo and hints at something about the cakes, sometimes referred to in the context of the site in one way or another. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  From centralization to decentralization </h4><br>  From today, all registered users, instead of the usual main page with posts that have been swabbed from all the blogs, will see a new habranth renamed the tape - an old, but not very popular section of the site that suddenly got a second wind. <br><br>  As before, only posts from blogs to which the user is subscribed are broadcast in the feed.  On the right on the page are available settings that allow you to quickly change the subscription and customize Habr to your liking.  Now you can read only blogs about programming, or about layout and administration.  You can read about project management, and if you are only interested in a blog about algorithms - please, there will be only algorithms.  How to set up - so be it.  By choosing the right blogs, you automatically subscribe to them - you no longer need to do it manually, by going to each blog separately. 
      <br>

      To make the new tape the main section of the site, we had to try.  For all the time, 992 blogs were created on Habr√©, many of which were unclaimed through the prism of reality.  To bring order to all this chaos, we started a "big wash" - first, we deleted all empty blogs, of which there were more than 200 pieces.  Then we figured out the blogs, where there were only a few posts, or that have not been updated for a long time.  When it became more free, we began to combine similar blogs (there were a lot of them, too), and the content of the frankly ‚Äúleft‚Äù (going beyond the subject of the site) merged into a specially created blog ‚ÄúSubconsciousness‚Äù (at the moment it is the largest blog on the site). , but this is not a reason to publish in it everything that is found in the subconscious).  After several days of manual sifting and gluing, slightly less than 300 blogs remain. <br><br>  Then we removed administrators and moderators from blogs - ‚Äúvigilant‚Äù administrators and moderators still did not notice this, but otherwise there was more harm than good from this function. <br><br>  The final stage of refactoring was the reorganization of blogs.  We examined the available categories and concluded that some of them are superfluous, and some, on the contrary, are not enough.  So we removed the unnecessary, added the necessary and then redistributed all the blogs to new categories.  In connection with this event, we strongly recommend that you explore the "new" blogs, for which you simply go through the entire list and subscribe to what you are interested in - now with high probability all blogs will be "alive".  We also hope that now there will be no confusion when choosing a blog while creating a post - everything has become more or less straightforward.  But if you have ideas on reorganization or suggestions on topics for new blogs - please contact <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/3753/">here</a> . <br><br>  In general, we got what we wanted - a fairly clear and expandable structure, with a clear focus on information technology. <br><br><h4>  How to read the "old" homepage? </h4><br>  Now Habrahabr can remember which tab was opened last: ‚ÄúRibbon‚Äù, ‚ÄúAll‚Äù, ‚ÄúThematic‚Äù or ‚ÄúCorporate‚Äù.  The next time you visit the main page of Habr, the tab that was opened last will be available by default.  Thus, registered users can customize the output of the main page and read either all posts, or a feed, or only corporate blogs - whatever you like. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  - Updated administration panel for corporate blogs.  Now it will be easier for companies to analyze the interest and relevance of their articles and make appropriate adjustments in their work; <br>  - The field for writing comments, answers to questions and comments to the answers appeared buttons most popular tags; <br>  - For users with the icon "Old-Timer", "Author", "Star" and "Legend", the option "do not show ads" appeared (see the section "Privacy"); <br>  - The user profile has the opportunity to leave a secret note that will be visible only to the author; <br>  - In the search on the site, it became possible to search the query in other search engines (Yandex, Google and Bing); <br>  - In the section "Q &amp; A" appeared your search - we do not know how you used to live without it; <br>  - Freed-up users can now also save posts in drafts; <br>  - The rubricator now displays the number of blogs in each category; <br>  - Large pictures in the comments are now also scaled; <br>  - In the RSS feed comment now displays the title of the post; <br>  - Fixed "404" errors in the "Invites" and "Summary" sections; <br>  - Fixed bug with saving resume; <br>  - Current changes in the reference section; <br>  - Several dozen small ficuses throughout the site, which you will not even notice. <br>  - Made RSS for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/rss/bloglist/">new blogs</a> <br><br>  While this is all we are ready to talk about.  The second part of the spring update will be in a few weeks.  Stay tuned for updates and do not forget to subscribe to the blog with announcements, if not already subscribed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115700/</a></p>
