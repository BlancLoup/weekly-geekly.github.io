  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attraction of unprecedented generosity from Amazon. Once again about technical support</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3c/b83/19c/b3cb8319c63d698c6d9f5697fe11cedb.jpg"><br>  It all started with the fact that my Kindle crashed.  That is how he crashed ... he was lying on the bed, charging himself, and then he accidentally sat on it.  Or lay down, I do not remember.  In general, the poor device was subjected to pressure.  And, as it should be a gentle screen, E-Ink Pearl flowed. <br>  My feelings can only be expressed by the first picture of the post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It looked very sad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d45/adb/b21/d45adbb21a1b70009a6210f7114574f3.jpg"><br><br>  And how much is not encouraging: the reader was acquired from the hands at a local auction.  The fact that she was registered to me then did not inspire me with great hopes. <br>  So, having learned and read about Amazon's magical tech support, I firmly decided - we must try.  The only question was how to contact technical support.  You can, for example, write a letter to them, but it‚Äôs still necessary to find where to write, moreover, usually an e-mail can be processed for a long time.  Calling is usually problematic, because by the ear English is still perceived with difficulty. <br>  Therefore, having rummaged on the Amazon website, I found the Live chat function, which provides online communication with technical support through the similarity of ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù. <br>  When communicating with the manager, there were almost no language difficulties.  I explained that I purchased the Kindle in February of this year, that it stopped working, that stripes went across the screen and in general half of it is not visible. <br>  I was informed that my Kindle was under pressure, broken and could not be repaired.  And another important detail: they can replace me completely for free, but they do not deliver goods to Russia, so I need to provide the address in the US.  And, <b>as an exception, I do not need to return my broken Kindle</b> .

    <blockquote>  Roman: And I need to send you my device right? <br>  Sathish (CSA): Yes, I need it. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Last I was very surprised, but not embarrassed.  Tech Support did not even request photos of a breakdown, purchase receipt, packaging, or something like that.  They just took my word at the first opportunity.  It was sooooo nice. <br>  I registered the box for hiss, once again contacted support via Live chat, briefly explained the situation again, provided a new address, and a new Kindle appeared in my orders! <br>  By the way, the old one was deactivated and disconnected from the service, but the books on it were still read, albeit half. <br>  Also, the manager informed me that if I want, I can send a broken device to the USA, but at the same time I will pay postage.  I think in a short time I will honestly send so that my conscience is clear. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  In the end, almost a month after sending the order, I received a brand new Kindle, after the announcement of Kindle Paperwhite.  But I do not regret, and I consider my reading room if not the best, then one of the best.  By the way, I also ordered a case to minimize the risk of repeated pressure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/967/2bc/523/9672bc5234c81682c7f4deb33acfc8e0.jpg"><br><br>  I believe that such a wonderful attitude to users who have not bought anything from Amazon, even books, shows the high status of the company itself, shows that the customer is in the first place for them. <br>  And just want to deal with them further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151694/</a></p>
