      - Well, what are you?  Come on, we will have soft skills now! <br><br>  - I can not hurry! <br><br>  - Why? <br><br>  With extremely focused facial expression: <br><br>  - It's so important!  One of these decisions can change the world ... <br><br>  What this dialogue was about and what decision could change the world, it became clear a little later. <br><br><h3>  Learn to start up </h3><br>  This year, EPAM and the Education for the Future Association are repeating a unique experience, opening the second shift of the educational camp, practically a business incubator.  We hope that this is the beginning of a beautiful tradition.  One hundred children from 12 to 14 years old from small towns and villages of the Minsk region, children with disabilities, UNHCR wards and SOS-villages Borovlyany study - discover the whole world of it-technologies.  And they do it with a clearly visible pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f5/22f/2d4/1f522f2d461f486056c8a18aee40956c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The learning process is very intensive - three pairs per day (four and a half hours).  Couples include three main blocks: IT-block, which includes robotics and programming Scratch, English and soft skills.  The volunteers of the camp say: ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt even such a case when one of the children was skipping classes.  Usually they just run there.  And the parents, who come, are very surprised how it happened so to ignite the children. ‚Äù <br><br>  On the other hand, why don't the guys catch on fire?  Same not school lessons in habitual classes.  IT couples are held in a real (or almost real) laboratory, and classes in the development of communication skills are held in the fresh air and look no less fascinating than the usual games in nature.  The guys emotionally tell: ‚ÄúI like the most that the lessons are not like school ones.  The school does not say this.  And interesting entertainment programs!  And English!".  13-year-old Kirill complements his colleagues: ‚ÄúEvery day I find out something.  And cool teachers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81f/461/eeb/81f461eebef3b530f9c1caa73d138085.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of games.  Surprisingly, after class, the guys do not run scrawling from side to side.  There is quite a working environment here, children are discussing something with heat and drive.  It turns out that there is also extra-curricular workload.  And novice engineers gladly "load" themselves.  Children are divided into study groups according to the level of the English language, so that they can study more easily and comfortably, and into groups.  Each squad is engaged in its own startup - these are the very classes outside the classroom.  The guys spend several hours a day developing a concept, marketing strategy, and presenting a project in Russian and English.  And in the end, they will pitch these projects to investors.  Full cycle: from idea to pitch in six days. <br><br><h3>  Smart windows and kids without pressure </h3><br>  In order for the guys to understand what a startup is all about, how to prepare it and what it is with, they are taught every step of the work from the very beginning of their classes.  Everything is like in adults: the idea needs to be generated and visualized, teams of young developers make presentation videos for investors and for the target audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba1/0d4/145/ba10d414502cb10bb5b834eef839064e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But what about the numbers?  How is the scalability of the project?  Not forgotten about it.  The guys really release the project "turnkey": they prescribe the necessary resources, partners, decide which bloggers to attract to promote the product.  And can make a commercial offer, for example, for the plant "Neman" and enlist their support?  All this is left to the discretion of the team.  Hands untied, restrictions, except for the subject - no.  The main thing to remember is that upon completion of the work, your project will need to be defended before real investors. <br><br>  <b>(By the way, this year the guys set a condition: start-ups must solve any environmental or socio-economic problem)</b> <br><br>  Here, for example, the project "Smart window", which analyzes the temperature outside the window or the situation at home, and closes itself from the weather or when the child approaches.  But the project for disinfecting dishes, which can be integrated into offices, schools, social institutions, and even solve the problem of using plastic at the same time ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/328/ddf/2dd/328ddf2dd20a85e87f4f86434dbe1015.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are lots of options.  Project presentations were posted at the entrance to the dining room, and it was they who had the dialogue mentioned at the beginning.  Still, maybe one of the authors will change the world once.  But, despite such exciting prospects, the future Ilona Mask needs to be distracted.  For this, workshops are held in the camp.  They are conducted by both invited specialists and specialists who work here.  The range of topics is wide: and handmade, and sports, and dance, and game design, and mathematics.  Surprisingly, mathematics is especially popular among children.  "Really like.  The school can overwhelm.  No motivation.  It‚Äôs also interesting and desirable to understand, ‚Äùsay the guys. <br><br>  Masha, 14 years old: ‚ÄúI like everything!  Attitude from teachers, the lessons themselves!  But most of all I like the camp atmosphere itself, when everyone is friends with you, everyone is friendly, and the teachers are trying to make the lessons much more interesting than at school. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/862/11e/35a/86211e35a7f92c6b45215340efb26761.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the middle of the shift, the children receive another task: to organize their own master class.  They decide what their talent is, prepare the program, and share their experiences with each other. <br><br>  Master classes are vocational guidance, the opportunity to try yourself in different roles, to see different professions from the inside.  The social component is also present here - not only in the master classes, but throughout the camp as a whole.  Tell about it in more detail. <br><br><h3>  "The road to any area that children do not choose" </h3><br>  The IT camp is an opportunity to acquaint children with certain barriers and difficulties to get additional education with programming, robotics, to ‚Äúspark‚Äù interest in information technologies in children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/42d/814/49542d814d9593b9d4d0af43f640b641.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inna Efimchuk, Senior People Programs Specialist: ‚ÄúFor the second year in a row, EPAM, in partnership with the Association, has been making Junior Ignite Camp.  We support this kind of initiative to encourage children to continually replenish their knowledge, develop an interest in the exact sciences, and expand their understanding of the world of modern technologies and professions.  I would like to express my gratitude to our coaches, who, on an absolutely free of charge basis, work with children here and charge them with their enthusiasm, ability to learn and learn new areas of knowledge.  Naturally, not all children will go to IT, but it is important for us to teach them to work in a team, generate ideas and defend them, which will help work in any sphere, whatever they choose in their life. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421535/</a></p>
