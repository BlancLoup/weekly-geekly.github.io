I dare say that we have created a new way of providing any services.  More cost effective for almost all market participants.  We created a new phenomenon and called it ‚Äúgeolans‚Äù. <br><br>  As <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/modx/132802/">promised</a> , I will tell you about the service we planned with another.  This is a geo-service based on Google maps.  And he is involved in facilitating the task of selling services and searching for nearby artists.  And more specifically, it significantly reduces the cost of services for customers, while increasing the earnings of performers several times.  Due to: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  multiple acceleration and simplification of the search procedure; </li><li>  elimination of intermediaries between the customer and the performer; </li><li>  introducing a smart rating system. </li></ol>  But I'll start with the story of creation.  Once we sat up late, sipping a beer in the kitchen under a good conversation, and we (beer) did not have enough, and it was too lazy to go for an addition.  And laziness was so much so that in the end we did not go anywhere.  We then thought about it, but how can a person in general get an ordinary store item without leaving the house?  Ordering delivery from the store is not our option.  She will come tomorrow, it's too late.  Take advantage of delivery services of ready-made food?  But it is all the same long and expensive. <br><br>  And then it occurred to us that with a high probability somewhere in one of the apartments of the house in which we are, and in extreme cases in one of the apartments of the neighboring one, a young man sits and suffers from a lack of a moderate amount of money.  And this person would be happy to drive to the store and get a small fee for it.  For us it would have happened as quickly as going on our own, and inexpensive compared to all other options.  But the trouble is - we do not have any tools to find this person.  And he does not have the opportunity to find us.

      This problem extends to many areas of human life.  If my washing machine breaks, I‚Äôll have to look for an advertising expert.  And I will find him, he will go to me through half the town, take the money for the time spent on the road, and he also needs to pay for the advertisement.  But it is very likely that the same master is in my neighborhood.  Such a person could make a discount if he received a free order five minutes from home. <br><br>  We began to think about solving the problem in general.  It was clear that masters and clients should be placed on the map.  Moreover, the separation between them should not be - in fact, each person needs some services, and some can provide.  And there was also a need for a clever mutual rating algorithm that would protect service buyers from scammers and simply curved characters.  And it is also necessary to make sure that when I type the word ‚Äúplumber‚Äù, Uncle Vasya from my door would be my first extradition.  With whom I, of course, am not familiar.  And it would be good ... <br><br>  I will say briefly - we came up with a lot of things and some of this have already been implemented.  To date, we believe that our service is ready to appear before the general public and begin to perform its functions.  We have just completed the closed beta stage and now we invite you to participate in the open.  From the full-fledged work it will be distinguished only by the lack of paid services.  We will introduce them, but not before our child passes the test under combat conditions. <br><br>  We called the project in honor of the idea that visited us during that drinking.  So you are welcome to register on <a href="http://www.nehvatilo.com/">www.nehvatilo.com</a> <br><br>  PS <br>  Well, of course: buns! <br><ul><li>  We give all active participants in testing a lifetime bonus of 10% on account replenishment. </li><li>  And among these same participants, we play 3 lifelong professional accounts.  These accounts will get the three best testers. </li></ul><br>  PPS Sorry for the sandbox, I hope for help with the transfer to the thematic blog. <br>  UPD.  Transferred to "I am promoting", did not immediately work </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137647/</a></p>
