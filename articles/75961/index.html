  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The life cycle of one HYIP. It was all over as usual ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell you the life cycle of one average, as it turned out a short-term investment fund.  And so, it all started with the fact that I saw a banner on one reputable foreign publication.  It was an advertisement of an investment fund called Shiftmoney Inc. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wasn't going to invest money there, but I just remembered the name and the striking banner.  In the process of visiting other foreign ecom resources, I paid attention to the fact that absolutely everywhere, there is an advertisement of this company.  Became interesting.  The site was very pleasant, in the best traditions of this area, with smiling people, symbolizing the success of the company. <br>  In addition to the standard 3 tariff plans, there was something interesting, for example, every week the currency of the week was chosen and when investing money in this currency the client received + 5% of the amount on deposit.  Also interesting was the fact that the service, in addition to the usual for investment Liberty reserve and Perfect Money, also received Alertpay, Solidtrustpay and bank transfer.  For many, it seems to me, this was the impetus to start trusting their money to Shiftmoney. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/843/d82/30a843d8243171fbfc191e89811059c2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This is the first stage in the development of HYIP - the stage of creation and promotion of a fund (5.10-12.10) - this is not a tricky way.  Advertising was everywhere: on the forums, information portals, on the sites an interview was posted with the site administrator ... Excellent affiliate program ... All this prompted to invest money here.  First, HYIP monitors entered the ‚Äúbattle‚Äù, they also need to move somehow.  The promotion was going full speed, more and more new users were attracted, the cash flow began to flow into the company's pockets.  And here the most interesting begins.  After 5 days (10/16), the company's accounts in Alertpay and Solidtrustpay froze due to the fact that no verification documents were provided for verification.  As for bank transfers, it is actually impossible to obtain a license for this type of activity, so the company used intermediaries.  This of course scared away some people, but in spite of all this, new customers also appeared.  Successfully passed the second stage of life - the stage of rapid growth (12.10-16.10).  Then the saturation stage began (10.16-27.10) - new clients appeared less often, but the payments were stably carried out, many reinvested their funds into this program.  On October 27, 2009, a warning was posted on the <a href="http://www.ifsc.gov.bz/">website of the</a> International Financial Services Commission on Beyliz that Shiftmoney operates without any license and that it is a fraud.  And here it is, the last stage - the stage of divorcing everyone for money (27.10.- to this day).  Payments immediately ceased to be made, the site, just like support, became inaccessible, in general, everything ended as always. <br>  To summarize, you can say - be careful and attentive when you manage your money, otherwise someone else will dispose of you for you. </div>
