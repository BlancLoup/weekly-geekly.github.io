The note indicates possible measures that the state can take to make a breakthrough in the Russian innovation sphere. <br><br>  The share of innovative small enterprises receiving business angel and venture capital investments is negligible.  According to the RANEPA, venture investments are available for 1% of small enterprises and 7% for medium-sized enterprises, business angel investment for 1% of small enterprises and 5% for medium-sized enterprises.  But world practice shows that it is necessary to finance 10 ‚Äúseed‚Äù projects to obtain two of commercial interest for venture funds. <br><br>  Therefore, the Academy proposed to provide comprehensive support for business angel investment from the government. <a name="habracut"></a>  According to RANEPA, business angels also need help in shaping their positive image through the media and social networks.

      A special place in the concept of experts of the RANEPA is occupied by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing the position of an ombudsman for issues (ombudsman) of innovative entrepreneurs and venture investors.  Academy experts believe that innovation will provide honest conditions for both entrepreneurs and investors. <br><br>  Nikolai Kalykov, Director of the Expert Analysis Center of the RANEPA, explained the position of the RANEPA on this issue: <br><blockquote>  A person is needed who can be approached by both an entrepreneur and an investor, and who can assist them.  For example, during a series of interviews with entrepreneurs, which we conducted in different projects in 2015, we often heard the fears of start-up entrepreneurs regarding raising funds from private investors or funds, which, according to their words, can later take away a successful business.  And, perhaps, the innovator in some situations could even act as a guarantor. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúNow any such initiatives can be implemented through the Internet Development Institute.  As for the protection of the interests and property of investors and startups, in the first case I don‚Äôt recall a single fact of any raiding in the innovation sector, in the second case, the legislation needs to be refined so as to fix the parties ‚Äôfinancial and legal relations as quickly and simply as possible,‚Äù the manager says Partner <a href="http://rusve.com/">Russian Ventures</a> Evgeny Gordeev. <br><br>  But you can remember a fresh story about how a startup did not give money to the investor.  IIDF sued 1.3 million rubles from a startup who refused to give a stake for the investment, Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/10/29/614752-frii-poluchil-dolyu-odnom-profinansirovannih-startape">wrote</a> today.  In September 2014, the fund invested 700,000 rubles in the Media of the Future company in exchange for 3.5% in the authorized capital.  However, the company took the money, but did not give the share.  Another 600,000 rubles the fund requires for training the general director of the company Alexei Semenov in the accelerator. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur number of commissioners will soon become more than the number of protected ones.  It seems to me that this path is a dead end and not innovative.  The industry needs more systemic and rational policy of the state in taxes and finances, ‚Äùsays the head of the Internet Development Institute ( <a href="http://xn--h1aax.xn--p1ai/">IRI</a> ) Hermann Klimenko. <br><br>  The CEO of <a href="http://rusbase.com/company/moedelo/">the My Business</a> startup, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/594278">told</a> Izvestia that ‚Äúit is necessary to organize the acquisition and incorporation of successful startups into large state-owned companies,‚Äù and here the position of ombudsman ‚Äúwould be useful.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295840/</a></p>
