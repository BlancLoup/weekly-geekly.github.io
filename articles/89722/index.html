  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The second Ukrainian forum of Internet leaders Iforum (report + photos) was held in Kiev</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have just arrived from the second forum of Internet figures and I want to share a little of what I heard and a little more seen. <br><br>  The forum is held for the second time, the first time was last year and the second time it gathers the most active audience and the largest number of interesting speakers.  This is explained simply, unfortunately at the moment it is the only event of this format where you can hear something useful for yourself and meet interesting people.  The rest of such conferences held in Kiev have long been turned into a platform for self-promotion, where companies advertise with each other, as there are fewer regular users. <br><br>  The entire forum was divided into 4 streams (business, advertising, technology, and Web 2.0) and at first it was quite difficult to get people to disperse into the other sections.  As it turned out not in vain, most of the most interesting was in the central section about the Internet business.

      According to information from Alexey Masya, the event was attended by about 2,500 people, for comparison, there were about 1,000 last year. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  And what did they do there? <habracut><br><br>  The event began with the performance of Anton Nosik, known as dolboeb, before that I heard about him a lot of interesting things, so I expected to hear something unusual.  Alas, the expectations were not met.  The speech was a bit lethargic and he woke up only when questions came from the audience.  I just remembered telling about ebusiness :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/650/b7f/f33/650b7ff33ef3b6d9cc9515f68f2443fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e2/c74/7c1/0e2c747c1aab17e100b6112f600a34b3.jpg"><br>  2 iPhones and here it is happiness :) <br><br>  The next speaker was Victor Dostov from PayCash, who told how to successfully sell his business.  Conclusion: every Internet project has three stages: growth, flourishing and fading, and you need to have time to sell it at the flourishing stage.  Um, I wonder why nobody sells google, it's just in bloom :) <br><br>  Then Alexander Olshansky from Imena.uu told everyone that it was necessary to invest in the Internet right now and gave an interesting graph (alas, not a picture) on which the average statistics of domain sales was displayed, by company names, where failure was clearly visible during the general crisis and recent growth. several months. <br><br>  The speech was also remembered by a well-thought-out advertising gimmick, constantly striving to escape with the letter M :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6af/e78/738/6afe787387c28a91773e4273a4846bda.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f4/cf3/6de/2f4cf36ded109890e22b32054405f510.jpg"><br><br>  The chip with the letter worked - everyone noticed and remembered the site address. <br><br>  I liked the presentation of Gleb Kaplun about ‚ÄúBootstrapping‚Äù the main conclusion of which: if you are a start-up, it is better to tighten the belt at the beginning and attract investments to an already finished project, then you can save 2 times more share of yourself than when attracting investments at the first stage. <br><br>  What else is remembered from the reports: <br><h6>  Reports about the development of applications for mobile devices. </h6><br>  The average cost of developing applications for Iphone is about 5-7 thousand dollars, for a winmobile and androit 1.5 p more expensive, for J2ME 2 times and no one develops for it. <br>  According to statistics, Iphone accounts for 40% of mobile traffic in Ukraine. <br><br>  While there was a discussion about the development for Iphone and other mobile platforms - people listened, as soon as it was about developing for Windows Mobile, some of the listeners got up and left. <br><br>  As it turned out not in vain, because ‚ÄúWindows mobile is dead‚Äù and this is official information from the mouth of speaker Sergei Baidachny, a development specialist from Microsoft Ukraine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06b/34b/068/06b34b0683c1f10c5d6f9f6306ee2190.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, I am still surprised by their progress, with the new Windows Phone platform.  Well, yes, the current platform is hopelessly outdated, at least at the interface level, but as HTC showed, it‚Äôs more than realistic to make a good shell for it, especially since a huge amount of software has already been written for it.  But there is no need to copy the Iphone and do a single-task closed system with the purchase of applications from the next "blah blah stor."  In my attempt to copy someone else's idea, the format has not led anyone to success. <br><br>  Another interesting requirement was stated for developers for a new platform: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24b/ffa/ab1/24bffaab1e676f8e9b9d617e8fa2709a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c73/e15/0ec/c73e150ec05a6bc9c70eae9699ca9d8f.jpg"><br>  From what you can actually conclude that the owners of the HTC HD2 are not threatened with an update then Windows Phone, probably fortunately. <br>  And the last requirement was the enchanting "and it should call." <br><br><h5>  Quotes that are remembered: </h5><br>  Dmitry Satin: "I called learn to engage users from porn sites" <br>  Dmitry Satin: ‚ÄúContent should go to the meeting for the user - under the cursor the content should change.  Let the user touch the site. ‚Äù <br>  Dmitry Satin: "The problem of news sites - the link is all" <br>  Igor Ashmanov: ‚ÄúSearch engines still work as text brokers and do not know the subject of the query and the meaning‚Äù <br>  Toast from Nosik: ‚ÄúWell, sir.‚Äù <br>  Alexander Olshansky: ‚ÄúIn the coming year, due to legislative initiatives, Ukraine will remain without User-generated content projects hosted in Ukraine‚Äù <br>  Alexander Olshansky: ‚ÄúAccording to a subjective assessment, it is worth $ 100-200K to create something from scratch in #ua, something worth buying +0‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Facts that are remembered: </h5><br>  - Promised Brodsky, almost the only politician independently leading the blog, the event propasoval. <br>  - P-host played a laptop, pulling out the winner on the collected business cards, and what a great way to advertise at such an event, the cost of the laptop is much lower than the cost of the sponsorship package, plus the business cards were collected from the audience, well done. <br>  - Annual turnover of the optimization market - 200 million dollars <br>  - The minimum check from Ashmanov: 80 thousand for promotion.  average check 120 thousand <br>  - Tweet the forum about 150 people, the most active: vanocomua, dyatel and zhem4yzhina <br><br><h6>  Just a couple of pictures: </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/012/ec9/f80/012ec9f80871e3eebec08974636e51af.jpg"><br>  Yabloko attracted attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04e/022/720/04e02272089e9be36d35a2ce6b95574c.jpg"><br>  And it just crawled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4a/7a2/0a7/b4a7a20a7dcd6a368b3ad75500255463.jpg"><br>  From left to right: Alexander Olshansky (Imena.UA), Victor Dostov (PayCash), Kirill Gotovtsev, Anton Nosik. <br><br>  ps You can read the broadcast from the event on Twitter using the hashtag #iforum <br>  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not physically possible to attend all the seminars, cloning is not perfect, so I wrote only about what I remember. <br>  pps crap for the quality of photos. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89722/</a></p>
