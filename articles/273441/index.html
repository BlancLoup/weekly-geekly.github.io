What it is?  This joint solution with VMware, which was fully calculated, varied, and comes as a kind of ready-made bundle, is designed in two versions, either for a certain number of electronic machines, or for a certain number of workplaces, i.e.  for solutions.  It comes with software, with licenses, it is integrated at the factory and this is such a complete module that you receive and simply deploy the infrastructure.  A little further we will show how effective it is, easy and simple.

      What does this give?  This gives you the opportunity not to think about how many virtual machines you need, how to calculate performance, you get it all from one manufacturer, i.e.  get support from one hand, well, and practically the deployment of a virtual environment already takes you not hours, but literally 15 minutes.  My colleague will show what it is and how it works. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What else gives the possibility of such a ready solution?  This is an opportunity to get a faster deployment, this is the ability to upgrade, upgrade, this is the ability to support and this is the possibility that you will have a continuous business, i.e.  you do not need to plan simple.  Well, of course, hardware - software support. <br><br>  This solution, it, as I said, is modular, i.e.  there is the possibility of expansion, and it is already fully tested, packaged and ready for deployment.  What is included?  This is the hardware and software from VMware, i.e.  This is a V-center, this is v-san, this is a vsphere enterprise, and, respectively, for a VDI infrastructure, this is a horizon view.  For support from Dell, you get hardware and software support, pro-port, i.e.  a single point of installation and optionally, you can either connect the existing network infrastructure, or we can offer the Dell Force 10 network switch. <br><br>  Those.  what the solution consists of, it is built on the basis of the PowerEdge line C, C series.  This is a modular solution consisting of several actions and is designed either for 250 virtual desktops or about 100 virtual machines.  The extension goes seamless, i.e.  add the same module in the future and you scale your solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/735/41e/268/73541e268e31469780c672809a56d7da.png"><br>  <i>Screenshot from the screen</i> <br><br>  This is how the hardware looks like.  This is practically a dual-unit platform, which may consist of two or four nodes with a certain calculation of processor and RAM and disk space for building infrastructure with ordinary disks, including the SSD drive for v-san.  Those.  The ability to quickly scale up about 15 minutes, since the entire presentation takes us, so I‚Äôll show this part in the pictures. <br><br>  When you turn on, you have access over the network, you configure the host name, network part, password, gigabyte network parameters, and then the entire infrastructure is built and validated. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lyHRu487hb0%3Ft%3D5m11s">05:11</a> This is how it looks in fact, i.e.  This is the process, it takes about 15 minutes and after this process is completed, you get access to a certain library of templates, after which you can create your virtual environment, your virtual structure. <br><br>  05:36 By management, it‚Äôs like a single console, i.e.  you can switch, make updates, create your own policies, we will show this in more detail in the demonstration.  Management, update, i.e.  all this from a single console. <br><br>  6:00 Well, the seamless scaling I mentioned, i.e.  when you add the same node, expand your infrastructure and practically you can build a structure for thousands of users or about 400 virtual machines. <br>  6:24 Thanks to this and now we will show how this works in real life. <br><br>  06:23 Good day to all.  My name is Bobkov Alexander.  I am an assistant engineering company Dell Ukraine. <br><br>  06:43 So  The standard authentication data that comes standard in VMware evo: rail is the root password, login: root, password: VMware! <br><br>  07:07 The current moment with us, I ask you to create the appliance itself and we already go directly to the appliance itself.  The connection organization is organized with the help of 3G Internet, so everything is not as fast as it might seem to us at first glance. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lyHRu487hb0%3Ft%3D7m41s">07:31</a> Now our console opens.  We click Create Wier.  A standard console appears, where we select About Image.  It is clear that at the moment there is a simplest image substituted in order to collect it as quickly as possible.  There is a copy of the data.  For evo: rail, VMware v-san is often required, which is essentially a VMware solution in the software-defined storage variant and allows you to combine several storage systems into a single virtual pool.  The process takes some time, but in principle, because  Our operating system is minimal, it is a fairly fast time. <br><br>  08:54 Well, basically, in a nutshell, I will tell the evo system‚Äôs very ideology: rail.  Her idea is that it is designed for enterprises of medium and large size, where, in general, there are sufficiently high-level system administrators and receive quite a lot of money.  And the idea is that when such administrators have a fairly large staff, commonplace tasks, such as creating or basic configuration of virtual machines, are quite time-consuming tasks.  Accordingly, evo: rail was invented for such purposes, due to which server resources, storage system resources, network resources can be consolidated into a single console, and these rights can be simplified to be delegated to an employee who does not have the appropriate configuration skills in VMware infrastructure. <br><br>  Now the data is copied.  As you can see, the VMware company worked quite well with the infra-framework, simplifying it as much as possible.  Immediately after the data is copied, we will proceed to the basic configuration of the very virtual machines that we will create.  Here is the progress. <br><br>  13:20 Understandably, we need to select an operating system from the list, in this case it will be Another operating system.  But as you can see, there are both desktop and server versions with operating systems on Linux.  We select the operating system, click continue, select the size of the virtual machine, in this case small for speed, select those networks that have been set up, for example, Production.  We select pre-predefined security policies that are removed, for example, take Security Policy 3. And we definitely need to name the virtual machine.  Let's call it VM. <br><br>  14:37 The virtual machine went to create.  In fact, the first virtual machine to be created.  It will be created faster than the data is copied.  And will immediately start at the same time. <br><br>  15:02 This virtual machine will be added to that console, as can be seen on the left side of its characteristics: one processor, one core, one gigabyte of memory, 16 gigabytes of disk space.  It is clear that medium large virtual machines will have more characteristics. <br><br>  15:43 As you can see, no additional settings are required, i.e.  these settings are already enough for the environment to create a virtual machine.  It will not be necessary to specify either file systems, or what devices will be connected there, or how the virtual machine itself and the virtual environment will work; everything is simplified in advance and configured. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lyHRu487hb0%3Ft%3D16m24s">16:12</a> Here is our virtual machine appeared in the environment.  As you can see, it has already loaded.  There is already a kind of console.  In this virtual machine, you can either enter it, or clone it, configure it, additionally stop it.  But this is with regard to the functionality of virtual machines.  You can also see the health settings of this infrastructure.  In this case, the settings for speed, memory load, storage system load, network environment usage graphs are shown.  Similarly, it is shown component by component, that everything really works in this virtual machine.  All these components, of course, can be deployed.  As here, for example, network adapters. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lyHRu487hb0%3Ft%3D17m21s">17:19</a> In the same way, because  everything should be simplified to the maximum, as I said beforehand, there is the possibility of preparing to change the faulty equipment.  If the system shows that you have something wrong, you can go into the hardware replacement, indicate that you have a problem, say, say, the hard drive is faulty.  Choose a hard drive.  We select it from the drop-down list and say to prepare a launch in order to replace this disk.  This process is irreversible, and pressing it once will prepare the host in maintenance mode, so for now we will not do it. <br><br>  18:23 Also, there is a system here that shows what is currently installed.  There is the possibility of an update.  In this case, both the hosts themselves and the evo: rail software itself will be updated and it is possible to plagiarize this system and see what has been done on this system. <br><br>  18:58 So you can see the virtual machine. Well, and, as you can see, on virtual machines it is quite possible to go here.  Those.  the system creates me some kind of host for a virtual machine, and a real acting image. <br>  On this, in fact, I have everything.
