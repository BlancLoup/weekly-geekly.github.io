      J. Koplien, Multi-Paradigm Design for C ++.  Library programmer.  - SPb .: Peter, 2005. p. 99, <br><br><blockquote>  5.1 About paradigms and objects <br><br>  The term ‚Äúparadigm‚Äù, which became known from the book by Kahn [Kuhn, 1970], entered the everyday life of software in connection with the popularization of the object paradigm.  A paradigm is a set of agreements in which we represent the world around us.  In software, paradigms define how we formulate abstractions.  What is your world made of?  Do you divide the world into procedures?  Data records?  Modules?  Or classes and objects? <br><br>  In practice, the paradigm defines the rules, means and agreements for dividing the world into separate understandable parts.  Paradigm objectives usually include a quality characteristic, roughly called modularity, which means that the analysis should create coherent abstractions with minimal cohesion.  If abstractions are independent, then their owners can develop them separately, without interfering with each other.  If we assume that the system can be developed in parts, then paradigms help us create islands of change. </blockquote><br><br>  So, I offer the readers a seventeen-level model, which I propose to use when reading textbooks of philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics with the secret idea to translate all this into programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã:-). <br><br>  The approach is based on the philosophical idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdualism, and begins with the introduction of two initial elements: <br><br>  - <b>ideas</b> - as an abstraction, which is self-sufficient for its definition <br>  - <b>emptiness</b> - as material, for which no idea is needed <br><br>  The remaining elements are squeezed between these elements, symmetrically distancing them from each other as complexity develops.  Qualitative levels of development of complexity and are presented in the underlying schemes /.  The main assumption is the symmetry of the abstract and material - for material concepts there are symmetrical abstract ones.  An additional assumption is a symmetrical disclosure of nature and concepts from the edges to the center. <br><br>  For example, the extreme elements correspond to the most material (emptiness, for which additional characteristics are impossible) and the most abstract (an idea for which there is no material representation).  This approach corresponds to the equal importance of the material and the ideal in the development of nature (dualism). <br><br>  For all levels in the proposed model is the selection <br>  The four elements of the Deming PDCA cycle: -Act-Plan-Do-Check-Act- <br><br>  I note that the Hans J√ºrgen Eisenck coordinate system is selected from the three orthogonal axes as the basis: <br>  - <b>Psychoticism</b> - level of abstractness <br>  - <b>Neuroticism</b> and <b>Extraversion</b> - as a direction to the Deming cycle element in polar coordinates <br><br>  Naturally, as the initial assumption, the schemes do not claim to be true.  Everyone can create, using a spherical paradigm, their own variants, which will be based on their categories, levels, phases. <br><br>  So, I represent the model - while in the form of graphic elements for modeling.  At the heart of the left margin of the images remained a set of symbols, symmetrical with respect to reality. <br><br>  General scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/9c3/388/3679c338830eb1ee67d0af75301ff59d.png" alt="All 17 levels"><br><br>  the order of the order of sciences in terms of abstractness: <br><br><pre>    logical

In this regard, the <b>negation is</b> often used to check the correctness.  In mathematics, this is called "proof by contradiction." <br><br>  The basis of the <b>idea</b> of something is <b>not the existence of</b> the <b>idea</b> itself.  In addition, the <b>idea</b> of something is characterized by the purpose of the <b>idea</b> (indicated as <b>directionality</b> ). <br>  In the value-normative component, an <b>idea is</b> characterized by <b>necessity</b> : any phenomenon can be expressed by its <b>idea</b> . <br><br>  The least abstract, and the most material (bearing no <b>idea</b> ) is represented by the concept of <b>emptiness</b> (in C this is described by the type <i><b>void</b></i> ). <br>  Moreover, even <b>emptiness</b> can be expressed with the <b>idea of</b> <b>emptiness</b> . <br><br>  Following the empty level with increasing abstractness is the level of chaos. <br>  Properties of matter at this level can only be described statistically.  However, this statistic allows us to evaluate the field properties ( <b>ability</b> ) and determine the space-time characteristics for conglomerates - bodies.  The main property of chaos is the <b>existence of</b> its elements.  At the same time it is not possible to identify specific elements of the element trajectories ( <b>randomness</b> ). <br><br>  Random level is the most fundamental.  For example, it is difficult to foresee the emergence of comets from deep space, and Siberia, as the largest part of the land, is the most likely territory for meteors to fall. <br><br>  In cybernetics, to protect against the influence of accidents, self-testing is used when the processor is turned on, as well as fool protection ‚Äî an attempt to envisage a reaction to all possible user actions - logical (coinciding with the system's purpose) and not logical (by dropping a hedgehog on the keyboard) <br><br><h3>  Physical and Religious </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/918/796/b1b/918796b1b581e41999803bef8e6be39b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For the ideal, the following segments are highlighted: <br>  <b>Purpose</b> - as an attempt to determine the reason for the need to form a specific <b>idea</b> <br>  Source of external justification of the <b><i>goal</i></b> ( <b>respondent</b> ) <br>  The possibilities of using <b><i>ideas</i></b> - a <b>function</b> <br>  Method of fixing the achievement of the <b><i>goal</i></b> - the <b>state</b> <br><br>  In material terms, they correspond to the behavior of matter, studied by physics - the interaction of two bodies or the interaction of body and field: <br>  the first thing is to determine the type of interaction - the <b>essence</b> <br>  the region of space-time is distinguished, whose behavior is estimated and predicted ( <b>object</b> ) <br>  for a selected <b><i>object</i></b> , its state ( <b>phenomenon</b> ) is fixed in a certain coordinate system <br>  it turns out the environmental impact on the object <br><br>  At the same time, for a specific study: <br>  <b>essence</b> is fixed as the <b>purpose of</b> <b>existence</b> <br>  the source of the <b>purpose of</b> justifying consideration is the <b>object</b> <br>  <b>the phenomenon of an</b> <b>object is</b> assumed as its main <b>function</b> <br>  possible <b>states of an</b> <b>object are</b> assumed to be mediated by its <b>relations</b> with the environment <br><br><h3>  Chemical and Philosophical </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae4/e74/9ad/ae4e749adf9965bbc51ce5c3bc3264b8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With the empowerment of the researcher, descriptions describing the structure of the studied concepts are added to the categories of <b>existence</b> and <b>purpose.</b> <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ideal: <br>  A <b>point of view is</b> added, as a characteristic that unites a view of the world, representing a striving towards a <b>goal</b> <br>  <b>Generalization is</b> singled out as a method of compressing several <b>ideas</b> into one when viewed from a specific perspective (to interact with a specific type of <b>respondent</b> , the actual <b>abstraction</b> ) <br>  An <b>interface</b> in this context means a designated set of ideas of transmitted and received <b>signals</b> , characterizing the designated <b>function.</b> <br>  <b>Assessment is</b> defined as a procedure that helps to obtain information about the <b>state of the</b> external <b>respondent.</b> <br>  Historically, this part is close to the work of shamans who broadcast the "will of the gods" <br><br>  In the field of material, structural division appears, which corresponds to the identification of the <b>structure of a</b> substance (chemistry), information and the basis for the operations of logic and arithmetic, which are determined by the set of allowed <b>rules</b> <br>  An <b>entity</b> identified at the previous level determines the applicability of <b>rule</b> sets <br>  The selected <b>object is</b> analyzed for the possibility of determining its internal structure ( <b>structure</b> ) <br>  <b>A phenomenon</b> generates a <b>subject</b> that it <b>modifies</b> , as a sensor-receptor, aimed at fixing exactly this kind of <b>phenomena.</b> <br>  The accumulation of previous changes of the <b>subject</b> characterizes the <b>resource</b> , the ‚Äúcaretaker‚Äù of which is considered the <b>subject</b> .  The basis of the <b>resource is</b> supposed to be the <b>connection of the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and the <b>subject</b> <br><br>  The relationship between the ideal and the material for this pair of levels is determined by the following characteristics: <br>  <b>The point of view</b> determines the set of <b>rules</b> used (is it possible to add red apples with green ones?) <br>  The possibility of determining the <b>structure is</b> governed by the possibility of <b>generalization</b> (is it possible to combine hydrogen atoms with one concept when considering the properties of a water molecule) <br>  <b>The subject is</b> characterized by the <b>interface</b> used (the scale does not determine the size or color of the object) <br>  The accumulation of a certain <b>resource</b> requires the possibility of its <b>assessment</b> (for example, ‚Äúnot one‚Äù already requires the specification of the <b>structure</b> within which the <b>assessment is made</b> , the <b>states of</b> ‚Äúlittle‚Äù, ‚Äúenough‚Äù, ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, etc., are similarly evaluated) <br>  Within these levels, the <b>rules of</b> logic and arithmetic are introduced. <br><br><h3>  Biological and Scientific </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c0/830/5d7/0c08305d7568eca38fc92a62b7a122c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With further development, it becomes possible to use <b>resources</b> to maintain self-preservation. <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ideal, it becomes possible to <b>predict</b> future <b>conditions</b> based on known <b>rules</b> and a selected <b>point of view.</b> <br>  A brief characteristic of the dynamic <b>assessment of the</b> situation are the <b>criteria</b> <br>  In order to be able to continue to exist without deterioration of the <b>state</b> , the <b>forecast of</b> changes is used with possible options for changing the <b>system</b> and the environment. <br>  The set of preferred actions determines the <b>culture</b> . <br>  The ideal analogue of the <b>resource</b> appears - <b>history</b> , as a set of consequences of applying the <b>rules</b> along with the conditions of their use and <b>results.</b> <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe material, there is an evolution of <b>systems</b> that provide their own homeostasis within an individual or species.  This corresponds to the development of living beings and similar artificial formations. <br>  <b>Knowledge</b> represents a set of <b>rules</b> with the context of their application in the presence of various ways of their own change. <br>  <b>The system</b> in this case is understood in accordance with the following definition: <b>system</b> - a <b>structure</b> capable of maintaining homeostasis <br>  For existence, the <b>system</b> may have a choice of several <b>alternatives</b> - ways of using <b>resources.</b> <br>  After being used to implement one of the alternative possibilities, the available <b>resources are</b> quantitatively changed. <br><br>  The relationship between the ideal and the material: <br><br>  <b>The knowledge</b> accumulated by the <b>system</b> allows you to select the <b>criteria</b> that contribute to the preservation of the <b>system</b> <br>  The maintenance of homeostasis itself requires the possibility of comparing <b>predictions of</b> actions for selected <b>criteria.</b> <br>  <b>Knowledge</b> allows you to view several alternative actions ( <b>choices</b> ), and a set of priority alternatives ( <b>culture</b> ) appears. <br>  When performing an action, accumulated <b>resources are used</b> .  Evolution allows you to accumulate a <b>history of</b> situations, <b>rules</b> applied, and selected <b>alternatives</b> .  Such an approach creates prerequisites for the development of science on the scale of a single cultural phenomenon - civilization. <br><br><h3>  Psychological and Political </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f93/e90/a42/f93e90a4206271b1ed1cd72408d046e6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After the emergence of <b>systems</b> sufficient for independent existence using environmental <b>resources</b> and the ability to memorize previous changes in an abstract form, there is the possibility of accumulating behavioral stereotypes, and, accordingly, <b>learning</b> opportunities. <br><br>  In the realm of the ideal, the possibility of <b>cognition</b> arises, based on accumulated <b>history</b> , and the planning of behavior in accordance with the <b>evaluation of the</b> values ‚Äã‚Äãof the <b>criteria</b> . <br><br>  For the successful existence of a variety of different types of behavior <b>strategy</b> is applied.  For example, eat grass and fear, or be a predator, and catch. <br>  After choosing a <b>strategy</b> , it is possible to <b>plan</b> your behavior.  For example, a cheetah tries to catch prey, and wolves organize a hunt in a group. <br>  In the <b>process of</b> achieving (or not achieving) the <b>goal</b> , <b>learning</b> occurs - training endurance or increasing the number. <br>  The result of <b>learning</b> is <b>cognition</b> , which contributes to the selection of <b>criteria</b> and improve <b>strategies</b> . <br><br>  In the field of material psychological <b>processes</b> appear, which are described in the framework of the process approach. <br><br>  In order to win in natural selection, the natural requirement is to improve the characteristics of the <b>system</b> . <br>  To implement the behavior, it is possible to use various <b>processes</b> that represent ways to convert the <b>input</b> to the <b>output</b> .  In accordance with the successful SADT (IDEF0) methodology, the required type of <b>input</b> is the manager - the starting <b>process</b> . <br>  <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>input</b> must obtain the necessary <b>resources</b> for use, which the <b>system</b> must take care of.  If the required <b>input</b> is not filled in, the <b>process</b> may stop.  Sometimes this termination of the <b>process</b> leads to a catastrophe (lack of air at the diver or lack of regulation at the Chernobyl NPP). <br>  The results of the execution <b>process are</b> ‚Äúcaught‚Äù at the <b>output</b> .  If the <b>output</b> does not meet expectations, then this is a reason for <b>improvement</b> . <br><br>  The relationship between the ideal and the material: <br><br>  To improve the functioning of the <b>system</b> , a <b>strategy</b> is applied. <br>  When choosing a <b>process</b> , <b>planning</b> is applied. <br>  The supply of control <b>signals</b> to the <b>input of the</b> <b>system</b> facilitates the <b>learning of</b> possible <b>behaviors.</b> <br>  <b>Cognition</b> tracks <b>the</b> system's <b>output to</b> expectations. <br><br><h3>  Managerial and Social </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/768/c21/166/768c21166cdf1a079989b5ab108eba18.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The result of <b>training</b> in the presence of different <b>systems</b> (and nature does not tolerate not only emptiness, but also sameness) is the possibility of comparing the propensity to perform the necessary or possible <b>roles</b> <br><br>  In the field of the ideal, the possibility of cybernetic <b>control</b> appears. <br>  implementation of the developed <b>strategy</b> contributes to the choice of the <b>scenario</b> , which will lead to an improvement in the value of the selected <b>criterion</b> <br>  <b>planning</b> includes the need to ensure that the <b>scenario is</b> executed under specific conditions by transmitting a sequence of <b>signals</b> and material flows <br>  <b>Learning to</b> perform the <b>script is</b> formulated in the form of a <b>project</b> -
