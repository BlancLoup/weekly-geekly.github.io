This year we decided to correct the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ca/36c/384/1ca36c384018482f852dff590bf60dc4.JPG"><br><br>  Fujitsu World Tour covers the whole world: from Orlando (USA) to Sydney (Australia), from Helsinki (Finland) to Johannesburg (South Africa).  We want to talk about what will be interesting at the conference, and why you need to go there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, this year we invited a special guest, Daniel Thorniley, who is president of DT-Global Business Consulting GmbH and co-founder of CEEMEA Business Group, a company that provides consulting services to managers in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.  He gave presentations at MBA courses for the University of Oxford, the University of Chicago, the Spanish Business School IESE and the Central European University in Budapest.  MBA students in Chicago called Tornily ‚Äúthe best speaker‚Äù 12 out of 12 times over 5 years.

      On the Fujitsu World Tour, Daniel Tornili will make a report on the prospects for business development in Russia in the period 2016-2020.  In his report, he will share his vision of the economic situation in Russia, analyze growth prospects in various business sectors, including IT, and give recommendations on how to optimize expenses based on forecasts of further developments in the economy.  Where else can you discuss promising ways of doing business in Russia with an international expert who, having a huge set of competencies, is able to explain complex business processes to even a student? <br><br>  This year, the focus will be on the practical experience of our customers from various industries.  They will share with the participants of the conference cases of implementation and operation of the Fujitsu solution and answer questions about the emerging difficulties and "pitfalls".  In 2016, with the participation of Fujitsu, two very interesting and large-scale projects were implemented.  The first project is the creation of the largest in Russia (in terms of memory) storage system for the petrochemical cluster of the Republic of Bashkortostan.  In this case, by gradually increasing the capacity, starting with the storage in the form of two standard ETERNUS DX disk shelves, the storage capacity was increased to 1.2 PB.  The peculiarity of the project is that this storage system is not designed for a single customer, it will be a co-repository for all cluster members and it will store specialized design software libraries for shared access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c30/0bf/f57/c300bff57fd74f87b2b05ace051d371e.jpg"><br><br>  In Samara, a unique cardiac surgery complex ‚ÄúHeart Clinic‚Äù opens, which is designed as the most innovative modern enterprise.  In the project to build an integrated IT infrastructure of a medical center, the Fujitsu ETERNUS storage system was used at the middle level.  Small in volume, it provides high performance data processing system PACS - an electronic control system of a medical institution.  This is a specific software, which while in medicine is almost not common (this project is one of the pioneers in Russia).  The storage system is connected to the PRIMERGY blade server and provides support for the virtual desktop infrastructure, about 200 workstations.  In addition, the center‚Äôs doctors will use thin clients and mobile devices (laptops, tablets) in the exercise of their professional activities. <br><br>  One of the most notable trends in the server market is the migration from proprietary RISC machines (for example, IBM POWER, Oracle SPARC) to mission critical x86 servers, year after year the sales figures of such servers confirm that the trend is gaining momentum, including in Russia .  At the exhibition of Fujitsu solutions, our expert Evgeny Tarelkin will demonstrate the mission critical server of the standard architecture of Fujitsu PRIMEQUEST and tell for which tasks it is best suited and in which Russian x86 migration projects this equipment was used.  According to Intel, PRIMEQUEST is the world's fastest server in its class, and also supports the ability to install a PCI-SSD to speed up database processing at the hardware level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24f/012/595/24f012595e4042cbb15cf053c489a506.JPG"><br><br>  Learn more about what innovations Fujitsu implements using cloud infrastructures, about the company's IT services, about our solutions in the retail sector and about other projects with Russian customers you will find in the next article.
