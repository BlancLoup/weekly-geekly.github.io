Therefore, I‚Äôm not going to make a mistake, but I‚Äôll give you the obvious theses that do not occur to everyone.  I always tell this to people who are going to speak for the first time, right after the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/13798/">story of how to prepare at all</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/359/7b4/62d3597b4ce44dd994d35078ffb11f4d.png"><br><ul><li>  Do not bother with a catchy name. </li><li>  The audience does not know what exactly and how you are going to tell. </li><li>  The speaker is not a servant of the audience. </li><li>  You make a report for those in the hall right now. </li><li>  Give the audience the rules for answering questions that are convenient for you.

Plus, the audience may have high expectations.  The general principle - the more experience and material, the more attention to the details of the type of name. <br><br>  <b>The audience does not know what exactly and how you are going to tell.</b>

      No need to skip the slides with the words "Oh, I'm not fit here.  This is not so important ‚Äù(‚Äú If it doesn‚Äôt matter, why was it included? ‚Äù) - it looks fussy and distracts attention.  The audience does not know how many slides you will be showing and how, so you can change several in the process of telling one slide, which is how it should be. <br><br>  <b>The speaker is not a servant of the audience.</b> <br><br>  The first task of the speaker is to read the report in the best way (it depends only on him), the second is that the report is accepted by the audience (here a fair amount of luck, because we are talking about the first speeches).  One way to depend less on the mood of the audience: to tell one person in the hall.  Quickly choose a victim and speak to her, it is better to put such a person on board. <br>  Example: A good graduate student who demonstrates attention and nods in difficult moments. <br>  None of the professional speakers will change the technical / professional report if they have not reached the audience.  It is better to read a report well past the audience than a bad reading past the audience. <br><br>  <b>You are telling for those who are in the hall right now</b> <br><br>  If people go out - this is not an indicator that you are doing something wrong.  This suggests that they heard not what they expected, wanted to eat, to the toilet, and a million more reasons.  All of them are not about how you speak.  Entry-exit is a completely normal situation, often there are parallel sections, so people migrate.  Do not worry.  I somehow got 3/4 of the audience out at the beginning of the report, however, it worked out well. <br><br>  <b>Give the audience the rules for answering questions that are convenient for you.</b>  <b>Observe them</b> <br><br>  It is advisable to voice the rules immediately.  Rules for exit / entry questions, the use of the phone.  Example: <br>  "Hello, my name is‚Ä¶.  I ask, if possible, to remember and write down the questions that you have in the course of your speech, I will be happy to answer them at the end or on the sidelines.  Just ask to go to talk on the phone. " <br>  It is possible, if the audience ‚Äúrages‚Äù questions, to provide several sessions after the key blocks.  And to voice it - "I look at a lot of questions, let me finish talking about ... and answer 3-4 questions." <br><br>  <b>Record the results of the performance - within 3 days after the event</b> <br><br>  Give yourself feedback on performance.  People are rarely satisfied with the first performance, you need to understand what was really good and what was not what you expected.  Write down what went well, the opposite did not like it.  These records can and should be shown to make it easier for your friends to give positive feedback.  You can simply write a note in the social.  networks to be supported by friends.  Your notes are a great help in preparing your next gig, this is your advice to yourself. <br><br>  <i>As soon as you finish your first speech, you become an orator and continue to cultivate.</i>  <i>Based on the feedback, the speaker himself chooses the direction of development, here I will not advise.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289742/</a></p>
