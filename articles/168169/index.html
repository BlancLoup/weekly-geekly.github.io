I succumbed to the call ‚ÄúTherefore, now I propose to arrange a‚Äú brainstorming ‚Äù‚Äù ¬© and share my thoughts on this matter. <br><br>  I'll start with the name - LunarCraft: it is assumed that the Russian project is therefore the moon, not the moon or selena (also hello to Google <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">[1]</a> ), Craft refers us to minecraf - how, <a name="habracut"></a>  . <br><br><h3>  So, the project LunarCraft </h3>  includes the creation of a group of 3 robots and sending them to the moon to create the most distant (at the moment) outpost of MANKIND.

    <h3>  Loud?  Is fantastic  Expensive? </h3><br>  Already, teams of 10-20 people send (at different stages of readiness) robots to the moon in pursuit of the prize <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">[1]</a> . <br>  At a time when game developers collect hundreds of thousands of dollars from potential players, there is no such thing as ‚ÄúNeed more gold‚Äù (c). <br><br><h3>  From lyrics to theory </h3><br>  The stated goal: the most remote (for today) outpost of humanity (read the lunar base). <br>  For a start, a structure resembling an Eskimo igloo <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583">[2]</a> , a human at 3, will fit. <br>  We will build from blocks of various shapes, not much different from the parallelepiped, slightly rounded in some places <a href="http://nemezund.ru/organizaciya-lagerya/ukrytiya-iz-snega/stroitelstvo-iglu.html">[3]</a> &lt;joke&gt; unless you need to force robots to lick a knife (watch the video) &lt;/ joke&gt;. <br>  We don‚Äôt need to bring bricks to the moon, we will build from scrap materials, i.e.  from pastures - regolith, dust. <br><br><h3>  We turn dust into bricks: </h3><br>  We use the principle of ‚ÄúSand-sand 3D printer from Marcus Kaiser‚Äù <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwN_rnVEqeFA">[4]</a> .  Using information from Wikipedia <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">[5]</a> we see that regolith is 20% composed of silicon, 20% of metals (Al and Fe) in different ratios, and 40% of oxygen (apparently it is in connection with metals) {Narrow spot number 1.  I think there will be notable metallurgists and they will write in the comments, and is it possible to melt a thin layer of such a mixture and, if so, how much energy is needed, as a first approximation, in some understandable equivalent.  If summer were to crawl into the nearest sandbox with pipes, a file and a magnifying glass}. <br><br>  Construction: the installation of Marcus Kaiser is cumbersome, it has to move the box with the workpiece, we also need to reduce the load on the moving parts.  The table is motionless, but the beam must scour and melt over the entire surface.  We use the Fresnel lens and a flexible optical fiber {narrow place # 2.  Who worked with optical fiber, is it able to withstand numerous mechanical loads, will it not melt}. <br>  So  we can have mountains of building blocks of various configurations and even with cavities or grooves like those of the designer.  So the first robot is a 3D printer. <br><br><h3>  Regolith collection: </h3><br>  If the sun's rays fall on the printer themselves, then the regolith needs to be brought up and the longer the mission, the greater the distance.  Therefore, the second robot should be a grader-dumper responsible for collecting, delivering and unloading the regolith into the printer's bunker.  There is nothing difficult in the first approximation (Write comments in the comments). <br><br><h3>  Construction building ¬©: </h3><br>  The third robot will, of course, be the Beeler construction assembler.  His duties include: take the finished unit, from the printer's warehouse, putting the right place to solder again the sun's rays (so that there are no drafts). <br><br>  Thus, we get a grouping that provides a full cycle of construction of extraterrestrial buildings. <br><br>  Of course, it will be possible to download sketches of necessary blocks from Earth to the printer. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  Program minimum: </h3><br>  Suppose we did not have enough money or ingenuity ingenuity to create a 'Builder' robot, then we send 2 robots - a grader and a printer (we‚Äôll do them for sure).  Then you can sell bricks on the moon to state space agencies to build a Russian house with caviar, bears ... or those who pay more because people are buying pieces of paper, which says that you bought the site from an organization that did not own any speck of dust from the moon.  But the fenced area let the height of the fence only 1 brick - more substantial evidence of the right to property (who first got up and sneakers).  Bricks can deliver a grader. <br><br><h3>  Maximum program: </h3><br>  Again suppose that the Lunar Engineering Habrahabr Team (LEHT - breathes something German, but we use the Google translator and it turns out to be ‚Äúleht‚Äù from the Albanian ‚ÄúActivity, Activity‚Äù, which cannot but deliver) consisting of hundreds of professionals in various fields and several hundreds enthusiastic activists coped with the task of constructing 3 robots and even raised money more than they had planned.  Then a dilemma arises: we make 3 brigades or, for the same money, we can deliver 1 brigade and 10 sets of electronics and power units, and hulls, chassis, manipulators can be made from the same regolith.  Thus, we get not just a building (a miserable shack) on the moon, but a real factory with a service for replacing components that were stolen (it is assumed that electronics and power units {I mean motors and servo drives} have a long life span of GO).  After debugging the process, it will be enough for the lunar state of the robots to import only liver, exporting He3. <br><br>  With the maximum program power, it will be possible to build a whole moon village. <br><br><h3>  If, however, "Need more gold" (s) </h3><br>  Robots operate both offline and under the control of the operator, since the delay is not as big as with Mars. <br>  Serious donators can promise admission to the watch, sticking the area for example 1000 ‚Ç¨ for 1 linear meter of fence height in brick (the first round amount taken from the ceiling) <br><br><h3>  Why build something, because you can live: </h3><br><ol><li>  in what they flew in as Americans <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">[6]</a> . </li><li>  in inflatable modules, according to the type of space hotel <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/3251">[7]</a> . </li><li>  in caves <a href="http://globalscience.ru/article/read/19836/">[8]</a> . </li></ol><br><br><h3>  Disadvantages (in my not professional opinion): </h3><br><ol><li>  Full-fledged long-term work (not just pofotkatsya) and life (rest after work) requires space more than the Apollo capsule. </li><li>  The price of delivery of kg is still high, and it is better to take more kg of edible, reagents, or astronauts, than fittings for the hut (conditionally). </li><li>  The caves are not always where it is convenient, it‚Äôs possible to spend 2-3 hours on the way to work and back in Moscow, cosmonauts have air and food not in such easy access.  Therefore, you need to work within walking distance of residence.  Ideally mobile station. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  What will the construction (possibly on a moving chassis, see the ‚Äúmaximum program‚Äù section) of the base: </h3><br>  Protection from radiation, meteorites, hard floor, walls, high-rise buildings (high ceilings). <br>  Tell me how to live in this needle, because it is certainly not tight. <br>  Yes, not tight. <br><br>  I see this: <br>  An airtight bag with a lock system is placed inside the wigwam, the bag is pumped with air, tables, chairs, beds (also made on the printer?), A tennis table, blackjack are entered inside ... <br>  Buildings are constructed with technological openings under windows, doors, corridors to other blocks of the base, and may already be with walls separating rooms. <br><br>  I hope there will be other articles on the topic of space exploration by the community. <br>  I am sorry that the pure text, without illustrations. <br><br>  [1] <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">www.googlelunarxprize.org</a> <br>  [2] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglu</a> <br>  [3] <a href="http://nemezund.ru/organizaciya-lagerya/ukrytiya-iz-snega/stroitelstvo-iglu.html">nemezund.ru/organizaciya-lagerya/ukrytiya-iz-snega/stroitelstvo-iglu.html</a> <br>  [4] <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwN_rnVEqeFA">www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN_rnVEqeFA</a> <br>  [5] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolit</a> <br>  [6] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunny_module</a> <br>  [7] <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/3251">www.membrana.ru/particle/3251</a> <br>  [8] <a href="http://globalscience.ru/article/read/19836/">globalscience.ru/article/read/19836</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168169/</a></p>
