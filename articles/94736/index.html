Today I want to offer an extended review, relevant, <b>primarily for freelancers</b> , as well as all those who are interested in the ability to quickly transfer money person2person. <br><br>  When it comes to choosing a payment system for work, the following questions are of primary interest: <em><br><br></em>  <em>- How to enter / receive money in the system?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- How to quickly transfer / receive money?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- How to withdraw the money?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- How to do it quickly and with a minimum commission?</em>

      How it looks in practice: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Enter / receive money in the system</b> : <br>  Money in the QIWI Wallet through the QIWI terminals is entered without commission, if the amount of input is from 500 rubles.  The term for crediting funds to the account is a few seconds.  They know about it. <br>  But how can freelancers use it?  Give customers your QIWI wallet, let them replenish it, indicating in the comments the purpose of the transfer: <br><img src="http://s52.radikal.ru/i135/1005/50/339b912d9c23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Instructions: <a href="https://w.qiwi.ru/fill.action">here</a> . <br>  <i>- Transfer speed - a few seconds.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Commission for both Parties - 0%.</i> <br><br>  <b>Transfers between users</b> : <br>  QIWI Wallet provides instant transfer / receive money. <br>  There are 2 transfer options: invoicing and transfer by phone number. <br><br>  1. Invoicing: <br>  This is very convenient if you are freelancing or you have a small online business (store).  There is a <b>comment</b> field in the invoice that the recipient will see and by which the payment can be identified.  For example, in the comments you can write: Doctoral Thesis.  The emergence of black holes. <br><br>  To do this, on the official website of the QIWI Wallet, in the <a href="https://w.qiwi.ru/orders.action">Accounts</a> section, select ‚ÄúIssue an account‚Äù, enter the phone number of the user from whom you want to receive money, the amount of transfer, write a comment, click ‚ÄúIssue an account‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/cef/9cb/d1fcef9cb0f09bbd1070bd0b0d65824a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>- Transfer speed - a few seconds.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Commission for the customer - 1%.</i> <br><br>  2. Direct transfer between users: <br>  Create an account is not necessary.  If your customer uses QIWI Wallet, he can transfer money to you for work in a few seconds: <br><img src="http://i077.radikal.ru/1005/42/8b88e9d9176e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>- Transfer speed - a few seconds.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Commission for the customer - 1%.</i> <br><br>  Both methods work not only on the site, but also in QIWI terminals or in mobile phone applications. <br><br>  <b>Withdrawing money from the system</b> : <br>  QIWI Wallet provides freelancers with the ability to quickly and profitably withdraw money from the system.  Commission - from 0.0% to 2.5% (depending on the method), the term - from online up to 3 days (depending on the method). <br><br>  1. Cash withdrawal: <br>  Money from QIWI Wallet in cash is profitable to display through Unistream.  To do this, type ‚ÄúUnistream‚Äù in the search box on the site, fill in all the form fields and receive money on the same day at the nearest Unistream office: <br><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/1005/14/2781bfa5ca5a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>- Commission - 2.5%.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The withdrawal period is about 30 minutes.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Contact money transfer system is also there, but the commission is there - 4%. <br><br>  2. Withdrawal to the bank: <br>  You can withdraw by account number or by card number.  On the website in the search box, enter the name of the bank, fill out the form, click "Pay": <br><img src="http://s55.radikal.ru/i149/1005/91/9c6f9605c3b9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alfa-Bank - 2%, online</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Tinkoff - 0%, 2-3 business days</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The rest (about 100) - 1.5%.</i> <br><br>  Sberbank - soon!  While it can be found only in the version for the mobile application on the JAVA platform, version 6.20.  But soon it will appear on the site. <br><br>  3. Earned can simply spend: <br>  The QIWI Wallet portfolio includes over 1500 different providers.  And taking into account the online stores connected to the system - more than 2,000. <br>  Well, QIWI VISA expands this list by several orders of magnitude. <br><br>  <b>Commissions</b> : <br>  They are more than acceptable.  It is important that they are acceptable, both for customers of your work, and for you.  You can do everything at 0%, if you collect funds in the first way, and spend everything collected to pay for services with zero commission. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> : <br>  QIWI Wallet allows its users to quickly and profitably receive payment for any remote work from anywhere in the country.  The number of QIWI terminals in Russia is over 89,000. Their monthly audience is over 50 million. <br>  I think these facts and the above instructions are quite enough to take note of a new way of mutual settlement with their clients, partners and colleagues. <br><br>  But do not forget that this offer is for freelancers.  For online stores - it is <a href="https://ishop.qiwi.ru/">somewhat different</a> .  There, the method is slightly more difficult to implement, and Webmoney is added to the conclusion - at 2%. <br><br>  Questions? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94736/</a></p>
