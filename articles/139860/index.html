      We are developers, we live in St. Petersburg and often after work we like to miss a couple (if lucky) glasses of any alcoholic beverages, discussing various working and not so much questions. <br><br>  At one point, we caught ourselves in the fact that there were not enough establishments in the market oriented specifically towards us.  There are Irish pubs, sports bars, biker bars.  But the workers of such an important industry, for some reason, have forgotten everything.  When I was in Holland, I noticed drinking establishments for doctors, policemen, firefighters, gardeners, vacuum trucks, and a lot of places with a professional concept.  In our country, this orientation is not yet developed. <br><br>  Actually, after thinking over and writing down everything on paper, the following happened. <br><br><h2>  Chips </h2><br>  Any self-respecting institution should have its own "chips" that make visitors come again, tell friends about them.  And in general, the face of the institution in society is automatically built on this. <br>  IT doesn't need to go far for this. <br><br><h4>  Cocktail card </h4><br>  Here are some examples from the list that we made up with an experienced bartender (who makes it so that it is not only interesting, but also tasty). <br><ul><li>  Basic - a simple cocktail to warm up </li><li>  PHP is long, it goes easy, but it's better not to get carried away </li><li>  Java - long, tasty, drunk for a long time and does not depend on the vessel </li><li>  With ++ - a shot, a bunch of everything is mixed, it inserts not childishly </li></ul><br>  The full list (and you saw only the eighth part of it) and the compositions will soon be available on our website. <br>  <i>We have nothing against programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the same name.</i>  <i>Partner, for example, works with PHP.</i> <br><br><h4>  Contests </h4><br>  Around the clock you can go to the bartender, take a test on the knowledge of any technology or subject matter. <br>  Also, in the main hall there is a server.  If you wish, you can try to hack it under certain conditions and get an evening of free alcohol. <br><br><h4>  Scene for reports </h4><br>  I have always believed that most IT conferences are boring.  Of course, there are interesting reports, but often you still need to combine the useful with the pleasant. <br>  Therefore, it is planned to organize a small stage for the speakers, who for certain bonuses can share their knowledge with visitors.  All equipment is, of course, provided. <br><br><h4>  And in dogonku </h4><br>  Card games.  Free wifi, of course.  Sockets for laptops, charging cables for phones at each table. <br>  Appropriate interior (with spectra and dandy).  Quiet music.  In general, everything you need to work (if you come to us for this). <br><br><h2>  Price policy </h2><br>  Representatives of the IT-industry are different.  To some extent these are students, most of them are employed specialists, i.e.  sufficiently solvent audience.  But we decided not to become an elite expensive bar and keep between the cheapest representatives of the market and average players.  In order for students to have a good time with interesting people, and experienced specialists did not have to leave with an empty wallet and credit card in the overdraft.  According to the plan, our ‚Äúaverage check‚Äù is 30% lower than the average for the hospital. <br><br><h2>  Location </h2><br>  The partner initially offered to stay somewhere in a residential area according to the principle ‚Äúsince it‚Äôs so cool, they‚Äôll get it‚Äù.  But after talking with experienced people, we decided that we needed to be smarter.  We looked at where the majority of IT companies are located in the city (literally, on the map), figured out the vector of the way home for most of the employees and chose the optimal, fairly passable place.  Strangely enough, this turned out to be not the center, but the Petrogradsky district (a shift to the north).  There now we are looking for a suitable area. <br><br><h2>  Audience engagement </h2><br>  Actually, in our opinion, such an institution is much easier to unwind than the next ‚ÄúIrish super pub‚Äù.  The originality of the institution and the narrow target audience will do its job (the experience of the same Dutch colleagues was studied).  Yes, and the word of mouth has not been canceled. <br><br>  We will attract through social networks, light advertising in IT-companies and themed (in terms of technology) evening.  And experts in the morning will tell colleagues themselves why they have such a pale face. <br><br>  Many will say that with such entertainment we are undermining the industry from the inside.  We sincerely believe that good leisure and popular methods of sobering provide an increase in the productivity of each visitor. <br>  Moreover, as described above, we provide conditions not only for drinking beverages, but also for work.  In part, this is even a coworking center with high-low split poker and beautiful ladies. <br><br><h2>  Speak - do not roll bags </h2><br>  At the moment, we are ready to calculate the cost of launch, lists of initial purchases (from toilet paper to the bar) and a detailed business plan.  There is also a part of start-up capital and connections with some representatives of the market.  Now we are actively looking for an investor. <br><br><h2>  What do we want from you? </h2><br>  In any case, we will implement this idea, but we are interested in how the representatives of the largest IT community in our country will comment on it.  Probably, they will slip through useful suggestions or obvious shortcomings of our plan, which we didn‚Äôt see as a stare. <br><br><h3>  *** </h3><br><br>  In a week we will publish specific figures of the plan, taking into account comments and suggestions (by the way, we are publishing a similar press release not only here). <br><br>  At the moment, you can follow the development of the project on Twitter. <br><br>  In order to avoid advertising: <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://devbar.ru/">Promo site</a> </h1><br><h1>  <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> </h1><br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139860/</a></p>
