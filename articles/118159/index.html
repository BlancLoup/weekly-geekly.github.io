      Take a book on project management - for example, ‚ÄúDeadline‚Äù by Tom DeMarco, books by Lensioni, or even the sensationally useless ReWork.  The books themselves are very interesting and correct, but they have one problem - they do not work with us. <br><br>  I can say that he personally does not look like the character of the original topic - i.e.  always raise questions before they turn into a problem. <br><br>  Observations: <ul><li>  Managers do not like being told that they are doing something wrong, even if they are doing something wrong.  Moreover, in my life I have heard a million times about the following: ‚Äúhere they (managers) have been in the market for XXX years, and what have you done with your advice‚Äù.  As a result, an opinion of an ambitious boor is formed about you.  The worst thing is that it is usually not treated; </li><li>  I saw, when management, attention !, <b>forbade personnel to attend courses</b> so that they, having gained experience, would not scatter.  Naturally, they paid a small salary; </li><li>  I saw a situation when the management let the team of devs leave with the team leader, because they did not want to increase the cost by 100 bucks, but the next day they were ready to give one and a half bucks for a recommendation; </li><li>  As a rule, managers bear some kind of unintelligible hunt about pride in their work, passion, call for patriotic feelings, and there may not always be tea in the kitchen; </li><li>  very rarely does a salary rise adequately to the growth of professionalism.  With us this is solved simply - a person goes to another company for 200 bucks and the process repeats itself; </li><li>  very many people want to get a good specialist for little money, and then shout at all ala habr sites that there are no normal specialists; </li><li>  very rarely (read - almost never) conditions before being hired == conditions after being hired. </li></ul>  Conclusion: A good manager sometimes means more than big money and other goodies.  Unfortunately, the bonus in the form of an adequate manager is not given everywhere.  Therefore, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the specialists solve the problem in their own way - at the price of $ 200 in a new ‚Äúsuccessful and dynamically developing‚Äù company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118159/</a></p>
