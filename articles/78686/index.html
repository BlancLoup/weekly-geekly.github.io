  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My 5 kopecks on copyright or A little about the price structure of legal digital content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, using the example of <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/">one portal, I</a> will talk about the cost structures of music, movies and books.  Various people, both creative and simply associated with this business, helped me in the selection of material. <br><br>  So, here we have this portal, which, according to him, occupies about 60% of the licensed digital content market.  Any right holder can conclude a contract with it (and this is not necessarily the author of the work).  The store takes 40% of the cost. <br><br>  And now we concretize ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Music </h4><br>  So, the standard price for an album is 80 rubles.  The rightholder receives 80-32 = 48 rubles per disk. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And now the copyright system is interfering.  As one knowledgeable person (who worked in this field) told me, there is no standard ‚Äúcommission‚Äù that rightholders assume.  Depends on the group and its contracts with them.  Alas, he has not voiced any concrete figures.  ‚Äú... the music market is extremely confused, especially in Russia.  The final cost for the user is dictated by the copyright holder.  Here you need to understand that the copyright holder is not even a record label.  How much of this money does the author get? I'm afraid no one can say. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, it is quite obvious that the artists, I get into this system, give a lot to it.  The question of how justified is difficult.  One can only firmly say that in the past it was almost impossible for the musicians to unwind without the companies selling tapes and discs.  But now, thanks to the Internet, their importance is gradually decreasing. <br><br>  Under the next heading will be an interesting comparison with movies. <br><br><h4>  Films </h4><br>  The standard price is 50 rubles.  The right holder receives 50-20 = 30 rubles. <br><br>  I suppose it is not worth explaining that the cost of the film is much higher than the cost of recording a music album (even if it is invited by a symphony orchestra).  And compare the cost with the music.  What's the secret?  The fact that the films will be shown later on TV and will receive money for it?  Hardly. <br><br>  As I understand it, correct, if I am mistaken, the main reason is the lack of an intermediate link in the producer-consumer chain.  No non-production rights holders.  All rights, as well as distribution efforts, are in the hands of producer studios. <br><br>  As a person who does not work in the film and music industries, I may not be aware of something, but I suppose anyone will see that there is some discrepancy between cost and final prices caused by an intermediate link, which is currently losing its real value. <br><br><h4>  Books </h4><br>  The standard price is 30 rubles.  The right holder receives 30-12 = 18 rubles. <br><br>  It's harder to say here.  Now I couldn‚Äôt find out if the publishers are interfering in the activities of writers who want to publish an electronic version, or take a commission from this.  In the year 2006, when discussed at one thematic forum, some sources stated that publishers are extremely neutral to such actions of their writers.  At that time, this market was so underdeveloped that there was really nothing to divide. <br><br>  Given my knowledge of this area, it is likely that it remains so at the current moment.  <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D1286083">Publishing business is extremely confused</a> .  And overpayments to eminent authors pays off at the expense of underpayments less runnings. <br><br>  But, if we consider that in this case the writer is the copyright holder of the placed book, then from one copy he will receive more than from one copy of the printed book.  Perhaps even 3-4 times (depending on the publisher, genre and a number of other conditions).  On the basis of economic theory, with a decrease in prices should increase demand!  Even taking into account the inelasticity of book prices, a price reduction from 150-250 (and somewhere even more) to 30 rubles is simply obliged (with the availability of technical means, like reading rooms) to increase the demand.  But do not forget about electronic piracy. <br>  Example: Anton Pervushin's book "The Cosmonauts of Stalin."  The author has invested 8 months of work on the book, 60 thousand rubles (in particular, access to various archives).  The book was published with a circulation not exceeding 10 thousand copies.  The corresponding fee (as already quite well-known author) - 40 thousand rubles.  Even cash investments did not pay off, not to mention temporary ones.  For the month it was downloaded from only one pirate site 25,000 times. <br><br>  I think everyone will make the conclusions easily.  The only thing I would like to say: let the music now part of the money and take the left uncles and aunts, but this is not a reason, IMHO, to refuse to pay the artist for his work. <br><br><h4>  Bonus </h4><br>  Now let's talk about the donate system. <br>  On Habr√© there are a lot of conscious people who are not lazy to encourage various projects for information / software / works.  And it seemed to be so convenient not to pay the copyright holders from some terrible offices, but to transfer the music group to the wallet, as much as you consider necessary.  And do not need these copywriters ... <br><br>  Everything would be so good, if not for the low consciousness of people.  I talked to the creators of several popular resources that have a corresponding page on the site.  A quote from <a href="http://alphyna.megus.org/">Alfina</a> , the creator of the ‚ÄúFull Bye‚Äù, ‚ÄúFools and Roads‚Äù web comics that have already reached the paper print: ‚ÄúI need to go to another job.  There is not enough beer and internet. ‚Äù <br><br>  So, I hope that you liked the article.  If where I received the wrong information, or made the wrong conclusions, write. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78686/</a></p>
