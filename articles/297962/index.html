Despite the fact that the percentage of writing community members was and remains far from the Pareto figure, in principle, each project is filled with a large number of high-quality and interesting publications every day. <br><br>  However, materials are only one of the reasons why users come here every day, and an equally important part of the entire information flow is comments.  Some of them, as rightly noted by many, often exceed in their value even the commented publication or at least qualitatively complement it.  Last but not least, it turns out because commenting and publishing notes are privileges of the same order, available only to a certain circle of trusted users.

      However, with all its advantages, this concept had an annoying nuance for many: in order to simply comment on a particular publication, a person needed, first, to receive an invitation, and second, to earn a certain amount of karma.  For potential authors of articles this is the right and natural way, but for those who want to limit themselves to comments, the game is not worth the candle.  As a result, the community loses not only useful information, but also a potential participant.  It hurts many people, and we understand them. <br><br>  Therefore, we decided to conduct an experiment: from today, any user registered on the Megamind can receive the status of Read &amp; Comment (R &amp; C), that is, it can comment on any publication for which the voting period has not expired. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, there are a number of conditions that guarantee cleanliness and order: <br><br><ul><li>  Comments are pre-moderated and appear only with the approval of the author of the publication or administrators; <br><br></li><li>  After approval of the first comment, the user receives the status of R &amp; C, and all subsequent comments <i>on the same publication</i> appear immediately, without pre-moderation; <br><br></li><li>  5 approved comments from different authors open the possibility to comment without pre-moderation in any publications with an unexpired term of voting; <br><br></li><li>  The R &amp; C user, along with the ability to comment, has karma and rating, but he himself cannot vote for publications, comments and karma; <br><br></li><li>  <b>All resource rules are fully applicable to R &amp; C users.</b>  Spelling and punctuation should not be forgotten either; <br><br></li><li>  You can vote only for a minus for the karma of a R &amp; C user (any account that has an invitation not just to publish, but just like that, has the same property); <br><br></li><li>  The R &amp; C user cannot publish articles until he receives an invitation from one of the users (directly or through the Sandbox); <br><br></li><li>  Getting an invitation removes all restrictions and upgrades your R &amp; C account to full. </li></ul><br>  In general, in the comments, we created! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297962/</a></p>
