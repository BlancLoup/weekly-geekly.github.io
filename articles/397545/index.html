They never shared their secrets.  The scale of this construction is amazing.  According to supporters of the Alternative History Laboratory, the Egyptians could not build.  According to them, anyone could build the pyramids: the Atlanteans, representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations, representatives of other peoples, but not the Egyptians themselves.  This very strange thesis is largely based on the fact that the Egyptians did not have the perfect technology that would allow them to begin processing highly-hard rock, lift heavy weights, and the like. <br><br>  On the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSaVoRErW4kqKsDqExs2MXA">Sci-One TV</a> - the new release of the Egyptian pyramids. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5md9_24XTo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e8/6a2/ccd/1e86a2ccdedd4262abc8b691e6b04061.jpg"><br>  <sup><i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B">Necropolis of Giza</a></i></sup>

      Many of the early pyramids were built fairly rough.  They are made of small stone blocks and are imperfect in terms of laying.  These pyramids are incomparable in their beauty with those that stand, say, in the Necropolis of Giza.  And here many supporters of the Alternative History Laboratory resort to deception: they convince us that the more advanced pyramids are the very first.  A less perfect - built by the Egyptians.  That is, it fits the facts. <br><br>  It is very difficult for us today to imagine an era that is several millennia old.  And therefore, many people who grew up in the age of modern technology cannot imagine life without iron, without machines, they cannot understand how people who did not have all this could build such impressive structures. <br><br>  What is the main argument for the fact that it was the Egyptians who built their pyramids?  The fact is that they did not immediately come to this.  At first there was the millennial era of the Stone Age, during which the Egyptians learned how to simply process a stone.  But as for the methods of delivering the stone to the construction site, another question arises. <br><br>  It should be understood that the largest pyramids are composed remarkably harmoniously and correctly.  The largest blocks are laid at the base, that is, they did not need to be raised to a considerable height.  And closer to the top are smaller blocks.  Thus, builders saved their time and resources.  They understood perfectly well that it is impossible to lift large blocks to a great height, for this very significant efforts of many thousands of people are needed.  According to the drawings found in the tombs, great weights, as a rule, were dragged by people or bulls; the Egyptians had no other power.  Therefore, we can conclude: for the Egyptians it was very important that the spirit of the nation was embodied in these pyramids so that they could thus declare themselves in history that they could accumulate all their knowledge in this grand building. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd2/a11/219/cd2a1121916144c4a1dc42189b9f9cb9.jpg"><br>  <sup><i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Pyramid of Khafre</a> (more precisely - Khafry) - the second largest ancient Egyptian pyramid</i></sup> <br><br>  The Egyptians did not immediately come to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating premises within the pyramid itself.  Initially, all the premises were underground, that is, under the baseline, and the pyramid itself was empty.  And only as the principles of construction were improved, when the so-called idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa stepped roof arose, did they begin to design the rooms inside the pyramid itself.  What was the impetus for this revolution in architecture, we do not know.  There is a hypothesis that underground premises were flooded with groundwater, so I had to look for new solutions.  To secure the sarcophagus with mummy, they tried to raise it as high as possible.  And for this purpose, they first came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa step vault - what we see in the pyramids of Snofra, and subsequently in the pyramid of Khafra, where the discharge chambers are used.  Thus, with each new pyramid, the sarcophagus with the king's mummy rises higher and higher.  Subsequently, all the pyramids were built with funeral peace on the foundation line, which reduced and cheapened the construction process, it became more economically viable.  And gradually the Egyptians completely abandon the construction of the pyramids. <br><br>  When people talk about pyramids in general, they use a term such as ‚Äúpolygonal clutch‚Äù.  True, it is typical for Latin America, in particular, the culture of the Incas.  Nevertheless, there are several samples of polygonal masonry, which was used in the construction of granite blocks in the valley temple of King Khafra.  The fact is that polygonal laying is not the art of stone processing, but the use of natural stones and some specific situation.  That is, the Egyptians did not adjust the stones, instead they used their natural irregularities to create the surface. <br><br>  It is very common among conspiracologists that the limestone stones are perfectly matched, that it is impossible to insert a knife blade, a sheet of paper and the like between them.  However, it is necessary to mention one of the most important properties of limestone - its plasticity.  This stone under high pressure begins to be pressed.  And if at the same time the air humidity remains favorable, then the process of diffusion - interpenetration proceeds.  For millennia, when the blocks lay on top of each other, they partially merged with each other.  And today it seems to us that this is just the perfect seam.  Although initially the seams could not be perfectly perfect. <br><br>  In addition, the limestone from which the Egyptian pyramids are built, is very easy not only to be processed, but also to the environment.  Therefore, modern pyramids for the most part have no facing - for many centuries, limestone has weathered.  And even if you just press hard on him with your hand, then he begins to pour under our fingers.  And although they say that time is afraid of the pyramids, in fact it is not.  Pyramids are destroyed, and the older they are, the more fragile the limestone they are made of.  Gradually, the stones crumble, and many even fall from their seats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/274/ddc/cd1/274ddccd115f43c098f5d7e1c5fabc79.jpg"><br>  <sup><i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">The pyramid of Cheops</a> (Khufu) - the largest of the Egyptian pyramids</i></sup> <br><br>  Any pyramid today requires conservation measures, and therefore many stones in the Khufu pyramid are covered with a special polymer-containing compound to prevent air and water erosion.  The pyramid is a wonderful structure, but it is also a monument to the great genius of the Egyptian people.  That the Egyptians first learned how to process limestone.  Egyptian civilization is a civilization of limestone, from which most Egyptian temples are built. <br><br>  For the construction of the pyramid were essential knowledge of mathematics.  And today, scientists are convinced that the Egyptians carried out mathematical calculations before proceeding to construction.  But evidence of their mathematical thinking has not survived.  We do not know how they planned, conceived and tried to calculate the strength of a particular pyramid.  But we know for sure that the layout was originally built.  It could be wooden or stone.  But on this model all possible solutions were calculated.  If during the construction it turned out that the calculation was not correct, the Egyptians made adjustments.  The famous pyramid of Snofru, a broken pyramid in Dahshur, was originally conceived with ideally regular faces.  But gradually the mass of erected levels of the pyramid began to put pressure on the interior.  As a result, the builders realized that if they continue to build at the same pace and with the same dimensions, the interior will collapse.  As a result, they had to reduce the height of the pyramid as soon as possible.  Therefore, it turned out to be broken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9a/a97/9eb/a9aa979eb3154ba892a807d3ffe0bb03.jpg"><br>  <sup><i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5">The pyramid in Medum</a></i></sup> <br><br>  The pyramid in Medum was also conceived as correct.  But the so-called laying of the false arch was first used in its construction.  The builders miscalculated the height of the walls of the internal funerary peace, and the pyramid just crumbled.  Its upper part still lies in ruins, although outside it has retained some original form. <br><br>  It is important to understand that the Egyptians built their pyramids by trial and error.  Naturally, they did not have a modern developed mathematical apparatus, but they possessed secrets that allowed them to build stately buildings.  They never shared these secrets, did not write textbooks.  They passed on their skills from father to son, and therefore we cannot fully understand them.  For example, they built embankments, thanks to which stone blocks moved to a considerable height.  How then eliminated these mounds?  But at least we know that these mounds were, their remains were preserved.  But most importantly, the Egyptians used more water energy, the energy of the Nile.  So the ancient Egyptian civilization is the civilization of the Nile River.  They not only floated on the great river, but also used it to move large masses of stone directly to the foot of the pyramids.  The Egyptians created an amazing civilization that was able to curb the Nile.  They not only built the famous dams, but also erected cities on the dams, and also rationalized labor during the construction of the pyramids. <br><br>  From a historical perspective, the Romans even surpassed the Egyptians in some way.  For example, when they built their famous <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA">aqueducts</a> to deliver large volumes of water to places where there was not enough water.  Although the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãaqueducts belongs, most likely, to the same Egyptians.  Yes, they would envy the scale of the construction of the Romans, but each civilization has made its contribution to the treasury of historical architectural thought.  If the Romans became famous for the construction of aqueducts, the Egyptians became famous for the construction of the pyramids.  And no one else tried to repeat their experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397545/</a></p>
