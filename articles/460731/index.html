But in the first hour after entering the public roads, he ran into a delivery truck.  Fortunately, there were no injuries then, and the vehicles were almost not damaged - the collision occurred at minimum speed. <br><br>  Then, in 2017, the media was telling that, for the most part, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/408131/">driver of the truck was</a> to blame.  As reported, he did not look in the rear-view mirrors, so he could not respond to the rapprochement with the bus.  But the truth was somewhere nearby - the other day it was announced by representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board (USA). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúDuring today's testing of an autonomous bus in the city center, he touched a delivery service truck.  The bus performed the intended actions: when the sensors fixed the truck, it stopped to prevent an accident.  Unfortunately, the delivery truck did not stop and touched the front wing of the shuttle.  If the truck had installed the same equipment with sensors as on the shuttle, then the accident would have been avoided.  Tests of the bus will continue during the 12-month pilot program in the urban area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Innovation District, ‚Äùrepresentatives of the city administration said at the time.

      Usually this department is not engaged in the investigation of simple and not very significant accidents - like this one.  But, since it occurred with the participation of a robotic vehicle, the agency decided to thoroughly investigate the incident. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20190711.aspx">As established by the investigation</a> , the unmanned bus noticed a truck that appeared - an obstacle - while being 45 meters away.  30 meters before the intersection of its trajectory with the trajectory of the truck the bus began to slow down.  He was supposed to stop him for about 3 meters. <br><br>  As it turned out, the driver of the truck saw an obstacle, but I thought that the bus would stop in advance, so he really didn‚Äôt look into the rear-view windows, but watched the other side of the movement, along which cars with human drivers were moving.  Unfortunately, the main events at this time took place on the other side, so the vehicles collided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/d22/c52/95dd22c52ae6b11ae855cfbbfc86d3b4.jpg"><br><br>  An investigation into the regulator showed that the bus operator had the opportunity to prevent an accident.  For example, it was possible to emit a beep, which was not done.  In addition, it was found that the robotic bus operator had the opportunity to stop his vehicle using specialized controls.  There were no usual controls on the bus. <br><br>  No one foresaw anything bad, because the bus had to move along a path a little more than a kilometer in length.  But what happened happened.  The controls of the robot avtoavbus, as it turned out, were in some kind of "closed space".  The bus operator, in the end, there was no way to respond more quickly to the incident. <br><br>  After the accident, the developer of a minibus made a controller with which you can control the vehicle, more accessible to the operator.  According to the regulator, if the bus operator had the opportunity to take control, there would be no problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460731/</a></p>
