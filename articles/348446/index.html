      - car sharing market; <br>  - YouDrive development strategy; <br>  - how the business is organized in car sharing; <br>  - the launch of Yandex.Drive and competition; <br>  - Startup PUMP (mobile tanker). <br><br>  Full text transcript can be viewed at the <a href="https://secretmag.ru/trends/players/boris-golikov-youdrive-odna-karsheringovaya-mashina-zamenyaet-sem-lichnykh.htm">link</a> .  Or read the shortened version under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What did you come to the studio for?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  I arrived by taxi, called through the YouDrive app.  I am testing a new service that we are currently actively developing.  Not at car sharing because I didn‚Äôt know how it was with parking. <br><br>  <b>How do you usually move?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Usually car sharing or taxi.  I don‚Äôt have my own car, I don‚Äôt need it. <br><br>  <b>Did you run YouDrive, if I'm not mistaken, in mid-2015?</b>  <b>Then there was Anytime with some ridiculous number of cars.</b>  <b>Did you know that car sharing will be a big trend?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Yes, it turned out that I was left without a car, and the question arose of buying a car.  But the feeling that the car was not needed in the center of the city was quite persistent.  I looked at the market, I realized that the car rental market in Moscow, in principle, does not exist.  I rummaged around, spotted a Zipcar service - this is an American service that was created a long time ago and was bought by Avis, a classic rental company.  I really liked the idea.  In Moscow from this I found only Anytime and was surprised why it is not popular. <br><br>  <b>In the beginning, did you copy any particular western model?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  No, I did not copy anything.  Come up with a hike.  Something already worked in Anytime, and what we thought was right, we took for ourselves.  Further developed simply by sensations. <br><br>  <b>The authorities support car sharing because it is believed that through such services traffic is reduced.</b>  <b>Can you explain how this works?</b>  <b>If I'm going somewhere, what's the difference in car sharing I'm driving or in my own car?</b>  <b>The number of trips from this does not decrease.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Traffic does not create trips, but the number of cars.  The city has a completely understandable task that I share: the number of personal transport on the roads needs to be reduced.  Otherwise we will just stand in a permanent cork, the rings will close.  One car-sharing car replaces seven personal cars, because it is more often in motion than standing in the parking lot. <br><br>  <b>Some of your competitors can leave cars throughout the city, and some even in some areas, for example, in Khimki and Kurkina.</b>  <b>You only have a little over the third ring, then you have to pay for the wait.</b>  <b>Why is that?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  It is important for us to create the maximum density of our cars in the city center.  Most people come from the center, and the distance to this car becomes a decisive factor when choosing a car for users.  Pricing is in third or fourth place.  Therefore, to create a high density is very important.  But Khimki and the state farm "Moskovsky" we opened for parking.  It is important for us to create a convenient communication between the big Moscow and the city center. <br><br>  <b>In 2017, you have grown from about 400 cars to 1000. What is the plan for 2018?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  3000. We believe that Moscow today needs 10,000-12,000 cars.  In the future 3 years - 20,000 cars. <br><br>  <b>What was your turnover for 2017 and what is the margin of travel?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The turnover is about 500 million rubles.  We are reinvesting all the time, we need to very actively grow and maintain our share, we have many competitors. <br><br>  <b>A taxi 20% of the trip is a gross commission.</b>  <b>Do you have something different?</b>  <b>Do you buy cars for leasing?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  To put the car on the line, you first need to invest quite a lot of money in it.  We pay in advance for insurance, branding, we need to put the equipment on the car and so on.  Only then does the car begin to generate revenue. <br><br>  <b>Does it require a lot of frozen money?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Constantly. <br><br>  <b>I found information about one round - $ 1 million from the Mercedes-Benz dealer "Panavto".</b>  <b>No more deals?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Soon we will announce another round, decent.  We are fighting for capitalization, for a good company valuation.  We have a high interest among venture capital funds, and I feel that there is interest in strategic partners, manufacturers, large dealers, and insurance companies.  Many are looking at this market. <br><br>  <b>What do you expect from the launch of Yandex.Drive?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Heavy topic.  I was upset when I found out that they are entering the market because Yandex has access to big money and it competes through dumping.  I do not want the situation in the taxi market to be repeated in our market.  They thought of becoming an aggregator in the car sharing market and came out with this offer, but nothing happened because of the position of YouDrive and BelkaCar.  We simply did not participate in this story, there is no point in this, we do not need external orders and leases. <br><br>  I think that now ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù has no other opportunity to squeeze out a large market share, but to play for lower prices.  Let's see how they can handle a large fleet of cars.  I think Yandex doesn‚Äôt represent what it is. <br><br>  <b>You wrote that the subscription model for the car that Volvo launched in Europe and the USA does not work with us, because in Russia there is expensive money.</b>  <b>Why does car sharing then work?</b>  <b>This is also expensive money.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Carsharing is a retail sale service.  We sell car rental by the minute, with this you can make a big margin.  In this case, the user who takes the car for 20 minutes, the price does not seem high.  A subscription is selling services in bulk.  I really like this service and we considered how much it could cost in Russia.  We turned out that the car of the middle class will cost 100,000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>It is worth it, if you count everything.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  That's right, if you count everything, but nobody does it.  You will sell the rent for 100,000 a month, and they will tell you: ‚ÄúNo, I will take a loan, there will be a payment of 25,000‚Äì30,000 rubles a month‚Äù.  Therefore, it will be difficult to sell the service. <br><br>  Full transcript of the interview <a href="https://secretmag.ru/trends/players/boris-golikov-youdrive-odna-karsheringovaya-mashina-zamenyaet-sem-lichnykh.htm">here</a> . <br><br>  Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7SHzmAFL9JMm50qNiqOhzQ">youtube channel</a> to not miss the next issues of Mobio Talks. <br><br>  And also subscribe to the <a href="https://t.me/epicgrowth">Telegram channel for product marketing</a> and get high-quality content! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348446/</a></p>
