Below we decided to collect some interesting statistics. <br><br><h2>  Users </h2><br>  We overcame the mark of 6 million users just a few hours before the bells announced the beginning of a new year.  Here are some key numbers: <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2010_a_year_in_stats_01.png" width="640" height="119">

      As you can see from this table, the total number of users has increased over the past year by 186%, from 2'096'030 to 6'003'130.  Only in December, we observed an increase of 237% compared with December 2009 (from 619,211 to 2,089,705 users).  But the biggest increase is in the number of our premium users, whose number increased in 2010 from 35'310 to 201'308 - and this is no less than 470% of the increase!  This means that we are not just growing faster than ever, but that more and more people are using Evernote regularly and as a result are switching to a premium subscription.  If you're wondering what is behind the increase in the number of premium users, see also the <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/12/14/phil-libins-from-simple-idea-to-global-success-talk-at-leweb/">interview of Phil Libin on LeWeb (in English)</a> . <br><br>  As for our growth rate, it is worth looking at our updated chart: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2010_a_year_in_stats_02.png" width="630" height="523"><br><br>  446 days we spent on recruiting the first million users.  We overcame the next mark in 222 days.  The next - for 133, then for 108, then for 83. A five-millionth user registered with Evernote just 52 days ago.  These are 19'000 new users daily.  So that you can roughly represent this number: every four days we can fill up with new users to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_(%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD)">Luzhniki Grand Sports Arena to the full</a> ! <br><br><h2>  Platforms </h2><br>  Over the past year, we have seen a lot of changes in the mobile industry.  Here is how it looked at us: <br><br><h3>  Mobile customers </h3><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2010_a_year_in_stats_03.png" width="630" height="507"><br><br>  iOS is still ahead of the rest, with twice the number of users in the past month compared with Android (1.1 million users against 550,000).  In addition, iOS is also adding users intensively (we see an increase of 223% compared to last year‚Äôs figure).  But just look at the growth rate of Android users - <em>1'570%</em> over the same period!  It will be very interesting to look at the dynamics of the development of these platforms in 2011.  We see a good increase in BlackBerry users, although much more modest in absolute terms. <br><br>  The use of HP Palm, Windows Mobile (not to be confused with Windows Phone 7) and mobile web client is decreasing, but we have not abandoned these platforms.  This winter we will launch a completely new version of Evernote for Windows Phone 7, and new versions of Evernote for HP Palm will be released about once every two months.  Well, by itself, we will continue to pay a lot of attention to our clients for iOS and Android. <br><br><h3>  Desktop clients </h3><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2010_a_year_in_stats_04.png" width="630" height="415"><br><br>  In the realm of large computers, these are the trends: the Windows platform took the lead, adding 214%, aided by the release of a completely new <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2010/10/27/evernote-4-for-windows-is-here/">fourth version of the Evernote client a</a> couple of months ago.  Web client usage also jumped 205%, thanks in large part to our web clippers and <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2010/10/01/evernote-chrome-extension-gets-simultaneous-search/">Chrome extension</a> .  Mac almost does not lag behind, adding 150% of new users.  These figures will still change dramatically in 2011, as each of these three customers will expect big changes already this quarter.  Read our blog to not miss any news. <br><br><h2>  Can users be more than 100%? </h2><br>  The most meticulous researchers of graphs may notice that if you add up all December users across all desktop and mobile platforms (and also add users from other client applications), you will get about 3.4 million unique users in total.  Why not 2.1 million, as stated in the very first table?  Did we make a mistake somewhere?  Not at all.  It turns out that the vast majority of our users use several platforms at once.  The most typical scenario is the use of Evernote on a computer and on the phone, but many also have a tablet computer, and several stationary ... <br><br><h2>  2011 and further </h2><br>  Thanks to everyone who found us and started using Evernote last year!  Our whole team is now working at such an intense pace that it seems that before that we were just warming up. <br><br>  And as usual, if you have any suggestions on how to make Evernote better and more convenient, please contact us. <br><br>  <em>Happy New Year again!</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111243/</a></p>
