  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results scandalous IFA2011: the queue for pills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is my first statement in my life about the exhibition, which I was not personally: I missed the IFA this time, so I got an outside look.  However, the Nomobile.ru team completed the exhibition at the usual high level, all the major innovations were lit from all sides, so I didn‚Äôt miss anything super hot.  And it is always interesting to look at the exhibition from the outside, and not from the inside, when there is a great chance that you will not see something big in operational frenzy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e1/5d6/95c/5e15d695cdf4ab44475d7d2042be3321.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A couple of weeks before the start of the IFA, it was clear that last year‚Äôs success could not be repeated.  And it‚Äôs logical: IFA 2010 was a jubilee, the 50th in a row, then the organizers tried and asked the producers not to roll out their blockbusters in advance, to hold them until early September.  This time there were almost no wow products, although formally, compared to the previous year, everything was in openwork: there were 3% more visitors (238 thousand), 1% more exhibits (1441), and even the exhibition area increased by as much 4%, up to 140300 square meters.  But I do not remember such a case that the main thing with which the exhibition was associated is not a gadget, but a scandal.  About which they wrote, not only the gadget-media, but all without exception publications.  And, frankly, if it were not for him, then IFA 2011 would not remember much, so the scandal was worth inventing.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Samsung vs Apple </h4><br>  This, of course, is about the shameful expulsion of the tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7, which was demonstrated at the exhibition for the first two days, and on the third day it was ‚Äúdeported in handcuffs‚Äù by the real policemen who cordoned off the Samsung stand.  Despite the fact that the tablets were stickers "Not for sale in Germany."  Just the day before, on September 2, the D√ºsseldorf Land Court decided to stop advertising and selling the Galaxy Tab 7.7 in Germany, deciding that Samsung had violated a number of Apple-owned patents by copying iPad elements into the Galaxy Tab.  Shortly before this, in August, Apple secured a ban on sales of the earlier Galaxy Tab 10.1 model in 26 of the 27 EU countries.  Russia will not be affected by this ban; Koreans' products will be sold freely in our country.  Apart from this puncture, Samsung as a whole performed quite well, both with smartphones and with the same tablets, and I personally consider the Samsung Galaxy Note half-slate smartphone to be the brightest, though ambiguous gadget of the whole exhibition. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2T38hNgl5E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-Gy7FjvO2fENL7pIFuQ8lRKMh_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When Apple offered its iPad with a diagonal of 9.7 inches, this format did not become the standard, competitors immediately offered a more compact version, by 7 inches.  And Samsung, going through form factors, ventured to roll out something with a diagonal of 5.29 inches and a resolution of 1280x800 pixels - the Galaxy Note is not yet a tablet, but no longer a smartphone.  Although, judging by the fact that it is possible to call on it - there is a speaker - then it is rather a smartphone.  The guess is confirmed by the operating system - this is a smartphone version of Android 2.3.  Dual-core processor overclocked to 1.4 GHz.  Suddenly, the stylus appeared, it is inserted into the pencil case on the bottom.  Particularly pleased with the powerful 2500 mAh battery, which theoretically should be enough for 20 hours of active use.  But the Koreans did not report either the prices or the timing of market entry ‚Äî they themselves do not know. <br><br><h4>  Tablet redistribution </h4><br>  IFA is increasingly similar to the exhibition of tablets and readers - most of the high-profile announcements of this type of product brands are stored for Berlin, except Samsung noted all the top brands.  One of the brightest tablets showed by Sony - its Tablet S differs primarily in design, the case is elegantly curved, here Apple definitely won't show up for copy-paste.  The display is 9.4 inches, on the left side there is a headphone jack, and under the plug there is a micro USB port and a slot for full-sized SD cards. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELraOqurLq4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkVAiapVyyleWoJjcNoiE-nF8esQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the same time, a dual-display Tablet P tablet with two small 5.5 "screens is shown. Both tablets work on a dual-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor, and by the beginning of sales they will get version 3.2 of the Android OS. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlLVnMCkCgE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBJyavaXPpjelb7IbNMtVmUjSqQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another Japanese - the thinnest (7.7 mm) Toshiba AT200 was not much better than its predecessor, shown at CES 2011. The entire front panel is glossy, the screen diagonal is 10.1 inches, the resolution is 1280x800 pixels, it runs on a TI OMAP 4430 processor with a clock 1.2 GHz, has a gigabyte of RAM and up to 64 GB of main memory.  All connectors are ‚Äúmicro‚Äù: micro-USB, microSD and micro-HDMI, the weight of the device is 558 grams. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFcUhc2v2fU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjp5YN40JPqWfXkhIxEXXmG42K5cQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Finally, it announced its Thinkpad and Lenovo tablet: the 10.1-inch tablet does not have its own name yet - it is simply called the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet.  The glass, like the laptop Lenovo X1, tempered - Corning Gorilla, and the display itself is made with IPS technology with a resolution of 1280x800.  There are two cameras: 2 and 5 MP.  The tablet is quite thick (14.5 mm), but light at the same time - it weighs 740 g. With connectors, everything is good: there is not only a slot for a SIM card, an SD card reader, miniHDMI, microUSB, a dock connector, but also full USB 2.0.  Inside Nvidia Tegra 2, gigabytes of RAM and SSD-drive 16/32/64 gigabytes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrQfts0xFis%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj5fxTcnXRAPwS4M0RmPXHExz8n-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Ours were also pleased: a very good tablet device was shown by the Ukrainian Pocketbook: this is a giant 670-gram A10 with a 10-inch display with a resolution of 1024x768 pixels.  TI OMAP 3621 processor on 1 GHz, Android OS 2.3.4, inside 4 GB of internal memory and 512 MB of RAM.  It works smartly, it responds well to touch and, best of all, there are mechanical buttons on the case.  In Russia, it will cost 12,000 rubles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEfowMVwOF0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtGP-RAeggx3ZGLHfMPxfxLQL_ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  3D internet </h4><br>  And what about other trends?  Yes, everything is in place, not gone away.  Only they do not cause already so much enthusiasm.  The television industry is in decline, and so far there is a gap between technology and demand: people do not want to buy expensive and not finished to the desired condition TVs, and manufacturers tune them not as fast as we would like.  Dear this thing.  It is clear to everyone that the ‚Äúspectacle‚Äù 3D is an intermediate stage, and they are waiting for the ‚Äúglasses-less‚Äù, but such TVs at the exhibition showed only a few brands, the rest still had no hands, and they would have sold old, ‚Äúspectacled‚Äù ... Here is an example of a good TV, able to show 3D without glasses: this is a Toshiba ZL2 with a 55-inch parallax screen and a crazy resolution of 3840x2160 pixels.  The television uses face tracking technology to ensure that each of those who are seated receives the highest quality 3D picture, the television is able to adjust to the eyes of nine spectators at the same time.  And now, attention, price: eight thousand euros.  Any questions? <br><br>  Much more attention was paid to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù TVs, however, they are being talked about and shown on which IFA.  Here is another accent: TV manufacturers are slowly but surely making us forget about stationary computers, transferring their functions to the TV.  The ‚Äúboxes‚Äù go online, learn various smart chips, develop services and applications for them.  And with the launch of a 3D channel from Youtube on 3D TVs, it will be possible to watch 3D Internet too.  Of course, there were also translucent OLED TVs, but they are still being demonstrated as concepts - except in films like ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù they are nowhere to be seen. <br><br><h4>  Air! </h4><br>  The next "wandering" trend, which is about to go out, then flare up again - this is ultrabooks.  The flames in it support, of course, Apple with its Macbook Air, this trend received a new impetus in the time of the last collapse of prices for thin Apple laptops.  The description of the old-new segment looks like a MacBook Air ad: ‚Äúa very thin laptop, weighing up to 1.3 kg, with a powerful filling, no more than 13 inches in diagonal and worth no more than a thousand dollars‚Äù.  And in this segment at the IFA 2011 laptops such as the Acer Aspire S3, Toshiba Z830 and Lenovo U300s fit into. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bi0Acszxffo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFtUZdV4QxbI7-rAI40LzgYQ8eVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Separately, I note the first: its thickness is only 13 mm, it works on Intel Core Sandy Bridge, it comes out of sleep mode in just two seconds.  The most interesting thing is the price: according to rumors, laptops in this series will cost from $ 770 to $ 960, and the MacBook Air has never had such a budget competitor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksIp8MHdzGM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhjjUUAJPsMjf8kwE6YvYqWK_T9ZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_QDS_WoGXQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg0dbQLNg7r-Drs-NmyR5MQ_m0mdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Phones on the side <br></h4> Chronologically, the exhibition began with smartphones, which is becoming a tradition, but prima ballerinas were not found among them.  As usual, the ‚Äúleaks‚Äù began in advance, and this time Samsung ahead of Sony Ericsson, denoting a new concept for the letters of their smartphones: marked with the letter S (from ‚ÄúSuper Smart‚Äù) will be the pinnacle of the development of the Galaxy family, category R (‚ÄúRoyal / Refined‚Äù ) will also mean expensive and top solutions, the letter W (‚ÄúWonder‚Äù) - balanced in price and quality, models M (‚ÄúMagical‚Äù) promise high performance at a low price, and the most budgetary models are marked with Y (‚ÄúYoung‚Äù).  Following the "leaked" Sony Ericsson Arc S, which is different from the previous flagship, "just Arc", more nimble processor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJk4gTQd7hU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrmXAnVipOaTUrovGWEtvGkI2xYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  HTC, in my opinion, introduced the most correct smartphones - Radar and Titan, they work not on Android, but on Windows Phone 7.5, these are the first HTC devices on the latest version of the Mango operating system.  Both are made in a monoblock form factor, but Radar is younger, has modest characteristics and a 3.8-inch display, and the 160-gram Titan is monstrous: a 4.7-inch screen (800x480 pixels), a 1.5 GHz processor, 16 GB of memory and 8 megapixel camera.  There was a timid attempt to spotlight (or was it really a leak?) A fresh Nokia smartphone, which traditionally misses IFA.  At the booth of one of the European distributors, the Nokia 700 smartphone was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù loaded with a promotional video for a smartphone, either the Nokia 801 or the N8-01, which presumably will work on the new version of Symbian Belle. <br><br><h4>  Hodgepodge </h4><br>  Of course, there were many original ‚Äúout of trend‚Äù gadgets at the exhibition.  For example, LG showed a LSM-100 computer mouse with a built-in scanner.  Sony, in addition to smartphones, tablets, readers and laptops, introduced the PS Vita portable console (4-core Cortex-A9 processor, 5 "touchscreen OLED display) and 3D Viewer gadget - glasses with two OLED displays with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels that simulate watching a movie in a movie theater . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aq6WCmdIx5Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgpuTtwss8iPho9QaJtQ_FTmq0hRA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyn9wlbdyOQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3VZxiFtaixOUWzUgj4LM8DskjQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first 3D video camera with a dual optical system was shown, here not one lens takes part in the shooting, as before, but two independent 32-millimeter wide-angle ‚Äúglasses‚Äù.  In 3D mode, they allow you to zoom in on a subject 10 times.  Of course, it was rolled out by a pioneer in 3D photography - the company Panasonic.  And LG, among other things, announced the robot vacuum cleaner Roboking VR6180VMNC, which not only destroys any dirt and dust using a vacuum cleaning system, but also sends a picture of the sound from the built-in cameras and a microphone to WiFi on a paired smartphone or tablet, and also allows Manage yourself with these portable gadgets. <br><br>  Summary <br>  It seems that Apple has completely spoiled the industry - companions cannot think up companies without Steve Jobs themselves, and IFA 2011, in addition to the already disgusting 3D and ‚Äúsmart reviewers,‚Äù exploits Apple's last year‚Äôs ideas.  But if suddenly the Yabloko workers at the beginning of next year invent some new wonder-gadget, IFA 2012 will surely shine with new colors. <br><br>  And a few more videos in the final - I didn‚Äôt write anything about the photo / video, but we made a video with the latest news <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDHPE-XqmA4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhR3z8Y3miCCQGtP9IflxpEP1EMwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiXr67Iok_k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCA7qgW0Rjbw4Mdvcj5rt68G1yZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS At the request of those who wish to - this is our final video from last year‚Äôs exhibition, where we tell what this IFA is in principle and interview the president of the IFA and the symbol of the exhibition - the girl in red.
