  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen Boost 2 SE went on sale: details plus photo and first-hand opinion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, the Network received information about the launch of the Highscreen Boost 2 SE, an updated version of the smartphone itself, which comes with a 6,000 mAh battery.  The processor, the manufacturer of the screen has changed, the RAM and ROM have grown, the improved camera has been installed.  Actually, the model - here it is, in front of me, so I will supplement the news with some first impressions of the device.  Full review, of course, will be a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3df/baf/b4a/3dfbafb4a3bf71d7734431875bc88269.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let me remind you, the "original" Highscreen Boost 2 was released at the beginning of last autumn.  The model received two complete batteries - 3,000 mAh and 6,000 mAh.  We were told about a maximum of two weeks of battery life (a total of two batteries), as well as an application to the Guinness Book of Records.  In general, the smartphone turned out to be interesting in terms of autonomy, but the performance with Qualcomm MSM8225Q frankly limped.  Appearing Highscreen Boost 2 SE, I would call serious work on the bugs.

Productivity has increased about 1.5 times, and the power consumption has remained at the same level (autonomous operation - up to 2 weeks). </li><li>  Boost 2 only supports GPS, Boost 2 SE - and GPS, and GLONASS (the first Highscreen with GLONASS and generally the first B-brand smartphone with support for the Russian navigation system). </li><li>  Boost 2 has an 8 megapixel camera, and Highscreen Boost 2 SE a 13 megapixel camera. </li><li>  Boost 2 has only 4 GB of internal memory, and Boost 2 SE has 8 GB (twice as much). </li><li>  You can assign one of 4 applications to the side Boost 2 button (front camera, rear camera, player, screenshot), to the same Boost 2 SE button - any installed application. </li><li>  Included with Boost 2 are 15 GB of storage space for information on the cloud service 4sync, complete with Boost 2 SE - as much as 64 GB. </li></ul><br>  Visual table of characteristics: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/c81/359/6cdc813597bf110e8777726a50d47569.jpg"><br><br>  Given that I have at my disposal both Highscreen Boost 2 and the new SE, I was able to immediately make some visual comparisons.  For example, the screen has become noticeably better - the colors are deeper, less distortion, there is no "overexposure" at maximum brightness.  The viewing angles are comparable, except that in Highscreen Boost 2 SE, when viewed diagonally, there is less blue.  I also liked the tactile display of the SE more - the surface resembles an oleophobic one, and the marbling quality decreased by an order of magnitude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/682/db5/4eb682db5790362b84eff4c6b09661c8.jpg"><br>  <i>Highscreen Boost 2 vs Highscreen Boost 2 SE</i> <br><br>  The build quality has grown - you can understand, without looking, which model you hold in your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1f/6d3/ca9/b1f6d3ca9c19cb99890694374bb052d4.jpg"><br><br>  As for the design, the case has not changed by one iota, only the strip under the display instead of the black one turned gray.  In my opinion, this is how the device looks more solid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb2/bb6/d95/fb2bb6d95270c375626157fa58cde3bd.jpg"><br><br>  Plus - how not to boast which processor is installed in the model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eef/91d/d1b/eef91dd1b1bb21a22c8a66ce518fe827.jpg"><br><br>  With the performance "everything is clear", the games I tested are "played" perfectly.  The only exception was Frontline Commando, which did not want to load further than the splash screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b55/10a/698/b5510a6984bdc9c0730e1151cc2f2fa7.jpg"><br><br>  In AnTuTu Benchmark smartphone scored almost 20,000 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c3/b04/57b/8c3b0457b70202b3ab5c0d1dd29afe26.png"><br><br>  Of course, the first thing was taken measurements in AnTuTu Tester.  the result is excellent, considering that this is an out-of-box achievement, without any buildup of a 6,000 mAh battery at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3b/410/76c/e3b41076c1c847beda99ba1a6c086012.png"><br><br>  Naturally, in the future I will be testing in different ‚Äúreal‚Äù work scenarios, I'm afraid to imagine how long it will take. <br><br>  <b>Little UPD.</b>  The multifunctional button of the smartphone is not yet multifunctional.  Highscreen threatens to release an update during February, then you can really hang any program on the key.  From myself I will say that the implementation of this option is personally seen in the engineering sample SE, everything worked as it should.  Regarding the realism of the release of the update - with the first Boost 2, the situation was exactly the same, the expansion of the list of teams arrived in a new dress almost immediately after the model was released for sale.  In general, we are waiting. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> .  Result with a 3,000 mAh battery.  Very, very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce6/ef5/390/ce6ef53902d63ef067d85ea1b2d195d7.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212501/</a></p>
