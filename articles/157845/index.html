We leave from the twilight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ulyanovsk is my hometown, but I started my development career in Moscow and went from a PHP developer in a web studio to a Ruby On Rails programmer on Skype.  Zelenograd, in which the Skype office is located, turned out to be a very unusual city.  He is really very green, well maintained and pleasant to live.  It was there that the thought came that the light did not converge on Moscow.  After some time, I quit, and, having no plan or savings, I went home to Ulyanovsk to create the company of my dreams. <br><br>  What was my surprise when I learned how developed the IT movement in the city. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

As part of this project, the guys lived in a tent camp away from the city for a week.  Having broken up into teams, they developed real projects, both for the web and for desktops.  Every day, specialists from organizing companies came to them and read workshops on topics from management to testing and code writing practices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af4/d5a/d04/af4d5ad0426e162eba9c208b7e6adf33.jpeg"><br><br><h5>  Branch of the department of measuring and computing complexes of UlSTU on the basis of ULSK.IT </h5><br><br>  The non-profit organization ULSK.IT (ITECH.group, ‚ÄúScript‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreative Development‚Äù, Echo), together with Ulyanovsk State Technical University, launched a new educational program this year, according to which students take part in the training ‚Äúin production‚Äù - within the walls of IT companies, and teachers are employees of companies. <br><br><h4>  Professional movement </h4><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://ulcamp.ru/">ULCAMP</a> </h5><br>  In the summer of 2011, on the banks of the Volga, the Script Company held for the first time ULCAMP, an informal gathering of IT specialists from Ulyanovsk and invited guests.

That there is only a list of speakers: Sergey Belousov (Runa Capital), Peter Didenko (SKB Kontur), Sergey Zefirov, Sergey Kotyrev (UMI), Andrey Aksenov (Sphinx) and even Monty, the legendary creator of MySQL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/760/8cf/76d/7608cf76d8040f4337f3091385eaf05f.jpeg"><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://ulcamp.ru/dev/">ULCAMP :: Dev</a> </h5><br>  The desire to continue professional communication after the ULCAMP-2011 gathering led to the birth of ULCAMP :: Dev - periodic self-organizing meetings of IT people, at which professionals share their experiences, and newcomers get the opportunity to communicate with IT ‚Äúgurus‚Äù (both local and invited guests from other cities) .

More than 1000 people from different regions of the country took part in it.  The conference turned out to be versatile, with reports on web development, marketing, IT startups.  The speakers were commercial conference stars of highload.ru level: Roman Pavlushko (AVITO.ru), Alexander Titov (Skype), Alexey Rybak (Badoo), Alexey Makhotkin (undev.ru), Konstantin Osipov (mail.ru), Lev Valkin (Echo ), Dmitry Kozlov (DEFA), Andrey Yablonskikh, Dmitry Vasilyev (NetCat), Vasily Tkachev (AllInTop) and Ivan Nikitin (binn).  The event was one of the largest in the Volga region, and at the same time - completely free for participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f05/82a/e4f/f0582ae4f306b84e1cda280fe0cb6c65.jpeg"><br><br><h5>  IT gatherings </h5><br>  ‚ÄúSit-offs‚Äù is one of the most informal formats of the Ulyanovsk movement, allowing novice IT people (and those who want to become) to communicate with well-known technology bison in an informal setting: ask their questions, listen to success stories and participate in the discussion of current topics. <br><br><h5>  miscellanea </h5><br><br>  The above companies are pioneers and active participants of the IT movement in the Ulyanovsk region.  They conduct master classes, organize meetings and discussions: regular testers meetings, round tables, chef-parties (devops), 24-hour hackathons, and even intercorporate celebration of Halloween.  In addition, employees of several companies teach in Ulyanovsk universities. <br>  Upcoming events <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">Railsclub</a> - December 15‚Äì16 </h5><br>  Due to the fact that a large and active community of Ruby / Rails developers has recently been formed in the city, the idea to hold a Railsclub conference in Ulyanovsk is long overdue.  The organizers accepted the idea with interest, and now they are actively preparing.  The speakers will include Maxim Lapshin, Alexey Palazhchenko (Skype), Andrei Rudenko (mail.ru), Lev Valkin, Nikolai Rekubratsky (undev.ru), Ivan Evtukhovich (express42), as well as representatives of companies Evil Martians, Evrone and others.  Announcement of the event <a href="http://railsclub.ru/conference">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  "BUTTON" - April 5‚Äì6, 2013 </h5><br>  Next year the event will be held in two days in the Leninsky memorial.  The planned number of participants is 2500. Participation is free.  Speakers are expected from companies Mail.ru, Yandex, Google, Badoo, Skype and many others. <br><br><h5>  ULCAMP - July 2013 </h5><br>  In July 2013, the third international festival ULCAMP will take place. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.agilecamp.ru/">Agilecamp</a> - Summer 2013 </h5><br>  After my stories about local IT, Scrumtrack decided to conduct training in the summer of 2013 in Ulyanovsk. <br><br><h4>  Future </h4><br><br>  Recently, we often hear from our colleagues from other regions that Ulyanovsk sounds more and more often and louder.  This is due to the openness of companies and the expressed desire to establish horizontal links.  Literally 4 years ago, the situation was not much different from our neighbors - everyone sat at their own ‚Äúiron curtain‚Äù and saw only attempts to divert employees around.  In 2010, it became clear that this was the way to a dead end. <br><br>  Despite the existing differences between the companies, we are actively interacting and looking for common ground.  For example, everyone is worried about the outflow of specialists to Moscow, and we are learning from each other to create more favorable conditions for employees.  Largely due to this, the ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù in the capital is indeed decreasing.  Attracting investment and the emergence of new companies in Ulyanovsk are also in our area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest.  We see how the exchange of experience and technological diversity leads to an increase in the overall technical and organizational level of local companies. <br><br>  Sure steps have been taken to involve the regional authorities in civilized support of various aspects of IT operations.  The Ministry of Information Technologies of the Ulyanovsk Region is a sponsor or co-organizer of many useful initiatives.  And, although many issues are still being resolved without proper focus and professionalism, there is a chance to correct the situation and to the fact that our example of interaction between private and public initiatives will prove to be a worthy example for replication in other regions of Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157845/</a></p>
