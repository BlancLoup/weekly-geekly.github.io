  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qiwi Visa version 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b31b6233/49caa00e/319fb984/7566e8a4.png"><br>  Today, a new service, QVC (Qiwi Visa Card), has become available to all Qiwi-wallets users in a personal account.  This product is similar in purpose to Qiwi Visa Virtual.  The latter by the way a lot of scolded and scolded.  First, they blamed for the fact that the Qiwi Visa Virtual card was not replenished - it was fixed, until now they are scolded because of the high commission, the maximum payment limit, the short validity period, the extra gestures to get something, but product, Qiwi Visa Card seems designed to correct these shortcomings.  So let's take a closer look at what kind of beast it is. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a1a87b9a/359fffc0/725ce51e/3cc808f9.png"><br><br>  <b>There are several advantages to this card</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d8e726fc/a8cbbec5/bb3a6b36/357956f4.png">  The commission has been reduced from 3.5% to 1.5%, which is pretty good. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d8e726fc/a8cbbec5/bb3a6b36/357956f4.png">  The card has been extended, now the card is issued for 1 year - a sensible decision, and every quarter a new card was issued and linked to PayPal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d8e726fc/a8cbbec5/bb3a6b36/357956f4.png">  You no longer need to replenish the card before you buy, the money is automatically deducted from the balance.  Therefore, there is no need to go into your personal account at all.  It will save a lot of time, because on Visa Virtual I still did not keep money for the future (they would become frozen) and each time I replenished the card with the necessary amount for the purchase. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d8e726fc/a8cbbec5/bb3a6b36/357956f4.png">  Quite an interesting moment with the disclosure of personality.  After all, this was the stumbling block, why it was impossible to buy something more expensive than 15,000 rubles.  via Qiwi Visa Virtual.  At least, the impersonality of the card was the only reason for such a limitation in the mouth of one of the employees of Qiwi.  Although I haven‚Äôt yet found any information on removing this restriction, I‚Äôm 99% sure that now I can finally buy HTC Desire HD for 16000 from one of the UK online stores :)

      <b>Disadvantages are also available:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b2ad5af4/dbe784aa/da94f652/a94fdcda.png">  It is rather dangerous now to pay directly from a card without intermediaries such as PayPal or Google Checkout, if you keep large amounts on your Qiwi wallet balance.  After all, now the entire amount is available for write-off.  I‚Äôm talking about the risk of cardholders getting the details and if earlier it was possible to keep the card empty and replenish it only before the purchase and exactly for the amount that is enough to pay for the purchase, now all the money in the account is vulnerable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b2ad5af4/dbe784aa/da94f652/a94fdcda.png">  This, of course, does not say a big drawback, but still you give your passport data and anonymity is essentially lost. <br><br>  <b>Some interesting points</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3aa4748d/a661a821/06850666/5095ec3b.png">  The release of such a card costs 10 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3aa4748d/a661a821/06850666/5095ec3b.png">  All SMS notifications are free. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3aa4748d/a661a821/06850666/5095ec3b.png">  There is no subscription fee for maintaining the card (as taken in banks) <br><br><h4>  Comparison with other payment instruments </h4><br>  Of course, it is not entirely correct to compare physical cards with virtual ones.  But people still use them for the same thing, so it is impossible not to mention the <a href="http://www.svyaznoybank.ru/home/retail/cards.aspx">Svyaznoy Bank</a> and <a href="http://kykyryza.ru/">Kukuru cards</a> .  These cards are physical, but they are obtained in 10-30 minutes in the communication shops of Svyaznoy and Euroset, respectively.  They, of course, have a rather small network of card replenishment and, of course, it is incomparable with the Qiwi multimillion payment terminal network, but, unlike QVC, when using, for example, Svyaznoy Bank cards, the commission is not only not charged, but even interest is paid on the balance, but the subscription fee is added.  For me personally, 1.5% is not critical and still I will not keep money on such cards, so it makes no sense for me to buy them now.  Although I confess, just a few days ago, before the release of QVC, I was thinking of buying such a card for the reason sounded above (HTC) :) <br><br><h4>  How to order a card? </h4><br>  If you do not have a Qiwi-wallet, then get it yourself on <a href="http://w.qiwi.ru/">w.qiwi.ru</a> <br><br>  Ordering the release of such a card was quite easy.  Just click on the QVC ad banner on the right and the personal data entry form opened: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/312ed423/47d09aef/37777e58/82afb5e5.png"><br><br>  Having entered the data in Latin letters, I got on the page with the notification about the successful order of the card.  Details came by SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/127a3737/67625d3a/4384df08/6f6e5d96.png"><br><br>  After that, the map itself appeared in the block on the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/01fbec18/a6d024c6/f852607c/d5a42bab.png"><br><br>  Tied to PayPal was successful, tonight I will test the card in action.  On the ebay-forum, people have already unsubscribed that the card has become attached to PayPal and they have already been able to pay for their first purchases using it. <br><br><h4>  What else could be improved in this map? </h4><br>  I think in the first place, it would be possible to make a customized option to confirm the debiting of the balance.  Those who store large funds in Qiwi-wallet, I think, would have included this option without thinking - even if there was an extra step in the form of calling into the Qiwi personal account. <br><br>  And, of course, we are waiting for the official announcement from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/efads/" class="user_link">efads</a> , maybe there is something to add or fix on this topic. <br><br>  PS Just received a message about the appearance of a new version of Qiwi-wallet for Android with the service of finding the nearest Qiwi terminal.  It looks like QVC has also become one of the reasons for the update. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113927/</a></p>
