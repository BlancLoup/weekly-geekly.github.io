This is the first program of this format, allowing to get the full amount of knowledge on the design, development and marketing of high-tech products.  The head of the project, the scientific director of the Interuniversity program of training engineers in the field of high technologies, the deputy head of the department of technological entrepreneurship at MIPT-RUSNANO, Vyacheslav Chikin, tells about what will be taught in the online magistracy of the Physics and Technology Institute. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In my opinion, the online magistracy is a fundamentally new educational product.  The use of distance learning forms is a tool that cannot be passed, this is today.  With the availability of modern technology, it is foolish to spend time going somewhere to listen to a lecturer.  I am personally confident that the use of remote forms allows for a unit of time to get much more knowledge.

      <b>It's all about motivation</b> : I include lectures not for what I need to get five credits, but in order to gain knowledge in a particular discipline.  Changing the method of presenting the material.  Teachers feel less on stage and less eager for effects, and more so that they give the right information. <br><br>  It is important to note that the <b>online magistracy focuses more on people who have already tried to do something, adults</b> .  Imagine a man of 28 years old, he has already successfully worked for 5 years in an enterprise.  He feels ambitions and a lack of new knowledge, but he has a family and a child, and there is simply no chance of escaping for two years to any good university. <br><br>  What is possible then?  He can choose two or three hours a week to listen to lectures and make a test when it is convenient for him: on weekends, in the evening - the person decides for himself.  In our experience, the rigidity of the schedule in higher education institutions greatly hinders learning. <br><br>  A student of an online magistracy in techno-business must come to Moscow only twice: in order to pass a state exam in their specialty, and a second time - to defend a master's thesis. <br><br>  We expect that not yesterday's bachelor‚Äôs degree will come to this program, but those who already have from 5 to 10 years of work experience, who have already achieved some success and realized that they want more. <br><br>  <b>An important feature of the online magistracy is the work on your own project</b> , which will allow you to work out the knowledge gained in practice.  You can choose both the project of the company or the company where you are working at the moment, and your own, and work it out under the guidance of the program mentor.  In the absence of the project, it will be provided by the mentor.  What is fundamentally important - throughout the entire process of <b>student</b> learning, the <b>mentor personally accompanies</b> . <br><br>  The key qualities of a technopreneur?  What kind of person has a chance to achieve success in this area? <br>  The first is terrible obstinacy, stubbornness.  And, oddly enough, the second is the ability to turn.  On the one hand, a person should not give up prematurely, and on the other - to feel the moment when it is necessary to turn around.  The flexibility of an entrepreneur is not the flexibility of a reed that bends with each wind.  Rather, the ability of the oak to grow slightly bent, given the wind rose.  In this case, quickly rebuild, if the wind rose has become different.  Another important feature: a technology entrepreneur must be able to find associates to promote their technology, without which it will be difficult for him to go all the way to the finished product.  Its task is to integrate into the technological chain in the right place, where its main advantages remain.  He says: ‚ÄúI can buy a machine and make one additional technological operation, which will allow you not to braid this thing around with copper.  The shielding layer will be stronger and lighter, and perform the same functions. ‚Äù  Joint efforts create a joint product.  The strengths of the partner are also used.  In the future, you can reach the end user, and develop other areas of technology use. <br><br>  This is <u>what we will teach our students - the ability to find opportunities</u> . <br><br>  <b>About magistracy:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://techpredonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3DMIPT%26utm_medium%3Dinstitutions%26utm_content%3Dhabrapost_270617">The master's degree in technology entrepreneurship at MIPT</a> is implemented in partnership with eNano (RUSNANO group).  The program is based on the model of the Department of Technological Entrepreneurship MIPT-RUSNANO, which has been successfully developing since 2013 as the Inter-University program of training engineers in the field of high technologies and uniting the leading Moscow universities of MIPT, MISiS, MEPI and RANEPA.  During the training, students work on their own business project under the direction of the program tutor and mentor.  At the end of the training, a graduate diploma of the State Institute of Physics and Technology is issued. <br><br>  <b>Master's teachers</b> - practitioners and leaders in their fields: <br><br>  Grigory Tshipes (chief consultant of IBS), Vladimir Antonets (international expert in the field of commercialization of research and development), Anatoly Levenchuk (president of the Russian branch of the International Council on Systems Engineering INCOSE), Alexey Nikolaev (head of Intell Russia Innovation Development Program) and many others. <br><br>  <b>Education in the online magistracy has several advantages</b> inaccessible for full-time programs: <br><br><ul><li>  there is no need to move to another city in order to receive a state diploma of a leading technical university in Russia.  The student comes to Moscow only 2 times: to pass the state exam and to protect the diploma; </li><li>  the combination of current work and training; </li><li>  individual work format and personal accompaniment of the listener on the part of the tutor; </li><li>  obtaining new professional connections and resources for project development thanks to the support of mentors, tutors, project experts and training colleagues. </li></ul><br>  <b>Graduate students study the following courses</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Strategies for the commercialization of research and development results </li><li>  Basics of financial modeling </li><li>  Systems Thinking and Requirements Engineering </li><li>  Economy for technology entrepreneurs </li><li>  Methodical tools for the analysis and development of technical systems (TRIZ + Design thinking) </li><li>  Agile project, process, task management methods </li><li>  Enterprise Architecture </li><li>  Project management and innovation programs </li><li>  Finance &amp; Investment </li><li>  Marketing Innovative Products </li><li>  New product development management </li><li>  Leadership.  Formation and management of an effective team </li></ul><br>  <b>The cost of training</b> is 250 thousand rubles a year, it is possible to receive an educational loan, payment in installments and in stages. <br>  <b>The duration of training</b> is two years, the beginning of training is autumn 2017. <br><br>  <b>Detailed information <a href="http://techpredonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3DMIPT%26utm_medium%3Dinstitutions%26utm_content%3Dhabrapost_270617">on the website of the online master</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331768/</a></p>
