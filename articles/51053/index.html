  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6th International StartupPoint Meeting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On January 25, the 6th International <a href="http://edu.it-online.ru/">StartupPoint Meeting of Startupers</a> was held at the Celt Club with the support of the innovation-educational company <a href="http://rma.ru/internet/about.html">RMA</a> and the company Careelab.  Each time, these meetings bring together more and more specialists in the field of creating and promoting Internet projects, forming around them a professional community of startups.  This time about 120 participants, 12 projects and representatives of three investment companies were invited to the meeting: Addventure, eVenture Capital Partners and AVK-Media.  Each time the quality of the organization of the event also increases - the growth of the experience of the organizational headquarters affects. <br><br>  The format of the minibar is somewhat modified in details from meeting to meeting.  The way of presenting projects and their subsequent discussion remains unchanged.  Representatives of each project are given 2 minutes to describe the essence of a startup (this presentation is called elevator pitch).  After the submission of each project, the process of ‚Äúlynching a startup‚Äù begins, when the audience asks questions, criticizes and quite often gives recommendations to the organizers of the startup. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To participate in the 6th StartupPoint meeting, 12 startups were announced (their presentations are posted on <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">StartupPoint.ru</a> ):

Of all submitted startups, only 5 worthy lynchings were chosen by public vote.  Such projects are: <a href="http://toolwi.com/">Toolwi.com</a> , <a href="http://bubuki.ru/">Bubuki.ru</a> , <a href="http://liveexpert.ru/">Liveexpert.ru</a> , <a href="http://kommandcore.ru/">Kommandcore.ru</a> , <a href="http://moodbox.com/">Moodbox.com</a> .  Lynching, as usual, was quite tough, which, however, only benefited the projects.  Traditionally, the most frequently asked questions were about monetization, planned profits, and ways to promote.  In the process of lynching, the creators of startups threw up some good ideas for further improving their projects.  However, in order to realize the creative potential of the audience in full force (there were a lot of bright heads at the meeting, as usual), the ideological inspirer and one of the main organizers of the meetings, Vitaly Akimov, suggested a little ‚Äúprobreinstormit‚Äù to try to collectively propose solutions to any problem, facing a particular startup.  As a victim of the experiment, the <a href="http://liveexpert.ru/">Liveexpert.ru</a> project was chosen, more precisely, the issue of attracting independent experts to this site.  Brainstorming was active and, as it seems, with considerable benefit for <a href="http://liveexpert.ru/">Liveexpert.ru</a> .  The range of proposed solutions was very different - from the proposal to attract celebrities to the recommendation to use in consultations young mothers sitting at home with the child. <br><br>  In addition to the presentations of startups with their subsequent discussion at recent meetings of StartupPoint, reports from invited experts in the field of Internet technologies and project management are presented.  At the 6th meeting, such an expert was Askhat Urazbayev, one of the founders of ScrumTrek, a specialist in the use of project management technologies based on Agile principles.  In his report, he pointed out the importance of an iterative and balanced approach between organizing startups and between the interests of business and development, and derived the main criterion for assessing the value of any innovative idea for an Internet project of its own - making profits from this project. <br><br>  Another innovation was the reports of the success story - success stories.  The creators of the two startups <a href="http://toolwi.com/">Toolwi.com</a> and <a href="http://kommandcore.ru/">Kommandcore.ru</a> presented about the development of their projects - from idea to real implementation.  The percentage of active participants in the meetings, as usual, was high. <br><br>  The most active received prizes from the partners of the meeting: free attendance of any lecture on the specialization <a href="http://rma.ru/internet/about.html">"Management in the field of Internet technologies"</a> from the company RMA. <br><br>  Two of the project audience‚Äôs favorite audience were invitations to the <a href="http://www.socialexp.ru/">‚ÄúVenture Investment of Internet Projects‚Äù</a> seminar from <a href="http://edu.it-online.ru/">Careerlab</a> absolutely free. <br><br>  There were also TV specialists at the meeting.  True, television was not quite ordinary - Anton Kulakov (a listener of the I-2 group of the specialization <a href="http://rma.ru/internet/about.html">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù</a> ) broadcast the meeting on the Internet live using the <a href="http://yatv.ru/">Yatv.ru</a> platform (online personal television service), one of the creators of which he is.  The broadcast took place online - Internet users could ask questions to the speakers. <br><br>  At the end of the meeting, Vitaly Akimov traditionally asked the participants to share feedback on the last meeting and voice their recommendations for the next minibar, which will be held on February 15.  Feedback and recommendations can also be left on the official website of startup seminars StartupPoint.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51053/</a></p>
