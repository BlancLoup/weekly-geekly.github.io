For any business, it‚Äôs a hot time that literally drains the team.  And then there's 11.11 sales, then Black Friday, and immediately New Year discounts ... Not a day for a break.  All year, we not only sent packages to all ends, chose goods, gave them to reviews, but also wrote posts on Geektimes to talk about the most interesting, unusual and profitable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e54/1ee/925/e541ee9258d0aadef77b05726e939f32.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Chinese industry and electronics, multiplied by the Chinese fantasy, give interesting results.  This is partly due to the steady demand for gadgets from the Middle Kingdom - you can always find something new, unusual and at a good price.  Moreover, there are well-known brands that pay attention not only to technology, but also to the quality of materials and assembly.  which means you can choose and buy confidently.  We studied the statistics of purchases and prepared the top "geek" gadgets, which were the most popular and received the most favorable feedback from the owners. <br><br><h2>  Computers as art </h2><br>  One of the most original geek wow effects is the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_493136.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">K8 Mini PC</a> , a miniature computer ... in a keyboard form factor.  But seriously, this is a flexible silicone keyboard with a built-in simple PC with tablet features.  The ideal advertising slogan for him would be the phrase: "Just add a monitor."  Indeed, it is enough for anyone, even a very old monitor, to start working.  Moreover, it is even possible to connect two monitors via HDMI and VGA outputs.  The performance characteristics of the device are modest on the tablet: Intel Z8300 processor, 2.0GHz, 4 cores, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 64GB internal memory, a microSD slot (128 GB microSDXC is supported), USB ports, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi support Fi.  On board Windows 10.

The ‚Äútablet‚Äù itself (if you want, the system unit) does not have a screen, but it works fine with gestures and serves as a touchpad.  The keyboard is rubber with all the consequences - typing large texts on it is inconvenient.  But you can, without fear of dripping tea and coffee, turn into a tube and put it in its case. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cd/1fb/132/3cd1fb1327eaf33e1d25f2833481fe39.jpg"></div><br>  Accurately identify for whom this computer is difficult.  Here you can watch movies at the dacha, and fully work with unloaded tasks, and use them as a keyboard with a good touchpad, for example, in the server room.  There are many options, although the computer is not very powerful.  We think real geeks will come up with a worthy use for him. <br><br>  A more familiar PC form factor (if you can even talk about a form factor here) is the universal favorite of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/raspberry-pi/pp_354347.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Raspberry Pi Model 3 B.</a>  Processor 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, 1GB LPDDR2 RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, supports distributions of ARM GNU / Linux and Windows 10 IoT.  In the case of this PC, there is no doubt in terms of application - an excellent ‚Äúbrain‚Äù for DIY inventions and for the personal Internet of things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aee/221/9dc/aee2219dc6db08e47760de54de9071fb.jpg"></div><br>  The <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/keyboards/pp_298472.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">MOTOSPEED Inflictor CK104 keyboard is</a> positioned by the company as a game, but there are several issues related to this definition, among which are non-game switches and not very thought-out ergonomics.  However, for office work and typing - this is a great solution, with your favorite many clacking sound and tangible move.  Multi-colored lights - an extra nice bonus.  The keyboard is firmly assembled - it is obvious that it will serve, if not forever, then for a very long time.  The current price is $ 43.99, a great compromise for such a device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14a/ab3/f82/14aab3f82eac41612e2df2139910040f.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Listen to music </h2><br>  This year <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/headsets/pp_265038.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">audio</a> lovers chose <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/headsets/pp_265038.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Meizu HD50 headphones</a> , which, by the way, now cost just a little more than 3,000 rubles ($ 49.99).  Strictly speaking, this is not just a headset, but a headset with the ability to answer calls, speak on Skype, record voice.  The frequency range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz, sensitivity 103 ¬± 3 dB, impedance 32 Ohm, in the delivery - 1.2 m cable and just a freaking cover, soft, shockproof and reliably protecting rather strong headphones.  Folding headphones themselves are made of metal and artificial leather and look stylish on any head: from the beautiful blonde top at the jog to the handsome bald head of the general director conducting a remote meeting.  The sound in the headphones can be called tube - clean, soft, comfortable, difficult to find music that will sound losing.  By the way, Meizu has not just released several models of headphones - this is their long-standing production, which is perfectly familiar to the Russian buyer: Meizu headphones came bundled with the popular Ritmix audio players.  Who remembers, Ritmix-s, among other benefits, always sounded great. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/headsets/pp_265038.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be4/e49/624/be4e496249bdd0a6a151b471f5d9528d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Headphones <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/headsets/pp_279992.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Superlux HD668B</a> - a great budget model from a well-known Taiwanese manufacturer of studio audio equipment.  Main sound characteristics: sensitivity 98 dB / mW, frequency range 10 Hz - 30 kHz, impedance 56 Ohm.  Included are two cables with a length of 1 m and 3 m, the weight of the headphones themselves is 222 grams.  Structurally, the headphones are very comfortable, strong, the budget of the ‚Äúsemi-professional‚Äù was affected only by the quality of the materials - good synthetic leather and ordinary plastic.  Due to the slight deviation from different angles, the ‚Äúears‚Äù fit as comfortably as possible and sit on any head.  The sound is not just good - the sound is excellent, the headphones are absolutely suitable for all musical styles.  For the price of $ 27.99, you can also stock up on the future for gifts to your favorite audio lovers or even fans to listen to music in a simple playlist. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a37/994/34a/a3799434ab0e6b817130a6b4e9ee60bd.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Listen to your heart </h2><br>  In the final review, it is impossible not to mention perhaps the most successful fitness bracelet among Chinese manufacturers - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_362705.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Band 2</a> .  Stylish, lightweight, with an excellent mount, it performs all its functions with a bang: it measures distance, counts calories, steps, measures pulse, controls sleep patterns, and even shows time.  The smart bracelet integrates with the app on the smartphone - this allows you to monitor the progress of physical activity.  New Year's price - $ 23.99. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f8/110/a73/2f8110a73487dce329c4b5ce4d6e2992.jpg"></div><br>  Pulsometer seems to be an attribute of some old man or granny with pressure.  in fact, this device is claimed not only by athletes - alas, cardiovascular diseases have become younger, and many young guys and girls need a portable, fast and imperceptible heart rate monitor to assess their condition and decide whether they need medicine.  This <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/measurement-analysis/pp_203885.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">miniature device,</a> priced at $ 11.61, will serve its owner faithfully. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96e/575/ae8/96e575ae83158bb93af88174883a94b8.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Popular smartphones </h2><br>  According to many Gearbest buyers, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_363558.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">OnePlus 3</a> smartphone is the top product of this year.  Indeed, the phone turned out to be a success: in a durable case there is an excellent filling, a capacious battery, and a good sound.  Onboard Android 6.0, 5.5-inch display, a powerful top-end Snapdragon processor 820 Quad Core 2.2GHz, 6 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal memory, support for OTG.  Thanks to such top-end electronics, the smartphone will cope with any tasks and will satisfy both the gamer, the businessman, and the amateur experimenting with the phone software.  The external camera is 16 megapixel, the front one is 8 megapixel - again, a universal set for travelers and lovers to take photos every day, as well as for lovers and lovers of solo and group selfies.  If someone else doubts, the smartphone works in 4G networks.  Battery - 3000 mAh, fast charging function.  Despite its size, the smartphone is perfectly in the hand and will fit almost any adult palm.  Well, the price during the New Year sale is $ 489.39. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/345/884/e10/345884e1011e081e221f13ca7955cebf.jpg"></div><br>  The best state employee, judging by the volume of orders and reviews, is the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_367021.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Redmi 3S</a> smartphone, which costs only $ 121.99.  Rumor has it that in the hands of individual geeks, he turned into a <s>synchrophasotron</s> practically a top device - as they say, brought to mind.  TTX fully correspond to 2016: Android 6.0, Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Octa Core 1.4GHz processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal memory, a fingerprint scanner on the back panel, a 13 megapixel camera.  The display of the smartphone - 5 inches, weight - 144 grams.  One of the main advantages is a 4100 mAh battery, which provides greater autonomy. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_367021.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74f/bd3/3b6/74fbd33b6d26b544c733d81bf004bd3e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another magic electronic box that was snapped up this year is the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_333724.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi TV Box 3 Enhanced TV box</a> , which was taken, rutted, tuned and received a powerful customized device that provided access from the TV to everything: from Youtube to radio, IP -TV and even street webcams in all corners of the planet.  The TV-Box has two USB ports, an HDMI input, a Cortex-A72 dual-core processor + a Cortex-A53 quad-core processor, runs on the Android 5.1 operating system, 2 GB RAM, and an integrated 8 GB memory.  Supports many formats of video, audio and photos, works with 4K.  With such power and even a built-in cooling system, the Xiaomi box has a very small size of 10 cm by 10 cm and a height of 2.5 cm. In general, for the price of only $ 89.60 you get access to a wide variety of entertainment. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/749/42e/949/74942e949eb8ba8d5ddb1d331b33b457.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Cause time - fun hour </h2><br>  Probably everyone has become accustomed to the fact that, following the victory of the gadget on Kickstarter, the ingenious Chinese create the exact same product and offer it to customers.  It happened with the Fidget Cube button - there is already a bright analogue on the Gearbest - the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_493775.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Magic Cube</a> .  There is only one recommendation - it is necessary to take it, because it really distracts, relaxes, has quiet movement options and is much less annoying to those around you than the clicking of a pen or the skip fastening button, so much loved by nervous workers.  And the price of peace is only five bucks. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_493775.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9e/e11/ad5/d9ee11ad55ac8e7dceda3ccb204bd0f9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Do you think that geeks and IT specialists sit at home, hit the keys and diligently make their home smart by soldering boards?  What do you know about them!  They can easily give away $ 307.18 for a toy car - and they know for sure that it's worth it.  For example, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_328270.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">JLB 2.4G Cheetah 1:10</a> model is a fantastic specimen in an aggressive design.  This "cheetah" is beautiful: it develops a speed of 70-80 km.h, easily overcomes irregularities and hills, turning over but keeping the suspension intact, forcing puddles and sand.  On one battery, the car lasts about 35 minutes - believe me, during this time you will have time to enjoy all the tricks and collect hundreds of spectators around.  The model is strong, perfectly assembled, resistant to vandal manners of the owner, equipped with a powerful engine.  The only drawback is the weight of almost 4 kg, the charging time is 6-7 hours (you can park for the night). <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_328270.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a38/fc1/c3a/a38fc1c3af807dce2a498b668ebbb2e3.jpg"></a> <br><br><h2>  Carry all yours with you </h2><br>  We often include bags and backpacks in reviews ‚Äî simply because the whole set of gadgets and other everyday things need to be worn in something durable and comfortable.  This is especially true in the season when it is most convenient to carry "all your own" behind your back.  For example, in the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/backpacks/pp_423939.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">TIGERNU T - B3143 backpack</a> - this year's clear hit among our customers.  A 17-inch backpack with a volume of 17 liters, with anti-vandal zip fasteners, stitched qualitatively, with a good waterproof coating, capable of holding both a laptop and a pile of clothes.  Inside the backpack are many compartments and hidden pockets for documents and for trivia.  Straps are wide, soft, do not shake and do not rub shoulders.  In the pre-New Year period, the price is only $ 29.59. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17b/001/7b5/17b0017b5dd453586aa987cfbfa3498e.jpg"></div><br>  Less than a week is left until the new year - everyone already has presents ready, someone has bought sweets and fruit, more and more New Year's videos and jokes around us.  Gearbest does not rest day or night, and even if you visit our website on the night of January 1, he will be glad to see you and is unlikely to lie down in 404 or 500. In the new year, we stay with you, continue to work, deliver, send, pick up, purchase.  Just in order to make the life of customers more convenient, more technological and more modern.  Happy friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400449/</a></p>
