  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business 160 bytes. Part one, introductory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SMS messages are not only convenient and simple means of communication, but also open up extensive business opportunities.  Only in Russia the market of SMS payments is 300 million dollars, and this is at a maximum message size of 160 bytes. <br><br>  If you have not seen the proposal to send SMS on TV, on the Internet or at least in spam on ICQ, then most likely you live on a desert island without all the pleasures of modern life.  I suppose few of you were lucky to solve the housing problem on a similar scale, doing away with the useful fruits of civilization and not always.  Nevertheless, human knowledge of the additional features of SMS is quite limited, and according to this, let us try to dispel some myths by drawing a lot of interesting information at the same time. <br><br>  Let's start with the simple.  What is SMS is described by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">Wikipedia article</a> , there is a history and technical details, so we will not repeat.  From this article, however, it is important for us to remember that SMS can be of two types - sent from the phone (MO - Mobile Originated) and received on it (MT - Mobile Terminated), then we will meet these terms in other meanings.

      With the help of SMS-protocol we can: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. send messages to each other from a mobile phone to a mobile phone; <br>  2. send messages from a mobile phone to e-mail or instant messengers like ICQ, and vice versa - from instant messengers to a mobile phone. <br><br>  Where and how the SMS will take place is decided by the SMS center - a gateway that processes SMS going in different directions.  Just like in the mail protocol, you can change the source of the message in SMS, so you can receive a message from ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù, ‚ÄúDed Moroz‚Äù and, in principle, any set of 11 letters or numbers.  Although it is forbidden by operators, <a href="http://svart.habrahabr.ru/blog/47266/">numerous services on the Internet</a> allow sending SMS messages with the ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù of the number. <br><br>  The cost price of an SMS message is actually zero, calculate for yourself how much they cost 160 bytes of traffic, but this does not prevent the operators to charge a lot of money from users for them.  Of course, with mass mailings, the cost can drop below one cent (millions of SMS), but as you understand, with such volumes, every fraction of a cent matters.  Typically, such volumes are used for mass SMS mailings during advertising campaigns or in SMS notification services.  It is worth noting that in Russia, <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/law/2009/05/29/smspam.html">SMS sending by decision of the Supreme Arbitration Court is not considered spam</a> , but in other countries the situation may differ. <br><br>  Now let's move on to more interesting things, when not an uncle pays for the message sent to us, but money is drawn from our own pocket, often quite big money.  Operators have special numbers, mostly 4-5 digits, which is why they are called ‚Äúshort numbers‚Äù (short codes).  Let's say right away - sending a message to such a number is always paid, in Russia the price varies from 1.5 rubles to 300 rubles without VAT per message.  Services paid in this way are called ‚Äúvalue added services‚Äù or ‚Äúvalue added services‚Äù ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAS">VAS</a> - Value Added Services).  As mentioned earlier, this is a multi-million dollar market with its players and rules.  In addition to selling content for the phones themselves, such as ringtones, wallpapers and JAVA applications, SMS is also used to pay for various services outside the mobile network - you can send a paid gift to a friend on Odnoklassniki, and download a movie from one of the many movie portals. <br><br>  Of course, there are enough fraudsters, because how convenient it is to pay a bonus in the game by sending a text message, it‚Äôs just as easy to subscribe to a super-bonus of a mobile operator or unlock your for some reason blocked account in gmail, descriptions of such <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581%2B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%26target_type%3Dposts">cases are enough</a> .  No matter how you fight the fraudsters, they will always find a way to use human gullibility for their own purposes.  The main reason that users fall for the hook is elementary ignorance, but it was with him that we were going to fight in a series of these articles, so the first blow was dealt! <br><br>  At the end of this introductory article, let us return to the positive side of using the wonderful service that we are discussing.  A bit more terminology (not all terms are scientifically agreed, but all are generally accepted by the main market players).  SMS messages sent to short numbers are called premium SMS (Premium SMS), as, in fact, the payment service itself with their help.  If we are talking about paying for something other than simple mobile content, we are talking about so-called ‚Äúmicropayments‚Äù (micropayments), and companies that provide a platform for their implementation are called sms billing.  A rather comprehensive overview of such companies can be <a href="http://sms-business.ru/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2.html">found here</a> , in principle, the entire resource is recommended for reading if there is interest. <br><br>  There are still a lot of questions, but it is probably worth taking a short break.  In the continuation of the article, we learn what fraud is, why SMS billing gives so little to its partners, why "informers" are sometimes not considered fraud, a lot of technical details, and much more.  And, of course, the authors of the articles will be happy to answer readers' questions. <br><br>  Musical pause <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/miscs/">smscoin.com/info/miscs</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68451/</a></p>
