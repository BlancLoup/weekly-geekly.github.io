  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Too many startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I had the feeling that everyone wants money.  Either I became interested in startups too much, or there were really too many of them.  There were thematic projects - start-up communities, directories and start-ups ratings, a bunch of small venture capital funds that specialize in Internet start-ups, venturers and start-ups about each other. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Regularly I go to thematic projects, and on Habr√© quite often new startups appear.  And everyone declares their uniqueness, advanced technologies, sociality, monetization, targeting and generally good prospects.  But the vast majority of new startups are a blatant crap.  I am not an investor and not a start-up, but I‚Äôm in my right mind to understand that no one really needs a designer‚Äôs next project, as well as another niche social network.  Someone somewhere said that you need to fill a niche and social networks about everything began to appear.  I will not even enumerate these niches, but so that you don‚Äôt remember which social group it is, it still has somewhere.  Probably, except for one, which is officially organized by a court decision - ‚Äúunclean cops‚Äù (case of S. Terentyev). <br><br>  In my opinion, the area is blurring.  Instead of cultivating really worthy projects, we have a stream of enchanting shit.  And this stream falls on investors, venture funds, you and me.  You look at a thread about the ‚Äúbest startups of the month‚Äù - 8 out of 10 projects there will be flawed, useless to no one.  For me, the benchmark for creating such business cards has become the standard of such uselessness.  And it looks like a tech-made Flash and it looks normal, but who needs it?  Those who really need a business card are unlikely to go to such a service.  Those who do not need a business card will also not go to such a service.  In the end, there are plenty of other tools where you can make yourself a business card, if very impatient.  Or another option - a startup to create a resume.  Cool, but in Word, there are templates that do exactly the same thing.  Then who needs a similar service?  And there are dozens or even hundreds of such services every month.  And it is good, if they are technological, beautiful, workers.  But after all, there are projects built in a couple of days in wordpress, today this is seen - some kind of social network for those who fly frequently - in fact, zero functionality, technology and does not smell, the project is not even working.  But already wants money.

      Apparently, today it has become fashionable to make startups, be proud of the investments received (incredibly lucky), share experiences on how to find an investor, write a business plan, put together a team.  Theorists today a lot.  But the quality falls with an increase in the number of projects - this is obvious.  There is no unique today, everything has been done somewhere before us with small changes.  They added some kind of chip and immediately became overgrown with uniqueness.  I think that soon we will all come to what freelancing has now become.  In the near future, there will be projects only for professional startups in order to somehow separate from the mainstream.  I have no doubt that every start-up with his project is worn like a chicken with an egg, he is confident in his usefulness himself is amazed how the world still lives without his project and what kind of investor is a fool that does not give money.  But somehow it would be time to sink to the ground, look at your projects objectively, assess the possible financial returns not only from an extremely optimistic point of view.  Come to your senses already, only 1-2% of projects receive money and live safely for at least 1 year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57553/</a></p>
