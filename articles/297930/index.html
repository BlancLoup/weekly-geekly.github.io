  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you really know your audience? Sure?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, having received feedback from the user, I once again found out that the user does not fit into the porta of the Central Asia to which I initially aimed.  A little thought, I decided to run a survey in the app to assess how true my assumptions about the audience were.  On the one hand, I was greatly amused by the results, but on the other, they made me think hard. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A bit of prehistory. <br>  I make an application for people involved in ‚Äúwind-dependent‚Äù sports: wind / kite surfers, yachtsmen, parachutists, paragliders, etc.  The application gives users a forecast of the wind for the next 10 days and has a base of ‚Äúspots‚Äù (POI) for which it is convenient to navigate. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Poll. <br>  The survey consisted of two questions: "What kind of wind interest do you have" and "How our app fits your needs?".  For the first question 6 variants of sports activity were proposed.  For the second - 5 assessment options, from ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù to ‚Äúvery good‚Äù.  And for each question there was an additional field with a comment. <br><br>  Already an hour after the launch of the survey, I found a very large number of unexpected answers: Fishing, Bicycling, Golf. <br>  When the number of comments with some kind of activity exceeded 20-30 - I added this option to the survey. <br><br>  Results: <br>  In just a month, about 10 thousand people took part in the survey.  This is about 30% of all users who have entered the application for this period.  This figure has already become amazing - I did not think that so many users will take part in the survey. <br><br>  The results that I received surprised no less: <br>  Yachting 21% / 2073 <br>  Kiteboarding 18% / 1796 <br>  <b>Fishing 18%</b> / 1780 <br>  <b>Bicycling 13%</b> / 1215 <br>  Windsurfing 11% / 1099 <br>  <b>Kayaking 6%</b> / 514 <br>  Paragliding 6% / 504 <br>  <b>Golf 5%</b> / 447 <br>  Skydiving 3% / 293 <br>  Ballooning 2% / 153 <br><br>  The options for less than 1% I dropped, otherwise the list would have turned out very large and diverse, for example: Drone pilot, Crane operator, Wind power producer, Veranda living (!).  :) <br><br>  Using such a simple tool as a survey, I learned that I have a very large segment of the audience - 42%, whose needs I did not take into account, but did not even suspect the existence of. <br>  Now I am actively communicating with this audience in order to better know its interests and understand how to further develop the application.  ‚ÄúNew‚Äù audience allows you to come up with new usage scenarios and develop the application in a direction that we could not even guess.  And it was enough just to ask people, and not to invent for them what they usually do and how to use the wind. <br><br>  Communicate with your audience and successful growth! <br><br>  Ps.  And, perhaps, the funniest case for using the application: one girl lives in the highlands, where the wind blows out periodically so that walking is simply dangerous ‚Äî it can blow off.  And this girl looks at the wind forecast every day and decides whether to go to work on foot or wait for the bus. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297930/</a></p>
