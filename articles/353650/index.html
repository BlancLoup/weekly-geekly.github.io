We propose to discuss what happened in fintech-sphere over the past few days.  And a lot of interesting things happened. <br><br>  First of all, the fact that <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/finansy-i-investicii/359897-trillion-vpustuyu-pochemu-v-rossii-tak-i-ne-poyavilas-cifrovaya">some experts consider</a> attempts to build a digital economy in Russia completely in vain.  Well, if the losses were purely temporary.  But no, about a trillion rubles was spent on the development of this sphere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That was how much was spent in the country on innovative projects in the field of fintech.  As it turned out, innovation and government funding are poorly compatible areas.  With all this, the digital economy is considered extremely important for strengthening the national security of Russia.

      Of course, there are some shifts in this direction, but there is no need to speak about cardinal changes.  It's a pity. <br><br><h2>  Robots in a Chinese bank </h2><br>  In China, China Construction Bank‚Äôs second largest bank has opened a branch in which <a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2141203/meet-new-face-branch-banking">customers are served by</a> robots.  They are engaged in working with clients in an office located in the Huangpu district.  There are several smart robotic systems that play the role of cashiers.  With their help, a bank client can open an account, send a transfer, exchange currency, invest in gold and receive asset management services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/tn/mn/potnmn_kocj14t8rsblrn7noi-u.png"><br><br>  The Chinese have developed a system in such a way that a robot informant meets customers at the entrance, who answers questions using a voice recognition system.  Initially, the robot carefully analyzes the visitor.  And only then, after a few years, he begins to recognize his owner by voice. <br><br>  China Construction Bank can now handle about 90% of cash and non-cash transactions.  If necessary, you can always contact the human operator if there is such a need.  As a result, the installation of machines, the bank increased the influx of customers and reduced staff costs. <br><br><h2>  New bills </h2><br>  And in Belarus they <a href="https://infobank.by/infolinebigview/messendzhery-i-socseti-mogut-li-belorusy-pereslatj-v-nix-denjgi-i-zhdut-li-nas-tam-moshenniki/">are preparing a bill</a> that will allow paying for goods or services with the help of instant messengers.  In addition, the messengers themselves gradually create and improve this function.  For example, Whatsapp plans to allow translation to its friends.  Given the user base of the messenger, this is a great idea. <br><br>  The function, apparently, should be added to the messenger in a short time.  Users will be able to confirm their own phone number using SMS, after which the application will open access to the Unified Payments Interface payment system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r1/zq/xz/r1zqxzkvmlkvj35aylycf47p7nw.png"><br><br><h2>  Well, about the blockchain </h2><br>  About a week ago, more than 20 EU countries signed a declaration on the creation of a European partnership in the field of blockchain technologies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn order to use the possibilities of blockchain technologies and to avoid a fragmented approach, the participants of this declaration agree to cooperate in creating a European partnership for the development of blockchain infrastructure that will help improve trustworthy and user-oriented digital services within the single market,‚Äù the declaration says , which was signed by 22 states.  As far as can be judged, the first cross-border actions will begin by the end of 2019. <br><br>  Well, PayPal is going to pay attention even to those users who do not have a bank account.  In particular, some users will be given ready-made debit cards if they have nothing.  PayPal has so far called the implementation of its idea "alternative financial services." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353650/</a></p>
