  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hacking Team deprived of the license to export their cyber services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Italian edition of Il Fatto Quotidiano <a href="http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/04/06/hacking-team-revocata-lautorizzazione-globale-allexport-del-software-spia-stop-anche-per-legitto-dopo-il-caso-regeni/2610721/">indicates</a> that the Hacking Team (HT) was deprived of the license to export its services and the company's RCS backdoor Galileo to other countries.  Earlier, we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/263321/">wrote</a> that EU regulators did not find a violation of the law in the activities of this ‚Äúorganization‚Äù (cyber groups).  Their license to provide their cyber services to other countries could operate for another two years, however, it was revoked.  According <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hacking-team-is-back-in-business-but-struggling-to-survive">to</a> the Motherboard edition, the head of HT did not give up after such an epic feil, and already in March of this year it became known about their return to the cyberservice market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/dcb/3cc/6f2dcb3cc05545259f23e97c40dccb88.png"><br><br>  The activities of the Hacking Team were widely publicized last year, when unknown persons published an archive on the network with all their confidential data and developments.  One of the main files in this case was the lack of encryption of HT's correspondence with their clients, which made it possible to quickly calculate each of them and make claims from the field of ethics and not only.  Simple users were also affected, since the company's exclusive 0day exploits were quickly built into popular exploit kits.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The Hacking Team has worked with a large number of intelligence services from various countries, including those that are clearly not in line with the spirit of the Wassenaar Agreement, for example, Russia and the former CIS countries, and countries with dictatorial regimes where governments use cyber services to suppress the rights and freedoms of their citizens. .  The publication Il Fatto Quotidiano writes that now each company's transaction with high-ranking clients of other countries will have to be coordinated separately from others and, apparently, in some cases the company will be refused cooperation even if the contract promises her serious money. <br><br>  According to the publication, the decision of the Italian officials entered into force immediately, which is caused by the ‚Äúchanged political situation‚Äù in the HT client states.  First of all, we are talking about Egypt, whose law enforcement agencies are delaying an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/giulio-regeni-italy-warns-egypt-to-speed-pace-of-investigation">investigation into the</a> death of an Italian citizen, a student Giulio Regeni.  According to Amnesti International, the situation with human rights began to deteriorate in Egypt in the last few years.  Thus, HT may refuse to provide services to Egyptian secret services. <br><br><cut><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06b/db6/2ee/06bdb62ee04d4e4baa1026bf27b76de4.png"><br>  Fig.  List of client countries HT.  It is visible that in the list there are Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan.  Azerbaijan. <br><br>  Recall that as a result of data leaks from the Hacking Team, source files from the backdoor for a wide variety of platforms, ranging from Windows to iOS, as well as exploits for web browsers and Flash Player, were online.  Among the leaked 400GB of data was all of the company's unencrypted correspondence with customers. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281042/</a></p>
