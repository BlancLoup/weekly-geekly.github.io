  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 critical errors when ordering a website</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  1) The first and biggest mistake of the clients is that they <strong>focus their efforts on the choice of the studio, and not on the formulation of the tasks</strong> that the site must solve.  The choice of studio is most often carried out in two ways: either interview the studio to find out the "price / quality" ratio, or consult with friends who already have experience creating websites.  In both cases, it is very difficult to predict the result.  Of course, you can hope for simple luck, when the choice will eventually lead to competent specialists who can advise, help to correctly define the goals of the site and prepare the technical task.  But most often the result of the work is a certain resource on the Internet, which not only causes dissatisfaction with both the client and the web studio, but also usually costs a lot of money.  And after a few months (an average of 6 to 24), the client orders a new site, trying not to step on the same rake, but again it comes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2) The second mistake is that the <strong>client is very rarely willing to admit his incompetence</strong> in the creation of sites.  Especially if he considers himself an "advanced user" and knows several html-tags.  As sages said, the more a person knows, the more deeply he understands the degree of his ignorance.  Web studio employees usually do not tell the client exactly how they need to conduct their business, lay out products on counters and communicate with customers.  At the same time, most site customers try to insist on their understanding of color, composition, content structure, and so on. <br><br>  3) The third mistake is the <strong>exaggeration of the role of design</strong> .  Of course, design is the part of the site that is immediately visible.  And this is something about which the client can always give at least some opinion.  Often this opinion is at the level of ‚Äúlike - dislike‚Äù, and if the studio starts going about the client and doing the design, ‚Äúso that the client likes it‚Äù, this can be considered as a complete work on the site.  The main role of site design is not to interfere with users' perception of information.  The key word here is ‚Äúinformation.‚Äù  It goes without saying that the design should be made in the corporate style and correspond to the general visual concept of the client - but no more! <br><br>  4) The next mistake is <strong>to try to chase after all the hares at once</strong> .  Since we decided to create a website, we will try to make the studio work out all the money paid, plus the same amount.  The most common situation in such cases is that the client sets the task to make an actively visited resource, but does not provide information that is interesting and necessary for visitors (and refuses to pay for its creation), cites world brands sites (often these are flash-based promotional sites), and while indicating that it is very important that the site pays off.  Surprisingly, web studios often try to implement this task definition, hoping that in the process of work all the problems will somehow resolve themselves.  As a result, the client remains dissatisfied with the work done, and the studio gets a dubious job in the portfolio, a dubious income and a lot of wasted time and nerves. <br>  5) The fifth mistake is that the <strong>client perceives the site as an extension of himself</strong> (especially if he is a business owner) or an extension of his business.  In fact, you need to consider the site as a tool through which money is earned.  As another resource for profit.  It is in this case that goals are correctly defined and priorities are set.  In the case of non-commercial resources, the goals are different, but now we are considering exactly commercial products and customer-web studios.

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      6) Another mistake - the <strong>perception of the site as a one-time financial investment</strong> .  Often, the client does not assume that the site as well as, for example, a car, requires further financial and labor injections.  From the payment of the domain name and hosting to the remuneration of those who will update, maintain, promote the search engines, and so on.  Therefore, either the client perceives negatively that the investment in the site with the act of acceptance has not been completed, or the site is not being supported, which makes all previous actions to create it meaningless. <br><br>  7) And, finally, the seventh error is the <strong>lack of evaluation criteria</strong> when accepting work.  First of all, it concerns the general concept of the site and its design.  It is in this situation that the most frequent problems arise between the client and the studio, a lack of understanding is revealed in the view of the project and conflicts arise.  It goes without saying that these criteria should be agreed upon and agreed by the client and the studio at the very beginning of the work on the project. <br><br>  Continued: <a href="http://taisha.habrahabr.ru/blog/38119.html">Ways to avoid mistakes when ordering a website</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22060/</a></p>
