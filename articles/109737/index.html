    <h4>  Editor's Bible </h4><br>  <b>Content</b> is paramount.  The editor always looks at the uniqueness and quality of the information provided.  There is a comparison with the resources already posted on this topic, as well as compliance with the topic section, as well as a comparison with the leading resources on this topic (if any exist).  Content should not be a mirror of other sites, or the result of the usual copy-and-paste.  Also, the resource should not be an SEO satellite (more on). <br><br>  <b>Contrast</b> - represents the diversity and diversity of the information provided.  The purpose of the ODP is to cover almost all points of view on the topic, to give the user a catalog, the right to choose. <br><br>  <b>Completion of the site.</b>  The editor does not just look at the first page of the site, he looks at many links.  If defects are found (the presence of 404, empty pages, empty sections, etc.), the placement of such a resource is likely to be denied.  <i>Take into account:</i> if, despite bad design, the presence of defects, the resource will provide unique information of its kind, which is nowhere else to be found, the resource can be recognized as particularly valuable and be placed in the catalog, despite the flaws. <br><br>  <b>Relevance of information.</b>  If the site claims that its information is regularly updated, the editor will periodically check it for updates.  It also checks the relevance of the information provided.  <i>Exceptions are</i> online archives, libraries, chronicles, etc., which may contain information that is no longer available on other network resources. <br><br>  <b>Hosting and performance</b> also affect the editor's decision.  The site must be loaded for a "reasonable" time and be constantly accessible.  The availability of the resource is periodically checked by the robot. <br><br>  <b>Design.</b>  The editor, as a rule, closes his eyes to the design and display of the site in the browser, provided that the content is high-quality and unique.  <i>Exceptions are</i> cases where design directly affects the readability of information.  In this case, the placement of the resource will be in question. <br><br>  <b>The authority of the resource and its owner.</b>  The editor must check the availability of complete contact information: who is the owner;  if the owner is a company, what is its full legal name, address, telephone number and other contacts.  Those.  all the information you can check. <br><br><h4>  Resources that most likely do not fall into the ODP </h4><br>  <b>1.</b> Resources based on multi-level marketing (MLM, Multi-Level Marketing).  Such resources are intended for promotion of a certain product, service or company.  This also includes mirrors, paid link catalogers, advertising platforms, resellers, websites of independent network marketing representatives. <br><br>  <i>Why does OPD not accept such resources?</i>  This is a single policy, argued that these resources duplicate the same information.  Only one can be added, the main resource (corporate site), while hosting others does not bring anything new and useful.  Paid directories, in turn, are intended to redirect traffic in order to generate profit for referrals / impressions.  Particular attention is paid to resources that use sales of goods / services on "referrals", in other words - build a pyramid of dependencies.  In no case will such resources be added to the catalog.  Sites of "financial pyramids" may also violate the laws. <br><br>  <i>The exception</i> is made by fan sites created by users whose primary purpose is not to earn money or to promote a product / service / company / person.  The second exception is mirrors duplicated by different languages. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Identical mirrors, offload sites and subdomains, including mirrors on different domains.  Such resources duplicate information.  The task of the editor will determine the main resource. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Resources with redirection and masked URLs.  The editor will check the source, and if it meets the requirements of the ODP, then it will place it.  The same rule applies to sites that download all content in an iframe. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Illegal sites.  This includes resources that host illegal materials that infringe intellectual property, call for illegal activities, or violate regional laws.  Exceptions are discussed by the editors on the forum. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Sites that place search results as sites are sites aimed at attracting advertising traffic.  Such sites are nothing more than ‚Äúspider food‚Äù aimed at search engines / spiders. <br><br>  <i><b>IMPORTANT:</b></i> In the ODP there is a system of "tags".  I will not reveal the subtleties of this mechanism, I will only say that the resource may be marked.  The label is attached to the domain, and it is impossible to bypass it, it will be attached to the resource, regardless of the section to which the application is submitted, and also on whether the application was deleted or not. <br><br>  Why am I saying this?  Do not fool the editors and the system as a whole.  The label is forever.  If the resource receives a red mark, the only way out is to change the domain, content and policy of the resource as a whole.  No new application will help. <br><br><h4>  Practical advice: how to choose a section and correctly fill out an application </h4><br><br>  <b>1.</b> First, determine the language of the resource.  If he is Russian, start by viewing the World / Russian section, if he is Ukrainian, start with World / Ukrainian.  I guess the logic is clear. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Make sure that your resource meets the requirements listed above, or at least does not contradict them. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> When selecting a section, review the already placed resources, compare them with yours. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Remember, a resource can be placed simultaneously in 2 sections: the first is thematic, the second is geographically. <br><br>  <b>5. The</b> URL should display the root directory of the domain.  For example, instead of <a href="http://domain.ru/index.html">domain.ru/index.html</a> you need to specify <a href="http://domain.ru/">domain.ru</a> .  This is due to the fact that in the future, the address may be changed. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Do not specify the legal form of ownership, for example, LLC, AT, etc., as well as TM, specify only the name. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> Do not use the words in the title: website, official website, online, homepage, invite, portal and the like. <br><br>  <b>8.</b> In the name special characters (including "") are not allowed, the exception is when they are part of the name. <br><br>  <b>9.</b> At the end of the name point is not needed. <br><br>  <b>10.</b> Do not write everything in capital letters.  If an abbreviation is used, first write the full name, and then in brackets () the abbreviation. <br><br>  <b>11. The</b> description should not duplicate the title / title. <br><br>  <b>12.</b> In the description do not use phrases: site pro, the site is / posted / you can and other similar. <br><br>  <b>13.</b> Description may not contain advertising context or characteristics like: best, largest, convenient, interesting, popular. <br><br>  <b>14.</b> Avoid expressions from the first and second person. <br><br><h4>  Human factor </h4><br>  Well, how can it be without him?  ODP very diligently selects applications to the editors, so if you think that you can apply, and then (in case of luck) enter with editorial rights and ‚Äúapprove‚Äù your resource - remember that you play Russian roulette with 5 patrons in the drum. <br><br>  Beginners are constantly monitored.  In addition, you will need to study dozens of topics, rules and instructions before you start checking the first application.  And do not forget that the editor is not the one who "approves" or "rejects" the sites, this is a person who first of all is looking for and adding resources, and in a significant amount. <br><br>  Therefore, it is better to spend 15 minutes to read this text and two hours to study the categories and their content.  Sit down, write a couple of categories, the themes of which are most suitable, think, look at examples of hosted sites, drop extra categories. <br><br>  And only then proceed to the preparation of the application, based on the recommendations outlined above. <br><br>  Remember, applications do not disappear anywhere, they are moved between sections, in case of inconsistency of topics.  Another thing is that in some sections editors do not exist at all, but there are only editors of the highest level of sections.  In this case, the application can lie for a very long time until the editor gets to it. <br><br>  The only way to increase your chances is to submit one application per category by geography and one or two in thematic sections.  Proper design increases the loyalty of the editor and, therefore, the chances to quickly get into the appropriate section. <br><br>  If anyone thinks that active editors are ‚Äúasleep‚Äù, I dare to assure you, there are about 78.900 topics on the editorial forum and more than 1,650,000 posts, so they have more than enough work and controversial issues.  Simplify their work. <br><br><h4>  Post factum </h4><br>  The information is based on translations of the original guides, also includes tips from editors with experience. <br><br>  Part of the factors released, part - combined for greater simplicity and better understanding. <br><br>  <s>I stir the article by connecting via mobile phone.</s>  <s>After bad weather, this is the only way to communicate, until new cables are stretched.</s>  <s>Therefore, if there are questions and comments - I will not answer immediately.</s> <s><br><br></s>  <s>At the time of dispatch, Chip &amp; Dale also decided to arrange for prevention - they are not so unlucky ...</s> <br><br>  <i>Good luck!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109737/</a></p>
