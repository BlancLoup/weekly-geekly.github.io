He also added that Sberbank is losing competition not to other Russian banks, but to IT companies that "take away the sweetest piece of cake from him." <br><br><h4>  Cooperation with Uber </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.sberleasing.ru/">Sberbank Leasing Company has</a> agreed on an exclusive partnership in the field of car leasing with the world's largest taxi ordering service.  Now, drivers collaborating with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> can buy cars on lease through Sberbank's subsidiary. <br><br>  In the Russian market, this is the first such partnership with a taxi service.  For Uber, such a decision could be a new stage in the development of business in Russia.

      The agreement will allow Sberbank "to increase the attractiveness of such a tool as car leasing" and "contribute to the development of small business," said the general director of Sberbank Leasing, Kirill Tsarev. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Under the terms of the agreement, Uber partner drivers will be able to receive cars under a simplified scheme and in a short time.  The Uber driver will not need to apply for the purchase of a car directly to the bank - it‚Äôs enough to leave a request in a special section for partners on the Uber website (‚ÄúCar Leasing‚Äù), RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/18/02/2016/56c5dc869a79470e3b27863c">reports</a> . <br><br>  In fact, requests from Uber partners will ‚Äúautomatically receive approval from the bank‚Äù after downloading and checking all the necessary documents to the Uber system, a representative of Sberbank Leasing explained to RBC. <br><blockquote>  Sberbank Leasing provides passenger cars only to individual entrepreneurs (IP).  A prerequisite is that the driver has at least 500 trips made through the Uber platform. </blockquote>  The remaining conditions are standard: the minimum advance for a car is 10%, the lease term can reach three years with the possibility of buying a car after 12 months.  The first driver-partner of Uber has already taken advantage of preferential terms from Sberbank Leasing, a Sberbank Leasing representative said. <br><br><h4>  Collaboration with eToro </h4><br>  Sberbank and Israeli trading startup <a href="https://www.etoro.com/ru/">eToro</a> will create a joint venture in Russia.  This was announced on February 17.  Sberbank intends to integrate social network for eToro investors into its applications.  According to the head of the bank German Gref, the trading platform will be primarily focused on unqualified investors. <br><br>  The service will allow Sberbank customers to make transactions with shares on the platform and pay them from their own bank account. <br><br>  The companies plan to create a joint venture by the end of 2016.  Revenues will be divided in the proportion of "50 to 50", <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/money/17/02/2016/56c48f4d9a7947e87081ccb4">according to</a> RBC. <br><br>  eToro is a platform for investors created for online trading of financial instruments.  In addition, this trading community, whose members online can exchange information about transactions, financial indicators and strategies used.  The network allows you to either buy CFDs (contracts for difference), or copy the investment strategy of other members of the community. <br><br>  In 2014, the Sberbank venture fund invested in eToro.  Sberbank Vice President Mikhail Ehrenburg spoke about the reasons for the deal: <br><blockquote>  First, we expect it to be financially efficient.  Secondly, in our mission it is written: we are always there.  eToro makes financing more intimate and understandable; this is the same thing that Sberbank does, only with the help of other technologies. </blockquote>  By the way, on February 18, Sberbank invested in another IT company, Firrma <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/news/7253/">writes</a> .  Together with the funds of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaz_Capital_Partners">Almaz Capital</a> , <a href="http://moneytime.ventures/">MoneyTime Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.rtp.vc/">RTP Ventures</a> (one of the funds of Leonid Boguslavsky), Sberbank invested in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridGain_Systems">GridGain Systems</a> . <br><br>  The volume of the round was $ 15 million.  As a result of the transaction, MoneyTime Ventures general partner Viktor Orlovsky joined the board of directors of GridGain Systems. <br><br>  GridGain was founded in 2010 by immigrants from Russia Dmitry Setrakyan and Nikita Ivanov.  She specializes in developing software for working with large amounts of RAM in real time (In-Memory Computing technology). <br><br><h4>  Non reciprocal love </h4><br>  In September, Sberbank completed a program to centralize the bank‚Äôs IT systems.  As a result, it was possible to combine the heterogeneous infrastructure of technological platforms (more than 15,000 systems installations) of all territorial banks, centralize the databases, standardize and unify business processes, Sberbank <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2015-09-21_sberbank_zavershil_programmu_tsentralizatsii_svoih">reported to</a> CNews. <br><blockquote>  The objectives of the centralization program were to reduce the time to market banking products, to create qualitatively new conditions for the further centralization and unification of operational and business functions, and to reduce Sberbank's IT costs. </blockquote>  On Thursday, February 18, CNews <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-02-18_sberbank_provodit_sverhskorostnuyu_zakupku_zarubezhnogo">reported</a> that Sberbank announced a <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/223/purchase/public/purchase/info/common-info.html%3FnoticeId%3D3412041%26epz%3Dtrue%26style44%3Dtrue">tender</a> for the supply of software and hardware for almost $ 30 million.  The tender in the form of a request for quotations was announced by the bank on February 15, 2016. <br><br>  Sberbank asked potential contractors to send their requests for the supply of equipment and licenses for <a href="http://www.avaya.com/ru">Avaya</a> video conferencing software within three days.  This term, to put it mildly, is small. <br><br>  The initial price of the lot is set at $ 29.6 million - more than 2.3 billion rubles (at the Central Bank rate on the day of the announcement of the competition). <br><br>  It is noteworthy that Sberbank does not consider any other vendors, except Avaya. <br>  In July 2015, the bank was <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/223/purchase/public/purchase/info/common-info.html%3FnoticeId%3D2651330%26epz%3Dtrue%26style44%3Dtrue">looking for a</a> supplier of equipment and licenses for Avaya software for $ 16.9 million, but in October refused this idea for wanting to participate in the tender. <br><br>  In October 2014, the bank <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/223/purchase/public/purchase/info/common-info.html%3FnoticeId%3D1593490%26epz%3Dtrue%26style44%3Dtrue">arranged a</a> request for quotations for service and technical support of software and hardware complexes of its contact centers and related systems on the Avaya platform with an initial price of $ 5.8 million.  In December of the same year, the procedure was declared invalid due to the lack of bidders for the contract. <br><br>  In June 2013, the bank <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/223/purchase/public/purchase/info/common-info.html%3FnoticeId%3D400619%26epz%3Dtrue%26style44%3Dtrue">announced a</a> tender for the supply of Avaya telephone equipment and software with a starting price of $ 40 million.  The commission extended the deadline for submitting proposals three times. <br>  After that, in November 2013, a protocol for opening the envelopes with the proposals of the companies <a href="http://www.platformix.ru/">Platformix</a> , <a href="http://www.step.ru/">Step Logic</a> , <a href="http://deltapay.ru/about">Delta Telecom</a> , <a href="http://www.krastkom.ru/">Krastkom</a> , <a href="http://www.oberon-it.ru/">Oberon</a> and <a href="http://www.croc.ru/">Krok Inc. was published</a> . <br><br>  On the state procurement website, the contest is still in the status of ‚Äúcommission work‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298826/</a></p>
