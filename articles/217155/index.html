Research presented by Kissmetrics suggests that the usual e-mail is ten times more efficient than social networks when it comes to conversion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ce/ec1/007/5ceec100791011b37929f46e65ca1a58.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Year after year, the popularity of social networks has grown, which have managed to create the appearance of effective work ... and nothing more.  But this does not mean that marketing using these resources has no future.

    <h4>  The main problem of groups in social.  networks - their focus on the immediate completion of the purchase by the client. </h4><br>  The problem lies in the attitude of most marketers to social networks.  They look at them as a way to expand their brand presence on the Internet.  They perceive them in the same way as an e-mail or product description page and expect a stream of likes and comments.  After a series of failures, the seller usually abandons these attempts and stops viewing the page as a way to promote the goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e84/c19/495/e84c194950758637796ea82803f2081b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fry's Electronics Facebook Page is an example of a typical sales channel.</i> <br><br><h4>  Adjust the communication channel </h4><br>  Ideally, you should create a bridge that will connect you and network users who will eventually become your regular customers.  One of the ways to achieve this is creatively covering your company's activities.  Create an online image of your company, emphasize your mission and principles, let people see your work and understand that you work for them. <br>  A vivid example of effective use of Facebook for brand promotion is Starbucks, which has become one of the top 100 brands on this site.  Their announcement of new stores in Austin, Texas received over 600 reviews and nearly 20,000 likes.  And this is not surprising, Starbucks has always been a company that promoted a brand, not a product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/6af/17e/b6d6af17e4eb46aa760b473558000b32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Telling the story of your company, as much as possible reflecting its activities, you will achieve positive results.  The user should be part of your story.  Interest him, make him proud of your achievements and create a friendly atmosphere.  All this in sum with the supply of digital material about your products, will create a solid base for your readers to become your customers. <br>  It is also important to understand which target group you are targeting, and which platform you should use.  It is not about narrowing the target group to people of a certain age and leading an active offensive in this direction, but about the fact that you cannot simply duplicate the Facebook page from Facebook and hope that it will also effective, as in VK.  There are many studies on the structure of network users.  For example, in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198722/">Who lives in social networks?</a>  ¬ªThe author provides such information about the activity of users in the domestic soc.  networks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/acd/d33/cb8acdd33d1055563dabac080e63744b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For the analysis of foreign resources, it is worth <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027398/a-new-survey-reveals-which-social-media-brands-people-are-most-attached-to">referring</a> to one of the latest <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027398/a-new-survey-reveals-which-social-media-brands-people-are-most-attached-to">research from Fastcocreate</a> , which provides information on the popularity of networks among various age groups.  It is worth emphasizing that, despite the apparent popularity, Twitter is not included in any of the three TOP-5: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/247/73e/2df/24773e2df91bca816cab1adbfd201914.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So why does the promotion in social networks fail?  The reason is that most groups have become a platform for arguing with their competitors or a simple sales bulletin board.  Nowadays, including through networks, the user has more access to information than ever.  He will simply not believe your statements that the product is the best, but he will gladly take the opportunity to ask the person who has already bought such a product and uses it. <br><br>  In addition, if you evaluate your group in the network by such criteria as the number of people who bought goods directly on this page, then you significantly underestimate its potential and mechanisms of influence.  Having seen your group in the list of pages of his friend, the user will remember your brand, emphasizing for himself that these products are like his friend.  It is thanks to this installation, the user will later make a purchase in the online store or through a sale announcement. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion: the main criterion for evaluating the promotion in the network is the number of active subscribers. </h4><br><br>  People do not come to social networks in order to buy something or enter into a couple of contracts.  Invite the user to the conversation, create an atmosphere of conversation and establish effective feedback, make the user an active fan of your commercial team.  Traditional contests and sweepstakes, promotions and distribution of free samples for repost or other content will be a great way to increase activity.  All this will gradually force the user to associate himself with your brand and make him your loyal follower, who will not only make purchases, but also expand your audience through secondary contacts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217155/</a></p>
