I think many are already familiar with it and know that one of its main drawbacks is the <i>touch</i> buttons of the consoles.  To use them, to put it mildly, it is unusual (especially for people of age), and it is still inconvenient to use in the dark - it is problematic to find the right touch button. <br><br>  Those who went to the electro-exhibitions with the participation of Nootechnics last year and the year before could see a prototype of a wall-mounted radio control with push-buttons (not touch-sensitive) buttons on their stand.  Push-button consoles do not have the disadvantages of their sensory counterparts, but they have a new big disadvantage - it is not clear when their production will begin.

      So ... it seems that this deficiency will soon be eliminated!  A small experimental batch has already been released, and in April, as it was said in Nootekhnika, their mass production will begin! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/1a2/106/1a11a21069cd43d1b78679870d863bac.JPG"><br><br>  It so happened that I got samples for testing from the first batch of consoles for testing.  I will try here to share with you my impressions of their use. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>I apologize in advance for the quality of the photos (namely, the darkness in the corners).</i>  <i>Unfortunately, there was no normal camera at hand and the shooting conditions were not very good :(</i> <br><br>  And now - let's go! <br><br><h4>  So... </h4><br>  There are only two new models of panels: 1-button PB211 and 2-button PB411.  Interestingly, the cost of both models is the same - $ 22.3, as indicated on the manufacturer's website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/103/93f/33910393ffcb48d387dae8790127af2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/202/575/043/20257504392d44069a5ffc8d4e828b60.jpg"><br><br>  The operation scheme of the new consoles is exactly the same as that of the old ones: the console is tied to the power unit controlling the load and sends commands to it by radio.  To bind / untie, as before, you need to press the buttons on the body of the unit and the remote.  Just like the touch panels, the new models are universal and work with all types of power units. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf5/2e3/89c/bf52e389ce4042d2b64f60dec1e7c992.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Buttons! </h4><br>  In general, the consoles have a pleasant appearance and one feels that they are made of high-quality plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbf/47b/2c3/dbf47b2c3c6642f7b9280fe68b662908.jpg"><br><br>  Buttons protrude from the body of the console by about 4-5 mm and the button stroke when pressed is about 1 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20c/989/525/20c98952538346138bdfd10b33abd740.jpg"><br><br>  At the top of the frame there is a small hole, behind which the LED is installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b51/d0f/561/b51d0f5611f54130953b9236387b8e01.jpg"><br><br>  Each button is pressed in two places (top / bottom) and, depending on the selected mode, can control one or two channels (each channel is an independent group of power units).  If the button controls one channel, the light is adjusted in different directions when you press different sides of the button.  If the button controls two channels, then each side of the button can be linked to its own group of lamps. <br><br>  The mode of operation of the console, on which the actions performed when pressing the button depends, can be selected using the switch on the back of the console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddb/08b/1d4/ddb08b1d484a408997c817c96abcbf03.jpg"><br><br>  There are 4 modes available: <br><ul><li>  top - turn on / increase the brightness in the channel, bottom - turn off / decrease the brightness in the same channel; </li><li>  top - on / off / change of brightness in the first channel, bottom - the same, but for the second channel; </li><li>  top - on / off / change of brightness in the first channel, bottom - scenario button (second channel); </li><li>  top and bottom - two scenario buttons that control different channels. </li></ul><br>  It is noteworthy that in the two-button PB411 remote control, the selected mode is applied immediately to both buttons.  Those.  Both buttons always work in the same mode and you cannot set up, for example, that the first button controls one channel, and the second button does not control two channels. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br><br>  If the appearance of the nooLite touch consoles was copied by the design of the famous W59 series from Schneider Electric, then the design of the new consoles corresponds to the series <a href="http://www.bylectrica.by/catalog/sockets/ujut1/">‚Äú</a> Cosiness <a href="http://www.bylectrica.by/catalog/sockets/ujut1/">‚Äù</a> from Bylectrica.  In principle, this is good, because  There is an opportunity to put sockets and other electric accessories that would look consistent with switches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ac/055/4ca/3ac0554ca36a45c58b59e2eec1c519d7.jpg"><br><br>  The new remotes will be available in two colors: white and beige (ivory).  Beige remotes do not exist yet.  Their production should begin a little later, but it seems to be before the end of April of this year. <br><br>  The consoles have two frames (internal / external) and, what is especially pleasing, are the internal colored frames from the fittings of the series <a href="http://www.bylectrica.by/catalog/sockets/ujut1/">"Cosiness"</a> , which I wrote about above.  With the help of colored frames, you can significantly improve the appearance of the remote in the interior of your apartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/267/0a8/ab8/2670a8ab8f354aa6aca739ae5ccdb112.jpg"><br><br>  A total of 23 colors are available: white, ivory, light gray, dark gray, orange, terracotta, red, blue, azure, burgundy, lilac, light green, black, light brown, chocolate, yellow, pink, olive, light olive, turquoise, blue, gold, silver.  It seems that this is enough to adapt the consoles to wallpapers and furniture of any color :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fd/7ff/700/8fd7ff700a124f7cbdc47ae3f31fd41a.jpg"><br><br>  Of the minuses - when you see the remote, it is not clear what button it does.  Particularly incomprehensible due to the fact that the purpose of the buttons may be different for different remotes and the only option is to remember all this.  It would be cool if there were some engraving or stickers on the buttons indicating the action being performed. <br><br><h4>  What's inside? </h4><br>  Of course it was very interesting to see what was inside the new consoles and I took them apart.  It was not at all difficult to do ... <br><br>  First of all, remove the back cover.  For this you need to pry a screwdriver here in this place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe6/6f9/3e3/fe66f93e3e0f4b88b11e92ba5f41bc29.jpg"><br><br>  Please note that the mount at the back cover is a bit strange.  Below this is the slot and the installed cover deforms it and due to this keeps in its place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49d/8db/766/49d8db766e934462b7d1befa57bade03.jpg"><br><br>  I first climbed the screwdriver into this slot and almost broke the mount. <br><br>  It looks like this with the back cover removed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f4/fe6/72c/2f4fe672c9264d0492f3bcdbd88451a1.jpg"><br><br>  Next you need something sharp neatly pry off the inner frame latch (on four sides). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/755/157/299/75515729934a4c00b4976d7168531bf6.jpg"><br><br>  After this, we take out the inner frame and the microcircuit with the buttons, which the inner frame holds in its place. <br><br>  Front view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c10/232/bf7/c10232bf708440afbf05564ce1d3f4da.jpg"><br><br>  Back view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0e/ea0/26d/d0eea026dcca4e7f9c6e9027f1dcbc96.jpg"><br><br>  The button itself is glued to the chip.  At a minimum, this means that you cannot replace the button on the remote (for example, put a beige instead of white) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/1fb/8cb/b141fb8cb80b449ca3b67812b5bd814d.jpg"><br><br>  I did not tear off the button from the chip, because  there was no glue gun at hand, then to return everything back. <br><br>  Back side photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/92b/ac2/29e92bac2e854c8e8ca12a19f80edd4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e58/e92/778/e58e9277891c42498cc8ab835bb919bd.jpg"><br><br>  A photo of the front side of the chip lay out later. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  In general, we can say, Nootechnika once again got a thoughtful and functional device, which is also a pleasure to hold.  The device is not without flaws (strange mounting of the back cover and glued button), but all this does not seem important, compared with the ability to change the color of the internal insert, and just with the fact that finally there are normal switches with normal <i>push</i> buttons.  Well, I am also glad that they did not begin to cheat up the price of new consoles. <br><br>  Shl.  There is information that in the summer the nooLite model range will be replenished with power blocks with feedback.  Here it would be very interesting to look at them! <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Photo of the front side of the board <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/0cb/842/785/0cb8427853384b598e4e384936275fcd.jpg</a> (1.4MB) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391569/</a></p>
