Almost every office has internet.  It would seem, why invent something else?  Why supplement communication with customers, partners and colleagues with some new technologies and devices? <br><br>  In fact, there is why.  Today, a typical customer is spoiled by attention, he does not need to do anything on his own.  He will be called, invited, informed.  Then they will write to the post office, get caught on the street, they will meet at home.  He does not want to strain - the less effort on his part, the better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That is why our services are aimed at simplifying communication between the company and the client.  Minute advertising.  Even less.

      For example, a mobile application that allows customers to make free calls to your company from anywhere in the world with just one button. <br><br>  Or the service "Call from the site."  Just click - and the user will connect with the desired department or manager. <br><br>  As well as video conferencing services for up to 100 people from any country. <br><br>  There are many services - and all of them are connected in order to simplify the life of your potential client, that is, to save time and effort. <br><br>  And also save time and energy to you.  We undertake all the technical part and are always available for communication on any issues.  If you do not have the necessary equipment - for example, for a call-center - we will provide it for rent.  New and powerful. <br><br>  If you've read to the end, for sure, you have one question in your head, very short.  This question is how much.  How much does it all cost.  And whether it is justified. <br><br>  Well, you decide.  We will not write that we have the cheapest offer on the market and we will give you the biggest discount in the world.  Not.  From the very beginning of the company, the main word for us is quality.  We buy good, expensive equipment, provide high bandwidth (billion minutes per month), reserve channels 100%, support our client around the clock.  Technically and morally :) <br><br>  Moreover, we have guarantees.  We work with our clients under the Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This means that the guarantee of availability and quality of services will not be below 99.5%. <br><br>  Like this. <br><br>  See you in the next posts and comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286336/</a></p>
