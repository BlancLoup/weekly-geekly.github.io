  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three days off in the frame of reference # 9DW</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of months ago, the International Labor Organization proposed moving to a four-day working week. <br>  According to ILO calculations, in such a work regime, the health of the population will improve, because in three days a person rests and recovers much better than in two. <br><br>  Almost in all articles devoted to this news, the temptation of such a proposal for the laboring masses was noted, but in the end they concluded that the Russian economy is still too low-tech for such a step as the transition to a four-day working week. <br><br>  Indeed, when asking the question ‚ÄúWe want to rest for Y days, with Y = 3.  Is X working days enough to make money?  Where X is located according to the formula X = 7-Y "probably the majority of citizens of our country will have doubts that they will be able to earn enough money in 4 days to cover them for 3 days of rest.  (the ending is superficial, not taking into account much) 
      <br>

      But if we reformulate the question differently, namely ‚ÄúFor what value of Z, I have enough money earned in X days, provided that Y = 3, and X = ZY‚Äù, then it is much more interesting to answer it. <br><br>  For myself, I already picked up the value of Z, it is equal to 9. X, respectively, will be equal to 6. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  X = 6 <br>  Is it bad or good? <br>  It seems like our parents found the time when the working week in the USSR was 6 days, with one day off.  And now some voluntarily, and some involuntarily (teachers) go to work on Saturday.  Therefore, there is confidence that 6 working days is not a critical load on the human body.  And unequivocally say that this is bad impossible. <br>  And for those who often go on business trips, or constantly coordinate all sorts of documents, X = 6 is generally a gift.  For 6 days, you can safely get by plane through Moscow to any other major city in Russia, work there for 2-3 days, return to your hometown on day 5, go to work on day 6 and report back on a business trip.  When X = 5, personally, I often have the case that either you leave / come on a day off, or you have to squeeze a program of 3 days on site for up to 1-2 days.  Both that and another strongly affects on rest after business trip. <br>  When coordinating documents, there are situations that at the beginning of the week all sorts of nuances are coordinated, and when you need to sign on the 4-5 day, the main persons either have not yet returned from a business trip, or went on vacation ahead of time, using Day 5 as an important tactical reception in receiving ‚Äú10 days - 10 nights, all inclusive. "  Therefore, the signing is stretched for the next week, and the work is worth it.  Yes, it should not be so, but in everyday work it is widely met. <br>  In general, X = 6 (8 times per day) is definitely better than X = 4 (12 times per day). <br><br>  Y = 3 <br>  Definitely good. <br>  You can leisurely go / fly to another city on an excursion or visit relatives. <br>  You can get up on the first day later, by day to clean up the apartment, and closer to the night, go to the cottage and not standing in traffic jams on the outskirts of the city, in 2 hours you can reach it at most.  Two nights in the fresh air will restore strength to the maximum and it will not be so depressing to return to the city at lunch on the third day. <br>  It is possible on the first day, while they are still sleeping off, to purchase construction materials, to devote the second day to repair, and to leave the third day for a full rest with the family. <br>  This is if you certainly do not drink alcohol at any opportunity, and yes, Slepakov will have to rewrite the song. <br><br>  Z = 9 <br>  I do not see any reasons, except religious, which could somehow substantially prevent this.  The number of days in the month remains the same. <br>  And with the work schedule, let's say 1 after 2 or 3 after 3, Z = 9 is more convenient than Z = 7 for calculations.  With other graphs, they seem to be parity. <br>  But in order to introduce a 9-day in a single country, it seems to me that you need to be an even more decisive ruler than Peter the First, who shaved the beards of the boyars in the European manner. <br><br>  Well, it seems that I have expressed my thoughts on this matter in an interesting way.  And before moving on to the second part (practical) of my post, I would like to ask readers who know some interesting facts or articles on this topic to give them or refer to them in the comments. <br><br>  Part two is practical. <br><br>  What do I suggest? <br>  In any case, Habr and its derivatives are valuable primarily for their comments.  I do not exclude the possibility that I will remove this entry in a draft with shame, having understood from the comments how deeply I was mistaken and superficially looked at the world order. <br><br>  Therefore, I didn‚Äôt immediately create an initiative on the IC, knowing that it would not even get 200 votes a year, even considering the Habro effect. <br><br>  But what I did right away is the new calendar for 2015, given the new input data.  Additional working day and day off denoting respectively as P + 1 and B + 1. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27e/2a6/e5f/27e2a6e5fd36481d86f06a293653152d.png"><br><br>  In this picture you can see how our life can change. <br><br>  So I suggest that anyone interested in this idea will unite in some semblance of a scientific group studying the possibility of living in a 9-day week. <br>  I do not think that there will be a working person who can (and most importantly want to) work and rest in accordance with this calendar for at least a month, so research will probably be more virtual than natural. <br>  But also virtually, it is possible to make a conclusion on Friday evening based on your state of health, whether you could productively work one more day (P + 1) or not, whether it would be decisive in some important aspect of the work or not. <br>  The same with B + 1, on Sunday evening, write how last weekend would be radically different if it were 3 days and not 2. <br><br>  I think for the collection of statistics, social networks will completely get away if the recordings are accompanied by a common tag, for example - # 9DW <br><br>  And a year later, having already summarized the real reports and interested the public, it is possible to put forward both on the IC and Kikstarter. <br><br>  And at the end of another couple of numbers, on average, the number of working days in a month decreases by 1-2 days (it remains the same in three months).  And for the year, the number of working days will decrease by 17 days (249 work days against 232 work days). <br><br>  Upd.03.12.14 <br>  On December 12, 2014, an initiative was created at the POI to <a href="https://www.roi.ru/16153">increase the working week to six days and to reduce the working day to 6.5 hours</a> . <br><br>  Bottom line <br><br>  1. Increase productivity. <br>  2. Increase the amount of free time for the population. <br>  3. Increasing such sensations of a person as: the need for society, the level of happiness. <br>  4. Strengthening the family. <br><br>  Presently: <br>  37 votes cast for the initiative <br>  939 votes cast </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363643/</a></p>
