  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basketball court patterns: Weak team, Personal float and Minus moral</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Spent half a day on the basketball court.  A good workout, and, as the Americans say, ‚Äúthought-provoking‚Äù.  I want to share some observations - common, in my opinion, for team sports and team development. <br><br><h5>  Observation 1: WEAK TEAM <br></h5><br>  The formation of a team of unfamiliar and unfamiliar players on the court is rapidly rapidly.  Crashed three-by-three, more or less fair in growth, in terms of the game and drove off.  If after a couple of minutes you realize that you are in a weak team, it is difficult to enjoy the game. <br><br>  Funny pattern: think ‚ÄúI am in a weak team,‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwe are a weak team.‚Äù  Moreover, regardless of their own level of play.  It would seem that both are a statement of fact, but there is a nuance.  I tried to repeat to myself several times, to observe the sensations: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  I am in a weak team, I am in a weak team ... I am in a weak team.  It feels like something like: ‚ÄúI'm my poor thing,‚Äù such an injustice happened to me, what can you do. </li><li>  We are a weak team, we are a weak team ... we are a weak team.  Initially, a similar annoyance, but with each repetition on the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù I start to wind up, a much more active reaction to, in fact, the same fact. </li></ul><br><h6>  Conclusion: <br></h6>  There are no passive donors in the team.  We can change a lot in the original ‚Äúgiven‚Äù when we take responsibility for teamwork.  To think more often ‚Äúwe‚Äù when you notice someone else‚Äôs or your own weakness.

    <h5>  Observation 2: PERSONAL TERKS <br></h5><br>  I observed such an effect several times: you need to break up into teams, but you really don't want to get into one team with that tip.  And of course, you will have to play with him sometime, or worse, programming in pairs.  How to be?  Quit the game?  Change project? <br><br>  There is such a belief that in a good team, everyone should be friends, practically love their neighbor.  But many virtuoso teams of athletes, scientists and musicians prove it is false.  If a task is an occasion for a team, then only personal contribution is a reason to play together.  Bank robbers gather in teams not for musical and gastronomic tastes, but for good for business.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, we have something to appreciate even those people whom we do not love. <br><br><h6>  Conclusion: <br></h6>  We like people who are like us, and the project is useful for the participants, different in style and skills.  Look for reasons to work together instead of reasons to like each other. <br><br><h5>  Observation 3: MINUS MORAL <br></h5><br>  Minus morality - so in sports and team games they call actions that undermine the morale of the team, jeopardizing the results, health and even the lives of its members.  Regardless of the technique of the game and the star team, often teams that have not learned to recognize and discard such actions lose to those in which the team spirit and sense of support are strong. <br><br>  The effect of minus morality may not be so obvious in the office, but it is perfectly observed on the sports ground.  Often the dynamics of the game, and even the score, change drastically when you get rid of a player who releases stinging comments and reproaches. <br><br>  The job of an engineer is to solve problems for which there are no ready-made solutions.  Technological expertise plays an important but far from decisive role.  The fear of experimentation, the inadmissibility of mistakes, criticism from technical leaders are social stoppers blocking the value stream. <br><br><h6>  Conclusion: <br></h6>  Social context determines team success.  We can achieve better results by agreeing on the rules of interaction.  Decide what is ‚Äúminus morality‚Äù for us and gradually get rid of such actions. <br><br>  Software development is a team game.  At least I like this way of thinking.  But in my opinion, our field lacks good team experience and strong examples associated with it.  I would be glad to learn about your experiences and conclusions.  And I strongly advise you to try team sports, it's exciting :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151246/</a></p>
