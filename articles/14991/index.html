  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IMified: IM and newgen user account - new web technology and to-do list + bonus reminder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I came across an <a href="http://www.imified.com/">imified.com</a> service (and the first acquaintance was from the IM contact - imified@imified.com).  In a nutshell - the service allows you to create notes (Notes), reminders (Reminders), to-do lists (Todos), to store them in an ‚Äúinfinite dimension‚Äù (that is, as many as you like).  Reminders allow you to set alert triggering.  The chip is in the latter.  But even this is not the main thing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Prehistory </h3><br>  There are different systems and ways of organizing cases, reminders of them. <br>  Steve Jobs aka Shishka from Yabble in the new Leopard offered the controversial opportunity to create Todo lists in Mail so as not to send letters to himself.  Anyway. <br>  I once had two icq uin'a (work \ home) for these purposes.  Those.  instead of letters, I sent im-messages to myself, so that upon arrival (understand correctly) I would not forget to do important things.  Until recently, unfortunately, I used two jabber accounts for the same purposes (even the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpriorities cannot help here). <br><br><h3>  But everything changed </h3><br>  To start using it is necessary to register.  How?  Remember about "newgen user account"?  And if so, then for registration and ‚Äúentry‚Äù you <em>just</em> need <em>to add the following contact to the list / roster</em> .

      <strong>AIM: IMified</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>MSN: imified@imified.com</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Google Talk: imified@imified.com (my choice and tell you why below)</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Jabber: imified@imified.com</strong> <br><br><h3>  User Account </h3><br>  So, the service itself assumes that you have one of the protocols for exchanging quick messages and provides the listed bots for manipulating the service.  Accordingly, after logging in (adding you to the list by the side), which takes a couple of seconds, you get the opportunity to use the service and your im-contact is the ‚Äúkey‚Äù to registration and then the most interesting begins. <br><br>  The dialogue looks like this: <br><img src="http://www.pudovkin.com/wp-content/uploads/imified_1.png"><br>  Using 1-4 teams we choose the right one.  Actually, everything is clear. <br><br>  To enter your account click 4: <br><img src="http://www.pudovkin.com/wp-content/uploads/imified_2.png"><br>  Actually this is your login password.  You do not need to remember anything, you do not need mail and user data (they are taken from the profile of your IM account), you only need a contact. <br><br>  My Account offers delicious buns for more comfortable use of the service.  All actions in My Account instantly take power in the IM-bot. <br><br>  <strong>Widgets</strong> : routines that allow you to interactively communicate with other services on the Internet.  From popular: Delicious - post bookmarks to your account, Live Journal, WordPress, Blogger, Twitter + Jaiku (today there was news that Google bought Jaiku, and this widget allows you to post on Twitter and in Yayka), Tumblr - post on a blog, Google Calendar - and so it is clear, Braingle - watch teasers, NetLookup - tools Ping, traceroute, alexa, whois, enum.  The list is quite large. <br><br>  Agree, it is convenient.  Already seen above IMified Notes, IMified Reminders, <br>  IMified Todos are also widgets and can be customized (although not obychyrno - you can change the name :) <br><br>  WordPress widget is just handsome: supports Russian, asks for titles, body and publish what is written.  However, he does not ask about the category and, it seems, does not post the html-format. <br><br>  IMified has its own API for developing its widgets: <a href="https://www.imified.com/developers/index.cfm%3Fsec%3Ddocs">https://www.imified.com/developers/index.cfm?sec=docs</a> <br><br>  This can be seen on the original Twitter.  As I understand it, you can post there from a jabber bot too. <br><br>  <strong>Shortcuts</strong> <br>  Shortcuts to actions for added widgets (services) are set. <br>  are introduced to the bot in the form / shortcut. <br><br>  <strong>Account Settings</strong> <br>  All you need is taken from the user-info of your IM-account.  You need to set the GMT-time for the correct operation of the notifications. <br><br><h3>  To do list + bonus reminder </h3><br>  There is no need to explain specifically Notes and Todo - and so everything is clear. <br>  We return to the reminders, the benefits of using Gtalk-account and the rejection of "double" accounts. <br><br>  Reminder can be set as follows: <br><img src="http://www.pudovkin.com/wp-content/uploads/imified_3.png"><br>  As you can see, there are enough opportunities. <br><br>  As you know, a definite plus of Google Talk is that it stores history on the server, combines both XMPP (that is, jabber) and email records, which allows, unlike, say, an account on <a href="http://www.jabber.ru/">www.jabber.ru</a> to receive both IM messages and mail to one name.  Sent mail to account@jabber.ru will come back, because  Nobody lives at that address. <br><br>  So, if we use a Gtalk account and the event will work when we are online, the bot will carefully remind you about the scheduled case (in my case, the links in the reminder text will be parsed and provided in an html-clickable format).  If we are suddenly not on the network (on the way home from work and vice versa), we will again receive a notification, but to the mail if it is opened before the IM client (curtsy to Steve Jobs with sending mail to himself ).  And it is damn convenient!  There is no longer a need to have two accounts (I have 6 pieces in total somewhere) for this type of notification.  As they say, no matter what others have, it‚Äôs important that you have a Jabber.  And with the prevalence of mobile clients for this protocol, you can stay forever online and be able to both create and remind of events. <br><br>  You can think further and force the letter to redirect to the operator sms-number and get a reminder on the phone.  However, this can be done in the phone itself, which leads slightly to the displaced poles of values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom using the service for the sake of the service.  Although the phone is not always at hand and it does not have 107 keys, it is again convenient to have all the reminders in one place. <br><br><h3>  Security and privacy </h3><br>  Secrecy is achieved by encrypting data via AES 128 bit encryption.  Read more <a href="http://imified.com/privacy.cfm">http://imified.com/privacy.cfm</a> .  If you use the Gtalk-mode of communication with the bot, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it - the forced SSL connection will do its job of protecting when accessing valuable widgets or data. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion? </h3><br>  New technology web I called this post, because  This is the first service where I met a similar method of authorization, usability and extensibility.  I‚Äôll be eager to keep track of the growing list of widgets (for bugmenot.com, it would be interesting to get the widget, and indeed widgets for sites that provide textual information) and expect similar ways of combining http: // and xmpp: // since these technology, as tried to show the future.  And the reminders in such a manifestation, although it is indulgence for the creators (everything was obviously designed for a far greater purpose), provide convenience for the user and talk about a systematic approach to the design of the service, which is encouraging. <br><br><h3>  Excuse </h3><br>  I apologize for the particular talkativeness and smearing - I wanted to cover everything and paint it in an accessible and detailed way, because, I am sure, we will all benefit from it. <br>  I checked the work only on gtalk-bot, because  in others not interested.  I hope, commenting will look at other clients (in particular, asiku) and appreciate. <br>  I publish to the blog IM, because it is primarily associated with IM ... and maybe better in usability.  Can you tell me where it is more logical to attach a note. <br><br><h3>  Lyrical abstract retreat </h3><br>  We can talk about reminder systems for a long time, but they do not take into account the main factor - human activity.  We are free to set <strong>the</strong> trigger'a response time, and only.  Think, in all existing programs and systems we can only deliver when, according to time, a window pops up and a signal (sound, vibration, email, sms) attracts attention.  If we deviate from the planned schedule (calendar), all the notifications go at random and require rework. <br><br>  But there is a very interesting, in my opinion, the right approach to tracking activity and it was proposed in the S60 (Nokia Symbian) devices - a program (trying to remember a name, something like ... GSM ... cell ... ?) included triggering an event by remoteness to the base station, switching to a specific broadcast.  It didn‚Äôt work correctly (the population of the base station affects our Chekaginsk), but the approach is important. <br><br>  We can notify a person by his <strong>geographical location</strong> (the method is not important - GSM, GPS, WiFi for mobile devices) or for a special device any frequency, radiation level, traffic jams, temperature, activity of the UFO entries publishing its own.  This gives a new level of freedom. <br><br>  For me personally, the geographical factor would be important (I‚Äôm terribly bezlaberny and sometimes forget to check the list of necessary cases in the PDA), since  I could plan and put things in advance knowing where I would be, where I was going from or where I was arriving, to plan notifications on my way.  There is no GPS device and it was not, but I dare to assume that there is such a function there (I would be very surprised if you didn‚Äôt think of it).  However, a more popular method would still be using popular gadgets, where everything is already there.  As they say, I‚Äôm burning the idea to create services with software (multi-platform) tied to them, which choose the tracking method and revolutionize the planning and notification of the user about events. <br><br>  Crosspost in <a href="http://pudovkin.com/2007/10/imified-im-i-newgen-user-account-novaya-tehnologya-web-i-spisok-delnapominalka-bonusom/">your blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14991/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14991/</a></p>
