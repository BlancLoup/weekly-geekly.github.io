    <h4>  Do not sell anything! </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you think about it, this is a working approach: you are not just selling a solution - you are selling your expertise packaged in a product. <br><br>  And the expert works not only with the client's material, he has his own experience, that is, he can offer the client something customized. <br><br>  Or consciously push the client out of the comfort zone.  For example, to offer a new niche: because not all industries will lead and feel as before. <br><br>  And finally, the expert can offer an alternative: even ‚Äúgo to a competitor, he has this and that‚Äù.  It also shows the price tag against the background of the rest of the market, and if necessary demonstrates that it is not afraid of losing a client (while leaving the comfort of buying). <br><br>  Because, at maximum, the client will return to you, but at least you will not suffer with it in the future.  Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors for the client is also a plus.  And this will help you to think less about those competitors - now it‚Äôs not up to them. <br><br>  That is, you really do not sell anything.  Nothing out of the ordinary. <br><br>  <b>But while your main slogan at this time: "We will increase your sales."</b>  Provided that you are really ready to give the result. <br><br><h4>  Why is that? </h4><br>  In unstable times, the market collapses.  That is, literally, if you look straight ahead, you are not likely to see anything with high probability.  Because the middle segment, as always, is washed out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03c/ecc/d6d/03ceccd6d6aa444c9e9462a910cf6fd1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The greatest chances are those whose services are knocked out: either by quality or by price.  If you feel in the middle segment, it's time to ‚Äúdrift‚Äù. <br><br>  At the same time, those who buy are not where the better, but where there is a higher discount (not the price - you understand the difference).  There may be up to 50%. <br><br><h4>  What does not work </h4><br>  Approaches like <i>"let's try, but we'll see, eh?"</i> Or <i>"tomorrow is more expensive</i> . <i>"</i>  Such ones are put on the back burner - and you need to put up with it. <br><br>  Approaches <i>‚Äúyou wanted a fresh idea - here you are‚Äù</i> .  Because you need all the same ready (and already customized at the level of the proposal) solution. <br><br>  Equally in the past were the themes ‚Äúto get a budget from good old customers‚Äù. <br><br>  Even <i>‚Äúlet's reduce costs‚Äù</i> is not the best option.  If not only at times and not on the profile actions. <br><br>  And the result - and expertise, which you vouch for it, and are your value proposition.  And often the client‚Äôs question is precisely this.  In value. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, to start communicating with the client now need immediately with the benefits.</b> <br>  You can even compare the lack of a solution with the availability of a solution with a client - this is an interesting approach. <br><br><h4>  Step one.  Crush the communication </h4><br>  If you try to explain to a person the device of the whole Universe at once, he will probably go astray.  Or, rather, turn away.  The forms of satiation of information, its volume and reactions to ‚Äúoverdose‚Äù and incorrect presentation (the same call to action for further action) are still poorly understood. <br><br>  But it is clear: <b>service - solution - project = / = is not a transaction yet.</b> <br><br>  That is why it is much easier to split the communication for the next target step, rather than for sale immediately. <br><br>  Here are at least two verification criteria: <br><br>  1) What goals are we pursuing right now? <br>  2) What should the ‚Äúother side‚Äù do in return? <br><br>  If this is the first letter, then: <br><br><ul><li>  Pay attention to the structure - consider all the important details that will affect the decision to continue communication. </li><li>  Clearly describe the problem, clearly describe the solution, suggest a reasonable next step (this is not always a meeting at once). </li><li>  Carefully segment recipients! </li></ul><br><br>  Here is a typical example, we ourselves have sinned like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT_mqPB7CoM&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhihtca71Zmw8ovli7rZuTHAnxrzBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And here is a good example that we made up with an expert: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ei0AOqXJbnU&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKelUWxNRiTsvujQVMqRFz6xPwMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Step two.  Presentation in 5 seconds </h4><br>  It is important that in the words ‚Äúsend me your commercial‚Äù everything does not stop. <br><br>  It is clear that the market is such that someone needs all the completeness of information, and someone needs less.  Therefore - customize the approach. <br><br>  And the rest - remember that a person maintains a slide for 5 seconds of reading, so you can split up the heavy information here - because the slides are shareware-free for you. <br><br>  <b>In this step, it is also important to check the sales logic again</b> .  As you know, you need to sell "not a broom, but a clean floor." <br><br>  Below we have collected video examples of errors of a couple of projects.  Disclaimer: often the presentation includes information that is relevant for several groups at once;  as a result, it is not interesting to read to anyone. <br><br><ul><li>  how to lose and not lose conversion </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo1w-KA0uGA&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhisFAS3iqfrXZmWS8Dfy4pwi8bukg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><ul><li>  how to sell a complete solution, not pieces: </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVxJOyy9zzM&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhimahMf_5CtChUwfQ_Z26ma9KN2og" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  Mail, as the first filter, was the most effective.  It immediately shows whether the person understands what he came with.  Or not. <br><br>  If you have passed it, you can make an appointment (but, again, keep in mind a clear plan and specific goals, know how to convey them to the other side). <br><br>  We hope this topic will help increase your sales. <br><br>  And if the above is not enough, welcome <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/sales/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dtceh_blog%26utm_campaign%3Dsales_challenge">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  In this post we have not considered: <br><br><ul><li>  real scripts from companies with no problems with leads, </li><li>  the practice of working with the sales funnel and aspects relevant for b2c projects that need partnership with businesses, </li><li>  how to work with a client who is not ready to buy, </li><li>  how to choose the lid generation system that suits your case, </li><li>  and which approaches are more efficient to use instead of cold calls. </li></ul><br><br>  These are the topics that #tceh will cover already after the next <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/sales/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dtceh_blog%26utm_campaign%3Dsales_challenge">master class by Leonid Valya</a> , an expert who helped us too. <br><br>  <b>We are ready to invite 1 person for free.</b>  <b>How to get to this place?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  state in the comments what your expertise is, plus tell us what bottleneck keeps you from growing sales. </li><li>  Wait 19 hours on March 3.
