  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to lose baggage traveling by plane</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I had not very big experience of flights.  Unfortunately, my relatives and friends, too, so I didn‚Äôt know a few things that could save a lot of time and nerves.  The one who flies for a long time already, most likely, knows all this, but for those who only need to prepare in advance. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  <b>1. If you are flying with a transfer and handing in your luggage, try to buy tickets with at least a couple of hours.</b> </h4><br>  This is especially true of Italian and Spanish airlines.  If the docking will be less than an hour, the probability that your baggage will not be transferred from one plane to another increases many times.  For example, I flew twice with Alitalia with docking 40 minutes and both times the luggage remained at the airport. <br>  Even the very fact of docking is already a risk of being left without luggage.  Most losses happen this way.  And if it seems to you that this is basically a rarity and maybe it will blow it, then it is not.  In the year, airlines lose several tens of millions of pieces of luggage and hundreds of thousands never return to their owners. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. If you still have not received your baggage, most likely you will receive it in 24 hours with the same flight.</b> </h4><br>  Arriving without luggage, you must go to a special counter and fill out a statement about the loss.  Be sure to include all valuables that were in the baggage, otherwise in case of loss compensation will not be available.  Usually, after that the aunt behind the counter simply gives a piece of paper with the phones and sends home without any information, offering to call and find out the fate of the baggage.  In fact, it is probably useless to call.  The chance that he will come next flight to zero.  At best, you will receive it on the same flight the next day.  If you do not receive it, then it‚Äôs bad.

    <h4>  <b>3. Pack bags in cellophane.</b> </h4><br>  Theft from baggage is also not uncommon.  Some people specifically go to work as porters at the airport to steal things.  Anything can take, not only valuables.  At me, for example, at various times they stole a lens, a set for a manicure (not mine :), even a jar of canned meat!  That is, dragging everything that can come in handy in everyday life.  Keep in mind that there are those who will steal your things not for sale, but for use. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Require compensation.</b> </h4><br>  According to the rules for filing a complaint with the airline, it is necessary to submit a copy of the application to the police along with the documents.  But in reality, if the value of the stolen is not very large, then you can simply send an email with a list of the stolen and an approximate price.  They will not give you money for sure, but they can give you a voucher for 50-100 euros to buy a ticket.  Voucher valid for a year.  A statement to the police also does not guarantee a refund, as the airline has limited liability for the loss of baggage.  But your chances with the statement still increase. <br><br>  In general, these problems can be avoided by buying a bigger backpack or a small suitcase on wheels (45x55x25 cm), which can be carried as hand luggage.  The only thing before the flight is better to read the rules on the airline's website about the allowable weight of hand luggage.  It may be 20 kg, and maybe 5 kg. <br><br>  All information is collected from personal experience and search on the Internet during the nervous waiting for the arrival of things.  If you have more accurate information, please share. <br><br>  Have a good flight ) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Great solution - baggage insurance - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/77790/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/77790/#comment_2268648</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77790/</a></p>
