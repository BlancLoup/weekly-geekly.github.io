  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio as forerunner of Internet piracy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddb/7f6/29b/ddb7f629beba4ac69494a535443cf24d.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Secretive science is the story.  At school, everyone was forced to cram into the dates of the start of the Second World War or the year of the baptism of Rus.  But somehow modestly silent about the fact that everything read in the erased textbooks with bad pictures is an obligatory projection of everything that we ourselves have to go through.  In the end, it is not so important when the second world war began, it would be more important to be able to see the same prewar notes in relations, for example, between Ukraine and Russia.  But now I do not want to talk about politics.  My blog, nevertheless, is about copyright.  Which, by the way, is no exception to historical processes. <br><br>  The main problem of copyright today is Internet piracy.  The most respected experts and bison of show business frown and condemningly shake their heads.  No one knows what to do with online piracy.  Online passport - as an option from the East.  Criminal liability for a couple of downloaded tracks - from the West.  Lobbyists of draconian anti-Internet laws are shaken up from high tribunes, saying that copyright has not yet encountered such a problem.  Figures of losses from piracy line up in long lines, passing over trillions, go into cosmic quantities.  I even met a comparison of piracy with the plague for the market.  But the bending and quiet voice of the story is barely audible, if only to pay attention to it, whispers: ‚ÄúFIG you!  All this has already passed! ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The 30s of the twentieth century.  Great Depression in the USA.  Global economic crisis.  The purchasing power of the population tends to zero.  A huge number of people faced with the real threat of hunger.  Not bypassed the crisis and the music industry.  Nobody buys records.  In fact, their sales have stopped.  New records are not available.  They are even pointedly plaited in the square.  But the commercial effect of this does not appear.  No money left. <br>  However, even in the face of hunger, people find time to think about music.  Music distracts from black thoughts and allows you to survive depression.  And then the radio comes to people's homes.  Free music now sounds in every home.  It was a short and incredible breakthrough in the music industry.  And what did it mean for record companies?  That's right - losses, piracy, disaster, plague.

License terms for radio began to provide for payment of royalties.  The way of monetization has changed - instead of trying to collect money from the end customer, a convenient point for collecting remuneration fees was found.  The introduction of this method was also not easy, because he broke the harmonious logic of the old business.  The same questions: ‚ÄúWhy do I have to pay as much as the guy who listens to the radio all day?‚Äù Were exactly as relevant then as now with respect to the content subscription model. <br><br>  Let's see what this story led to. <br>  Is there at least one right holder struggling against radio?  - Of those who keep their mind, I do not know these. <br>  Did the radio destroy the music industry?  - Looking at the success of Justin Bieber and Stas Mikhailov, I find it difficult to answer.  But at least not the radio is to blame. <br><br>  At the time of the Great Depression, the threat of hunger contributed to the increased sensitivity of the right holders to the market.  Then the lobbyists in the Senate could not change the indisputable fact that people are not physically able to pay for the old format of musical goods.  Now while the safety margin of society is clearly not exhausted.  However, the old woman-story just chuckles, carefully writing down everything in textbooks with bad pictures.  We'll see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234281/</a></p>
