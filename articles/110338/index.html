The first is the creation of multifunctional service delivery centers (MFC), which many people already know about in a number of large cities.  The second way is the introduction of an interdepartmental electronic document circulation uniting the bases of regional authorities.

      First, about the MFC - they are already not only in the millionaire cities.  One of the most advanced regions in this respect is the city of Shelekhov of the Irkutsk region. <br><br>  Since 2008, the project ‚ÄúDevelopment of a regional state institution‚Äú Multifunctional center of state and municipal services ‚Äù, including an increase in the number of public services provided on the basis of a multifunctional center, has been operating in this region.  Within its framework, the MFC was created.  Its main task is to implement the principle of ‚Äúone window‚Äù - the creation of a single place for receiving, registering and issuing the necessary documents to citizens and legal entities in the provision of all state and municipal services. <br><br>  In December 2007, the opening of the first center in the city of Shelekhov took place (operators' workplaces are organized on the basis of the electronic document management system ‚ÄúBUSINESS‚Äù). <br><br>  Now the MFC uses electronic technologies for transmitting documents and receiving answers and documents from the OIU and the local government bodies (executive authorities and local self-government, respectively).  The organization of fast and convenient registration of documents is carried out by means of the unrolled system of various reference books. <br><br>  One of the features of the system is to ensure electronic document management in <a href="http://www.eos.ru/eos_products/eos_delo/">the "BUSINESS" system</a> using electronic digital signature (EDS) to protect information.  Now, within the framework of the project, work is underway to organize interdepartmental electronic exchange using EDS and encryption with federal and municipal authorities - in particular, electronic administrative regulations for the provision of public services are being implemented on the basis of the MFC. <br><br>  In the future, on the territory of Irkutsk is supposed to deploy a second MFC.  Its creation will ensure the availability of services for residents of the city and the Irkutsk region. <br><br>  <b>Guryevsk of the Kaliningrad region.</b>  As part of a project funded by the European Union ‚ÄúDevelopment of the Administrative Capacity of the Kaliningrad Region‚Äù, in 2009 in Guryevsk, the MFC developed and implemented a system for monitoring the execution of applications for the provision of services via the Internet and an electronic queue - these services are deployed on the basis of the EDS ‚ÄúBUSINESS‚Äù.  The total number of services provided in the MFC Guryevsk is 57. <br><br>  Now information on the progress of the service or a reasoned deviation from the provision of the service can be provided to customers by sending them requests to the MFC via SMS.  While the messages for the MFC clients are paid, the MFC assumes a partial payment for the messages. <br><br>  <b>The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)</b> is one of the foremost regions of the Russian Federation in the field of implementing MEDO.  Here the first phase of the project started back in 2003-2006.  Then, the CED "DELO" was introduced in 15 ministries and 4 state committees of the Sakha Republic - during this period about 860 workstations were automated, and in addition, 19 workstations of the "Archive Case" system and 48 - of the "FRAME ".  The second stage, which came in 2010, is the direct introduction of the technology of interdepartmental exchange of electronic documents (using EDS) among the first line of republican ministries. <br><br>  <b>The Moscow region</b> is implementing a project to create e-government.  It involves the Ministry of Transport of the Moscow Region, the Office of the Government of the Moscow Region, the Ministry of Economics of the Moscow Region, the Moscow Regional Duma, more than 20 central government bodies of the Moscow Region, the Administration of the Domodedovo, Naro-Fominsk, Balashikha, Noginsk districts, the Administration of the Barvikhinsky rural district of the Odintsovo district, Administration of Dubna, Korolev and Dolgoprudny.  The project is implemented on the basis of EOS solutions. <br><br>  The project started in 2007.  Then in the ministries, committees, departments and administrations of the districts of the Moscow region, about 600 workplaces of the ‚ÄúBUSINESS‚Äù system were introduced.  Thus, the office automation systems of 18 state authorities of the Moscow Region were transferred to a single technological platform. <br><br>  The forms and methods of working with citizens' appeals are now optimized, the exchange of electronic documents with the Government and the Legislative Assembly of the Moscow Region, also using the SED "BUSINESS", is supported.  Information integration with other systems, in particular, with the Internet portal of the district Administration, is provided. <br><br>  At present, the system of automated office management and electronic document management "BUSINESS" is used in virtually all structural divisions of the Office of the Government of the Moscow Region.  In the future, it is planned to expand the use of the system in the state authorities of the Moscow region, as well as the introduction of a single technological platform for office automation and document management in local governments. <br><br>  <b>"Electronic Khakassia".</b>  The transition to paperless workflow has already been made in this region.  Within the framework of the ‚ÄúElectronic Khakassia‚Äù project, a corporate network of the Government of the Republic of Khakassia was created and, as a result, all local information systems of ministries and departments of the Republic were united into a single information space. <br><br>  In addition, a number of portals were launched, including the official portal of state authorities of the Republic of Khakassia ( <a href="http://www.rhlider.ru/">www.rhlider.ru</a> ), which brings together more than 30 websites of ministries, various committees, etc., the government procurement portal of the Republic of Khakassia ( <a href="http://www.pgz.rhlider.ru/">www. pgz.rhlider.ru</a> ), where information on orders for state and municipal needs is published. <br><br>  Creating a system of interdepartmental electronic workflow and document management on the basis of the CED "BUSINESS" is also one of the project components.  Currently, all the ministries are merged into one database with the Government office, and practically all key officials work in the ‚ÄúBUSINESS‚Äù system.  In October 2009, the transition to completely paperless work with draft documents was announced: the end-to-end electronic sight technology was launched and the draft documents were coordinated within the Government.  Thus, this region became the first place where the transition to paperless workflow was realized. <br><br>  <b>Electronic government of the Republic of Bashkortostan.</b>  The first in Russia full-fledged system of legally significant interdepartmental document circulation at the level of the subject of the Federation has been created here.  This system (also created on the basis of the CED ‚ÄúBUSINESS‚Äù) allowed creating a unified information space for different levels - from specialists of departments of executive authorities to managers. <br><br>  MEDO provides automatic document reception in state and local authorities of the Republic of Bashkortostan, received through any of the electronic channels (fax, e-mail), its initial registration in any department and subsequent centralized control of its movement with the possibility of generating reports on the execution of documents. <br><br>  <b>Electronic government of the Rostov region.</b>  The project is being implemented from 2006 to the present.  By 2010, the system "BUSINESS" became the basis for creating a unified information space and interdepartmental electronic document management of the Rostov region.  It is used in the regional administration, 32 executive authorities, 55 municipalities, state and legislative authorities of the Rostov region and has 578 client sites. <br>  As for the results, since the beginning of 2007, the region managed to halve the time required for documents to pass through all departments, reduce the material costs of ensuring the delivery of documentation to recipients, and increase the speed of execution of resolutions and instructions in all departments of the Rostov region. <br><br>  <i>What it says.</i>  Regions are in principle interested in creating an MEDO and many of them are already implementing similar projects within the region.  The regions have some technical and even psychological readiness to work in a single system - so the creation of an MEDO at the federal level and no longer within the framework of pilot projects is likely not far off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110338/</a></p>
