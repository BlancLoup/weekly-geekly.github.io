      <i>Source: <a href="http://www.intermedia.ru/news/286653">intermedia.ru</a></i> <br><br>  The problem of piracy concerns not only media companies whose content is used by pirates, but also advertisers, according to the cluster.  "Placing advertisements on pirate sites is incompatible with the ethics of conducting responsible business," the statement said.  In addition, the placement of such advertising has a negative effect on the reputation of payment systems, since the income of pirates is ‚Äúassociated with illegal activities,‚Äù the letter's authors believe. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2006, the payment systems Visa and MasterCard appealed to the banks included in its payment system with a request not to process payments for purchases in the online store <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllOfMP3">allofmp3</a> .  The site Allofmp3.com has long been the second most popular in Europe after iTunes.  The tracks cost only $ 0.1, and the albums cost $ 1.  In 2006, recording studios launched a campaign against the owners of this site.  Moreover, they achieved that Russia's accession to the WTO depended, inter alia, on its closure.  In 2007, the site was closed, although a Russian court acquitted its former owner. <br><br>  Placing video ads on third-party sites is permissible only on sites with completely legal content, such as <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/">Kinopoisk</a> , <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">Afisha</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%40Mail.Ru">Mail.ru</a> , the statement said.  And online cinemas should not place their players on pirated websites and ‚Äúshare advertising revenues with the owners of such pirated websites.‚Äù  The authors of the statement believe that advertisers may be misled about the status of the sites that host its advertising messages. <br><br>  In October, the Deputy Minister of Communications, Alexei Volin, accused large Western companies of advertising on sites with pirated video.  After that, the advertising group <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VivaKi_Russia">VivaKi</a> prohibited legal video services from displaying Internet advertising for their clients in the so-called partner networks, employees of several media companies told Vedomosti earlier.  Other advertising groups have reduced such placements, but have not abandoned them completely.  Because of this, the video advertising market this year will grow noticeably less. <br><br>  To identify sites with illegal content, the RAEC / Media cluster used a number of special criteria, Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/23/622259-svernut">writes</a> . The main feature of the pirate site was ‚Äúplacing copyright objects or information necessary to receive them, without appropriate licensing agreements or other permits from the copyright holder‚Äù . <br><br>  The additional signs of the pirate site also include the lack of contact between the site owners, the contact form for rights holders and the system of digital fingerprints for content filtering.  In addition, a site where copyrighted content is distributed through torrents by itself can be considered pirated, since ‚Äúa torrent is not, in principle, an established form of legal distribution of digital content‚Äù. <br><br>  The copyright holders attributed the torrent trackers <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuTracker.org">Rutracker.org</a> and <a href="http://nnm-club.me/">NNM-club.me</a> , music projects <a href="http://zaycev.net/">zaycev.net</a> and <a href="http://vk-sound.ru/">vk-sound.ru</a> , as well as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA">lib.rus.ec</a> , <a href="https://www.lostfilm.tv/">lostfilm.tv</a> , <a href="http://seasonvar.ru/">seasonvar.ru</a> and other sites to <a href="http://seasonvar.ru/">pirate</a> sites.  In the near future, the cluster promised to publish a list of 100 sites that qualified as pirated. <br><br>  In late April, "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/14648/">wrote</a> that the resource management with pirated video content <a href="http://kinokrad.net/">Kinokrad.net</a> and <a href="http://bobfilm.net/">Bobfilm.net</a> offered cooperation to the right holders.  The offer was sent to <a href="http://webkontrol.ru/">WebKontrol</a> .  She is tracking illegal copies of films on the Internet.  WebKontrol works with such film companies as <a href="http://bazelevs.ru/">Bazelevs</a> , <a href="http://fepcom.net/filmy-onlajn/nashe-kino/">Our Cinema</a> , <a href="http://www.art-pictures.ru/">Art Pictures</a> , as well as with Hollywood copyright holders. <br><br>  Owners of pirated sites reported that they are ready to cooperate with WebKontrol under any conditions.  They promised, if necessary, to remove from the resources of any films.  Moreover, they agreed to install a video player with licensed content. <br><br>  Since May 1 of this year, a new edition of the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/13730/">anti-piracy</a> law has entered into force.  Right holders were able to block the pirate site forever, if they twice prove in court the fact of violation of rights.  Now the law applies to other types of content: music, books, software, and so on. <br><br>  <b>update:</b> In conclusion, Megamind provides expert <a href="http://rublacklist.net/14003/">comments</a> on the RAEC / Media statement about pirated websites. <br><br><h4>  Vartan Khachaturov (Minkomsvyaz): </h4><br><blockquote>  Guys Alexey Birdin, Sergey Plugotarenko, is everything okay there?  Not earned in the pre-New Year turmoil of everyday life?  What is the ‚Äúestablished form of legal distribution‚Äù?  Who installed?  What is the "form of legal distribution"?  Is TCP / IP a fixed form of legal distribution?  And TCP / IP over frame relay?  Can frame relay ban? <br><br>  The bittorrent protocol itself is neither indirect, nor key, nor any other sign of content that is distributed through it.  Moreover, with its help a lot of completely legal music, software, books and other things are distributed.  Nonprofit - maybe in the majority, but you have there the word "commercial" is not in principle.  Only the "legal form of distribution" - and this is just a lie. </blockquote><br><h4>  Olga Makarova (MTS): </h4><br><blockquote>  The document is extremely raw with a huge amount of inconsistencies.  The first point in which you write: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe use of copyright and / or related rights by sites on the Internet without obtaining the appropriate permission (license) from the copyright holder - the so-called  "Internet piracy."  The question immediately arises, what about Creative Commons? <br><br>  Further in the same paragraph: <br><br>  "Extraction of profits by pirate sites by accompanying advertising or charging for providing access to content is totally unacceptable .." <br><br>  What kind of profit are we talking about: before tax, after tax?  And if the pirate site does not extract profits, that is, it works at zero (income = expense).  He is no longer pirated, can you work with him? </blockquote><br><h4>  Stanislav Belov: </h4><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLegal commercial content through torrents is not distributed‚Äù - Oh, not!  But when I was pumping out a freshly bought ‚ÄúThe Witcher‚Äù, or was there a Starcraft, what was it?  Not commercial enough, not legal enough, or software too low concentration?  Windows here is still somehow downloaded by itself with an update to the same ‚Äútop ten‚Äù.  Actually, the content of quotes is a flaw (dullness) of publishers.  Who prevents them from distributing their legal commercial content through convenient transporters? </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297518/</a></p>
