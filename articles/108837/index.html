(thinking out loud)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/67754c22/7e0814df/08500ad4/fb7e0f8a.jpg" align="left">  In many databases and directories of startups there is such a thing: ‚Äúa project at the idea stage‚Äù.  I always wondered why such projects were added by their authors to the start-up directories, and what happens to these projects-ideas after they are added to the catalog? <br><br>  The authors believe that this idea has already been worked out to the point where it can be started to be taken and done? <br><br>  Many people forget that a project is not just an idea, but also a bunch of other boring things: a business model, promotion methods, principles of distribution channels, incentives to attract partners, a project of income and expenses, an exit strategy and much, much more.  In most cases, the idea represents only the first stroke to the project - a reason for its detailed discussion and thinking through.

      The authors hope that the investor, seeing their idea in the catalog, wants to buy it or give money for its development? <br><br>  In order to ‚Äúsell‚Äù an idea, they first of all need to ‚Äúsell‚Äù themselves, which is impossible without a personal and, best of all, a long conversation with a potential investor.  A personal conversation is needed because the investor in this case is invested, rather, not into the idea, but into a specific person whom he needs to first see and with whom to speak.  A long conversation is necessary, because the art of elevator pitch in 30 seconds (and even 2 minutes) is not the strength of most of the startup authors I met. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One more note about those investors that the authors of ‚Äúprojects at the idea level‚Äù can find - to invest in an idea, except for friends, family and fools, can only be experts: <br><ul><li>  those who professionally understand the market - those who can select from the stream of consciousness a really working idea </li><li>  those who are professionally versed in people are those who can distinguish a real expert from a graphomaniac and a talker. </li></ul>  Or, these experts can find and convince people with money that they should invest in this particular idea, using their connections and putting their personal reputations at stake. <br><br>  In other words, simply adding your ‚Äúproject at the idea stage‚Äù to the startup directory most often cannot by definition lead to any results: <br><ul><li>  the idea at this stage is too cheese to be called a real project, and fundamentally needs to be discussed and worked out with the participation of people who understand this. </li><li>  the author needs a personal meeting with potential investors, and in a format that will give them the opportunity to personally and long ‚Äúsell‚Äù their idea </li><li>  The best investor or dear to an investor for a ‚Äúproject at the idea stage‚Äù is an expert. </li></ul>  To put it more specifically: if you are the author of a ‚Äúproject at the idea stage‚Äù and you really want to realize this idea, then you will have to break away from your favorite chair or sofa and come to where you can actually do it. <br><br>  One of the closest places suitable for this: the <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/">third Moscow Startup Weekend</a> , which takes place on December 3-5.  Here you can personally meet and talk with experts who can help you work out your idea in person and in a long conversation.  In addition, you may have a real chance in the future with the help of experts and Glavstart to attract the first money to develop a good and thought out idea during the Weekend. <br><br>  I will wait, <br>  Arkady Moreynis </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108837/</a></p>
