      <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  ZeptoLab - Chief Product Officer (product director) <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Enthusiastically <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  I think about work one way or another almost all 24. <br>  And so - it depends on the particular day.  Usually during the day, my workflow beats up into three stages. <br>  In the morning - the most important mail and study of the main tasks for the day, in the afternoon (usually between 11 and 20) - cases and meetings in the office, in the evening and at night - quiet time to work on things that require maximum concentration, and to communicate with partners from other time zones. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 5s, iPad Mini, Nexus 7 - you have to wear a few <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  MacBook Air 13 '' <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  Dropbox, Evernote, Google Drive - for a long time I have not stored data on the local computer / device.  Very convenient when access to files is everywhere, regardless of whether with a laptop. <br>  Slack is definitely the best messenger, which by its appearance greatly improved this world. <br>  Pocket, Mindjet MindManager and Wunderlist make life even easier. <br>  Well, without our games (first of all, King of Thieves) I can't live either. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  Removing the Facebook application from all mobile devices and setting the mute mode in non-working instant messengers helps to distract you less (or rather only get distracted at the right time) and save a lot of time. <br>  The ‚Äúfive minutes of silence‚Äù also helps - when you postpone all tasks for a couple of minutes and try to relax your brain.  After that, usually productivity grows noticeably. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Wunderlist for personal purposes + Things for workers. <br>  Well, the good old paper notebook has not been canceled. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  I usually try to listen to colleagues. <br>  But seriously, I usually find it difficult to concentrate to the music, so if I listen, then most often something is light and without words (lounge, minimal house etc).  8tracks is great for opening a new one. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  Nasim Taleb "Anti-frailness" - a great book, allowing much differently to look at ordinary things. <br>  I am still reading the second volume in the ‚ÄúMoscow, which is not‚Äù series about the history of old Moscow houses and streets.  Some of them are well known, but many, alas, have not survived.  It was always interesting to dive into the history of the beloved city. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  In recent years, probably, this is Dan Ariely ‚ÄúPredictably Irrational‚Äù - an excellent book about the basics of behavioral economics and the factors influencing our decision-making in various situations.  This knowledge greatly helps in the development and subsequent promotion of products.  I highly recommend it to anyone who for some reason has not read it yet. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  In Moscow, I read only paper books, it is much more pleasant. <br>  On trips, for obvious reasons - ipad. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  On average, 6-7 hours. <br>  Once slept on 9, and it seemed completely unreal to live differently.  It turns out that it is possible to get used to and feel at the same time great. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  Owl.  In the evening and at night, my productivity is much higher than in the morning.  Then I do all the main things. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  If at home, then double coffee and light snacks.  In general, coffee inevitably accompanies me daily and throughout the day. <br>  Usually, in the first half of the day I try to set up meetings outside the office, so I manage to combine the pleasant (breakfast) with the useful (communication). <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  Behind the wheel - either I listen to podcasts with industry news and interviews, or I give the brain a rest and listen to new music that has accumulated lately. <br>  Sometimes - just going in silence, thinking through various tasks. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  This is not really advice, but rather a motivating formula.  She was told to me in due time by one of the guys from my team, and since then she has not gone out of my head: <br>  1.01 ^ 365 = 37.8 <br>  0.99 ^ 365 = 0.03 <br>  That is, improving one of your skills by at least 1% every day, after 70 days, you can double this skill (1.01 ^ 70 = 2).  Similarly, by degrading by 1% per day, in just over two months you will be twice as bad (0.99 ^ 70 = 0.5). <br>  With this in mind, you force yourself to learn something new and do something cool every day. <br><br>  The second advice that helps me a lot in life is to do all the unpleasant things quickly, without putting them off the shelf.  Greatly makes life easier and eliminates unnecessary reflection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290558/</a></p>
