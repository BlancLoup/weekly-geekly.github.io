  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nintendo 3DS revolution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/654/6c9/97e/6546c997e2103fd9f3951c9d4201d622.jpg" alt="Nintendo 3DS revolution"></div><br>  As it usually happens at important events, large companies practice pompous rhetoric, and words such as ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù, ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù, ‚Äúsensation‚Äù gradually grow dull and boring.  Nintendo chose not to abuse the big words, letting its small device speak for itself ... and, as often happens, the ‚Äúdog‚Äù that barked least of all turned out to be the most biting one - the new 3DS is a real little killer of competitors.  And now you see for yourself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Most importantly, as everyone who was lucky enough to hold a new portable console in their hands, could make sure that the stereo effect works.  This is a real 3D without funny glasses.  The number of polygons Nintendo 3DS is not inferior to the Wii, which, together with the stereo image creates a stunning effect. <br><br>  For the convenience of users, the developers have provided a volume adjustment knob - if the picture starts to bore you, you can reduce or even completely turn off the stereo effects.  And with any settings, the image remains clear and bright.

      Another nice detail is the analog joystick, which in all respects surpasses the similar element of the PSP.  It is more and more pleasant to the touch, and as a result - much more convenient. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://games.qip.ru/upload/image/newsimages/June/160610nintendo3ds.jpg" alt="Nintendo 3DS revolution"></div><br>  Otherwise, 3DS is definitely a product of the Nintendo DS line - the same size and shape, and about the same weight ... In general, if you take the new console in your hand, you will not notice the difference.  In addition, the old console, most likely, will fit the old covers from the DS.  Naturally, this is not bad, but wonderful. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, the 3DS console is traditionally equipped with two displays: the top one with a diagonal of 3.53 inches and a resolution of 800x240 pixels (400x240 for each eye), and the bottom one, with a touchscreen, with a diagonal of 3.02 inches and a resolution of 320x240.  It is through the top screen that one can view stereo images with the naked eyes (there are still two eyes). <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <i>The principle of operation of 3DS ‚Äúvolumetric‚Äù screens is based on the use of the <a href="http://www.racurs.ru/%3Fpage%3D416">parallax barrier</a> effect ‚Äî two slightly different images for the left and right eyes are formed on the screen.</i>  <i>If the user is located directly in front of the display, the image seems to him volumetric.</i>  <i>And although you can see a 3D image only from a distance of about 30 centimeters, this is more than enough for a portable device.</i> <br><br>  Do I have to say that this function is the main feature of the console?  The device can even play movies in 3D! <br><br>  Nintendo 3DS is equipped with three cameras - one on the inside of the clamshell and two on the outside.  Two external cameras allow you to make stereo photographs, which is a good bonus for a gaming device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://games.qip.ru/upload/image/newsimages/June/160610nintendo3ds_1.jpg" alt="Nintendo 3DS revolution"></div><br>  Naturally, both the gyroscope, the accelerometer, and the microphone, and the stereo sound remained, but the graphic characteristics of the device were significantly improved, although the technical details have not yet been disclosed. <br><br>  Nowhere is the Wi-Fi controller, which allows both to access the Internet and connect to other 3DS.  Moreover, the novelty will find the next set-top boxes itself, simplifying the life of casual users. <br><br>  The new console is compatible with the old games for the DS model, and of course it will receive games specially developed for it, using its power and a stereo screen - the incredible possibilities of the Nintendo 3DS have already attracted the attention of a huge number of developers: dozens of publishers are developing about a hundred games for 3DS.  Real 3D blockbusters from such iconic game series as Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Resident Evil, FIFA, Street Fighter, Pro Evolution Soccer, The Sims, Sonic, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden, Saints Row ... <br><br>  And Nintendo itself is preparing dozens of new games, including three-dimensional Animal Crossing, Kid Icarus, Mario Kart, Paper Mario, PilotWings Resort, Star Fox, as well as Nintendogs, where, to the joy of children, puppies and kittens will react not only to the voice, but and on the "master" movement. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://games.qip.ru/upload/image/newsimages/June/160610nintendo3ds_2.jpg" alt="Nintendo 3DS revolution"></div><br>  Unfortunately, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, who introduced the device, has not yet announced the release date and estimated retail price.  I would like to hope that this information will be made public in the near future, and we will immediately inform you about it. <br><br>  By the way, you will be surprised, but this is not the first attempt by Nintendo to bring a portable stereo set to the market.  Back in 1994, the Virtual Boy gaming system was introduced, the sad fate of which you can read in a separate <a href="http://games.qip.ru/news/articles/628/">article</a> . <br><br>  But it seems that this time everything was done correctly and Nintendo again performed a coup.  Already, it is safe to say that 3DS will lead the sales charts, it will have to be ordered in a few months, and not everyone will be able to buy it for Christmas. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/83VnVLxgAfY&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8C7Z7ApBydlzDG4DAYK5_5ZcK3Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96614/</a></p>
