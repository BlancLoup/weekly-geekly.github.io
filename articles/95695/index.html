When the number of comments to the article exceeded the second hundred, we decided not to stop at what was written and move on. <br><br>  In this article we‚Äôll take a deeper look at the benefits of the service and tell you how we managed to make the service, through which it is more convenient to buy and not much more expensive than through eBay itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, let's talk about registration.  If you decide to buy something, the first thing you need to register on the service.

      EBay.com registration fields are quite tiring.  First, without a basic knowledge of English, this is not far away.  (However, without knowledge of English on eBay there is nothing to do at all).  Yes, we also have eBay.ru - but about it is either good or nothing (read - nothing). <br><br>  In addition to registering directly, you will have to suffer from registering with Paypal, registering a card, linking a card and Paypal, linking PayPal and Ebay, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f20/565/1bc/f205651bc288139243f0fb12635effba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This, of course, is not difficult.  The whole procedure is described in detail in hundreds of manuals and instructions.  However, step-by-step instructions will not save you from many hours of fussing with registration and a long wait for banking operations with a card and Paypal. <br><br>  Registration on EbayToday is simple and straightforward.  You do not need to frantically google what a CSV card code is; it is enough to know your name, surname and email address.  Registering to EbayToday takes three minutes at most, and immediately after registering you can make purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cee/5fc/e83/cee5fce837170bea8adbc0e0f159107c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  1. The buying process </h3><br><br>  Let's consider the purchase process on the site one by one. <br><br>  For example, we want to buy an iPod Touch.  Of course, we want to buy a quality, working iPod (and not restored after falling to Niagara Falls), and we want to buy it cheaper. <br><br>  Directly from the main page of the site the search form looks friendly at you.  Sin is not to take advantage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61d/c76/a70/61dc76a7085aa4e54d1e33c16ebdbc85.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We have a smart search that supports all search keys.  If you have ever used Google or Yandex advanced search, you can easily figure it out and configure everything flexibly.  All the key variables of a normal human search work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/051/2de/0c2/0512de0c262d636f48cf866f5a3287fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Search results can be sorted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/063/e30/302063e3037c59a14091fe15760f96c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We click on the ipod we are interested in and read all the details.  English text can not be afraid - we have an automatic translator.  Of course, ‚Äúyour-my‚Äù will be present in it, but everything can be completely understood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb5/62d/6aa/bb562d6aad2d78a23da374a03c4473a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, you need to soberly understand that eBay is an auction in which fraudsters, maniacs and other scoundrels flourish in color, craving you to impersonate his exact crumb model instead of an ipod.  However, a few simple rules will help you greatly increase your chances of a successful deal. <br><br>  First of all, pay attention to the rating of the seller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46e/8ae/51c/46e8ae51cc665e88096e9b77398e9558.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Try to buy from sellers with a rating not lower than 99% - even if they are more expensive, but definitely no deception. <br>  Generally speaking, rating is a very complicated thing, you can write a separate book about it.  We will tell about the rating in one of our following materials. <br><br>  Then pay attention to the price.  A new iPod can not cost twenty dollars.  This price should cause a smile, but not a strong desire to urgently buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f8/8e8/b44/6f88e8b44b1fff97870c049a98a4ee86.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, we chose an iPod.  Now we need to make a bet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/d7d/266/132d7d26659542a7717e938e0570b0cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As we can see, 18 bets have already been made on this ipod, so there is practically no chance to get by with a little blood - buyers will fight to the last. <br><br>  Therefore it is necessary to estimate in mind the amount that we are ready to pay for this iPod.  For example, we have free 200 dollars.  Enter 200 in the field and click ‚ÄúMake a bet‚Äù.  An iPod will be placed in our purchases.  Now his fate is in the hands of EbayToday - you just have to watch the developments. <br><br>  However, the struggle for the iPod will not start until you put the required amount on your personal account.  This can be done with the help of a huge number of methods, <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/payment">here</a> is a complete list of them. <br><br>  EbayToday carefully spends your funds - we try to win the auction by the minimum bid.  In case we were able to save, the balance will be returned to your personal account. <br><br>  But we have another technology that helps to get the desired purchase.  This Poole is a weapon of mass destruction for Ibei‚Äôs vendors. <br><br>  The pool works very simply, like this: <br><br>  1. Through the search we select several products of the same type.  In this case, we choose five to seven iPods that differ in price.  Our goal is to buy at least one of them, and preferably cheaper. <br><br>  2. We pool products, like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c66/a48/361/c66a483610b30a58c79583cbc6d452a7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Contribute to the account the amount sufficient to purchase the most expensive of the selected lots. <br><br>  4. The system wins one of the lots. <br><br>  In short, the pool will work as a sniper with several rifles - it will automatically start playing the game on all lots at the same time, based on its mechanical stinginess.  As soon as Poole wins the bidding for any one commodity, he will automatically stop bidding for the others - so we will not have a chance to stay with five ipods and empty pockets. <br><br>  Poole has limitations.  So, for example, like any sniper, he doesn‚Äôt work well on targets located at arm's length - the pool doesn‚Äôt work on deals that are about to end.  Also, the difference in the time of the end of trading in lots of the pool must be at least four minutes - otherwise the pool will not work.  But in any case, it is much more convenient to buy with Poole. <br><br><h3>  2. Negotiations </h3><br><br>  No negotiation!  With EbayToday you get rid of the most painful part of the purchase (after registering on the service, of course) - from negotiations with the seller. <br><br>  First, despite the fact that the seller is set to sell his product, it will be quite difficult for him to understand the Russian if the Russian uses a translator and his meager stock of school knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ad/381/e2a/3ad381e2a56a2bfe3e408901ab5e0196.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There were cases when the American seller was afraid of the epic refusal and refused to sell.  Moreover, sometimes you will have to find out difficult questions, for example, the configuration of your computer or the state of the guitar - you can't do without good English. <br><br>  Another case - an American sells its goods only in the United States (well, or in the United States and its suburbs - Canada).  He might be glad to sell his iPod to Russia, but he is not aware of its existence yet.  What to do? <br><br>  With EbayToday you are deprived of a similar problem, we have a warehouse in the USA with an American address, naturally.  So the seller will have no reason to deny you a bargain. <br><br><h3>  3. Ibei - so that ‚Äúand‚Äù does not change to ‚Äúe‚Äù </h3><br><br>  Deceivers, scoundrels and other perverts on the Internet was always full.  A lot of them on eBay.  Some of the villains deliberately deceive customers, and, by the way, a little English-speaking audience is a tasty morsel for them.  In fact, you don‚Äôt even need to deceive anyone, it‚Äôs enough to honestly say that everything works amazingly in an iPod, the foreigner may simply not understand the phrases, and he will not be able to make any claims in which case. <br><br>  We have already written that it is worth paying attention to the rating and reviews.  This, so to speak, is the first line of defense from deception. <br><br>  However, rating and feedback is not an indicator of the integrity of the seller.  The seller can honestly sell a hundred times over the old coin, thus obtaining an excellent rating, and then warm up someone in a big way. <br><br>  In order to protect ourselves from such troubles, we have a service for checking goods in our warehouse.  For ten dollars, our staff will verify that the product meets its description.  For example, if it was written in the description of the ipod that it is new and fully working, we will include and check its performance.  If our employees find that the seller is trying to deceive you, the goods will be sent back with a refund through PayPal. <br><br>  However, one should not expect a full examination of the quality of the goods.  We can check only the performance of electrical goods and electronics and the conformity of the goods to the declared name.  We in the warehouse do not have the ability to inflate tires, launch models of helicopters, conduct research on the authenticity of clothes purchased.  So the main work to prevent fraud still lies on the shoulders of the buyer - you need to check the seller‚Äôs rating and carefully read the description.  However, checking the goods in stock can significantly help out in many doubtful situations. <br><br>  When you buy, for example, a monitor, penny expenditure on its verification costs nerve cells, which, as you know, are not restored. <br><br>  That's the whole buying process.  We will be happy to answer your questions in the comments. <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95695/</a></p>
