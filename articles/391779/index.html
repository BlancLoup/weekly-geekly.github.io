Samsung Electronics announced that they are now ready to manufacture a solid-state drive (SSD) with the largest amount of memory to date - 15.36 TB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43f/9b5/0c6/43f9b50c640f4c389b685626711aade6.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2.5-inch SSD with Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) at 12 Gb / s is designed for use in premium data storage systems.  The PM1633a delivers amazing performance, with random read and write speeds of 200,000 and 32,000 I / O operations per second (IOPS).  According to the specialists of the company, this allows achieving data transfer rates of up to 12,000 Mbit / s.  The company also claims that the classic SSD with SATA interface can reach a maximum of approximately 5.5 - 6 Gb / s. <br><br>  Since the PM1633a is made in a 2.5-inch form factor, it fits comfortably in standard server platforms and more.  In addition, the SSD sets a new bar for the stability of all subsequent drives - said Samsung.  The 15.36TB PM1633a disk supports one complete re-recording per day.  This means that every day you can write / rewrite 15.36 TB of data on one drive without failures.

Samsung also claims it is betting on a new line of PM1633a, as the undisputed favorite among the hard drives for premium storage systems.  But the problem lies in the fact that Samsung has not yet announced even the approximate price of a new super-high-end line of SSD drives.  As we all know, at the cost of SSD they could not bypass the classic HDDs. <br><br>  As Jung-bae Lee, senior vice president of application development for Samsung Electronic, said in a statement, he said: <br><blockquote>  In order to meet the growing market demand for ultra-high performance SAS SSDs from leading premium storage system manufacturers, we focus all our efforts on meeting the needs of our customers in SSDs. </blockquote><br>  The performance of the PM1633a SSD is based on four factors: 3D NAND (vertical NAND or V-NAND) memory chips;  16 GB DRAM;  Samsung's proprietary controller chip;  12 Gbps SAS interface.  The random read / write speed is 1000 times faster than the random read / write speed of SAS-based hard drives.  Also, the speed of sequential reading and writing is more than twice the speed of a typical SSD with SATA interface, as the company says. <br><br>  Combining Samsung's 512 microchip memory with 256 Gb V-NAND allows an SSD with an unprecedented 15.36 TB of storage capacity in one drive.  The V-NAND or 3D NAND architecture allows NAND cells to be stacked on top of one another, like a microscopic skyscraper.  Not only is it twice as dense as standard NAND chips from 128 GB to 256 GB, this architecture also increases performance. <br><br>  Samsung initially announced a 48-layer V-NAND last August, saying that this is a 3-bit-per-second sports event in a multi-level cell (MLC) NAND. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b32/bc6/44a/b32bc644abaa452e9d88c02f723db5b4.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung 256 Gbps, 3D NAND microchips.  Samsung began mass production of the industry's first 256 GB 3D vertical NAND (V-NAND) flash microchips based on 48 layers of 3-bit multi-level-cells (MLC) last year. <br><br>  On the V-NAND chip, each cell uses the same 3D Charge Trap Flash (CTF) structure, in which the cell matrices are folded vertically to form a 48-level array.  This array is connected through 1.8 billion channel holes vertically.  The holes themselves are formed using special etching technology.  In total, each chip contains more than 85.3 billion cells.  Each of them can store 3 bits of data.  As a result, you get 256 billion bits of data, in other words - 256 GB of space on the chip. <br><br>  Of the 256 GB microchips, blocks of 512 GB are formed, which are stacked in layers to provide the necessary volume of more than 15 terabytes.  In total, the PM1633a SSD contains about 32 blocks per 512 GB.  It is expected that with the use of the third-generation 256-GB Samsung V-NAND technology, the performance of the PM1633a will increase and become more reliable than its predecessor PM1633.  The former model uses the second generation 128 GB Samsung V-NAND on 32 layers. <br><br>  In 2014, Samsung became the first company to introduce a 3D NAND flash chip with 3-bit MLC architecture.  In October 2014, the company announced mass production of a 32-layer V-NAND chip.  Last August, company representatives made new announcements about the launch of mass production of 48-layer V-NAND chips. <br><br>  While Samsung may take the lead in creating a 15 TB SSD, there are other leading companies in the development of chips for 48-layers 3D NAND.  Last year, SanDisk and Toshiba announced that they are also preparing to produce 256GB 3-bit microchips per cell (X3) 48 layers of 3D NAND, whose throughput will be twice as high as their earlier models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/533/2e2/11b/5332e211baf242ccbb058643d2b713c2.jpg"><br><br>  Intel and Micron also announced 3D NAND.  Both companies boast that their technology will allow them to create SSDs with a memory capacity of 3.5 TB to 10 TB, while maintaining a 2.5-inch form factor. <br><br>  Along with the model 15.36 TB in the near future, Samsung will offer a PM1633a SSD with 7.68 TB, 3.84 TB, 1.92 TB, 960 GB and 480 GB.  Since SSD-drives are aimed at enterprises and will be sold to resellers, who determine the retail price, Samsung does not name its own prices for these drives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391779/</a></p>
