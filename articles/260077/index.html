Interesting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main developer conference for Apple platforms continues in San Francisco: iOS, Mac OS X and the new watchOS 2. The week is in full swing, the sessions are mostly technical.  It is already more or less clear what we will have to deal with in the coming months, adapting and improving our applications for the release of new systems, so I hasten to share the news with you. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/260077/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/f86/ac0/490f86ac01204a96bc1a00b2ae0cb016.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Analytics in iTunesConnect</b> </h4><br>  ITunes analytics has several advantages over all others.  It is free, works automatically without any settings, provides unique data that no one else can access (for example, views in the AppStore). <br>  So, iTunesConnect Analytics came out of beta and acquired new features.  All the data that is collected in the eppl clouds can be divided into three categories: <br><ul><li>  data from the AppStore - the number of views, sources of transitions to the application page (work out of the box, without additional settings and special links!), the activity of marketing companies </li><li>  sales data - number of purchases, number of downloads, in-app purchase, retention rate </li><li>  use of the application - transitions on the screens, crashes, errors, and more. </li></ul><br>  The latter category is collected only if the user agrees, which is not so tasty, of course. <br>  All this is implemented in a quite nice interface and is available now. <br><br><h4>  <b>Multitasking to iPad</b> </h4><br>  In the new iOS 9 in the iPad will appear split-screen.  Full work in two applications will be available only on the iPad Air 2, but the overlay of one on top of the other and the picture-in-picture video mode can be seen in weaker models (mini, mini 2 and Air).

      Today we talked a lot about how applications work in such conditions and not suffer from brakes, lack of memory and other desktop problems.  You need to optimize the load on the CPU, GPU and work with memory.  And if in the first two cases everything will just work slowly, then in the latter version the system can kill your application, if you impose another, heavy, application on top of it (yes, such an injustice). <br><br>  For skillful work with data, it is recommended to always keep in ‚Äúactive‚Äù memory only what the application really needs (for example, pictures that are displayed on the screen).  Everything else should be placed in the NSCache or immediately cleared when Memory Warning is received. <br>  To check whether you did everything correctly, it is recommended to launch your application, and on top of it a system safari.  If not crashed, then carry and then. <br><br><h4>  <b>Design and Design for Apple Watch</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5c/107/371/b5c10737121d47ef95a8c62803837c09.JPG" width="400" align="right">  Apple design evangelists call three design principles for Apple Watch: <br>  <i>1. Personal communication</i> <br>  The device is personal as you can imagine.  Therefore, under pain of execution, it is not recommended to disturb the user with frequent notifications and lengthy formulations. <br>  Recommend to guess about user preferences and rebuild the interface.  For example, the Sports system application remembers the user's choice and tastes and offers likely options for playing sports before others. <br><br>  <i>2. Holistic Design</i> <br>  This is beauty and neatness.  The clock merges iron and software in a single ecstasy, and therefore you need to use a black background and edge-to-edge alignment in your applications.  It is so difficult to distinguish where the screen ended and the hull began. <br>  You also need to use the Digital Crown, to which we have full access to watchOS 2.  And do not forget about Haptic Feedback - these are sounds and Taptic Engine.  The richer the application to the reaction, the easier it is to use it on the go. <br><br>  <i>3. Lightweight interaction</i> <br>  This item is perfectly sucked back in the Android Wear Guidelines.  The idea is that the application on the clock is used on average for 5 seconds.  During this time, you need to have time to transfer all the important information, and Glances and Complications come to our aid.  Well, if there is something important, then you need to use Handoff to redirect the user to the relevant place of the main application. <br><br><h4>  <b>Designing for Future Hardware</b> </h4><br>  If you remember, last year at WWDC there was a carbon-monic session about design thinking, quick prototyping of mobile applications in Keynote, and the process of creating a toast search service in San Francisco. <br><br>  This year, the same guys are telling how to make a smart toaster.  With the manufacture of the prototype, the same Keynote'om and other original approaches.  In apple, they are engaged in inventing and manufacturing products (Watch, iPhone, iPad and others), so the session is very useful and has a real relationship to reality.  I advise you to look, words can not convey. <br><br>  Do not forget how it all began: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259951/">WWDC15.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259951/">The first day.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259951/">Keynote</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">WWDC15.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">Second day.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">Details</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260077/</a></p>
