      What came of it - look at the screenshots <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/062/85e/15b/06285e15b778f76a47d9e5ce09391789.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/838/521/26a83852129c31489dffd325216309be.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c54/905/d8d/c54905d8d58c2389171c63f7e27c3d80.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, a week after the publication I received a number of reviews about the project, people wrote how to improve, what to finish - in general, everyone was positive, but most of the proposals were of a visual nature - somewhere to fix, add, and so on.  There were even such cases when the user offered assistance in translating into another language, and there were also those who wrote that the icon discriminated it :) <br><br>  At the very beginning, the plugin went as a user-script extension and required a number of efforts to install Opera and FireFox in browsers, which confused users.  Yes, and from a technical point of view, not the best option. <br><br>  In this first thing was the task of remaking under browser extensions.  This was done and now you can install in 1 click in browsers such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ejempdmgbnckcgndlojjbnmgkolgdbeh">Chrome</a> , <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/addons/extensions/details/capybarcom/2.0/%3Fdisplay%3Den">Opera</a> and <a href="">Firefox</a> . <br><blockquote>  I would like to say thanks to Opera moderators, who were able to quickly check the application and advise how to improve, at the same time, FireFox moderators took more than 1 month for moderation, which rejected it.  Repeating and waiting for another month is very difficult. </blockquote><br>  After creating extensions, it was time to change the design, because the old windows98-style did not attract anyone at all.  It is said - done, but surprisingly, the designers painted the design for about a month, which adversely affects the enthusiasm, but nevertheless the work went on. <br><br><blockquote>  While the designers drew me the opportunity to talk with <b>Arkady Moreynis</b> on Skype as part of the qualifying round for their startup startup, apparently my poor description of the project led us to talk about the same thing, but in different languages, it happens when you get overwhelmed, however less I want to say thanks to him for good advice and recommendations!  But still, the search for help continues, there are ideas that you want to develop, and there are not enough hands. </blockquote><br><br>  Today, the CapyBar project allows <b>webmasters to</b> install the code on their website and enjoy all the benefits of the project.  That is, the <u>webmaster can observe the activity on the site, provide support and communicate with clients</u> .  Details on the <a href="http://capybar.com/webmasters/">webmasters</a> page. <br>  I would also like to note that work in the direction of webmasters continues and new tools will appear as the project develops. <br><br>  In the meantime, the main task is to add as much functionality as possible to the project and tell everyone about it as loudly as possible!  After all, according to statistics, 50% of registered - continue to use the plugin, which is good news. <br><br>  You can look at the work on the <a href="http://capybar.com/client/">demonstration</a> page, but it is not yet possible to write without authorization. <br><br>  Summarizing the above, I would like to thank everyone who left feedback and helped with advice, the work on the project continues, and if you want to advise or offer something, write to <i>pr@capybar.com</i> <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br>  to be continued ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130839/</a></p>
