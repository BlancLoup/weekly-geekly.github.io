So the vast majority of reusable projects up to this point in one way or another relied on the concept of a design with wings or a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2581">bearing body</a> and a horizontal landing. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.griffshp.com/belchja/forums/ben%2520donahue%2520aiaa%2520jsr%2520air-launch%2520april%25202004.pdf">Comparison of the</a> benefits of the air start from the maximum speed of the spreader: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Separation rate </th><th>  0.75M </th><th>  2.5M </th><th>  3.1M </th><th>  6M </th></tr><tr><td>  Separation height </td><td>  9 km </td><td>  20 km </td><td>  22 km </td><td>  26 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Required delta-V </td><td>  8.51 km / s </td><td>  7.49 km / s </td><td>  6.47 km / s </td><td>  5.59 km / s </td></tr><tr><td>  Delta-V Percentage of Land </td><td>  92% </td><td>  82% </td><td>  78% </td><td>  67% </td></tr></tbody></table>  As can be seen from the table, a speed of 6M saves a full third of all expenses for going into a low reference orbit ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">LEO</a> ), which for a three-stage rocket means that when you start from such a hypersonic plane, you can actually throw out the first stage launch vehicle cost).  For speeds of the order of 2-2.5M, two passenger planes and an infinite number of military were built, and even for speeds slightly higher than 3M in the USSR and the USA at least one aircraft was made (about which below), the characteristics of which made it possible to carry a considerable load.  At the same time at such speeds we still have 20% savings from the required speed. <br><br>  It would seem that subsonic start allows you to save quite a few (up to 10%) - but in this case several problems appear at once: in order to get the maximum benefit at the start with a limit of ‚â§1M we need to climb as high as possible.  But due to the drop in air pressure at the height, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">stall speed</a> (minimum speed) of our aircraft begins to increase, while the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">speed of sound</a> (maximum speed), on the contrary, begins to fall.  The most indicative of this planet was the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2">Lockheed U-2</a> reconnaissance aircraft, which climbed to an altitude of 21 km.  With a cruising speed of 805 km / h, it had a safe speed window of just 19 km / h (after upgrading the aircraft, its safe window weight became even smaller), the exit from which threatened to stall into a corkscrew or even destruction of the aircraft.  This schedule of safe values ‚Äã‚Äãconverging with an increase in altitude at one point gave the pilots a very colorful name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_corner_(aerodynamics)">‚Äúend of the corner‚Äù</a> - partly because <a href="https://www.popmech.ru/weapon/9007-legkokrylaya-ledi-drakon-legendarnyy-samolet-shpion/">three</a> test pilots died during the tests of the aircraft because of this effect.  For a strategic intelligence officer, such a danger could be tolerated, but for an ordinary commercial ‚Äúspace driver‚Äù, this turns out to be an excessive risk. <br><br>  Thus, all modern projects of air launch are limited to the practical ceiling of transport aircraft, usually 10-12 km.  At this altitude, the LPRE vacuum nozzle still has significant losses in efficiency, which means a slower start and greater losses at the time of the launch of the rocket (when the loss share is already the most).  Thus, we need to either use engines <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">specially developed</a> for such large elevation changes or to make an engine with an "intermediate" nozzle.  This forces us to actually make a specialized launch vehicle for an air launch that will not be unified with ground samples, or use the currently existing components of ground launch missiles that are not optimal for an air missile and thus lose a significant part of its advantages. <br><br><h4>  Previous projects: </h4><br>  <b>Rocketplane X-15</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/f0/e6/59f0e667c6019854396887.jpeg"><br><br>  It was dropped from under the wing of one of the two <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress">B-52</a> bombers allocated for this purpose at an altitude of 13.7 km at a speed of about 800 km / h.

New wings for the rocket glider were blown through the wind tunnel from 1966 until the X-15-3 crash put an end to this idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/f0/f6/59f0f65defe61523914495.jpeg"><br><br>  The flight tests of the two built Valkyries proceeded normally until October 14, 1965, when the first sample, when tested at a speed of&gt; 3M, had a free-flowing air stream from the left wing 60 cm of its honeycomb structure.

At the beginning, they wanted to entrust this project to the Tupolev Design Bureau (the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2583-144">Tu-144</a> already engaged at that moment), but in the end he refused it.  The project adopted the Mikoyan Design Bureau, which conducted the flushing of aircraft models in a wind tunnel until the project was closed.  The accelerating aircraft accelerated with a help of a booster car to a speed of 400 km / h, after which it started its engines and took off from the ground.  To improve aerodynamics after takeoff, the nose of the aircraft was raised, thereby limiting the review to the bottom - this option was used on the Tu-144 and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4">the Concorde</a> , and for the Soviet bomber the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2-4_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582)">T-4</a> went even further and made the cockpit completely closed. <br><br>  Since the base fuel for the rocket stages (fluorine / hydrogen) and the fuel for the scramjet of the spreader aircraft (hydrogen) had not been used for this purpose before, it was decided at the initial stage to develop an intermediate version of the system with somewhat worse indicators.  However, even this intermediate version should have become in many respects the best that was created before, and the main version of the system is completely amazing: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Specifications </th><th>  Intermediate option </th><th>  Main option </th></tr><tr><td>  Spreader Fuel </td><td>  kerosene </td><td>  hydrogen </td></tr><tr><td>  Fuel boosters </td><td>  oxygen / hydrogen </td><td>  fluorine / hydrogen </td></tr><tr><td>  Spreader speed </td><td>  1200 m / s (4M) </td><td>  1600 m / s (6M) </td></tr><tr><td>  Compartment height </td><td>  22-24 km </td><td>  28-30 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Takeoff weight (total) </td><td>  130 tons </td><td>  115 tons </td></tr><tr><td>  Ship weight </td><td>  6.8 tons </td><td>  8.8-10.3 tons </td></tr><tr><td>  Payload mass </td><td>  - </td><td>  0.5-2 tons </td></tr></tbody></table>  Thus, this system could put a load of 10+ tons into orbit with a starting mass of just 115 tons - that is, the payload was about 10% of the starting mass!  This is simply an inconceivable indicator for modern chemical rockets, which put an average of 3.5% of its own mass into orbit (and only in the heaviest version of the fully hydrogen <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-4">Delta IV,</a> this figure reaches 3.9%).

Since the ship had a military orientation, it was assumed that the cockpit would be shot, to have its own engines and a parachute for the possibility of independent descent from orbit and landing on the ground.  Due to common problems with the project, this part of the ship was never implemented. <br><br>  The first aircraft analogue of the MiG-105.11 was dropped from a Tu-95KM in its 11 joint flight on October 27, 1977, after which the runway Groshevo landed.  The analog tests were carried out until September 13, 1978, when the pilot blinded the Sun due to an error of the flight leader during an approach at the wrong course, in the evening, resulting in a hard landing that damaged the chassis.  On October 24, the aircraft was sent on a suspension of the same Tu-95KM to the Tushinsky engineering plant for repair.  Although the analogue aircraft was later repaired, this flight on the TMZ remained the last for the MiG-105.11. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/5m/g7/qu5mg7es45lgj_wl4yh-sdv1hcy.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  After the official closure of the project, hope remained for using the orbital ship of aircraft from other projects to launch, most of all, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2-4_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582)">T-4</a> project of the Sukhoi Design Bureau, which has an interesting history, was most suitable for this role.  Since the USSR did not have the opportunity to create such a large number of carrier groups as the United States had, it was necessary to find some other way to fight them.  Conventional nuclear weapons were not suitable for these purposes, since in the time between receiving information about the position of the aircraft carrier and the missile‚Äôs upshot, it could go out of range.  Therefore, it was proposed for this purpose to create a small group of strategic bombers with nuclear missile weapons. <br><br>  The calculations showed that in order to break through the air defense of an aircraft carrier connection, they had to have a very high speed - about 3M.  Three design bureaus participated in the competition: the Tupolev Design Bureau with the Tu-135 project, the Yakovlev Design Bureau with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BA-35">Yak-35</a> project and the Sukhoi Design Bureau with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2-4_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582)">T-4</a> project.

The engine had two modes: in the first of them, to increase thrust, both chambers were supplied with a large proportion of kerosene (which provided 2.5 times more thrust), while the engine later switched to the second mode in which the kerosene supply was completely stopped (providing 10 % greater specific impulse): <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  RD-701 </th><th>  1st mode </th><th>  2nd mode </th></tr><tr><td>  Traction </td><td>  408 </td><td>  160 </td></tr><tr><td>  Specific impulse in vacuum, s </td><td>  415 </td><td>  460 </td></tr><tr><td>  Pressure in the combustion chamber, atm. </td><td>  298 </td><td>  148 </td></tr></tbody></table>  The project was widely known, but did not receive adequate funding.  Despite its unique engine, the project inherits all the technical flaws of the subsonic carrier, and also has its own - this is a three-component tank, in which it is necessary to provide thermal insulation for three fuel components (hydrogen, oxygen, kerosene) that must be stored at different temperatures (about 20K, 50K and 300K respectively).  Much more promising in this regard <i>(in my personal opinion, of course)</i> would be a complete rejection of the aircraft carrier in favor of a ground launch, using discharged tanks and maintaining a single-stage scheme - this would solve the problem of thermal insulation with standard drainage systems are dropped, and the tanks are powered by ground systems until the moment of launch). <br><br>  <b>There were several European projects:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/f1/42/59f1423f907ca767398925.jpeg"><br><br>  The <b>RT-8</b> project of the German company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers">Junkers</a> provided for the launch of a two-stage cruise missile from a 3-kilometer bogie with acceleration to 900 km / h, and an air launch was also considered.  Both stages assumed landing on the ground, the second stage assumed the withdrawal of just under 3 tons into orbit, and hydrogen / oxygen overflow from the 1st stage to the 2nd was also provided.  The project was completed with the closure of the company in 1969. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/f1/41/59f141ff8de40184016502.jpeg"><br><br>  The original project of the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSTARD">MUSTARD</a></b> British aircraft manufacturer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aircraft_Corporation">BAC</a> - which involved the launch of three identical vehicles with a total weight of about 424 tons.  After a set of 2 km / s and 56 km of altitude, the engines were turned off, and the two extreme vehicles pumped the remaining hydrogen / oxygen fuel into the middle machine, after which they separated and landed like an airplane.  The payload was supposed to reach 5 tons, the project did not go beyond the initial design development stage, but received considerable fame in the media. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/f1/40/59f1404944c39288791519.jpeg"><br><br>  The British project EAG.4396 provided for the launch of a ship and a rocket stage from an aircraft at a speed of 4M.  The rocket stage had kerosene / oxygen and two discharged tanks as fuel.  According to the project, different versions of the ship / missile as a carrier were worked out, but because of its military orientation, almost nothing is known about it. <br><br>  The project ‚ÄúLe transporteur aerospatial‚Äù of the French company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Aviation">Dassault Aviation</a> is a ramjet aircraft with a ramjet engine, the acceleration stage and the rocket plane in which hydrogen was to be used as fuel at all stages. <br><br><h4>  Modern projects </h4><br>  This is <b>the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C)">Pegasus XL</a> launch vehicle</b> - it is launched at an altitude of 12.4 km from the modified wide-body passenger aircraft Lockheed <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargazer_(%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE)">L-1011 TRAYSTAR</a> and is a super-light carrier rocket.
