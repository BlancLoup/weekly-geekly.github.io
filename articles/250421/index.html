SQALab conferences are well-suited for this.  So they are not about the market, but about education, of course.

      <b>- You call developers and testers very smart guys.</b>  <b>At the same time do not say it is good or not bad.</b>  <b>Do not you think that they need to be a little easier, because</b>  <b>many users are not always clear that for developers is "like a clear day"?</b> <br><br>  - The mind of developers is just a natural phenomenon.  Sometimes useful, often reminiscent of a natural disaster, but definitely not amenable to control or pacify.  The problem is not in the mind.  The problem is overconfidence, whose legs grow from a small and relatively prosperous life experience, a very homogeneous social environment and greenhouse working conditions.  As a result, many (not all) developers behave like elephants in a china shop.  It should be noted, elephants are very confident in their rationality.  This is in our irrational world (never a metaphor, the irrationality of a person is scientifically proven)!  In general, developers tend to pretend that they are not humans, but robots.  It would be funny if it did not interfere with work.  But pay attention that this is not a reason to simplify.  This is a reason to study the terrible and incomprehensible: people.  And the first step, many techies will have to admit that they do not understand people.  It will be painful and difficult, but they will cope, smart ones. <br><br>  <b>- Are there any experts who, after the developer has passed the project, make it easier for the mass user?</b>  <b>If not, do you think that the need for them has matured?</b>  <b>Still, it‚Äôs not worthwhile for such thin people as developers to ask to simplify it after the work done, surely many perceive it as a personal insult</b> <br><br>  - In general, it is not very clear what ‚Äúpassed the project‚Äù.  Released to the real world?  So in fact only here, from the point of view of this real world, the life of the project begins.  Of course, begin and rework.  Well, take them as the pressure of a cruel evolutionary rink, if you really want to suffer.  Evolution is ruthless, it‚Äôs pointless to argue with it, there will be alterations, your personal relationship with a specific button and architectural solution - few people care. <br>  Specialists who make a crooked zombie into a living organism are, for example, called product managers.  Behind them or near the crowd of people: designers, market analysts, UX-specialists, etc., etc. In general, despicable humanities, it is not clear what the busy. <br><br>  And about the simplicity.  This is actually hellishly difficult - it's easy to make  Pretty severe professional challenge.  Not everyone, however, feels this complexity, but it also trains. <br><br>  <b>- In the report, which was announced on <a href="http://analystdays.ru/">AnalystDays 4</a> , you claim that many teams "are accustomed to fulfill an order in the notorious two weeks."</b>  <b>Where does such a stereotype come from and is it really possible to fully develop an IT project in such a period?</b> <br><br>  - This is such a well-understood irony to the developers.  Ask almost anyone how long it takes to develop a new feature.  Typical answer: "Two weeks."  Well psychologically verified, by the way: in two weeks, either the need will disappear, or the customer will forget, or more important tasks will appear.  Hear the phrase "two weeks" from the developer - turn on the siren and red storm lantern: anxiety, anxiety, the wolf carried away. <br><br>  <b>- How do you think, can a developer argue with the customer if he asks to make changes to the order, which obviously destroy the project or destroy its attractiveness?</b>  <b>What risks does this approach entail for the developer?</b> <br><br>  - And maybe I should.  But we must be able to argue.  To hammer at one point, not trying to understand the arguments of the second side - this is not to argue.  The first step is to understand your opponent.  And if they understood, if they recognized that his idea has the right to exist, then comparing alternative realities, showing pros and cons and helping to make the right decision. <br><br>  <b>- Now business in Russia is experiencing, to put it mildly, not the best time.</b>  <b>Has this changed the way business interacts with users on the Internet?</b> <br><br>  - That's when it changes, then we realize that yes, it‚Äôs hard times for business in Russia.  For the time being, the former total rudeness, omissions, petty fraud and no respect for the client remain.  Exceptions are monstrously rare.  Let's see if they will become massive.  There is hope. <br><br>  <b>- Do you have any forecast for 2015?</b>  <b>What awaits the site building industry in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus?</b> <br><br>  - I do not think ahead.  While it is possible to work, it is necessary and interesting.  And we'll see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250421/</a></p>
