  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Igarity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>History of one city</b> <br>  Fans of the urban lifestyle can rejoice: Electronic Arts has officially announced (through the list of releases from the Soft Club distributor) the existence and imminent release of the SimCity Societies project from the SimCity economic series.  As noted by the publisher, in a new game, gamers will have a return to their origins - and this means that a strict economic system and realism of social processes taking place in the city will come to a bright schedule and numerous opportunities.  By the way, for the first time in the history of SimCity, it is not Maxis or EA Redwood Shores that is engaged in the development of a sequel.  The game is engaged in the studio Tilted Mill Entertainment, which revived last year another city-planning simulator - Caesar. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Court games</b> <br>  When talking about money, all the ways are good.  And the court - the minimum of the means of pressure.  For example, in recent times, mutual legal accusations by the holders of virtual game universes, users trying to make money in these games, and ordinary gamers have become more frequent.  So, lawyer Mark Bragg won the case against the owners of the game Second Life, who closed his account.  Dazzled by the rapid increase in the price of virtual real estate in this game, Bragg invested almost all his money in buying it.  The company owner considered such actions a direct violation of the user agreement and the account was covered.  Lost money forced Mark to act decisively, but within the limits of legality ... <br>  Another case of the trial is related to the game World of Warcraft.  The largest operator in the secondary online market, Internet Gaming Entertainment, was sued by World of Warcraft players, who sued the "farmers" from Peons4hire.  They accuse IGE and its farming department of violating the user agreement that caused other users to spoil the game‚Äôs pleasure because of the depreciation of the game currency, not to mention the banal unfair competition between ‚Äúhonest‚Äù subscribers and IGE customers. <br><br>  <b>All ages are submissive.</b> <br>  A growing number of older people are keen on video games, but at the same time more and more young gamers are starting to play them - this is the conclusion of the analytical agency NPD Group.  If the previous ‚Äúmeasurements‚Äù of the audience were given the figure of 8.1 year - as the beginning of the game ‚Äúcareer‚Äù, then in 2007 the beginning player was already an average of 6.7 years.  According to NPD representatives, ‚Äúchildren are not afraid of new technologies and calmly take possession of them, turning complex consumer electronics into everyday devices.‚Äù

      <b>New, but not worse than old ones!</b> <br>  Fallout 3 will be released in the fall of 2008.  It became known finally from the released video on the engine of the new game, from which fans learned a couple of interesting details.  As expected, Bethesda Softworks is trying to preserve the spirit of the original games: in the post-nuclear future there will be a place for the narrator Ron Perlman (Ron Perlman) with his unforgettable phrase about the invariable nature of war, and the enticing advertisement of Vault-Tec, promising a ‚Äúbright future - underground‚Äù ! ‚Äù, And the song‚Äú I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire ‚Äùfrom the group Ink Spots - and the song sounds not from somewhere, but from a tube radio.  Finally, the Brotherhood of Steel will move to the east coast with its canonical helmets.  In addition to the PC, the game will be released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platform, which was opened by the online representation of Game Informer magazine, in the July issue of which the first preview will appear. <br><br>  <b>Good moment</b> <br>  Death of spies will not end - so promise us in the publishing house "1C" and the studio Haggard Games from Rostov-on-Don.  Having understood the aspirations of the people, the developers began to create an add-on (its name is ‚ÄúThe Moment of Truth‚Äù). <br>  Seven new secret operations were once again entrusted to Semyon Strogov, operational officer of the 4th division of SMERSH.  The game will unfold in different countries.  New types of transport will be available, as well as an expanded set of special means for the silent destruction of the enemy.  In the ‚ÄúMoment of Truth‚Äù there will appear a long-desired opportunity to complete the same mission in various ways.  Graphics and animation will be updated and improved.  The release of the project "Death to Spies: The Moment of Truth" is scheduled for the end of this year. <br>  - <i>when creating news materials used sites</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.ag.ru/">www.ag.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.dtf.ru/">www.dtf.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9603/</a></p>
