The reasons for this decision can be extended for a long time, but I will not do that.  "Given: get rid of pirated programs" and a full stop.  And as an option, find <a href="http://www.charnad.com/">something to replace</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately, I note that there are things that I can not refuse.  First, it is Windows XP.  You can even spend all the ammunition of rotten tomatoes.  I'm used to it, and I will not prove why, it can also be painted on the whole post.  On Habr√©, I met statements that they say if you program in PHP, then Windows Sax, and Linux - tru.  Well, I'm still young and green, so I live in a world of pink fantasies. <br>  Also, I cannot refuse categorically from Total Commander.  For the n-th number of years, I got hooked on him like a drug. <br><br>  So, the purchase of this good requires ~ 5000 rubles.  Unpleasant, but not fatal.  Go ahead. <br><br>  <strong>Office:</strong> MS Office -&gt; Open Office.  Moved easily and naturally.  For half a year I haven't encountered any problems.  Of course, if you often need to share documents for printing, and all your colleagues are worth MS - then there may be problems, after all, both packages look at the formatting of the document in a slightly different way.  But if the design of the document is not essential for you and you also print at your place, then Open Office is no worse than the MS office.

      <strong>Mailer:</strong> The Bat!  -&gt; Thunderbird.  This transition was easy for me.  First of all, of course, it‚Äôs not so convenient, but literally in a week I found Bat as monstrous, and Thunderbird was simple and convenient. <br><br>  <strong>Antivirus:</strong> ESET NOD32 -&gt; Avast -&gt; Avira.  Reluctantly, I deleted my beloved NOD, who served me faithfully and set Avast, which my friends advertised to me.  Antivirus is generally not bad, but it behaves like a doggy ssyklivaya.  Often swore where there was no trace of viruses.  After another squeak, Avast was turned off until better times, and I set Avira.  He pleased me much more.  Frequent updates, nice interface, screaming less often, viruses are found, and, of course, free.  And I left Avast just in case, to double-check, if it is ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>CD / DVD Burner:</strong> Ahead Nero -&gt; Small CD Writer / Ashampoo Burning Studio.  Sighing, I sent to the basket and the familiar Nero.  The choice of software on this topic is really great, Deep Burner, CD-DVD Burner and others.  However, my choice fell on a tiny program, which, however, writes discs perfectly.  Small CD Writer.  My girlfriend, but he failed to correctly determine the speed of the recorder and wrote at very low speeds.  So I downloaded Ashampu with a free key during the promotion.  He seemed to me too catchy, but he writes just as well. <br><br>  <strong>Virtual drives:</strong> Alcohol 120% -&gt; Alcohol 52%.  Well, what is there to comment.  All the functions for which in 120% of alcohol had to pay are associated with a sharp discs, and this was another program for me.  So if you only need to mount disks, then putting 52% Alcohol you will not notice the difference. <br><br>  <strong>Archiver:</strong> WinRAR -&gt; 7Zip.  The fact is that my favorite total commander was able to pack and unpack many different formats, so in principle a separate archiver was not needed, but I decided to let it be. <br><br>  <strong>Sound processing:</strong> Sound Forge - Audacity.  I edit the sound most often, just copy-cut-peist pieces, more / less volume and other small things that the free Audacity does a great job with. <br><br>  <strong>Defragmenter:</strong> O &amp; O Defrag Professional -&gt; Auslogic Disc Defrag.  Of course, Defrag Professional will not be able to outdo, but Aulogic Disc Defrag is doing quite well with its task. <br><br>  <strong>File Recovery:</strong> Ontrack Easy Recovery -&gt; Recuva.  A little fast and free Rekuva in my opinion is not inferior to the big and slow Easy Recovery. <br><br>  <strong>System info:</strong> Lavalys Everest -&gt; SiSoft Sandra.  The basic version of Sandra is distributed free of charge, which you can only enjoy. <br><br>  <strong>Drawing:</strong> Photoshop -&gt; GIMP, Paint.net, Photofiltre.  Same story as with SoundForge.  I draw little, most often I cut or cut, so free programs and their effects are enough for me. <br><br>  <strong>Graphic viewer:</strong> ACDSee -&gt; Fast Stone Image Viewer.  I don‚Äôt know how new versions of ATSD are, but at first I was stubbornly using version 3. However, it is still paid.  Of course, FastStone is not as nimble as it could be, but it can cut, turn and a lot of useful stuff when it‚Äôs too lazy to load a graph.  editor. <br><br>  To be continued ... <br><br>  PS&gt; I don‚Äôt mention software that is free anyway: Opera, AIMP, Notepad ++, QIP <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28357/</a></p>
