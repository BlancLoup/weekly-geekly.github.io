Many have tried to write their music, were interested in this topic.  There was a desire to share their experiences.  The first article in the series will be on the most important topic - VSTi synthesizers. <br><br>  What is VSTi?  Why do we need VSTi?  Why not enough samples alone to create high-quality music?

      Firstly: this sample, which sounded as you want, still need to find.  And this is not so easy.  Naturally, there are production libraries with ready melodic loops, but in this case making music is like folding the Lego. <br><br>  Secondly: a sample cannot just as easily change the sound as a synthesizer sound. <br><br>  Thirdly: when playing with a sample using a midi keyboard, possible artifacts, such as aliasing, should be taken into account. <br><br>  Samples, of course, are used in a number of VSTi - samplers and compilers, where for example a piano or a guitar can be sampled.  What is not possible to create a high quality one synthesis.  But they take up a lot of space and do not have the ability to completely change the sound like the generated synths. <br><br>  How can you create your own sound? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Technology VST (Virtual Studio Technology) was created by the German company Steinberg in 1996.  At the moment, VST de facto is one of the most popular audio plug-in formats (windows platform).  The format is program-dependent, a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) program is required for the plug-in to work ‚Äî the host is an audio editor or a sequencer. <br><br>  VST plug-ins can be divided into VST effects and VSTi tools.  The first ones are designed for sound processing (equalizers, reverbs, compressors, etc.).  VSTi (the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù stands for instrument) are intended for receiving sound, which will be discussed in this article. <br>  For each synth I prepared an example of the sound <br><br>  To date, there are thousands of VSTi synthesizers that are created by both amateur singles and large companies.  For example, Native Instrument or Arturia. <br><br>  VSTi synthesizers use a variety of sound generation algorithms: subtractive (subtractive), additive (summing), FM - synthesis, physical modeling, and the most common hybrid synthesis - a combination of the previous three.  We should also mention synthesizers that do not actually create sound from scratch, but use pre-recorded sound libraries.  These are the so-called samplers and romplers.  Their sound libraries can occupy dozens of gigabytes of hard disk space. <br><br>  The VST instrument is controlled in real time using an external midi controller or automation track in the sequencer.  The user changing the parameters of the synth changes the parameters of the received sound, such as timbre, duration and others. <br><br>  There are VSTi emulators of real-life ‚Äúiron‚Äù synthesizers, for example, such legendary devices as Minimoog, Roland TB-303 or Yamaha CS-80.  The problem of creating virtual clones is the great difficulty of repeating exactly the analog circuit.  Naturally you can not talk about the full identity of their sound.  But still, developers sometimes manage to achieve great success in this industry.  One of the most famous companies producing such software copies is Arturia. <br><br>  The use of virtual synths in their work was announced by composer Hants Zimmer, rock musician Trent Reznor, trance DJ and producer Armin Van Buren and many other world-famous music figures.  In electronic music, there is a tendency for VSTi to supplant "iron" synthesizers. <br><br>  Naturally, there is a very large number of virtual plug-ins.  To cover at least a small part of them is extremely difficult.  The most famous foreign resource dedicated to VST and VSTi is <a href="http://www.kvraudio.com/">www.kvraudio.com</a> .  Also, they are devoted to some specialized publications, such as Computer Music Magazine, Digital Music Magazine, Future Music.  From the Russian-speaking segment, one can mention the works of Roman and Yuri the Petelins - <a href="http://petelin.ru/">petelin.ru</a> <br><br>  Below is a review of 5 interesting in my opinion VSTi synthesizers.  Audio plug-ins made by yours truly are attached to each plug-in.  In writing demo, only those synths that are used in reviews were used; no external processing was used. <br><br>  It is necessary to remind that it is impossible to start any VSTi synt without a host program.  To do this, use any music editor: a sequencer with VSTi support, for example Steinberg Cubase, Image Line FL Studio, Ableton Live, Cockos Reaper or others.  To download the plug-in, a separate track is selected on the multitrack and the folder with the installed synth is indicated.  You should install plugins in one folder in advance, usually by default - this is C: \ Program Files \ Vstplugins. <br><br>  <b>Sonic charge microtonic</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/418/961/cc6/418961cc6565699dcaa669eb66690670.png" alt="image"><br>  Created by former Propellerhead Software engineer Magnus Lidstrom (Magnus Lidstrom).  The interface of the plug-in falls under all criteria of what is called Scandinavian design - it is ascetic, but at the same time very beautiful. <br><br>  Microtonic is a quasi-analog drum machine, i.e., a synthesizer for writing drum parts.  All sounds are generated in real time, and are not samples.  Unlike most software drum machines.  Microtonic sound is quite specific, it has nothing to do with live drums, however, it is quite interesting.  He received great recognition from techno musicians because of his underlined synthetics.  According to the developer of the program, the roots of Microtonic goes into analog drum machines of the 70s. <br><br>  There is one oscillator with three waveforms, a noise generator, several effects (modulator, equalizer and distortion).  At the same time, 8 sounds are available, the rhythmic pattern of each from which the user ‚Äúfills‚Äù into a step sequencer in the plugin itself.  Sint has an extremely low processor load. <br><br>  Official site: <a href="http://soniccharge.com/microtonic">soniccharge.com/microtonic</a> <br>  However, even without this plugin, you can evaluate how it sounds.  To do this, just go to the online service Patternarium at <a href="http://soniccharge.com/patternarium">soniccharge.com/patternarium</a> .  Here is the flash animation, which using microtonic algorithms automatically creates a continuous rhythmic pattern. <br><br>  Also my example of sound: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/microtonic-demo">soundcloud.com/holygunner/microtonic-demo</a> <br><br>  <b>Native instrumentments massive</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81e/9d0/a5a/81e9d0a5af46b8a44899ab2630b3723a.png" alt="image"><br>  The flagship product of the company Native Instrument is deservedly one of the most popular synths in the world.  The range of its application is quite wide - these are basses, leading sounds, drawn pads, sequences and sound effects.  Due to this massive is applicable in a wide range of styles.  However, its highlight is the creation of bass. <br><br>  According to the developers, the secret of synth sound is a high-quality engine that allows you to create a very rich sound. <br><br>  Its interface at first glance seems complicated.  Nevertheless, it is intuitive.  It consists of 3 tabs, two of which are responsible for navigating the presets - ready synth tinctures.  The synth tab is designed for working with sound parameters. <br><br>  The basis of the synthesis is 3 oscillators containing a large number of analog and digital forms.  Also apply a wide range of various filters and effects.  But the main feature of Massive are its modulation and synchronization capabilities.  For example, any parameter can be synchronized with any other parameter.  This provides a very broad sound experience. <br><br>  A plugin can load a processor quite heavily.  In this case, you can reduce the parameters of oversampling - sound quality. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/producer/massive/">www.native-instruments.com/en/products/producer/massive</a> <br><br>  Sound example: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/ni-massive-demo">soundcloud.com/holygunner/ni-massive-demo</a> <br><br>  <b>QuikQuak Glass Viper</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6e/e46/9ff/b6ee469ff5aa6ca96cfb39d82aaec495.png" alt="image"><br>  Little known, but very interesting, in my opinion, synth.  A special feature of Glass Viper is the synthesis method itself - the user can draw an oscillator form itself, unlike most additive synths, where the oscillator shapes are unchangeable.  Also, each of the four oscillators can be processed separately by changing the parameters of the envelopes, filters, and pitch, which, like the oscillators, are available in graphical form. <br><br>  All these manipulations take place in one window, which is also an oscilloscope.  High-quality chorus, reverb and deli are available with effects.  The sound of the Glass Viper is very rich, it has a peculiar effect of movement. <br><br>  Official site: <a href="http://www.quikquak.com/Prod_GlassViper.html">www.quikquak.com/Prod_GlassViper.html</a> <br><br>  Sound example: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/glass-viper-demo">soundcloud.com/holygunner/glass-viper-demo</a> <br><br>  <b>Korg MS-20 {or Plysix}</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5f/aa3/d86/b5faa3d8671f14744d2dfd154054b117.png"><br>  Released by Korg, which is known for its musical equipment.  In particular, analog synthesizers. <br><br>  The plugin is a software emulator of the old analog synthesizer Korg MS-20, commercially available from 1978 to 1983. <br><br>  This synt is included in the Korg Legacy package, which also includes several other Korg iron emulators. <br><br>  The interface with the plug-in scheme repeats in detail the design of its ancestor.  True, unlike him, the plugin is polyphonic, while the original MS-20 was strictly monophonic. <br><br>  There are two generators: the first can produce triangular, sawtooth, pulsed waveforms and white noise;  the second is a sawtooth, rectangular, pulsed waveform and ring modulation.  Very high quality filters with envelopes give the very Korg sound, known from the synth-pop of the 80s and early electronics. <br><br>  An interesting feature, the heritage of the original, is a large switching panel with 35 connectors (jacks).  They can be used to connect different parts of the synthesizer, which cancels the internal connections.  Thus, it is possible to get both simple sounds with the help of internal connections, as well as complex ones that are more common in modular systems. <br><br>  Thanks to the efforts of the developers, synth has a very analog sound with a slightly metallic tint extremely close to the original.  He is one of the best virtual emulators of existing synthesizers.  The MS-20 is sold as part of the korg legacy collection. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.korg.com/product.aspx%3Fpd%3D443">www.korg.com/product.aspx?pd=443</a> <br><br>  Sound example: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/korg-ms-20-demo">soundcloud.com/holygunner/korg-ms-20-demo</a> <br><br>  <b>Lennar Digital Sylenth1</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/607/cbe/581/607cbe581e057450be77f82df244554d.jpg"><br><br>  Very popular and highly appreciated by specialized editions virtual-analog synthesizer.  One of its main advantages is the extremely low load on the processor.  However, at the same time it has a very high-quality and rich sound.  Thanks to its interface, it is extremely easy to configure.  The base is four oscillators with eight waveforms with very good resolution.  Each oscillator has 8-voice polyphony and unison.  8 effects are placed in the center of the plug-in window: arpeggirator, distortion, phaser, chorus, equizer, deli, reverb and compressor. <br><br>  Included with the synth is a huge number of presets.  Like Massive, it is suitable for creating so many sounds.  Skate Sylenth - polyphonic leads and pads.  The sound of Sylenth1 is often compared to the expensive Access Virus iron synthesizer popular in electronic music. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.lennardigital.com/modules/downloads/">www.lennardigital.com/modules/downloads</a> <br><br>  Sound example: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/sylenth1-demo">soundcloud.com/holygunner/sylenth1-demo</a> <br><hr><br>  If the topic is interesting for the habocoobschestvo, then there will be a continuation of articles about synths and about creating electronic music. <br><br>  Part of my work + demo synths can be heard on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/holygunner/">soundcloud.com/holygunner</a> <br>  Download a demo in one archive here <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/kjxn9s">www.sendspace.com/file/kjxn9s</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126050/</a></p>
