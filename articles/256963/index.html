  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frameworks spoil development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  Since on the Toaster I was clearly explained that there is no place for discussion, but the topic is important to me - please arrange a small, but very calm discussion here.  I would very much like to hear your reasoned opinion. <br><br><h5>  Thought itself </h5><br>  I believe you agree that programming has 2 meanings.  The first is a powerful tool for solving complex (sometimes simple) problems, the second is creativity.  If everything is clear with the latter - you enjoy the process, inventing the optimal algorithm or creating something new, then the first is not quite. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Writing any code leads to the creation of a product (good or not - it does not matter).  This product is the solution.  It is necessary to recognize the person in the photo / video - the task, the program that makes it - the product, the code - the tool.  And your task is to have the final product solve the initial problem.  I'm not talking about what you need / you can write govnokod and enjoy life - no, this is impossible.  It is necessary to remember about the optimality of the algorithm and consumed resources.  But chasing the perfect code is not the best idea, in my opinion.  One should always seek and dwell on the golden mean, which gives the best balance of expended forces and the optimal solution. <br><br>  Previously, to develop something, a person learned the language and approaches to building / creating an application.  After that, he created the product and proceeded to the next task.  If the solution of a new task required any part of the past product, source codes were taken and finished to the desired state.  At the same time the threshold of entry was lower and higher than now.  Below is for a person who knows the language.  Higher for a man who knows nothing.

      Now, most developers are trying to spit out the finished product as soon as possible and get money for it, for which the frameworks are used.  A person can memorize a set of certain words and just copy them, and at the output get a more or less finished product.  In this case, it is not necessary to understand and understand what is happening.  And if something goes wrong, then you will spend a lot of time pushing through the entire code of the framework to understand what is going wrong. <br><br>  The problem of frameworks is that they push you into the framework, depriving you of freedom and understanding.  The library gave you a ready-made function / functions written by someone else, which you could use as and where you want.  At the same time, when switching from one project to another, from one language to another, you could quite easily replace the library with a similar one in that language and did not have to retrain / change the structure of the application.  As the library is only a wrapper around a natural, naked language. <br><br>  The framework binds you to itself.  Each of them has its own built-in logic of work, which is not always easy to grasp.  And when moving from one language to another / from one team to another, you often have to spend several days to figure out how to use the new framework.  And when you move a project, you essentially have to re-create your entire product.  If you used naked language, then you would not have to face such a problem.  The language is the language and the new developer in the team would not have to spend so much time understanding the framework, he could work right away. <br><br>  It is worth remembering the recent joke about the most powerful and popular vanilla.js framework. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256963/</a></p>
