      By the new 2011, I looked at myself on the ebay MacBook Pro.  I faced the problem of delivering it to Russia.  Impressed with the number of positive reviews about Ebaytoday, my choice fell on them.  I paid for goods, Ebaytoday services, insurance, EMS services, having spent the entire amount equal to my income for several months. <br>  And on January 6, 2011, I received a letter from Ebaytoday, saying that the package with the MacBook went to me ... <br><br>  A month has passed.  The delayed delivery dates began to bother me - I monitored the EMS website every day and called their hotline, which turned out to be useless a little less than completely: for all the information, the mail ‚Äúreturns‚Äù to the sender.  Good.  To the sender, so to the sender - I thought. <br>  The support of EbayToday, in turn, sends calls to EMS, often repeats what has already been discussed previously (despite the fact that on the internal mail page it is written: "The message history is saved. When you contact support, the consultant can quickly view previous messages and you do not need to reiterate the essence of your case. It saves time. ").  It all came down to what to expect. <br><br>  I was waiting‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I waited, continuing to monitor the EMS site and daily calling the operators, to clarify whether there was a new information about my package. <br><br>  And so - at the end of February 2011, an operator at the post office informed me that the parcel had been sent back for reasons unknown to them, which I could find out from the sender.  I immediately wrote to the support Ebaytoday.  To which he received the answer: <br><br>  <i>Good day!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Since we are not a delivery service, we cannot verify the reason for your return.</i>  <i>For all questions of delivery, please contact directly to EMS 8 800 2005 055. If you are called to the customs, you must coordinate all the issues at customs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please note that all return shipments are entered into your account and are charged as MF (parcel to your address in the USA).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>eBayToday.ru team</i> <br><br>  On the EMS website, I learned that I had to write an application for the search of a shipment and again applied to Ebaytoday support, asking for help in compiling this application.  The answer was as follows: <br><br>  <i>Good day!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>From our warehouse parcel left with a weight of 9 lb.</i>  <i>2.6 oz.</i>  <i>If there is a shortage or weight difference in the parcel, this must be fixed upon receipt.</i>  <i>The reasons for the return of parcels from the Russian Federation, the US Post does not tell us.</i>  <i>From practice, parcels are most often returned due to lack of demand or, if not missed, by customs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Today, once the package is returned to the US, we need to wait for it to be received by colleagues in the US.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>eBayToday.ru team</i> <br><br>  Just at this moment, an article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebay/115696/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebay/115696</a> appeared on Habr√© - in one of the comments I described my problem.  A habrauzer <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kosilov/" class="user_link">kosilov</a> replied: <br><br>  <i>Have you insured your package?</i>  <i>Write me a personal number.</i>  <i>If insured, insurance must be paid</i> <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt hope to get my laptop and was ready to receive insurance.  March 17, 2011, answering in a personal <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kosilov/" class="user_link">kosilov</a> , I received the following answer: <br><br>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The parcel was deployed, the reason is reported by attaching the form to the parcel.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>as soon as we receive it, we will see the reason.</i>  <i>If something is wrong with her, then we are also waiting for the parcel to be received for insurance compensation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Therefore, it remains only to wait when she comes to the warehouse ((.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Unfortunately, there are no levers of influence on EMS to speed up something.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Good!  - wait, so wait.  Now I daily monitored the USPS website (US mail), waiting for the parcel to return to the Ebaytoday warehouse. <br><br>  And so, on May 21, 2011, information appeared on the USPS website that the package was delivered back.  Well, finally - I breathed a sigh of relief - now I can get my insurance.  And immediately went to write to the support Ebaytoday.  I did not receive any answer within a few weeks.  Then I had to repeat my question.  The answer was as follows: <br><br>  <i>Good afternoon, Ilya Evgenievich!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Perhaps you did not get the system message.</i>  <i>Apologize.</i>  <i>The fact is that your parcel returned empty, it was stolen.</i>  <i>We sent a request to the US post about this, but unfortunately, the post office does not accept it, since the deadlines for the proceedings have already passed.</i>  <i>And without mail confirmation it is impossible to transfer the application to the insurance company.</i>  <i>Sorry to have this situation.</i>  <i>But we did our best.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>eBayToday.ru team</i> <br><br>  I wanted to leave a review on the Ebaytoday website.  But I can‚Äôt do it technically (perhaps due to the fact that I didn‚Äôt press the ‚ÄúI received the parcel‚Äù button. So the reviews of those who didn‚Äôt get the Ebaytoday package at all will not work, and we still wonder why only good reviews), although maybe I just did not find the link - I want to believe in it. <br><br>  Thus, I spent huge (by my standards) money, a lot of strength and nerves to stay with nothing!  Package was stolen.  I also did not receive insurance (although I paid for it).  Ebaytoday refuses to take any action and somehow protect my interests, referring to the 90-day period of proceedings on EMS shipments.  They cannot provide any documents other than pdfs with an invoice (they do not explain the reasons).  At the same time, they themselves clearly indicated - wait for the parcel to return to our warehouse in the USA - it was in the first half of March 2011, when the lines had not yet expired.  I also note that for the first time I addressed my concerns to the Ebaytoday support back in February 2011 - explaining that they told me at the post office that the package was delayed at customs. <br><br>  Perhaps right now you, Khabrachelovek, with a broad smile, foreshadowing the purchase of the cherished thing, copy the link from ebay to send it to Ebaytoday, as I did more than six months ago.  I told you how it ended for me - maybe this experience will be useful for you.  In any case, you decide. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124239/</a></p>
