You can‚Äôt play with the touchpad, so I‚Äôll order this one.  Practically, I poked at random - sorted out the minimum and maximum price in the Yandex market, and then the lucky model Gamdias Hades GMS7011.  Why she?  It became interesting - not so beaten brand, like the same Razer or Logitech, well, I saw it at the exhibition.  So, I present to you the tale of a rodent gamer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One day, a black-black mouse crawled out of the dark, underworldly underground kingdom.  It was not easy: a laser sensor with a breathtaking resolution of 8200 tons / d was clearly extracted from the depths of the earth.  Therefore, the rodent was named in honor of the god of the underworld Hades, who is responsible for the <s>Ministry of Agriculture,</s> fertility, as well as other <s>hydrocarbons of</s> wealth that lie deep.

      Gamdias Hades has many faces.  If you take it in your hands, you won‚Äôt understand: for a left-handed person or for a right-handed person, but three sets of pads are included in the kit, with which you can change the geometry of the mouse very seriously.  Despite the fact that I have been using the mouse for already a month, I occasionally change the shape and it seems to me more comfortable - funny.  The skin of a rodent is tenacious.  It seems that the usual matte plastic, in the store would have seen - did not pay attention.  And you take in your hand - you feel a small-fine roughness.  I would do everything from such material.  And then some remnants of a circle.  That and look slip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acb/e9f/2d3/acbe9f2d3df44f25b72285506e95bc1b.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äútail‚Äù is long - two meters, dressed in a nylon (feeling) braid that slides very nicely and does not cling to the corner of the table.  True, personally, I already want a wireless gaming mouse!  But without delay!  Okay, I fantasized and went on. <br>  I had an ambiguous attitude towards the HERA program, which manages all the functionality of Gamdias Hades.  On the one hand, everything is convenient, everything is clear, and most importantly, even installation is not required ‚Äî I downloaded the archive from the site, unpacked it, launched it, and that's it.  On the other hand, there is no Russian language. <br><br>  But this very HERA, sorry for my English, allows you to save 6 profiles into the mouse itself.  Drop down comfortably when gamishsya for different computers, you take the mouse with you, but it already has everything - you use like at home.  I will not even tell about any settings for the color of the backlight - it‚Äôs all so clear.  More interesting is the sensor.  For some time I did not follow the development of the industry and to meet the resolution as much as 8200 dpi was a revelation for me.  The previous mouse was at one time one of the tops - 3200, but what would more than double ... <br><br>  And you can see how many times you clicked on each of the buttons.  I do not know how useful this ‚Äúodometer‚Äù is for a mouse, but it's funny.  Maybe this is how the manufacturer wanted to emphasize a high resource - in the Hades 7011, the switches of the Japanese company Omron were installed with a resource of as many as 10,000,000 clicks!  The company is good, I know for sure - there is a tonometer and digital scales at home.  Both gadgets work well, I think, and buttons are able to do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea0/3f3/5ef/ea03f35efd4f4e118e1a51de94f12af6.jpg"><br><br>  The keys are pressed gently, but with a clear click.  I‚Äôm used to a little tighter buttons, but I adapted completely in an hour.  In general, I say - ergonomics is good.  In the hand it lies as it should, thanks to the overlays, and 7 of the 8 buttons can be customized to your liking. <br><br>  Now about the main thing - about the Witcher 3, more precisely, about how the agricultural god helped me enjoy the process.  First, the horse is a pity.  I love animals, and horses especially, that is why it was a matter of honor to find and knock on the head to someone who does not do well with a horse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70c/1a1/f03/70c1a1f032ea4150b5763421001f91d2.jpg"><br><br>  Gamdias Hades 7011 is divinely good at running and all kinds of slaughter in forests and fields.  The sensor is really smart - the accuracy is amazing, and the ability to change the resolution on the go allows you to feel the hero and the weapon.  Moreover, I played on different surfaces - from a cheap old rug to a wooden table (not lacquered).  The difference, of course, is, but rather tactile.  It is more pleasant for me when the hand is just on the table without any extra pads.  The main thing - the coating did not affect the work of the mouse.  In general, I felt what is described by the phrase ‚Äúwhen an instrument becomes an extension of a hand‚Äù. <br><br>  I played mostly with headphones in a dark room - so the effect of immersion is better.  I will say that the Witcher turned out cool, I do not know why he is sometimes scolded.  Take a look at these naked young ladies, at least - they‚Äôre almost like real ones.  Yes, to work on the face, but everything else has turned out very well!  And the gameplay is good.  Live in.  Good game. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391191/</a></p>
