The idea, of course, is not new, but perhaps someone can be helped to ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù several outgoing motherboards. <br><br>  I wanted to write about it after reading this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206236/">article</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will explain right away that all this was done not only for the sake of pleasure.  As is known, 2013 in Russia has been declared the year of environmental protection.  Therefore, in one of the main competitions for technical vocational education - ‚ÄúArt-Profi-Forum‚Äù (in which employees are voluntarily forced to participate), a nomination of products from outdated electronic devices appeared.

      After some deliberation, together with exer <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/exer/" class="user_link">habrauzer</a> , it was decided to make a layout of the map of the Kemerovo region. <br>  To begin with, a paper version of the card was printed in the form of a poster of 3x3 A4 paper size.  Gluing everything together and cutting the map along the contour, we got a stencil (unfortunately there is no photo), on which the image on the sheet of 14 mm plywood was applied. <br><br>  After that, guided by the "do no harm" rule, we started cutting plywood.  The main difficulty here was to maintain a balance of speed and accuracy, since the upper layers of plywood, when cutting them with an electric jigsaw, have the ability to split.  In addition, at this stage, we had to simplify the borders somewhat, due to the not very high accuracy of the tool.  As a result, after an hour of cutting and an hour of finishing the file, the base of the map was ready. <br><br>  Then began the hardest and tedious part of the work - cutting printed circuit boards.  Cutting was decided bormashinkoy with cutting wheels.  After preliminary measurements, the board was applied to the base and outlined from below with a marker, after which it was cut out.  Cutting discs were consumed fairly quickly: either they broke during any inaccurate movement, or they were completely erased after 10-12 cm. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Several photos of the process</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/a28/b65/336a28b652f440e59b0503e49c3364a5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/888/d2e/284888d2e5bf4480818c70efd169a953.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/598/e1f/82d/598e1f82d04c41ed8b0e67c0172502a9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/327/dec/4f9327decef64ba2a69708e481aec847.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  Fragments of the boards were screwed to the base with small black screws, almost invisible against the background of variegated boards.  The boards were chosen in such a way that the sockets of the central processors approximately coincided with the location of two large cities on the map of the region.  A transparent film was pasted on each socket with the city coat of arms printed on it.  In the center was a large logo of the 70th anniversary of the region. <br><br>  Final version: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/aa4/201/d7aaa42019e34d57a0e4c782563b47fa.JPG"><br><br>  The project has spent: 0.6 m2 14 mm plywood, about 18 cutting wheels, 5 motherboards, 1 sound card and 1 month of work.  At the moment, the card is decorated with a computer room, and failing motherboards are piling up for the New Year tree. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361883/</a></p>
