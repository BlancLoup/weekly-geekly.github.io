Account in Yandex. Of course identified.  The turnover of transactions in i.dengi not more than 30k per month.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Hello. <br><br>  In accordance with clause 4.6.2.3 of the Agreement on the use of the Yandex.Money system, expenditure transactions in your account no. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx are suspended to clarify the purposes for which you use the payment system. <br><br>  You can view the text of the agreement on the <a href="">money.yandex.ru/doc.xml?id=522764</a> page. <br>  Unfortunately, we are not entitled to discuss the decision to suspend operations by e-mail or by phone. <br><br>  Please note: expenditure transactions are suspended temporarily, until a positive decision on your application. <br>  <b>The statement must tell you what you are using the Yandex.Money system, as well as comment on the payments and credits that you made on xx.02.2010.</b> <br><br>  You can bring the completed application in person to the Yandex.Money System representative office.  Addresses of representative offices are listed on our website: <a href="">money.yandex.ru/doc.xml?id=157622</a> <br>  You should have a passport or military ID with you.  If you cannot come in person, you need to notarize your signature on the application and send us this application by registered mail to: <br><br>  117393, Moscow, PO Box 273, OOO PS Yandex.Money <br><br>  In accordance with Art.  80 Fundamentals of the legislation of the Russian Federation on the notary notary indicates the authenticity of the signature on the document, the content of which does not contradict the legislative acts of the Russian Federation. <br>  The notary, certifying the authenticity of the signature, does not certify the facts stated in the document, but only confirms that the signature was made by a certain person. <br><br>  Your application will be reviewed and, if technically possible, satisfied.  If the result is positive, your account will be identified if it has not been identified before.  Identification will need to be confirmed in the system. <br>  The term of consideration of the application is 20 working days from the date of its receipt. <br><br>  Please note that the application should be sent by mail only to the mailbox, and by express mail and courier delivery to the address of the Moscow office.  Applications without notarization of signature signed by mail or courier delivery are not considered. <br><br>  Applications from minors are accepted only in the presence of parents or with the provision of their notarized written consent to use the System. <br><br>  Thank you for your request. <br></blockquote><br><br>  The only transaction on the day for which Yandex asks to tell what was there was a payment in 4 thousand rubles for the completion of the script and its withdrawal to the Alfa-Bank linked card.  But the subject of the agreement placed below unequivocally prohibits me from accepting payments for services. <br><br><blockquote>  3. Subject of the Agreement <br>  3.1.  The subject of this Agreement is the provision by the System Operator to the User of the use of the System for the purpose of paying for goods (works / services) sold by the Suppliers, as well as accepting from the Users funds sent to government authorities, local governments and state institutions <br><br>  * to fulfill the monetary obligations of the Users for payment of goods (works, services); <br>  * for transfer to the bank account of the User; <br>  * for transactions using payment cards; <br>  * to transfer to the Bank, when carrying out transactions with the use of payment cards, of the User's instructions on effecting settlements on their bank accounts, under the conditions specified by the Agreement. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Registering as an online store is also not an option. <br><br><blockquote>  * the online store must be fully operational (all sections of the site are filled, all internal links are adequately processed); <br>  * Store site should not be hosted on a free server (narod.ru, ucoz.ru, by.ru, etc.); <br>  * The site must contain valid contact details of the store; <br>  * The site should have at least 500 unique visitors per day. <br></blockquote><br><br>  So, forget about Yandex.Money or prepare to send notarized papers for each transaction?  And will not there be an explanation that I took the money for a commercial service by violating the rules for using PS Yandex.Money followed by eternal blocking?  On account of 200 rubles, it‚Äôs not a pity to forget, I‚Äôm sorry for the power.  And to pay a notary, wait for 20 days + x days mail delivery is some way of a samurai. <br><br>  UPD on May 12, 2010 <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93382/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/93382/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87095/</a></p>
