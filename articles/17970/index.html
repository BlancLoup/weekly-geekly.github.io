Only the approach and the assessment of the events from one person to another differ, but the goal is the same for everyone - based on the information received, to form new criteria for a successful year.  Someone will consider success in the new year to get a good job and gain a foothold in the new position, and for someone even a profit of their own company of several million will be considered a failure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/356/04a/903/35604a903c49395ef1cb65c4b29adb27.gif" width="200" height="132" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  Turning to the topic of forecasts for the development of the Internet advertising market in 2008, first of all I would like to touch on the development of the Internet community as a whole, since it is this which ultimately determines the vector and direction of development of the Internet advertising market.  The year 2007 showed that the modern users of the network, for the most part, are no longer faceless hosts and hits, wandering in the network from site to site in search of certain information.  The informational chaos and technical illiteracy gradually go down in history.  The boundaries between the desired and possible disappear.  Today there is no need to delve into the technical nuances to implement the desired, all the rough work for you is done by automated web services that amaze with the dynamics of their development and what is important - with a friendly, intuitive interface.  No need to reinvent the wheel.  And the widespread introduction of web standards and open_source products, taking into account the development of modern technologies, makes the life of web services data developers easier. <br><br>  All this, ultimately, led to the rapid growth of this kind of phenomenon as social networks.  The popularity of social networks immediately led to the emergence of a new kind of service <strong>SMO</strong> (Social media optimization) in the advertising market. <br>  Based on the fact that it was 2007 that was marked by a rapid growth of social networks both in runet and beyond, and the growth trend clearly maintains more than a positive trend - you can make the main forecast that the market for Internet advertising services in 2008 will also respond on this with the appropriate offer. <br><br>  Along with proposals for <strong>SEO</strong> , contextual advertising and media advertising - SMO will become an integral part of the package of integrated promotion of the web project.  The main advantage of SMO over SEO, in my opinion - is primarily the dominance of intellectual thinking over technical during the advertising campaign.  SEO is 80% routine, as opposed to SMO, where the proportion of routine is minimal.  And besides, SMO allows you to directly contact the target customer, unlike SEO, where the main goal is a search engine.  This is not to mention the cost, where SMO leaves SEO far behind. <br>  All this should lead to the development and promotion of SMO services.  In view of this, as well as the ever-increasing role of content - the services of a copywriter will be the most popular since 2008.

      Here I would like to make a small digression.  In September 2007, I conducted a study of the Internet advertising market for the internal needs of our company.  Through a survey (under the guise of a client), I surveyed more than 50 firms that provide online advertising services from various price groups.  In every 2-nd question about the availability of our own copywriter, I was answered negatively (that is, we did not provide this service), and among the remaining 50%, a good half keep copywriters outsourcing due to weak demand.  Therefore, I would formulate my second thesis on forecasts for 2008 as follows: an increase in the demand for the services of professional copywriters. <br><br>  Against the background of the global financial crisis, the online advertising market will show completely asymmetric dynamics: according to estimates by the analytical company eMarketer, the estimated market growth will be 20% (from the current 21 billion to 27 billion dollars). <br>  In turn, the influx of large-scale online advertising agencies into the online advertising market, which absorb (it is absorb, not unite) young and promising startups - will continue in 2008. <br>  Also in 2008, according to forecasts of our company, it will be a turning point in the market for both contextual and media advertising, due to the emergence of more flexible mechanisms during the advertising campaign, namely the ability to control the display of your ads by socio-demographic parameters, and same behavioral targeting.  Of course, this move will not go unnoticed by the users of the network themselves, most of whom clearly will not like the fact that the stories of their network activity will be available to anyone else except themselves, even if it is confidential.  And since history knows quite a few examples of when confidential information was in the hands of intruders, no one can give you 100% guarantees for non-proliferation of information. <br><br>  Now I would like to talk about the development of the SEO market.  In 2008, the positive dynamics of the development of this market of services will naturally continue.  At the same time, the rise in prices for the services of SEO specialists (both freelancers and individual structures), according to our company's estimates, will increase by 15-20%.  This is due to the fact that, as before, demand exceeds supply, which allows SEO staff to set the rules for the game.  It is also not worth discounting the fact that every year the complexity of the work increases (due to the introduction of new filters by the search engines and the change of ranking algorithms), and the reference budgets do not become less.  Although in the conditions of high competition - smaller companies in the first half of 2008, most likely, will occupy their price niche - and will not raise prices for SEO complex. <br>  The mechanisms of seo-specialists in 2008 will change slightly.  This statement is based on the fact that neither Yandex nor Google (the two most popular search engines on the runet) over the past six months have not patented any coordinate-new relevance determination algorithms.  You can certainly recall the technology TrustRank and PhraseRank from Google, but we have already heard about them since the end of 2006.  So there is no fundamentally new wait. <br><br>  <strong>So, to consolidate, we will repeat once again the main points put forward in this article about what awaits us in the coming 2008:</strong> <br><blockquote>  1. Twenty percent growth of the online advertising market; <br>  2. Rising prices for SEO services; <br>  3. Personalization of advertising.  Behavioral and geographical targeting, along with socio-demographic parameters, will be decisive in conducting an advertising campaign in runet; <br>  4. The increase in the share of SMO in the market of services for online advertising, due to the rapid development of social networks and the blogosphere; <br>  5. Copywriter - one of the most sought-after professions in the new year; </blockquote><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17970/</a></p>
