Most often this language is English.  There are many methods of learning a foreign language, including English: memorizing words using cards;  putting up stickers with the names of items throughout the house;  the method of the 25th frame (although I personally do not believe in it);  studying grammar, - both with a tutor / at school / at a university / at courses, or independently;  dive method finally.  In general, there is plenty to choose from.  Fortunately, you can find a great many on the Internet. <br><br>  The choice of a particular method, and perhaps several, depends on the motivation.  Before you dwell on one of them, ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúWhy am I learning a language?‚Äù.  Someone will be quite enough basic knowledge of grammar and vocabulary - simply because the language is needed only to read articles, for example.  And for some it will not be enough.  Yes, grammar and vocabulary is, of course, good.  They are the foundation of the language, its foundation and walls.  But what about live speech?  After all, the understanding of foreign speech, and then the opportunity to speak a foreign language is an important component. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think that the best way to get acquainted with a lively speech is to dive into the language environment, but not everyone has the opportunity to go abroad and live there for at least several months (this is exactly what is required for getting used to the ear to someone else's speech, adaptation and overcoming the language barrier).  So what to do?  Audio books - this is a worthy solution to the problem, even if it does not completely replace this very language environment.

      Having studied the list of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/60133/">resources that will help you learn English</a> , I found many interesting and useful resources, continuing my search on the web, and I also received several decent sites: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://librivox.org/">librivox.org</a> - By clicking on the "directory", we get not a list of books, but a search box.  It is proposed to download mp3 and ogg formats. </li><li>  <a href="http://storynory.com/">storynory.com</a> is a portal for children and not only.  Large selection of fairy tales, classic children's stories, ancient myths, and even real stories.  The site has a nice interface, the narrator has a nice voice.  You can listen directly on the site, and you can download. </li><li>  <a href="http://booksshouldbefree.com/">booksshouldbefree.com</a> - a huge selection of books in many different genres, up to philosophy and religion.  Available download mp3, text file (for reading), and read online.  Listening online is not provided. </li><li>  <a href="http://freeclassicaudiobooks.com/">freeclassicaudiobooks.com</a> - the choice is not very large, but the names are practically all recognizable.  Downloadable (mp3 and mp4 for iPOD).  In addition, the site makes a tempting offer - buy 200 classic books for only $ 9.95! </li><li>  <a href="http://www.newfiction.com/">www.newfiction.com</a> - Access appears only after registration.  The books are available in chunks with breaks of several hours, after which you can go back to the site and continue listening.  They can also be chapters downloaded to a computer, phone or iPOD. </li></ul><br>  I want to tell about the latter in more detail, it was this site ( <a href="http://www.newfiction.com/">newfiction.com</a> ) that attracted by the fact that, unlike most similar sites, the story is read in roles by different performers, emotionally and with the imposition of sound effects.  Yes, and the text itself is not chewed almost syllables, and goes with normal speed.  If you do not have time to keep track of the meaning - just below you can open the text.  In addition, English is here - in its American version, which personally pleased me.  Presented works of contemporaries, so that the language is neither living nor real! <br>  In the process of studying this site, I had the opportunity to get information about what is called ‚Äúfirst-hand‚Äù from one of the creators of NewFiction.com, Tom Lopilato.  I asked him to formulate the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site.  Given that Tom is the Marketing Director, his description was somewhat poetic and did not quite correspond to what I expected to hear from him.  Nevertheless, the person spent the time, so I give his description in the Russian translation, without changes: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/52d/573/c63/52d573c63bbf9f8936e3aaa394f6c2b1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>NewFiction.com website offers you a new opportunity: listen to stories from American authors and at the same time pull up your American English.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Hollywood.</i>  <i>Once storytelling to the public was accessible to almost everyone: there were no censors, no critics, no publishers.</i>  <i>But only those who could tell an interesting story could do it: if you started reading your story, but it was unsuccessful, then, most likely, you were deprived of the attention of listeners.</i>  <i>The availability of this uncomplicated entertainment to the public (its price was relatively low, but was completely absent) served as an undoubted advantage.</i>  <i>That's where democracy was! ..</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But then came the publishers.</i>  <i>A bunch of people, "keepers" of the publishing world, ordered that you read and what did not.</i>  <i>However, their dominance came to an end.</i>  <i>The Internet has greatly democratized the publishing industry.</i>  <i>It is no longer controlled by a small group of favorites who read the same thing, hang out in the same places and speak the same topics.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Everything is back to normal thanks to iSoaps at <a href="http://www.newfiction.com/">www.newfiction.com</a> .</i>  <i>Through the efforts of a team of editors, software developers, and literary authors, an innovative format was created, such as a regular radio play, where the story is performed by a number of talented readers, and not by a single speaker.</i>  <i>But the similarities end there.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Comparing these two formats is the same as comparing a horse-drawn carriage and a spacecraft.</i>  <i>On the radio of the 20s or 30s, you would never hear dialogs like iSoaps.</i>  <i>Rather, you can not listen to this at all on any radio and even on television.</i>  <i>And the matter is not in the dialogues as such;</i>  <i>the case in the situations and actions of the characters of the story, reproduced by the actors-narrators.</i>  <i>These guys play the glory!</i>  <i>In doing so, they do whatever they want and more.</i>  <i>And, of course, they are helped by realistic special effects and sound background, which previously could only be dreamed of on the radio.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Site NewFiction managed to increase sales of electronic books.</i>  <i>They act in the same way as the well-known online stores selling and distributing music (for example, Itunes and Napster), which played a significant role in the development of a completely new approach to selling music.</i>  <i>The site is as user friendly as possible;</i>  <i>Unique design allows you to easily register and receive the product in any way - via Email, via instant messenger agent, on a mobile phone or IPOD, via SMS messages or on a PDA device.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>With today's hectic lifestyle, you'd better not imagine.</i>  <i>People are now less likely to fall on the sofa with a book - there is simply no time for this.</i>  <i>Another thing - to listen to a story or another on the way to work, in the subway or bus.</i>  <i>Especially if it is performed by professional actors, by roles, as in the good old radio play.</i>  <i>The road will immediately become many times more pleasant!</i>  <i>You can download the whole book and enjoy it for months.</i>  <i>Both readers and listeners welcome any easy opportunity to get acquainted with the latest literature, and iSoaps helps them in this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Digital technology is now being introduced into the world of novels, stories and short stories.</i>  <i>But they remained alien to the publishing world, whose representatives are even proud of it.</i>  <i>For the most part, publishers avoid Internet technologies, due to the difficulty of control over the content of books and copyright infringements.</i>  <i>This can be understood.</i>  <i>Due to pirated downloads, the same music industry loses 90% of their sales value.</i>  <i>But at the same time, it is impossible to ignore the rapid development of new technologies that are changing our world literally before our eyes. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Finally, let me give you some tips: <br><ul><li>  First, do not try to listen to the entire book at once, it is completely useless.  It has long been proven that the assimilation of new information is proceeding gradually. </li><li>  Secondly, to start, select a record with a moderate reading speed;  You can also follow the text, but over time it is better to refuse the cheat sheet. </li><li>  Thirdly, the recording in the headphones is clearer than in the columns. </li><li>  Fourth, write down the words or phrases that you found interesting.  So you use the motor memory. </li><li>  Well, and fifthly, after some time, try to recite an excerpt of the book you listened to and compare it with the professionals.  It is possible that the differences you will not find </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65778/</a></p>
