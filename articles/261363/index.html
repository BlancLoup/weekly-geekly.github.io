HP Training Programs‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a6/55d/fa1/9a655dfa1a0d484898cdfc5bfb43b7f9.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the technological effectiveness of IT solutions, there is an important aspect - for what services does this equipment work?  ITIL is a methodology for managing, debugging, and continually improving IT business processes.  The manufacturability of IT solutions does not guarantee the proper operation of IT services.  ITIL is not a ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù, it is also constantly changing and improving as a service improvement methodology.  As much as a service exists, so much should it improve, otherwise it will die.  The fictional company in ITIL courses deals with the fact that it launches satellites into space, and when this course is taught in Kazakhstan, all the time the listeners have a question, why does the launch take place in Ukraine, because we have Baikonur :) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/149326/">Formula 1</a> , the development of HP, where the services (refueling machines, engine, maintenance) depends on whether the car will win the team in the race. <br><br>  Here you can see everything: - how information is lost during transmission, - where the ‚Äúholes‚Äù in communication are, - how ‚Äúwhat is clear to everyone‚Äù becomes a big problem for different groups of people: from the IT team to the business leadership.  How a request changes beyond recognition, until it goes from business to IT engineers, and how an IT service loses its meaning if IT professionals have not bothered to find out how it works in life.  All these "diseases" of any IT services are visible here in full view.  Time itself checks the business for strength, continuity, reliability, where cost reduction is constantly required.  Technique, management, process maturity - all this in ITIL courses.  Learning ITIL will help to use these tools of the ITIL methodology - both for yourself and for your organization. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6qJqHSbRzE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhggP27GZ04oyJzZfr9OQOOOCrbO_Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Egor Skrynnik, HP Software technical consultant, with the report ‚ÄúHP Software - a modern approach to building an IT and business services monitoring system‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a7/583/792/6a7583792fc54fe28a15b5b0879e4084.JPG"><br><br>  Egor spoke about HP software solutions, in particular about application monitoring.  HP began developing software solutions 25 years ago with monitoring its network solutions, then the task pool and functionality expanded significantly.  The greatest interest was caused by the IT infrastructure monitoring section.  uCMDB is a software platform that helps build interconnections between IT infrastructure components.  All incidents must be ‚Äúassigned‚Äù, each to its own application or process.  HP software solutions allow you to see rare network problems, network bugs that are fraught with consequences.  We can see all the events, where they can lead, what changes are caused, etc., - the program itself compares these events and shows the weak and problematic places of the network.  Using these tools, we can see the network problem, even before its transition to the critical phase.  A special discussion among the listeners was caused by the fact that there is information about such a decision, and how it works in practice is not quite clear, it raises many questions.  Therefore, the wish was taken into account that in the next courses on this topic more attention would be paid to real cases, where and how HP software solutions work. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2UzmUq9pw4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhweC_BYAwPTWIM8WPEyt9DLtyjMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Review of HP security solutions</b> .

As you probably already know, HP bought Aruba Networks.  The speaker talked about how Aruba solutions are already working in the HP wi-fi lineup and how they will work.  What the line of equipment of HP access points now looks like now, and what equipment upgrades are expected. <br><br>  In particular, it was told about a fairly innovative solution of HP - Cloud Management Wi-Fi.  When the wi-fi access point has a controller in the cloud, the access points may be in different, cities, but have one cloud controller.  In this case: the access point (s) and subscription to the service are purchased.  Who may need it?  Mostly retail, or rather those customers who do not have IT staff.  To some extent, this is similar to leasing, you buy not equipment, but service - you buy access points with corporate Wi-Fi.  In case of problems, even if the virtual controller does not work, the points do not stop working.  The speaker also spoke about many other Wi-Fi solutions, from home use to a large enterprise. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the equipment is also tired, and the entire report is not recorded, but soon, we promise, there will be a separate extended review in our blog on these solutions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cQhgGIX4do%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLhrCCra3zoBIx4qouILe3WHJnBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Well, as without prizes for those who studied the whole day, discounts (up to 50%) for <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/hewlett_packard/">HP</a> training <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/hewlett_packard/">at TC MUK</a> were raffled off - congratulations to the winners!</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/174/dd2/1ba/174dd21baec740e38ae6fc93e64daa4d.jpg"><br><hr><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MUKTrainingCenter">TC MUK in Facebook</a> <br>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/hewlett_packard/">HP Training Courses</a> <br>  <a href="http://muk.ua/business/">Distribution of HP solutions in Ukraine, CIS countries</a> <br><hr><br>  But the video report of the event: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH-XqJP5HfA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjHKX1bfBnpTtbCytSQ4u93Hx5NJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261363/</a></p>
