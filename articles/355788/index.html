What will be the next important event for the web? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a34/9b7/0ec/a349b70ecc7a0b465fd1b44087834440.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In truth, I do not know.  Why?  When I developed the web, I specifically arranged it as a place for neutrality, creativity and collaboration.  I wanted anyone from anywhere to share knowledge and information without having to buy a license or ask permission from me or any CEO, government agency or committee.  This openness was the cause of the tidal wave of innovation, which is still fueling breakthroughs in science, commerce, culture and much else.

      Today, the key element of openness that underlies the Internet and the entire Internet is at risk.  I'm talking about network neutrality - the principle that each data packet must be processed equally throughout the network.  This means that censorship is unacceptable - the state should not restrict citizens' access to legal content.  This is guaranteed by Article 11 of the European Union Charter on Human Rights.  In particular, it should not be limited for economic reasons.  The data packet, email, page, video call, needs to be processed in the same way.  It didn‚Äôt matter that they sent him from a small Lithuanian company or from a mega-corporation in London. <br><br>  Supporting neutrality is critical to the future of the web and human rights, innovation and progress in Europe.  Research shows that network neutrality stimulates interaction, leading to lower prices, fair competition, improved communications and innovation.  This benefits both individuals and Internet companies. <br><br>  However, companies and governments argue that this principle must be violated.  It is unacceptable to use locks or somehow restrict the distribution of legal content, including allowing ‚Äúpositive discrimination‚Äù when an Internet operator places one of the services above other similar ones.  If you do not prohibit such practices by law, this will lead to the fact that providers will have excessive power over sites, services and platforms.  This can lead to the disappearance of competition and crush innovative start-ups in the bud.  Imagine that a startup needs to ask permission or pay its competitor before they can start attracting visitors?  This is bribery and abuse of the market. <br><br>  And these are not theoretical concerns.  Net neutrality is already under threat.  In the 2014 Web Index survey, which was reviewed by 86 countries, 74% of them lack clear and clear net neutrality rules, and / or there is evidence of price discrimination.  In 95% of countries without neutrality laws, there is evidence of traffic discrimination. <br><br>  In today's Europe, the situation is mixed.  The situation in Holland, where net neutrality is supported by law, was rated by researchers at 8 out of 10 points.  The Czech Republic, Norway and Denmark received 7 out of 10. Poland and Italy are only 2 out of 10. Raising the bar of neutrality throughout the European Union can help Europe to feel the full potential of an open Internet as an engine of economic growth and social progress. <br><br>  The European Parliament has already made the necessary proposals to support neutrality.  Now it is up to the Council of the European Union, which should determine its position on this issue.  The discussion is scheduled for March 2015 and will be successful only if it is supported by Latvia, which will chair the EU at this time.  All interested parties should remind Latvia (twitter @ eu2015lv) that Europe needs neutrality now, before online discrimination has become the norm. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355788/</a></p>
