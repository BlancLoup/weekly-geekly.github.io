This is a digital camera based on the theory of the light field, according to which the camera sensor records not only information about the color and intensity of light, but also vector information about the direction of light at each point in the image, thereby obtaining more complete information about the plot being shot. than an ordinary camera. <br><br>  A key feature of the camera was the ability to adjust the focus of the image after the picture was taken. <br><br>  Despite the fact that last year Lytro acquired Limitless VR-animation company for $ 60 million, in March 2018 Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17166038/lytro-light-field-camera-company-shuts-down-google-hiring">swallowed</a> Lytro for $ 25‚Äì $ 40 million.

Google acquired the assets of Lytro, but without direct plans to integrate them into existing projects. <br><br><h3>  1. Theranos - blood test technology </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/lp/cn/wxlpcn3ziew1mr2ovsvtr1s0i2a.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Year of foundation</b> : 2003 <br>  <b>Maximum estimate</b> : 9 billion dollars <br>  <b>Amount raised</b> : 910 million dollars <br><br>  In 2015, Forbes magazine announced Elizabeth Holmes the youngest billionaire woman who made her own fortune by relying on Theranos market value, which at that time was valued at $ 9 billion. Holmes owned half of the startup‚Äôs shares. <br><br>  Theranos argued that, thanks to an innovative method developed by its experts, just a few drops of blood are enough for accurate and inexpensive analysis. <br><br>  However, within a few months after that, accusations of fraud fell down to the corporation: it turned out that the portable device for blood analysis offered by Theranos had too many errors and the company carried out parallel analyzes using traditional methods to compensate for errors. <br><br>  On June 15, 2018, Theranos founder and former operating director <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm611112.htm">were charged</a> with fraud.  According to the prosecution, Holmes and Balvani cited obviously false facts in presentations for investors and releases for the press, as well as during the demonstration of the company's products.  In this way, Theranos tried to convince investors of the revolutionary nature of its key product - a portable blood analyzer - due to its ability to carry out the entire spectrum of analyzes on a drop of blood from a finger. <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  In the past year, the biggest resonance was caused by the closure of Theranos, a medical technology company that collected almost $ 1 billion.  Many companies do not advertise the real reasons for closing.  We can only guess what went wrong in a company.  The main result can be considered only the fact that millions of dollars invested from venture capitalists are not the guarantor of the longevity of a startup. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434692/</a></p>
