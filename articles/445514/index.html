  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most interesting at the exhibition Securika Moscow 2019</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From March 19 to March 22, the 25th International Exhibition of Security Equipment and Equipment for Safety and Fire Protection Securika Moscow 2019 was held at the Capital Expocenter. Over 400 Russian and foreign companies, including Panasonic, PERCo, Bolid, Dahua, ITV, presented their novelties , Safe Logic, Argus Spectrum, Assa Abloy, Ajax and many others. <br><br>  So, briefly about <a name="habracut"></a>  the main novelties of the anniversary Securika-2019. <br><br><h4>  1. Intellectual Atris patrol robot from UBTECH </h4><br>  The Atris patrol robot, whose resemblance to the hero of the cartoon "The Valley" has already been noted by the press more than once, is intended to patrol areas with a heightened terrorist threat.  In his homeland, in China, the robot patrols the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region instead of the military, and also keeps order on the streets of Beijing.  The face recognition system is able to distinguish potential terrorists from the database from civilians, and, if they are detected, the robot calls into the military.  The tracked robot can move along a given route and be controlled manually in real time.

DarkFighter DS-2CD2T47G1-L camera with ColorVu technology from Hikvision </h4><br>  The camera, which became the winner of the ‚ÄúBest Innovative Product‚Äù competition in the ‚ÄúSecurity TV Systems‚Äù nomination, is designed to work in low light conditions and is capable of forming a color image with no light at all due to the built-in warm light illumination.  High image quality and accurate color rendition are necessary for video analytics, when accurate characteristics of video objects are important.  A new technology of collecting light, Smart FSI, and a new generation lens with anti-reflective coating, glass with ultra-low dispersion, effectively stabilizing image sharpness and color saturation and aperture F1.0, have achieved this effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/li/76/ubli76bjf0iegb0wazdtfdzz4ma.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  3. Ajax MotionProtect Outdoor Wireless Outdoor Ajax Detector </h4><br>  Ajax MotionProtect Outdoor is a wireless motion sensor with protection against false alarms that can work reliably even at sub-zero temperatures and in conditions of splashes and dust.  The intelligent LISA algorithm prevents false notifications.  The sensor does not respond to medium-sized animals, accurately identifies a person, has a range of up to 1,700 meters and an anti-masking system that meets the third level of reliability (Grade 3) according to the European standard of security alarms EN 50131-1: 2006.  Able to work up to 5 years without replacing the battery. <br><br><h4>  4. Biometric controller with integrated reader from PERCo </h4><br>  Biometric controller with built-in reader is used in modern access control systems.  The new controller from PERCo supports work with fingerprints, and with access cards of HID / EMM and MIFARE formats, and with smartphones.  The controller allows you to use several methods for identification in the access control system at once, which allows system users to easily make the transition from access cards to mobile access and biometrics.  To enhance access control, you can organize a passage on the map and smartphone simultaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/az/cj/rrazcjildv6jeppghwaqb3eqwxy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  5. Automatic fire extinguishing system based on mini-robots with a system from "EFER" </h4><br>  The fire extinguishing system based on mini-sprinklers with a remote access system was created using innovative developments in the field of sprayed water.  The system is able to automatically detect fire, to carry out automatic fire extinguishing of the object, to organize electronic fire supervision with remote control, eliminating the "human factor".  According to the developers, the use of such systems in crowded places will avoid the tragedies associated with the incorrect response of the responsible persons in case of an emergency.  The system won the first place in the nomination "Means and fire extinguishing systems" of the contest "The Best Innovative Product". <br><br><h4>  6. The development program "Heart of the city" by Dahua </h4><br>  At the core of the ‚ÄúHeart of the City‚Äù strategy is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintelligence, sensing and ecosystem.  According to the developers, the development of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud technologies, 5G and the Internet of things will allow to bring the "smart city" system to a new level.  Among the main problems in the development of smart cities, Dahua experts cite passive reading, partial intelligence, and network security threats.  To solve these problems, the program ‚ÄúHeart of the City‚Äù has been developed.  The ‚ÄúHeart‚Äù architecture is organized according to the principle ‚Äú1 platform, 2 centers, N applications‚Äù and is designed to organize industrial, commercial and city level applications, allowing you to effectively solve business problems and bring social and economic benefits due to the scientific approach to construction and operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-n/q9/yj/-nq9yj9eluvkkdaozzgmt84w8ao.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  7. Wireless cloud alarm Security Hub from "Astra" </h4><br>  Secutity Hub wireless alarm system with Big-Data cloud technology has been designed to function as part of smart home systems and security alarms for small objects.  The uniqueness of the cloud-based Secutity Hub alarm system is that, thanks to the open architecture, the device can be easily integrated with any centralized monitoring console and a large number of other devices.  For different organizations - for example, security and monitoring companies - a single software is provided with different personnel roles and different tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445514/</a></p>
