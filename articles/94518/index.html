  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buy my TV and I'll tell you what to watch.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the spread of broadband Internet, many began to predict the imminent extinction of conventional television.  Indeed - now you can watch anything and anytime on the network, but what a bad luck - TVs both bought and continue to buy, and new channels continue to appear like mushrooms after rain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77d/135/60c/77d13560c768530b89de22dab9371246.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Apparently, not wanting to waste time, Google, Intel, Sony and Logitech decided not to wait for the weather by the sea and create a new content platform for you and our mailboxes on their own.  At the moment, all this is called <b>Google TV</b> , at least that is how technology was called at the recently held Google I / O conference in San Francisco. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started, perhaps, with Intel and its concept of <b>Smart TV</b> , which was supposed to turn the situation on television upside down - so that the user does not adjust to the broadcasting network, but to it.  To implement this, the company began developing new hardware solutions, soon after which the multimedia <b>Intel Atom CE 4100</b> processor appeared, designed for various consumer electronics like Blu-ray and DVD players, set-top boxes and other TVs.  I don‚Äôt have any details on this ‚Äúisotope‚Äù, but it‚Äôs reliably known from the ‚Äútasty‚Äù one that it easily copes with decoding full-size high-definition video (1080p).  It is also reported that the processor is capable of processing three-dimensional graphics and there will be a special version of Adobe Flash Player 10 for it, including through which new products will be endowed with interfaces and effects of the highest quality.

According to Google, the technology should include the unification of the search algorithms of the giant, already familiar TV channels and TV programs, YouTube and other social networks, and all this ... yes, on the TV screen.  Rishi Chandra, product manager of the Google TV project: ‚Äú <i>Remember the first time you used Google search engine on your computer, remember this feeling of power over the Internet?</i>  <i>We want your television impressions to be the same, so that you can easily find what you want to watch</i> . ‚Äù  And the fact that the basis of all this is exactly the new Intel Atom processor, confirmed Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/diTpeYoqAhc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhNUsLTEFTFoGz9-wihoMiyibZdeg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Speaking of Intel - for them this is not the first experience with digital TV.  So on the site <a href="http://intel.sky.com/">Intel.sky.com</a> there are still episodes of the Internet-series ‚Äú <b>Intel's World of Tomorrow</b> ‚Äù, in which one Ben Shirez wanders around the headquarters of the corporation and with its various representatives enters conversations on the latest technologies and developments of the company. for tomorrow.  Among them, for example, three-dimensional Internet, news block management, real-time news tracking and other topics, one way or another relating to the future of information technology in everyday life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/61c/f52/d7a61cf526e44d95020a1b05657b28bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the first series, fluent English dealt with the algorithm for automatically selecting the most spectacular moments of a TV program on the example of a football match.  According to the developers, viewers who do not have an hour and a half to watch the whole match have the opportunity to see the brightest moments of the game in a few minutes: on an individual request, the system should automatically pick up goals, bars, penalties and other critical moments with star players.  Unfortunately, at the moment I don‚Äôt know anything about the state of this development - perhaps, by the way, it will be one of the elements of the new TV platform. <br><br>  It is expected that by the fall, Sony will release its first truly Internetized televisions.  However, many are aware of the problem of prices for new products of this company, so for those who do not want to get a new display, Logitech will release a special prefix that turns the TV into a smart home entertainment center.  What is funny - any phone or communicator (of course, based on the Android platform) can turn into a remote control for such a system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d44/3ea/77a/d443ea77aa54ac9b5e075ca0cefb0101.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My opinion is that all this is for lazy people, for those who do not have time and who do not have his ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù.  Almost all of the expected functionality is now anyway possible to more quickly and conveniently get through various sites and services, but with a reservation - on the computer.  What prevents to display the image from the computer to the TV?  True, nothing - that is why more and more people are buying multimeter HDMI wires) I practically don‚Äôt watch TV, preferring to periodically watch a movie through a media player.  Although ... if you talk like that, then instead of the Internet you can go to the library.  So, in new opportunities, ways of human interaction with content, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong. <br>  Of course, developments in the field of television will be in demand - if everything is good with sound and image quality technologies for a long time, then with a full-time software part and attempts to ‚Äúembed‚Äù the Internet into the zomboyaschik, everything is more than sad.  And the spread of technology with the usual scales for Google will certainly have a positive effect on many issues - I think Sergey Belyakov from Taganrog will be pleased) <br><br>  In general, wait and see;  details of the Google TV platform will be known already this week, although it is now clear that everything is spinning and spinning.  What do you think about this?  If, of course, generally watch TV) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94518/</a></p>
