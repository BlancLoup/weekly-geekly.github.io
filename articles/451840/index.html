  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flutter Application Performance Testing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The default Flutter framework works well and quickly, but does this mean that you don‚Äôt need to think about performance at all?  Not.  It‚Äôs absolutely real to write Flutter applications that will be slow.  On the other hand, you can also use the framework as much as possible and make your applications not only fast, but also efficient, consuming less CPU and battery time. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb9/950/aa7/bb9950aa7d75e64e402d3ffdd8958c97.png"></p><br><p>  <em>This is what we want to see: a statistically significant result of comparing two versions of your application for some meaningful metric.</em>  <em>Read on to find out how to get this.</em> </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  There are some general recommendations for optimizing performance in Flutter: </p><br><ul><li>  Enable as few widgets as possible when updating status. </li><li>  Update status only when needed. </li><li> Carry out computationally intensive tasks from your <code>build</code> methods and ideally from the main isolate. </li></ul><br><p>  The sad truth is that for many questions about performance optimization the answer will be "how lucky."  Is this particular optimization worth the effort and maintenance costs for this particular widget?  Does this particular approach make sense in this particular situation? </p><br><p>  The only useful answer to these questions is testing and measuring.  Quantify the impact on performance of each choice, and make a decision based on this data. </p><br><p>  The good news is that Flutter provides excellent performance profiling tools, such as <a href="https://flutter.github.io/devtools/">Dart DevTools</a> (currently in preview release), which includes Flutter Inspector, or you can use <a href="https://flutter.github.io/devtools/inspector">Flutter Inspector</a> directly from Android Studio (with the Flutter plugin installed).  You have <code>Flutter Driver</code> to test your application and <code>Profile mode</code> to save performance information. </p><br><p>  The bad news is that modern smartphones are ‚Äútoo‚Äù smart. </p><br><h1 id="problema-s-regulyatorami">  Problem with regulators </h1><br><p>  Quantifying the performance of the Flutter application is especially difficult with iOS and Android controls.  These system level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemons</a> adjust the speed of the central and graphics processors depending on the load.  Of course, this is basically good, as it provides smooth operation with less battery consumption. </p><br><p>  The disadvantage is that you can make your application much faster by increasing the amount of work done by it. </p><br><p>  Below, you can see how adding meaningless print calls to the application cycle caused the controller to switch the CPU to an increased frequency, which made the application much faster and its performance more predictable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bd/5e4/b29/0bd5e4b299bc338e4a65aba9f0a91bda.png"></p><br><p>  <em>The problem with regulators: by default you cannot trust your numbers.</em>  <em>In this span diagram, we have separate launches along the x axis (marked with the exact start time) and assembly time along the Y axis. As you can see, when we enter some completely unnecessary print statements, this causes the build time to go down. and not up.</em> </p><br><p>  In this experiment, the worst code resulted in faster build times (see above), faster rasterization times and a higher frame rate.  When objectively the worst code leads to improved performance, you can not rely on these indicators as a guide (recommendations). </p><br><p>  This is just one example of how mobile application performance testing can be unintuitive and difficult. </p><br><p>  Below I share some tips that I gathered while working on Flutter <a href="https://github.com/2d-inc/developer_quest">Developer Quest</a> for Google I / O. </p><br><h1 id="obschie-sovety">  General tips </h1><br><ul><li>  Do not measure performance in debug mode ( <code>DEBUG mode</code> ).  Measure performance in profiling mode only ( <code>Profile mode</code> ). </li><li>  Measure on a real device, not in an iOS Simulator or Android Emulator.  Software emulators are great for development, but have performance characteristics that are different from the real ones.  Flutter will not allow you to work in profiling mode on a simulated device, because it does not make any sense.  The data you collect in this way does not apply to actual performance. </li><li>  Ideally, use exactly the same physical device.  Make it your special device for performance testing and never use it for anything else. </li><li>  Explore the Flutter <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-io/performance-testing-of-flutter-apps-df7669bb7df7">performance profiling tools</a> . </li></ul><br><h1 id="cpugpu-regulyatory">  CPU / GPU regulators </h1><br><p>  As discussed above, modern operating systems change the frequency of each processor and graphics processor at their disposal in accordance with the load and some other heuristics.  (For example, touching the screen usually increases the speed of the Android phone.) </p><br><p>  On Android, you can disable these controls.  We call this process "scaling lock". </p><br><ul><li>  Create a script that disables the knobs on your device to test performance.  You can use the <a href="https://github.com/google/skia/blob/e25b4472cdd9f09cd393c9c34651218507c9847b/infra/bots/recipe_modules/flavor/android.py">Skia example</a> for inspiration.  You can also check out the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-system-cpu">Unix CPU API</a> . </li><li>  You may want something less universal and easier if you do not do such a great job of testing as Skia.  Check out the shell script in the Developer Quest to see where to go.  For example, the following part of the script sets the CPU for the userspace controller (the only controller that does not change the processor frequency on its own). <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/usr/bin/env bash GOV="userspace" echo "Setting CPU governor to: ${GOV}" adb shell "echo ${GOV} &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu${CPU_NO}/cpufreq/scaling_governor" ACTUAL_GOV=`adb shell "cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu${CPU_NO}/cpufreq/scaling_governor"` echo "- result: ${ACTUAL_GOV}"</span></span></code> </pre> </li><li>  Your goal here is not to simulate actual performance (users do not turn off the controls on their devices), but to have comparable performance indicators between launches. </li><li>  At the end you need to experiment and adapt the shell script to the device you will use.  It works, but until you do, your performance data will deceive you. </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x4/fw/o5/x4fwo5lyzfo7osrcbjgpfjd7whi.gif"></p><br><p>  <em>Early version of Developer Quest, tested using Flutter Driver on my desktop.</em> </p><br><h1 id="flutter-driver">  Flutter driver </h1><br><p>  Flutter Driver allows you to automatically test your application.  Read the section <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/profiling">‚ÄúPerformance Profiling‚Äù</a> on flutter.dev to find out how to use it when profiling your application. </p><br><ul><li>  To test performance, do not test your application manually.  Always use Flutter Driver to get really demonstrative data. </li><li>  Write your Flutter Driver code so that it checks what you really want to measure.  If you need overall application performance, try going through all parts of the application and doing what the user would do. </li><li>  If your application has an element of randomness ( <code>Random</code> , network events, etc.), then create a ‚Äústub‚Äù (mock) for such situations.  Test runs should be as close to each other as possible. </li><li>  If you want, you can add custom events to the timeline using the <code>startSync()</code> and <code>finishSync()</code> methods of the <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.2.0/dart-developer/Timeline-class.html">Timeline</a> class.  This can be useful if you are interested in the performance of a particular function.  Place <code>startSync()</code> at its beginning and <code>finishSync()</code> at its end. </li><li>  Save both the summary ( <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/flutter_driver/TimelineSummary/writeSummaryToFile.html">writeSummaryToFile</a> ) and, more importantly, the raw timeline ( <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/flutter_driver/TimelineSummary/writeTimelineToFile.html">writeTimelineToFile</a> ). </li><li>  Test each version of your application many times.  For Developer Quest, I spent on 100 starts.  (When you measure things that may be noisy, for example, on the p99 metric, you may need a lot more runs.) For POSIX based systems, this simply means doing something like the following: <code>for i in {1..100}; do flutter drive --target=test_driver/perf.dart --profile; done</code> <code>for i in {1..100}; do flutter drive --target=test_driver/perf.dart --profile; done</code>  <code>for i in {1..100}; do flutter drive --target=test_driver/perf.dart --profile; done</code> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/add/92b/950/add92b950ec34ce95edb9095a57186a3.png"></li></ul><br><p>  <em>Chrome timeline tool to check the results of profiling in Flutter.</em> </p><br><h1 id="timeline">  Timeline </h1><br><p>  The timeline is the raw output of your profiling results.  Flutter writes this information to a JSON file, which can be downloaded to <code>chrome://tracing</code> . </p><br><ul><li>  Understand how to open the full timeline in Chrome.  You simply open <code>chrome://tracing</code> in the Chrome browser, click "Load" and select the JSON file.  You can read more in <a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2017/01/23/Chrome-Tracing-as-Profiler-Frontend/">this little guide</a> .  (There is also <a href="https://flutter.github.io/devtools/timeline">a Flutter timeline tool</a> that is currently in tech preview. I did not use it because the Developer Quest project was launched before the Flutter tools were ready.) </li><li>  Use the WSAD keys to move along the timeline in <code>chrome://tracing</code> and 1234 to change the modes of operation. </li><li>  When you first set up performance testing, consider starting Flutter Driver with the Android tool Systrace.  This gives you a more complete picture of what is actually happening in the device, including information on scaling the frequency of the processor.  Do not measure the entire application with Systrace, as this will make everything slower and less predictable. </li><li>  How to run Android Systrace with Flutter Driver?  First, launch Android Systrace using <code>/path/to/your/android/sdk/platform-tools/systrace/systrace.py --atrace-categories=gfx,input,view,webview,wm,am,sm,audio,video,camera,hal,app,res,dalvik,rs,bionic,power,pm,ss,database,network,adb,pdx,sched,irq,freq,idle,disk,load,workq,memreclaim,regulators,binder_driver,binder_lock</code> .  Then <code>flutter run test_driver/perf.dart --profile --trace-systrace</code> .  Finally, start the Flutter Driver <code>flutter drive --driver=test_driver/perf_test.dart --use-existing-app=http://127.0.0.1:NNNNN/</code> (where NNNNN is the port that gives you the flutter launch of the application above). </li></ul><br><h1 id="metriki">  Metrics </h1><br><p>  It is better to look at as many metrics as possible, but I decided that some are more useful than others. </p><br><ul><li><p>  Assembly time and rasterization time (metrics that are provided by default using <code>TimelineSummary</code> ) are only useful for really hard benchmarks that do not include much more than creating a user interface. </p><br></li><li><p>  Do not consider <code>TimelineSummary.frameCount</code> as a way to calculate frames per second (FPS).  Flutter profiling tools do not provide real frame rate information.  <code>TimelineSummary</code> provides the <code>countFrames()</code> method, but it only counts the number of completed frame assemblies.  A well-optimized application that restricts unnecessary rebuilds (updates) will have a smaller FPS than a non-optimized application that rebuilds frequently. </p><br></li><li><p>  Personally, I get the most useful data by measuring the total CPU time spent executing the Dart code.  This counts the code executed both in your <code>build</code> methods and outside of them.  Assuming that you run profiling tests on a device with a scale lock, the total CPU time can be considered a good approximation to how much more / less battery your application will consume. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bca/5e4/cf8/bca5e4cf8e41dc0fbb7a314de92ef507.png"></p><br></li><li><p>  The easiest way to find out the total CPU time spent executing the Dart code is to estimate the number of <code>MessageLoop:FlushTasks</code> events on the timeline.  For Developer Quest, I wrote <a href="">a Dart tool</a> to extract them. </p><br></li><li><p>  To detect junk (trash) (i.e. missing frames), look for extremes.  For example, for the particular case of Developer Quest and the device on which we tested, it is useful to look at the build time of the 95th percentile.  (The build time of the 90th percentile was too similar, even if you compare the code with completely different levels of efficiency, and the numbers of the 99th percentile are usually noisy. Your indicators may differ.) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/496/e74/50c/496e7450c256ea47b319c66b7faea88d.png"></p><br></li><li><p>  As mentioned above, test each version of your application several (possibly 100) times.  Then use the mean or percentile data with error fields.  Better yet, use span diagrams. </p><br></li></ul><br><h1 id="rezultaty">  results </h1><br><p>  After setup you can confidently compare commits and conduct experiments.  Below you can see the answer to the common dilemma: ‚ÄúIs this optimization of service costs worth it?‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/2c7/0e0/6e72c70e0077c95ce8d68abe26d886f5.png"></p><br><p>  I think that in <em>this particular</em> case the answer is yes.  Thanks to just a few lines of code, each automated passage of our application takes on average 12% less processor time. </p><br><p>  But - and this is the main message of this article - measurements of another optimization may show something completely different.  It is tempting, but it is wrong to try to extrapolate a measurement of productivity too broadly. </p><br><p>  In other words: "how lucky".  And we must come to terms with it. </p></div>
