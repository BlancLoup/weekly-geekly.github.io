This time the best projects were determined not by me, but by you.  This means that the rating has become much more objective and competent than it was before. <br><br>  Among the best startups of March are an educational social network, file transfer ‚Äúat once‚Äù, services for storing and online demonstration of resumes and business cards, as well as <s>your own hacker with blackjack and whores</s> , habra-like team blog about hardware. <br><br>  Meanwhile, it is already possible to declare your projects in a similar vote for the right to become the best start-up of April - <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/startup/add/">startuppoint.ru/startup/add</a>

The customer can upload their projects and take the pushers on them.  But, in turn, the pushers can lay out their project (start-up), and the interested customer can invest it. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Soloviev (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúIn our opinion, there are two main projects that can be compared with Pushidea.</i>  <i>This is an e-generator and free-lance.</i>  <i>The process of placing an order distinguishes us from free-lance, i.e.</i>  <i>The customer is not required to make a choice of the performer of his order, studying his portfolio, he selects from ready-made solutions to his task, proposed by the performers (this we have tried to make life easier for the potential customer).</i>  <i>And the main difference from the e-generator is the possibility of placing ideas for finding sponsorship or sales, as well as access to all site content, including the ideas of the authors, without any payment whatsoever.</i>  <i>At the end of the year we plan to bring site traffic to at least 1000 thousand unique visitors per day. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h3>  9th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.tvepisodes.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cb/054/5bd/8cb0545bd1336f54a091a5ecb5b75505.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tvepisodes.ru/">www.tvepisodes.ru</a> <br><br>  TvEpisodes.ru - a project that aims to help fans of Western TV shows and sitcoms.  If earlier you had to constantly press the button to update on Lostfilm or Novafilm, in anticipation of what time the new series will be posted today, then now you just need to subscribe to the series you are interested in.  And you will be notified of the release of a new series. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Mitroshin (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúOur service helps fans of popular television series to receive new series with translation into Russian, immediately after their appearance (usually the translation release date is unknown). There are similar services that notify on episodes in English (release dates broadcast usually known in advance).</i>  <i>We now have 3,000 followers.</i>  <i>We don‚Äôt think for a long time, today hundreds of thousands of users are watching TV shows on the Internet, all of them are our potential subscribers.</i>  <i>However, at the moment we do not plan to use TV Episodes for profit ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h3>  8th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.zpmer.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/3a6/470/e6d3a6470e7be401777e1670591412d4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.zpmer.ru/">www.zpmer.ru</a> <br><br>  In a crisis, many people have to think about changing jobs, some have to do it after being fired.  In finding a new place, one of the key factors is salary.  Now, before you go on an interview, you can find out how much the average pay is now in your position, and how much on average the employees of the company you are going to receive. <br><br>  <b>Andrei Anchenko (Project Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúOur service is designed equally for both hired employees and employers.</i>  <i>Both categories of our potential users will be able to benefit from it.</i>  <i>Employees - when assessing their position in their firm, or in the labor market as a whole.</i>  <i>Yes, take at least another interview - a person will be more confident to answer one of the main questions: ‚Äúhow much do you want to receive?‚Äù If he previously found information about a potential employer on our service.</i>  <i>On the day we have about 200 users.</i>  <i>By the end of the year, we plan to reach 20000-50000 visits per day.</i>  <i>Everything will depend, including on the further development of the crisis and the situation with dismissals.</i>  <i>The core business model is the provision of additional, expanded services for employees and employers by subscription.</i>  <i>Advertising model is considered by us as an auxiliary "</i> <br><br><br><h3>  7th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.2torrents.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a51/17c/758/a5117c7584450f7d6784126523babf22.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.2torrents.ru/">www.2torrents.ru</a> <br>  2torrents.ru is a search engine for torrents.  Many of you will object that with the same success you can use the search on torrents.ru, as on the largest tracker in Russia.  But alas, torrents.ru has increasingly begun to close distributions, and there are such files that you cannot find there, in this case, you can turn your eyes to the project being described and try to find this file with it. <br><br>  <b>Artyom Smirnov (Project Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúThere are already more than 200 large torrent trackers already in one Runet, and Russian torrent trackers are apparently not interesting to foreign torrent search engines.</i>  <i>So I had to search for something rare to jump from one site to another.</i>  <i>We decided to stop this outrage by creating a site 2torrents.ru.</i>  <i>Receiving feedback on our work and the natural increase in visitors, we see that our project is needed!</i>  <i>Now we continue to work on increasing the number of torrent trackers, improving indexing and searching mechanisms, developing plugins and templates for various bittorrent clients and browsers.</i>  <i>At the moment, site traffic is ~ 3,500 users per day.</i>  <i>By the end of the year we plan to reach 50,000 per day. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h3>  6th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.honto.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c15/5eb/14a/c155eb14a10bbfbdc69ac0d098eb4591.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.honto.ru/">www.honto.ru</a> <br><br>  Honto is Habr for iron lovers.  Here you can discuss any part of the computer technology.  Read announcements and comparisons.  Learn about the hardware from the mouth of its owner.  And also read and discuss the latest news from the world of Hardware. <br><br><br><h3>  5th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.russiancreators.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bc/70a/a61/7bc70aa6173e8fe320a493f1f5f660fe.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.russiancreators.ru/">www.russiancreators.ru</a> <br><br>  Russian Creators is a social network for people of creative professions.  Users are given a number of useful functions - convenient publication of their portfolio, demonstration of projects, placement of job offers, search for orders, creation of communities.  Also on the project are interviews with outstanding people from the field of creativity, announcements of upcoming events. <br><br>  <b>Ilya Plotnikov and Alexandra Zakharova (Founders of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúWe expect success in the niche of a remote labor exchange thanks to the technical implementation of services, since at the moment this is a new level and a new level among sites in this category.</i>  <i>In the niche of information resources, we will try to achieve success due to a wider coverage of topics and their deeper coverage.</i>  <i>The number of registered authors currently exceeds 400 people and is increasing every day.</i>  <i>In the coming months, a large-scale modernization of the project is planned: the opening of new sections, improved navigation, a mechanism for creating projects. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><br><h3>  4th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.moiavizitka.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a4/eda/b7f/5a4edab7fc1fad96cbf14f7ecba0fd32.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.moiavizitka.ru/">www.moiavizitka.ru</a> <br><br>  With the help of the project "My business card" you can forget about offline business card holders.  Having created your electronic business card, and setting up its design, you will be able to give your partners just a link to it.  In addition, you can store electronic business cards of your partners and acquaintances in your virtual business card holder, and have access to them from anywhere in the world. <br><br>  <b>Artod (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúBusiness</i> <b>Card</b> <i>Designer allows you to create any design for your business card.</i>  <i>Most analogues have no such possibility.</i>  <i>The site does not have any business card catalog.</i>  <i>The business card is available only to those who know the address MoiaVizitka.ru/Vash_Login.</i>  <i>The project will be successful due to the possibility for users to have their business card online.</i>  <i>By the end of the year, we plan to reach 20,000 unique visitors per day.</i>  <i>This will be possible due to the viral effect, when users will distribute their online business cards to friends or business partners.</i>  <i>In addition, we are planning to roll out the project for decent attendance and sell it to a specialized organization that manufactures business cards and other printed materials. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h3>  3rd place </h3><a href="http://www.getcv.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d30/e82/b04/d30e82b041532bd2977d633f71419883.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.getcv.ru/">www.getcv.ru</a> <a href="http://www.getcv.ru/"><br></a> <br>  Getcv is a project that will allow you to no longer send your CV to every employer.  By filling out your resume on the site, you can simply give employers a link to your resume.  From the advantages of the project - well-structured information, statistics of references to your resume and easy conversion to pdf-format, if you still need it. <br><br>  <b>p_r_i_m_a_t (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúOf course, summaries can (and should) be placed on specialized sites, but for mailing it is not always convenient - some require registration for viewing, almost all are overloaded with advertising and other unnecessary information‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h3>  2nd place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.jetbytes.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b55/085/0a6/b550850a60a3eb0f80344e8145d8c5d2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.jetbytes.com/">www.jetbytes.com</a> <br><br>  Jetbytes is ‚ÄúBurn after reading‚Äù in its manners.  More seriously, this is an experimental web file transfer service.  Its innovation is that the file you uploaded is stored until the first opening by another user.  You upload a file, a special link is generated for you - you transfer it to the recipient, it downloads the file, then the file is deleted. <br><br>  <b>FloppyFormator (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúThe project implements an original idea and is practically useful.</i>  <i>The niche is extremely small, there are almost no analogues (they will probably appear soon - I have already seen applications for freelance sites).</i>  <i>The business model has not yet been fully developed, the goal for the near future is to keep on the threshold of self-sufficiency, which so far has been successfully achieved.</i>  <i>Now the service serves about 2000 people per day, passing about 50 GB of traffic through itself.</i>  <i>Predictions - what forecasts can there be?</i>  <i>The crisis in the yard :) "</i> <br><br><br><h3>  1 place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.scribbler.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/087/ffe/b5e/087ffeb5ec56a419026296b35e9b9e69.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.scribbler.ru/">www.scribbler.ru</a> <br>  Scribbler is a youth social network that is designed to help students learn.  With this project, student groups, and even entire faculties and streams can more effectively interact.  Quickly find out about changes in schedules.  Conveniently, interactively conduct joint projects.  Learn about additional training events: conferences, workshops, meetings with interesting people.  Exchange cheat sheets, scans of lectures, and simply discuss just past exams or new teachers. <br><br>  <b>Stas Tushinsky (Project Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúThe project will be successful due to the fact that we offer a real solution to a specific problem, namely, we offer the necessary tools to simplify the educational process.</i>  <i>None of the existing Russian networks are created for joint study or work, they are all aimed at communicating and maintaining contact.</i>  <i>In the West, these problems are solved at the level of universities, where their local learning networks are created, but even those solve the problem of receiving information from the top down, but not horizontally.</i>  <i>Now we have more than 2 thousand users.</i>  <i>We expect to see figures of 400 thousand users by the end of the year. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h4>  Other startups Martha: </h4><br>  Multifunctional user rating - <a href="http://www.in-rating.ru/">www.in-rating.ru</a> <br>  Site for conducting holivarov - <a href="http://www.pospo.ru/">www.pospo.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56540/</a></p>
