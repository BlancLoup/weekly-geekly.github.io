A company with a really rich history.  I have more or less closely followed its activities since its inception, that is, since 2008.  But now, when I began to poke around in this matter with special care (for writing this post), I realized that earlier I was following the company's novelties namely ‚Äúmore or less‚Äù, that is, not very carefully.  Because offhand, I could remember 10-15 pieces of pocketbooks, and there were more than 30 of them - PocketBook is the leader in the number of models released in the entire history of the reader market, no one else, nor any other manufacturer from this segment.  And this, I emphasize, only devices with E Ink screens, that is, on electronic ink.  Models with TFT displays will be left behind the brackets this time - yet the key direction for PocketBook development has always been the E Ink screen readers.  And the company has achieved in this field, I‚Äôm not afraid of such a big word, of huge success: it was PocketBook that actually formed the market of readers in Russia in 2008-2009.  And from its very inception essentially led it.  And he continues to sit on the top of all these years right up to today - with a mass of curious models and a market share of about 70%.  However, the mass of models, and the proportion of 70% - all this will be later. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0e/787/0ec/d0e7870eca304df993a16fda86d0c230.jpg"></div><br>  In the meantime, let's imagine that in the yard ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>2008</b> </h2><br>  That year, PocketBook entered the reader market.  The company's firstborn, the <b>PocketBook 301</b> model, became a real hit: in two years or more, by the end of 2010, more than 100,000 copies of the device were sold in Russia alone.  Given that the entire volume of the Russian market of book readers for these three years (2008, 2009, 2010) was estimated by analysts to be less than one million.  That is, PocketBook 301 - just one model, for a minute - in terms of sales, it took more than 10% of the total domestic reader market.  Thus, PocketBook 301 has become the most popular reader in Russia in the history of this class of gadgets.  And to break the record in the future, no other model failed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3b/3fa/44e/f3b3fa44ec504faf99a8b59929870c14.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 301 - reader with record sales.</i>  <i>Offered in several versions.</i>  <i>Some went with a memory card and a cover, and some had a minimum grade</i>

      We will not hide: there were certain claims to PocketBook 301.  In particular, individual users complained about the unreliability of E Ink.  Like, almost a finger hit him - and he took and broke.  (And the replacement of the display at that time cost about 70% of the price of the new reader - and it was easier to buy a new reader than to change the screen.) This really was the case, but the blame should not be PocketBook, but the company E Ink, the manufacturer of similar displays.  Its development of the time really did not differ in reliability.  And users blamed PocketBook only because of the popularity of the PocketBook 301 model, although the problem with the ‚Äúbattle‚Äù of the screens was absolutely for all reader brands.  If, say, Samsung sells a million smartphones, of which 1% will be defective, then theoretically 10 thousand users can write about it on the Internet.  But HTC, for example, will sell 100 thousand smartphones, and the level of marriage it will be exactly the same - 1%.  How many people can face it (marriage)?  That's right, a thousand.  In the same way with the PocketBook 301: this model was sold many times better than others, and therefore the noise on the Internet due to problems with the displays of this particular model was much more than about other brands. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/add/201/242/add2012428c7455aa64b4d4047c2de46.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 301 was available even in glamorous pink colors - 7 years before the iPhone 6s!</i> <br><br>  Anyway, PocketBook 301 still continued to buy almost avidly.  Because, first, this reading room had the most thoughtful software - one support for 12 book formats was worth it.  By the way, in the future the quantity has grown to a maximum for the market - as much as 18;  and that's against Kindle 6 and 10-12 for most other competitors. <br><br>  The software design of the PocketBook 301 model is a consequence of the presence in the PocketBook team of the backbone of programmers from the countries of the former USSR, namely from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus.  They perfectly understood and understand the domestic realities - for example, the need for support by the reader FB2, the most popular book format in the CIS.  In Amazon, for example, they don‚Äôt see any point in supporting FB2, because they don‚Äôt care about Russian realities.  Secondly, PocketBook 301 as a whole was a high-quality, complete product without obvious ‚Äújambs‚Äù.  This is very important, since it was then, in 2008‚Äì2009, that a ‚Äúreader boom‚Äù began in Russia, and everything from China began to carry reading rooms.  And most of them brought that slag that-it was painful to watch.  PocketBook, on the contrary, set a very high level of quality.  That, in fact, led to an avalanche-like growth in sales of the first model, and then to leadership: by 2011 PocketBook already controlled about 40% of the market of electronic readers.  By 2016, the share of PocketBook on the Russian reader market has increased, almost to 70%. <br><br><h2>  <b>year 2009</b> </h2><br>  This year, the PocketBook has already released two new readers.  The first was the model <b>PocketBook 360</b> .  In the case of PocketBook 301, they took the finished development of Netronix (in particular, the case and hardware) and, after thoroughly finishing it from the software and engineering points of view, got the PocketBook 301 itself. But the PocketBook 360 is a completely authentic development - the model was made from scratch, since 2009, Pocket has acquired its own fully formed team of hardware engineers.  This was the key difference between PocketBook and all the players of the Russian reader market at the time: they brought devices with their own logo from China (in 99% of cases, the devices were crooked, skewed and low-quality), but the PocketBook has since trusted the Asians only.  The development of the devices was carried out up to now, that is, up to the present moment, is conducted by the specialists of the company. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/746/d74/86d746d7459745f0a7572f767ee0d147.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 360 - the first reader in the world, developed according to the wishes of consumers.</i>  <i>It was completed with a cover to protect the screen</i> <br><br>  PocketBook engineers created a theme on the-ebook.org Russian forum and collected user suggestions for three months - the latter thought and wrote what they would like to see in the new reader model.  The result was PocketBook 360 - the first and so far the only reader in the world, entirely created on the basis of the wishes of ordinary people.  The model was made compact, 5-inch, plus they implemented a number of extremely unusual for that time chips.  For example, a plastic cover for the screen - it protected the display from various items in bags, pockets and backpacks.  And in the PocketBook 360 for the first time (in the case of readers, of course) a gyroscope was implemented: the image on the screen automatically rotated depending on the position of the reader in space.  Hence, in fact, the number 360 in the title.  Plus, the design of the PocketBook 360 was very pleasant: in general, the reading rooms of that time looked scary, but this model could be called pretty - including thanks to the pattern on the protective cover.  This reader was eagerly bought by the girls, who, in addition to the design that was pleasing, were attracted by the compactness of the PocketBook 360 - the reader could easily fit even into a miniature handbag. <br><br>  The second new product of 2009 is <b>PocketBook 302 Cookie</b> .  It‚Äôs also an innovative reader in many respects: it became the first touch-screen package (albeit a resistive one ‚Äî that is, not very convenient).  In addition, PocketBook 302 Cookie immediately offered five options for downloading books to memory: from the Internet via Wi-Fi (it was a simple browser), from a computer or smartphone via Bluetooth, from a computer using a cable, as well as via a MicroSD card and using USB flash drives.  Most of these methods were later abandoned: the Internet has become faster and more accessible, and MicroSD is now no more expensive than ordinary USB flash drives.  So Bluetooth and USB host are no longer needed.  But then, in 2009, PocketBook 302 Cookie in terms of convenience and technology tore all competitors almost to shreds. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7db/746/5ef/7db7465ef97547cab89340eb81581e43.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 301 Cookie could be controlled with both fingers and a stylus.</i>  <i>But the pen reader listened better, given the resistive touchscreen technology</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>2010</b> </h2><br>  This year has become very successful for PocketBook - in the sense that the company has released a whole galaxy of successful models.  Namely, the Pro line, which included <b>PocketBook Pro 602, 603, 902</b> and <b>903</b> .  All of these models were made in factories Foxconn - Taiwanese company that assembles the iPhone, iPad and other Apple products. <br><br>  PocketBook Pro 603 and 903 models have become the world's first readers with a full smartphone set of wireless modules - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G.  Yes, yes, it was possible to insert a SIM-card into the reader and then buy e-books in the company‚Äôs PocketBook store, BookLand (which, by the way, has since been pre-installed into all PocketBook readers with access to the Web).  Well, just to surf the Internet through the browser, too, no one forbade.  Actually, why was 3G needed if the readers supported Wi-Fi?  Well, today Wi-Fi is almost in every first cafe and even in buses and subways, but then, in 2010, with free networks everything was a bit more complicated.  And to ensure constant and uninterrupted access to the Internet, 3G was indispensable.  Later, with the final popularization of Wi-Fi, PocketBook from 3G modems in the readers completely refused. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ef/40f/d54/1ef40fd54799479ea5952cd51647d5fc.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The package of PocketBook Pro 603 and 903 left pen.</i>  <i>The models looked the same, unless, of course, we take into account the dimensions.</i>  <i>In the picture - PocketBook Pro 603.</i> <br><br>  Also PocketBook Pro 603 and 903 received inductive touch screens - with support for stylus control.  Such displays did not react to the fingers, but the pen presses were processed much more accurately than the PocketBook 302 Cookie with its resistive screen.  Well, here, perhaps, I would say that PocketBook Pro 902 and 903 were the company's first readers in a large-format 9.7-inch form factor.  Such a hefty reader with high resolution (1200 x 825 pixels) for technical and scientific literature, which, due to the presence of a heap of small characters, requires just large screens. <br><br>  PocketBook Pro 602 and 902 did not have touch screens and 3G modems.  Otherwise, they did not differ from their more expensive counterparts - PocketBook Pro 603 and 903, respectively. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e36/6db/71f/e366db71fe994a5396e44e6af111a14a.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Well, this is PocketBook Pro 902. Model PocketBook Pro 602 looks the same, only smaller</i> <br><br>  All models of the Pro-series have rear panels made of magnesium-aluminum alloy: this significantly increased the rigidity of the cases for torsion and, as a result, almost completely solved the problem of cracked E Ink screens, which occurred in the early models of the company.  However, the solution with the above-mentioned alloy was temporary: 6-inch PocketBook Pro 602 and 603 weighed 255 and 280 g, respectively.  That for models in such a form factor is quite a lot: today 6-inch diagonal billboards weigh about 180 g. In general, steps were required from E Ink, which was supposed to increase the reliability of its screens.  However, E Ink will only do this in a year. <br><br>  It is worth noting the presence in the PocketBook Pro 602, 603, 902 and 903 of a number of audio features.  If ordinary MP3 players were also in PocketBook 301 and PocketBook 301 Cookies, then ‚Äúproshki‚Äù also received the ability to play text by voice - the Text-to-Speech function.  That is, ordinary books by the software of the reader could turn into audiobooks, which previously no single reader of any other manufacturer could do. <br><br>  And in PocketBook Pro 602, 603, 902 and 903 for the first time (and not only for PocketBook models, but also for the reader market as a whole), ABBYY dictionaries and a number of other manufacturers appeared, which are still used in all PocketBook models.  The principle of operation of the dictionaries is as follows: you highlight a word in the text - and immediately receive a translation.  Later, this implementation became the standard for the reader market, and it was gladly ‚Äúripped off‚Äù by dozens of other companies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ca/de9/122/8cade9122fc8482dbf8ab224526d807c.jpg"></div><br>  Back in 2010, the first wave of attempts to introduce readers into schools as electronic textbooks began.  Anatoly Chubais himself <a href="http://a-chubais.livejournal.com/41069.html">compared</a> in his blog the reader Plastic Logic 100 from RUSNANO with PocketBook Pro 902 - they say, let's see which one is better suited for the needs of education.  Of course, Anatoly Borisovich won his native Rosnan Plastic Logic.  However, the Plastic Logic 100 project eventually died, and was not born, but PocketBook readers ‚Äî however, models 903, not 902 ‚Äî were successfully implemented in a number of schools in Russia and Ukraine.  Then, in 2010, a prototype reader for schools <b>PocketBook 901</b> was created.  It was originally created for educational institutions, that is, from scratch, it was not based on any other reader.  PocketBook believed that it was better for schools to create a separate product, but the success of the implementations in schools of PocketBook Pro 903 showed that it is quite possible to do without a completely new model in the face of PocketBook 901.  Therefore, massively this model, alas, was not released. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e97/3e9/d90/e973e9d90572470a8a5e03d902e1cd72.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 901 occasionally met in stores, although they didn‚Äôt start mass production of this model</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>2011</b> </h2><br>  2011 was, so to speak, a year of evolution: PocketBook offered just one radically new model, plus a good update of the old ones.  For example, <b>PocketBook 360 Plus has</b> replaced the legendary PocketBook 360: the processor frequency has increased from 400 to 533 MHz, and Wi-Fi support has been added.  On this updated reader, for the sake of demonstrating the power of iron, they even launched Doom II - for the first time on devices with E Ink screens, a game with such 3D graphics was launched: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOPZrVsCEHg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b92/add/929/b92add929bed41e7838b78f24f49098b.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 360 Plus has become faster than its predecessor and has learned to go online and also play Doom II</i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook Pro 612</b> and <b>912</b> models are a cross between 602/603 and 902/903, respectively.  PocketBook Pro 612 and 912 have lost 3G modems, but the inductive touchscreens remain in them.  PocketBook Pro 912 was also released in the Education version - with an electronic diary and other applications necessary for the school.  The model also experienced a number of successful implementations in educational institutions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d6/98c/853/5d698c85394d43e1b6815d7ab8981ce3.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The new line of "proshki" included only two models - PocketBook Pro 612 and 912. Both with touch screens, but without 3G modems</i> <br><br>  Well, a radically new model in 2011 was the <b>PocketBook 611 Basic</b> .  It was the first time that new E Ink screens were used in it - with the same image quality as before, but less fragile.  This made it possible to abandon the protective covers and metal in the enclosures.  Therefore, the 6-inch PocketBook 611 Basic weighed only 175 g - as much as 80 g less than the same PocketBook Pro 602. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6c/179/2f0/a6c1792f0f174fc79ec7cdcbb26c9130.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 611 Basic has become the first reader with an improved E Ink screen - not in terms of image quality, but in terms of reliability.</i>  <i>This allowed for a lightweight plastic case.</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>year 2012</b> </h2><br>  What did PocketBook do this year?  First, they made PocketBook 611 Basic cheaper - the <b>PocketBook 613 Basic New</b> model was released.  The essence is the same, but with minor improvements in the software and without Wi-Fi support. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afb/512/ba8/afb512ba82884a69a0e1c9bc34f2b1fe.jpg"></div><br>  <i>No Wi-Fi, a slightly different form of buttons - that's all the changes compared to PocketBook 611 Basic</i> <br><br>  Another update has undergone and PocketBook 360: PocketBook 360 Plus version was turned into <b>PocketBook 360 Plus New</b> .  Innovation - overclocked to 800 MHz processor, which also found application in PocketBook 611 Basic, PocketBook 613 Basic New and PocketBook 622 Touch. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a49/535/d7f/a49535d7ffc24042a7f3afb3ff74750d.jpg"></div><br>  <i>A faster processor is the only significant difference between the PocketBook 360 Plus New and the previous version called PocketBook 360 Plus.</i> <br><br>  Actually, <b>PocketBook 622 Touch</b> is the third and most important novelty of 2012.  This model was the first poketbukom screen E Ink Pearl and the first - with a capacitive touchscreen and support multitouch.  That is, the text could be scaled by pin-pinning, which is very convenient.  Just like on the iPad.  The case of the PocketBook 622 Touch is plastic, as is the case with the Basic series models - due to the increased reliability of the E Ink screens and the competent design of the cases from the PocketBook side, the problem of ‚Äúcombat‚Äù of displays began to appear rarely.  Among other features of the PocketBook 622 Touch is the support of Wi-Fi, an MP3 player, Text-to-Speech, and a new design that has become classic, which is still used with minimal edits. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/922/0f1/e139220f19334472bf81b46998e659d1.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 622 Touch was the first among the PocketBooks to receive the E Ink Pearl screen.</i>  <i>Plus, he got the design, which later became a classic for most of the company's 6-inch sensor readers.</i> <br><br>  It is also worth remembering about the first of its kind service for bibliophiles ReadRate - its first test version was launched in 2012 (the final one in 2014).  It allows people to talk about recently read books and publications that they only plan to meet, as well as to learn about the book preferences of their friends.  In addition, the function of "likes" and comments, as well as integration with other social networks.  By the end of 2016, ReadRate has about 160 thousand users - this is not very much compared to VKontakte and some Odnoklassniki, where millions go by, and still quite a lot to find a good book for yourself. <br><br><h2>  <b>year 2013</b> </h2><br>  This year was extremely fruitful.  Firstly, it is worth noting the fact that PocketBook has begun to massively use E Ink Pearl screens in its devices - brighter, clearer and generally better.  In all the models described above, except for PocketBook 622 Touch, the E Ink Vizplex screens were installed - they were quite good for their time (better than the same Sipix), but they give Pearl at least in definition of the image. <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 623 Touch 2</b> received not just the E Ink Pearl screen (800 x 600 pixels), but the Pearl HD (1024 x 758 pixels).  And the backlight system - for the first time for Pocketbooks.  Plus, synchronization with Drobpox appeared: you throw a book on the computer into a folder - and it appears in the reader after a minute.  In general, the flagship of the 2013 model.  Moreover, the model is relevant to this day - for example, the author of this text is still using PocketBook 623 Touch 2. And it is not going to change it for anything.  Just because the reader is not a tablet, the readers do not lose their relevance after a year, or two, or five.  Reducing the capacity of the battery does not make them worse (well, the reader worked for a month, and then three weeks sal - is the difference great?), And the display quality of the books does not change with time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/d97/139/7a7d971396e54eb483585515e68076f8.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 623 Touch 2 - the first backlit with the backlight and the first with the E Ink Pearl HD screen</i> <br><br>  The <b>PocketBook 624 Basic Touch</b> model is also released in 2013.  By design, it is similar to the PocketBook 623 Touch 2, but there is no backlight and MP3-player embracing Text-to-Speech - for the sake of lower prices.  Well, the screen has a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels, not 1024 x 758. That is, the PocketBook 624 Basic Touch 2 had the usual Pearl, not the Pearl HD.  But the hardware platform is slightly more powerful: the processor frequency was raised from 800 MHz to 1 GHz. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b3/257/c8b/6b3257c8b8b247f39b70ebaaddb056ef.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 624 Basic Touch 2: a familiar design and simpler stuffing than the PocketBook 623 Touch 2</i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 614 Basic 2</b> is the ‚Äúcontinuer‚Äù of PocketBook 613 Basic New: the design was slightly changed, the Vizplex screen was replaced with a more modern Pearl, and the memory became 4 GB instead of 2 GB.  That's all the differences from its predecessor. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/032/9df/98d/0329df98d1c84c81baadfc5677beb6f0.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Another budget Pocketbook - with a good screen and no frills</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>PocketBook 515 Mini</b> is the first completely new 5-inch reader since PocketBook 360. That is, the developers decided not to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the PocketBook 360 once again, but to develop a compact reader from scratch.  It turned out not bad, considering the low price, but, as they say, with trade-offs: there is no slot for memory cards, the screen of the previous generation is E Ink Vizplex.  But the color "sea wave" with an orange joystick pleased: usually readers are gray, white or black, and this version stands out against the general background. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/796/3bc/840/7963bc840d464dde8ef4063f2b5844b2.jpg"></div><br>  <i>PocketBook 515 is currently the latest 5-inch pocketbook</i> <br><br>  Not in 2013, without three unusual models.  You can even say "experimental."  The first is the <b>PocketBook Cad Reader</b> with a 13.3-inch E Ink Fina touchscreen, the model was shown at the Autodesk University 2013 conference in the USA.  These displays were designed to ‚Äúcombine the advantages of TFT and E Ink.  There are no other details: apparently, E Ink did something wrong, and now Fina screens on the official website of this company are not even mentioned.  According to some reports, PocketBook tests have shown that the Fina large screens - just with a 13.3-inch diagonal - are not very reliable.  Therefore, the project turned.  But in general, PocketBook Cad Reader could be a very interesting product - it was assumed that this professional model will be used by architects, engineers and builders.  She worked on the basis of Android and allowed to run AutoCAD. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/0d2/545/7290d254598f4f6e9869973986597c20.jpg"></div><br> <i>PocketBook Cad Reader      ‚Äì  .  -   Fina (     E Ink)    </i> <br><br>    ‚Äì <b>PocketBook 801 ColorLux</b> ‚Äì     .
