For the impatient, the calling card of the event: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p-/dk/5i/p-dk5ivare5gqhl8p7bgwhlyie8.png"></p><br><p>  But first, I want to tell one story.  Usually such stories-prefaces are very boring, I know, but still - listen.  She will help you decide whether to go to this conference. </p><br><p>  It so happened that I have many friends at the age of about 25 years.  They all sincerely believe that they will not live to 30, and ask - well, how is it there, on the other side?  They also ask how to become a real programmer ( <em>whatever that means</em> ).  And also - whether to go to the conference.  I answer: so far it is wonderful here, it is possible and necessary to become a successful developer, and to explain it I have three stories. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Let's get acquainted.  My name is Oleg, I am 31 years old, born, live and work in Novosibirsk.  Most recently, he worked as a Java architect in a large company, and now joined the JUG.ru Group team and organize conferences with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/23derevo/" class="user_link">23derevo</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/arg89/" class="user_link">ARG89</a> and other people you know about Habra.  This work is perceived absolutely not as work, but as some kind of sacred mission - this will be further. </p><br><h1 id="tri-istorii">  Three stories </h1><br><p>  <strong>The first story</strong> begins somewhere in school.  My parents had a very specific idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmy future: I had to become an artist, an architect, or something like that ‚Äî like themselves.  I had to draw a lot, go to special clubs, prepare for admission to the Novosibirsk State Academy of Architecture and Art (NGUADI / NGAHA) and so on.  This line of development was severely broken by a meeting with the <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/">Computerra</a> magazine, which clearly showed that with the help of program code one can draw much more beautiful pictures.  However, the ability to draw and knowledge of the basic categories of composition, understanding how a beautiful product looks, burned in the brain forever. </p><br><p>  <strong>The second story</strong> began immediately after entering the NGU, and more precisely, an epic departure from it due to the undelivered exam in physics.  By that time, her father had died, and her mother would have to give all the money she earned as a school art teacher to pay for a uni.  I could not accept such a sacrifice, and instead just went to work. </p><br><p>  Initially it was Delphi, but with the release of Delphi 8, it became clear: the platform would soon end, and we had to run at a breakneck pace, no matter where. </p><br><p>  Then there was a long shameful period when I modeled a DLL in C ++, connecting them to the web interface in Delphi.  It worked poorly, I threw in a couple of projects and lost a few friends with whom we did these projects.  Probably everybody ever piled up projects through their own fault and they know this bitterness and shame.  I had to quit programming and go to the sysadmins.  At this second story stops temporarily. </p><br><p>  <strong>The third story is</strong> about the fact that any developer at least sometimes presents himself as a great leader.  At first, I went to the system administrators, clearly realizing that the sysadmin of a small company is the second person after the director.  Then I made websites (at first it was very bad, then it got better and better - as I mastered Photoshop and Korela) - first one, then I started sharing my work with friends.  It quickly became clear that in the face of tough competition, the easiest thing to do is not all the work, but only to help other developers to do very complex things.  And the most difficult thing is, of course, backend programming. </p><br><h1 id="soedinyaem-tochki">  Connect the dots </h1><br><p>  And now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DD1R-jKKp3NA">as old Jobs used to say</a> , it's time to connect the dots.  The ability to program led to the first job by a Java developer at Axmor (a company in Akademgorodok) under the authority of Andrei Kanonirov.  The ability to communicate with the business and produce visually beautiful products helped to quickly jump to the position of lead developer with his own team (already in another company), then - product manager, and, skipping a few more projects, managed to climb the mountain, up to the position of architect in Sbertech . </p><br><p>  <strong>Each of these jumps occurred with the growth of either salary, or interestingness of the project, or some other goodies</strong> .  Each of them was very painful - when I was in control for a year and did not write code, it‚Äôs very difficult for an interview to remember ‚Äúhow many methods does ArrayList have‚Äù.  Conversely, when the year kodil one focused topic, it is very difficult to switch to multitasking from dozens of tasks and drawing up an annual plan (Agile? What is Agile?). </p><br><p>  One of the most important things that helped me to make these jumps the least painful is books and educational videos on YouTube.  Let me explain for YouTube: when you are a Java Junior with a salary of 15 thousand rubles, you can‚Äôt go to real conferences - there‚Äôs hardly enough money to devour.  When you work ‚Äúfor the idea‚Äù and 30 thousand rubles in a state-owned company, you are unlikely to fly to St. Petersburg for a Joker (the main Java conference in Russia), this is simply not enough salary.  Therefore - watching videos on YouTube. </p><br><p>  And it helped a lot.  On the one hand, there were reports containing knowledge unique to Russia (my competitive advantages relative to other Java developers).  On the other hand, they can be applied by more exotic methods.  For example, once I applied a wonderful hack: I compiled several popular reports with the contents of a kookbook on the then-popular Java web framework Wicket and wrote a short training course on YouTube.  When asked at an interview if I knew Wicket, it was enough to show the YouTube channel to get a job.  Rollers deleted, so as not to shame - as I understand now, in vain.  At the last place of work, during centralized testing, the reports of Lyosha Shipilev allowed to solve almost all the tests on the subject of Java Concurrency, which helped a lot in the future. </p><br><p>  The moment came when I, with a pure heart, bought the most expensive (because I missed all possible registration deadlines) a Joker ticket.  With a clear understanding that it was not me who ‚Äúwent broke‚Äù on a ticket, but what exactly Joker brought me here: in such a situation, when I don‚Äôt give a damn how much the ticket costs and how far I have to go by plane.  This is such a special self-sustaining system - the more you invest in it, the greater the return. </p><br><p>  And just recently, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/23derevo/" class="user_link">23derevo</a> offered to join the organization of these conferences.  Did I have any choice?  I just have to make sure that secret knowledge belongs not only to a certain small group of elite corporate programmers, but to all people.  So that every stern Siberian developer, every Novosibirsk and Barnaul has the opportunity to do their projects using the latest technologies or at least have a steep high-paying job, not wallowing in cheap outsourcing and vulgar bodyshop.  Everyone in life has its points, helping to connect them is more than just work.  The result of this mission is the best Java conference in Russia: JBreak, Joker and JPoint. </p><br><h1 id="v-chem-sut-jbreak">  What is the essence of JBreak </h1><br><p>  In my subjective opinion, JBreak 2018: </p><br><ul><li>  solves organizational problems ‚Äî blockers that once prevented me from living and attending conferences personally; </li><li>  embodies a bunch of wishes regarding form and content that are ignored elsewhere. </li></ul><br><h2 id="voprosy-organizacii">  Organization issues </h2><br><ul><li>  <strong>Everything passes right in Novosibirsk</strong> .  Even if you do not care about the cost of a plane ticket, does every employer let you go for a whole week to St. Petersburg on Joker?  Let's take it: a day to fly there and get in the hotel.  Two days of the conference.  Day to go back (4 hours of flight + 4 hours of time zone difference - this is immediately minus the day).  The risk that they will not let you go anywhere in the light of impending deadlines is great.  But JBreak takes place in Novosibirsk, and there is no need to fly anywhere. </li><li>  <strong>It will be a day off</strong> .  Many employers consider conferences nonsense and may well not let you go on a working day.  But JBreak will be held on Sunday, so to hell with all these restrictions.  On Saturday, you can take a break from work, on Sunday, you can visit JBreak and dip into it with your head, and on Monday, you can begin tasks with fresh thoughts and new tools. </li><li>  <strong>If it is difficult to get to Novosibirsk - there is an online broadcast</strong> .  For online there is a <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/tickets">special type of tickets</a> .  By the way, for the Siberian conferences of the JUG.ru Group, an online broadcast is being done for the first time, but this is not an impromptu, the technology has been developed by the older brothers JBreak - Joker and JPoint. </li><li>  Conference participants, of course, will be provided with <strong>videos of all reports</strong> , and very quickly.  If we perceive the conference as a real source of knowledge, then it would be madness to hope to remember so much useful information in one day.  Fortunately, we will have records. </li><li>  <strong>Ticket price is significantly less</strong> than at JPoint and Joker.  Approximately 3 times.  Of course, you need to consider that JBreak is only one day, and JPoint and Joker - two days. </li></ul><br><h2 id="voprosy-soderzhaniya">  Content issues </h2><br><ul><li>  On JBreak there will be not only simple light reports, but also <strong>powerful hardcore</strong> .  Such things that have real value, give a competitive advantage, make gyrus, whatever, move.  Something that is almost never delivered to the rare Novosibirsk Java mitap.  Want to know how to add new intrinsics to the JVM?  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ku4CMKcPbh0">To eat is served</a> .  (Report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5kB4CH_-eKQ%26list%3DPLVe-2wcL84b_iJvIflZu74vcyjezF6Fx9">one of the past JBreak</a> , this will be completely new reports). </li><li>  Among the speakers are not only our compatriots, but also world-famous foreign experts. </li><li>  Among our compatriots are Siberians, with whom it is quite possible to encounter one day on the street.  For example, Nikita Lipsky lives in Novosibirsk and works in Excelsior - these are the same dudes who wrote <a href="https://www.excelsiorjet.com/">their own JVM</a> .  Tagir Valeev also lives in Novosibirsk, works in JetBrains and makes <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/specials/idea/idea.html">the same IDE</a> on which you write your code.  (If you still don‚Äôt write, it‚Äôs worth a try!) So as not to seem like a secret Masonic Novosibirsk lodge, there are people from other places: for example, Alexei Zinoviev is historically from Omsk. </li><li>  The JBreak program committee is also in many ways Siberian.  Most likely, we will write a separate article about the program committee; </li><li>  If you think that speakers are not good enough, and you can make a better report - <strong><a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/cfp/">submit an application</a></strong> , Call For Papers is open! </li><li>  It will be possible to communicate with all speakers in special discussion zones.  Roughly speaking, after the report, each (!) Speaker is sent to a special place, where you can continue to torment him with complex issues.  About this I will write a little lower with a beautiful photo :-) </li><li> JBreak is not a reduced copy of JPoint and Joker, but an independent conference with its own reports.  Now the exact list of reports is still unknown, and perhaps in some ways they will overlap with Joker and JPoint, but in drawing up the program we will fight hard for independence.  If you attended the conference in Novosibirsk, you can fly to St. Petersburg and Moscow and see a lot of new things. </li></ul><br><h1 id="programma">  Program </h1><br><p>  The program is still being formed.  Now only a few reports are known, the information on which is presented below.  In the future, reports will be added (this can be seen <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/talks/">on the official site</a> ) </p><br><h2 id="jdk-9-mission-accomplished-what-next-for-java">  JDK 9, Mission Accomplished: What next for Java? </h2><br><p>  <em>Simon Ritter, Azul Systems</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/14/f6/rn14f6mxus1rr7shkxzbmyrwm7g.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Simon is <a href="https://www.azul.com/">Azul's</a> deputy general manager, who has been in IT business since 1984.  (The author of this habrapost was not born that year).  In 1996, Simon began working on JDK 1.0 at Sun Microsystems, then became an evangelist at Oracle, and now works at Azul, represents Azul at the JCP, and continues to help people deal with Java and other JVM technologies.  It is Java Champion, twice Java Rockstar for JavaOne, and so on and so forth. </p><br><p>  His report will begin with a brief overview of what has been included in Java 9 and how it will help Java developers (and perhaps give them a serious challenge).  JDK 9, including the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), is finally out, and something needs to be done about it. </p><br><p>  Oracle has made some important announcements about the future of JDK and Java EE.  We‚Äôll learn about the expected changes in the frequency of JDK releases, the numbering scheme and the release of binaries under the GPL.  We will also look at the long-term support (LTS) model and what this means for developers and administrators. </p><br><p>  Finally, we will look into the future of the platform.  There are many proposals for improving JDKs (JEPs) and OpenJDK projects like Valhalla, Amber, Metropolis and Loom.  Discuss what it is and how important it is for developers. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="verifikaciya-java-baytkoda-kogda-kak-a-mozhet-otklyuchit">  Java bytecode verification: when, how, and can disable? </h2><br><p>  <em>Nikita <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pjbooms/" class="user_link">pjBooms</a> Lipsky, Excelsior</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/m1/ul/tam1ulzzg7xlistlsjfuc7fj3fs.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Nikita is one of the initiators and managers of the <a href="https://www.excelsiorjet.com/">Excelsior JET</a> project, a certified Java SE implementation developed by Excelsior.  Working on the project since 1997, he participated in the research and development of virtually all components of the product, from the core to the product properties.  In particular, he is one of the authors of OSGI support at the JVM level in Excelsior JET, Java Runtime Slim Down technology (Java SE modularization implemented in Excelsior JET since 2007), both Java bytecode verifiers in Excelsior JET and much more. </p><br><p>  In this report, Nikita will talk about the bytecode verifier.  Today, Java developers are increasingly using libraries to generate Java bytecode in runtime to effectively implement various tricks that are difficult or impossible to express in Java.  But if using the Java language, the javac compiler ensures that the output will be the correct Java bytecode, then going down to the level of the bytecode itself, you often need to independently monitor its correctness.  Otherwise, you will get jlVerifyError when loading the classes you have generated, because the JVM strictly monitors the correctness of the bytecode that it loads by means of the Java bytecode verifier.  Thus, when generating bytecode, it is often not enough for you to simply know the semantics of bytecode instructions, you also need to know how the Java bytecode verifier works, which bytecode it considers correct and which it does not. </p><br><p>  In this report, we will understand what mission in the JVM the bytecode verifier carries, when and how it works, whether it can affect the performance of your application and why it is dangerous to disable it. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="smuzi-ml-vmeste-so-spark-mllib">  Smoothie ML with Spark MLlib </h2><br><p>  <em>Alexey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zaleslaw/" class="user_link">Zaleslaw</a> Zinoviev, EPAM</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/tm/6i/fetm6ine0lld9z1b0d07smmlpwa.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Alexey is the embodiment of Charon.  In Greek mythology, Charon was engaged in transporting the souls of the dead across the River Styx, and Alex carries from Java to Big Data.  Simply put, he is a practicing trainer at EPAM Systems.  He has been friends with Hadoop / Spark and other bi-datas since 2012, forks and pull-ups since 2014, tells since 2015. He especially loves text data and large graphs. </p><br><p>  In the direction of BigData, not only data scientists are needed, tyunyuschie parameters of models from packages in R / Python, but also javista who are able to understand built models, implementing them in Java / Scala, including using Spark MLlib.  With the help of Alexey, we will begin to get acquainted with this most powerful library of distributed machine learning, at the same time discussing the features of using standard machine learning algorithms and data structures in Spark. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="ml-pipelines-v-odnoklassnikah">  ML Pipelines at Odnoklassniki </h2><br><p>  <em>Dmitry Bugaychenko, Mail.ru</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/-a/fa/rh-afagccjaktzth_ebeur7plpk.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Dmitry graduated from St. Petersburg State University in 2004, where he defended his Ph.D. in formal logical methods in 2007. He worked in outsourcing for almost 9 years without losing contact with the university and the academic environment.  Big data analysis in Odnoklassniki became for Dmitry a unique chance to combine theoretical training and a scientific foundation with the development of real, sought-after products.  And he gladly took this chance, having come there five years ago. </p><br><p>  In the framework of Dmitry's report, we will look at the main architecture of the Spark ML machine learning library, as well as the features of its use for solving real problems with processing large amounts of data.  Special attention will be paid to a number of limitations that complicate the use of the library, and we will learn what extensions for standard elements had to be developed in order to circumvent these limitations and fully unleash the potential of massive distributed machine learning.  The work of the standard library and its extensions will be demonstrated on the example of the task of ranking the news feed in the social network Odnoklassniki.  The report will be useful to developers, data engineers and analysts using machine learning methods and a distributed information processing platform. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="effective-enterprise-testing">  Effective enterprise testing </h2><br><p>  <em>Sebastian daschner</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/it/mx/ph/itmxphxfumbvge1ovncr1nt0xlq.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Sebastian works as a Java-consultant, is the author of books and trainer, among other things, engaged in programming with the use of Java (EE).  For example, you might know his book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/architecting-modern-java-ee-applications">Architecting Modern Java EE Applications</a> .  Sebastian participates in JCP and helps shape Java EE standards by participating in groups such as JAX-RS and JSON-P.  For all this, he was awarded the title of Java Champion, Oracle Developer Champion, JavaOne Rockstar, etc.  In addition to Java, Sebastian is engaged in Linux containerization technologies, for example, Docker. </p><br><p>  Now a few words about the report.  Most developers still try to avoid testing topics.  Despite the fact that testing is of great importance for software, the development and maintenance of tests require a certain amount of time and effort, especially when changes in existing functionality cause test scripts to adapt.  Not doing software tests is not a solution.  This raises the question: how can the enterprise tests be performed most effectively and efficiently? </p><br><p>  In this report, we look at what is needed for effective, pragmatic and automated testing of Java EE applications.  We'll see how to maintain fast feedback, substantial coverage and constant development speed.  Most of the time will be devoted to live coding of tests of different scale using different technologies.  We show how containers and orchestration frameworks support efficient enterprise testing.  And especially focus on developing a supported and high-quality test code that requires mastering the basics of mastering software. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h1 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/rm/hx/pfrmhxinbe3lsv9kswsenoy-m2q.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Surely you know the feeling when you raise your hand to ask a question, and the presenter suddenly announces: ‚ÄúThere is time for one question‚Äù - and of course, the choice does not fall on you, but during the break the speaker is hiding behind the doors of the speaker rooms. </p><br><p>  If over the past year you have ever been at our conferences, then you already know that this does not happen with us.  Each report is accompanied by a <strong>discussion area</strong> .  Everybody is delighted with this format: both the participants and the speakers - you can calmly ask specific questions in a special place, the speaker has the opportunity to constructively and thoroughly answer any question, no matter how narrow it is, without thinking about timing or Whether it is interesting to all to listeners. </p><br><p>  It is the discussion zones that answer the question ‚Äúwhy go to conferences, when you can learn everything on the Internet‚Äù.  It's simple: to personally ask your specific question.  Well, at JBreak 2018, all the conditions are created for this: in long breaks, track-guns will lead the speaker into the allocated space with an illustration board, sitting places and the opportunity to grab a cup of coffee.  Now not a single question will drown in timing. </p><br><h1 id="osobennosti-online-translyacii">  Features online broadcast </h1><br><ul><li>  Video in resolution 2560x1440.
