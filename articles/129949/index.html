We are again on the air to continue the description of services and applications for the Samsung Smart TV equipment family, primarily TVs.  As promised in the first part of the material, this time it will be about those Smart TV resources that are addressed to Russian-speaking users. <br><br><h4>  Stream interactive </h4><br>  Service category VoD (Video on Demand): the desired position is selected from the list and viewed.  Streaming video has a standard resolution.  The constantly expanding range of "Stream Interactive" includes various television programs and reports, documentaries and Russian TV shows.  Convenient interface and availability descriptions are attached.  This service is a logical addition to conventional television, all the more, all content is provided free of charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/70bf7f5b/a5b7efd5/a0e93e1f/4984a1b1.jpg">

You can search either within the specific channel of the holding (Russia 1, Russia 2, Russia 24, Science 2.0, My Planet are available), or by global categories: news, serials, documentaries, programs to children.  The content is structured very clearly, each video is provided with a brief description.  You can watch what you want both inside the interface window and in full screen mode by controlling the playback using the ‚Äúplayer‚Äù buttons on the TV remote control.  The quality of standard definition pictures is quite high, and is at the level of a good digital broadcast.  In general, the impression of using the service is excellent.  Hopefully, other channels will follow the lead of VGTRK and launch apps for Samsung Smart TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cc802900/2a377b70/18e32db9/9f6b7896.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/61c84982/1880dd09/a7a08481/9607e863.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/493ea0f2/f71733c6/5bb62ecc/4b857552.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Tvigle.ru </h4><br>  A well-known project that opened up access to predominantly Russian films, cartoons, TV shows, music videos, documentaries, etc. to hundreds of thousands of viewers.  In the growing collection there are loud releases, such as ‚ÄúWhat Men Talk About,‚Äù ‚ÄúTsar‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh Security Vacations‚Äù and the animated series ‚ÄúMasha and the Bear‚Äù.  Of course, someone may complain that there are no high-budget full-length paintings of 2011 in the Tvigle.ru piggy bank, but let's not forget that you don‚Äôt need to pay for viewing, therefore you need to demand the most cream in this situation - pure hypocrisy.  Who pays for the banquet?  Tvigle.ru lives mainly due to advertising, which can be seen before the start of the session.  It is quite acceptable.  The interface structure is organized in a ‚Äúcatalog‚Äù style that is customary and convenient for most users (on the left is a list, on the right is a preview), you can watch your selection in a small window or in full screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f1549ecb/e3338b2a/12a73e5c/a41ce701.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a4ff0912/320fa9f6/d36144fc/1f9bbd76.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Yota music </h4><br>  As the name implies, this application allows you to access an extensive music collection (the application says more than 700,000 tracks, and a million are already mentioned on the Yota website).  In the collection you can find almost any composition of Russian and foreign artists, and not of the worst quality: although the creators chose lossy compression, they did not greed for bitrate, and compression artifacts do not come to the fore.  Subjectively, the sound quality can be compared with MP3 files of 160-192 kbps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/35142f5f/3835d296/5c97a7b6/4dd6e9d6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2dd85d8c/b8b64674/a9574723/d8dfa1d9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5f49f4d5/5d3ca80f/c24bb7bf/98824c89.jpg"><br><br>  There is no charge for using the service, but access to it can only be obtained after registering on the Yota website: at the very beginning, the application requires authorization, for which it is enough to enter the username and password of the site. <br><br><h4>  Yota play </h4><br>  Another service from Yota, not just a well-known wireless provider WiMAX 4G, but also a major content provider, also a long-time partner of Samsung.  In this case, the viewer is invited to an impressive selection of full-length films, including the latest Hollywood blockbusters, like "Fast and Furious 5".  Therefore, if all the available Blu-ray discs are already looked to the holes, then Yota Play can help out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8b00ba70/f81872ae/f7a34085/fd05219b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/78a1359c/78ff4ada/386ea4e4/76ce2c51.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of films - up to 99 rubles.  Only those who have registered on the Yota website can use Yota Play; money for viewing will be debited from a special account to which you need to enter the necessary amount.  To connect the TV to the Yota Play service, you need to launch the corresponding application, remember the special PIN code shown on the start screen, then log in to the Yota ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù from the computer and drive this same code on the registration page of the new equipment.  After that, the TV will open access to the base of films. <br><br><h4>  Sport-Express </h4><br>  News feed with illustrated notes from a famous sports publication.  For the convenience of searching all the news is divided into categories - by type of competition.  The interface is simple, intuitive and functional, no tinsel in the design ... In general, for all sports fans, this service will probably be in your favorite lists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1c3c2caf/141be03b/a3dfe055/02c130c7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0e43273c/c25a2e12/077dbe27/204ea844.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Traffic tutor </h4><br>  As it is not difficult to guess, this application allows you to test your knowledge of the Rules of the road of the Russian Federation.  The creators offer three modes: an imitation of the ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù exam in the traffic police (20 questions of one randomly selected ticket), the solution of abstract road problems and the study of user-selected exam tickets.  In contrast to the ‚ÄúExam‚Äù mode, the last two allow you to learn about the error immediately, and not after passing the entire survey.  The program interface is extremely simple and clear, the graphics are clear, the readability of fonts does not cause any complaints.  The application is free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7157e904/fb2adeaa/98d34f26/0b1ca701.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ab07fc7c/7fa03011/5ddae4c4/dcf77c31.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Gismeteo </h4><br>  Service from the popular site of weather forecasts with automatic location.  Graphic design is similar to that used by the site, the forecast is detailed - separately for each time of day.  In addition, current atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction and speed are shown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4e6abf3/d423eb66/9737a14f/98117bda.jpg"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  First of all, I would like to say that in no way will we limit the coverage of relevant services and applications for Samsung Smart TV to two articles (this and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/128792/">previous one</a> ): as we release new widgets, we will certainly return to this topic.  In the meantime, allow ourselves to sum up some results.  So, despite the relative youth of the direction of Smart TV, it has already managed to acquire a really rich set of network services and entertainment software.  That is, we can already speak about the full actual ‚Äúusability‚Äù of the technology for the end user.  In the future, the list of resources available to smart TV owners will only expand.  Already, the service has more than 250 applications, new ones come out literally every day. <br><br>  <i>Useful links:</i> <br><br>  1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/126821/">General review article on the concept of Smart TV</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/128792/">Smart TV services (‚Äúglobal‚Äù)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129949/</a></p>
