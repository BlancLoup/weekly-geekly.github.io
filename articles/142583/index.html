      Most power supplies are made on the basis that the unit cost should be as small as possible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hence the problems: <br><br>  - Bad power wires and connectors for them.  Wires have a core thickness much less than it should be.  Made of copper, but of very low quality and collected from some remnants of something, just twisted together.  The insulation itself of the power cable is also of poor quality - with a good bend or frequent bends - it cracks, sometimes even with insulation of internal wires.  In the cold, such wires simply crumble. <br><br>  - The power connector itself, when used frequently, begins to falter, there have been cases that the connector loosely shorted something inside the power supply. <br><br>  - bad, cheap plastic block.  Cheap plastic is quickly scratched, loses its presentation, cracks with small bumps.  Since most power supplies are bought to replace old ones, and laptop batteries remain the same, power supplies often do not cope with the load.  They heat up, sometimes overheat so that the body of the block just melts just like chocolate. <br><br>  - You can talk about the assembly itself for a long time.  I will say this, it‚Äôs just terrible.  The rules for the installation of radio elements are generally not respected here.  On the boards, there is often some white bloom, traces of rosin and smudges of apparently soldering fluids.  Often the closure of the tracks occurs just in the places of these streaks.  Solder can be seen that cheap, often where the elements are heated, either peeling off of the track or desoldering of the element occurs (poor contact, which leads to failure of other elements ..). <br><br>  - Cheap electrolytic capacitors.  There were several blocks made apparently from improvised radio elements.  There was even such a masterpiece: a capacitor, designed for a voltage of 50 volts, was shoved into the case from the conder, on which 100 volts was written.  How it all worked I do not understand. <br><br>  Since the power supply is heated in us, and the radio elements themselves are selected without any power reserve at all, respectively, we have a reduced service life of electrolytic capacitors (they dry up, swell up).  How many did not try to repair the blocks ... it was cheaper to buy a new one or repaired it was enough for a maximum of a year, then some other element died. <br><br>  I had to disassemble the power supply, sorry there was no photo left, duck right there, apparently for weight gain, the Chinese shoved a bolt on the M8 covered with a thermocmbric. <br><br>  Some power supply units have very poorly fixed chokes, if you tug on such a block - you can hear it hanging.  As a result, such power supplies break down quickly (the throttle falls off), sometimes close, well, if without consequences. <br><br>  - Low-voltage wires going to the laptop itself.  The quality is better than the power, but the same problems.  Sometimes there are magnetic filters (ferrite) on such wires.  Sometimes they are even real), often made simply for Ponte (a plastic barrel is soldered). <br><br>  - Do not see on the label corporate or not the power supply.  Can stick everything, I tell you as a specialist.  Look at the quality of workmanship, wires, plastic.  This is the only way to understand whether a quality power supply unit.  I do not deny that there are power supplies, the quality of which is commendable, but they usually cost 10-20% more expensive. <br><br>  Perhaps experts will be able to explain this, but often I have seen such problems.  I bought a power supply for a laptop, which is 3-5 years old (respectively, and the battery is the same).  The old one either didn‚Äôt charge the battery or failed after about 3-4 years of operation, or failed after replacing the battery with a more powerful one.  Duck here, having an old battery, people change the power supply, then after 1-3 months they brought back the burnt new blocks.  Symptoms of failure were one - charged, but very hot. <br><br>  I understand that the longer the life of a laptop battery, the more if a replacement with a more powerful one has occurred, then the power supply unit requires more power, it carries more load to charge such batteries.  Therefore, there is overheating and failure of the charging power supply. <br><br>  If you buy a new power supply for your laptop, try to check its performance in place, see how the battery is charging, how it is heated.  A good seller usually on site with a multimeter will show you the voltage at the output (you can come with your multimeter).  The power supplies are sealed, but all have a fuse.  If the old one is dead, do not be lazy, carefully disassemble and check the fuse, it suddenly flew out, although it is only a symptom of a problem. <br><br>  That's all.  This is just the main thing.  If you have questions - write, help advice on power supply laptops.  Sorry that there are few pictures, but there is nothing much to photograph here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142583/</a></p>
