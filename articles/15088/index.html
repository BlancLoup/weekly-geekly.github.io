  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And all</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a thing in literature and cinema as ‚Äúanti-climax‚Äù.  This is when the tension builds up and builds up - and now it is already the very peak of emotions, when all of a sudden the bang fell apart.  Technically, this technique is quite simple.  The reader or the viewer is allowed on the wrong track.  Show the open door.  From the room there are some dumb sounds.  The main character goes to the kitchen and takes a knife.  Then quietly sneaks up to the room and abruptly opens the door.  And there is a great-nephew, who returned from college to a vacation a week earlier, and turned on the telly to its fullest. <br><br>  But this is a ‚Äúplanned‚Äù anticlimax.  Personally, I am much more interested in the natural.  Take for example Warren Buffet - the richest investor in the world, with a fortune of 40 billion dollars.  Buffett is often asked about his investment strategy (by the way, here is his excellent <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fvideo.google.com%252Fvideoplay%253Fdocid%253D-6231308980849895261%26vidurl%3D%252Fvideoplay%253Fdocid%253D-6231308980849895261%2526q%253Dwarren%252Bbuffett%2526total%253D387%2526start%253D0%2526num%253D10%2526so%253D0%2526type%253Dsearch%2526plindex%253D0%26usg%3DAL29H214FfzimZuiOYCPlfRAToMvCczXpw">video presentation</a> - see if you are fluent in English and you have a dedicated line). <br><br>  And everyone is waiting for a mega-complicated explanation of the super-tricky strategy.  But everything is simple.  Buffett invests only in those companies that he understands.  And there are only a few dozen, by his own admission.

      And that's all. <br><br>  How is everything?  It can not be.  It's too easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes all.  In fact. <br><br>  Recently, I read a short phrase from <a href="http://www.kraynov.com/">Max Krainov</a> - ‚Äúconsumption is an alternative to investment‚Äù.  To be honest, I oherel.  These four words contain all the necessary information that hundreds of books about money management, personal investments and family budgeting are trying to convey, but which people never understand. <br><br>  People who do not understand the phenomenon of "and all", are obviously in a losing position.  Take for example blogs.  I can give a very simple recipe for blog popularity.  Do - and report what is happening.  Everything.  It was on this wave that the blogs of <a href="http://homelessinmoscow.blogspot.com/">Bum</a> , <a href="http://maulnet.ru/">Maulnet</a> , <a href="http://www.kraynov.com/">Max</a> <a href="http://maulnet.ru/">Kraynov</a> and <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/">mine</a> rose.  The more a person does, the more he will be read. <br><br>  And that's all. <br><br>  The same with sites and services.  You can invent a lot of smart ass chips and megaslose engines.  But this is not necessary.  There are sites like <a href="http://inosmi.ru/">Inosmi.ru</a> .  If you do not take the biography of the site and the links of the creators, then the idea is insanely simple - take foreign articles where they slander Russia and translate them.  And that's all.  That's the whole secret. <br><br>  You can create a site where there will be daily interviews with interesting, but unknown people.  The site MUST be popular. <br><br>  But I personally do not expect the appearance of such a site in the near future.  I can explain why.  In order to create such a site - you have to run every day, like a fucking Rex, and look for this most interesting, but unknown person.  Screening out a bunch of slag. <br><br>  And it is much more difficult than to set yourself on the wrong track and not start dreaming about another web-based network or another LinkedIn clone. <br><br>  And that's all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15088/</a></p>
