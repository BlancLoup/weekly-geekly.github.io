I invested $ 1,000 in purchasing power in the cloud.  Today I am ready to share my intermediate results and talk about the prospects for mining. <br><br>  I recently traveled to Tallinn and went into the office of the HashCoins company, which produces mining equipment and provides cloud mining service HashFlare and spoke with the company‚Äôs director, Sergey Potapenko. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/371/0ac/6fd/3710ac6fdd8187daf96028dcaf682676.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company currently employs 22 people, data centers, in which mining occurs (the creation of cryptocurrency) are located in Ireland, the USA and Tallinn. <br><br>  On the laptop screen online video from the datacenter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5b/39c/04c/f5b39c04caf2f46e8640ef6df9beffa5.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a new and very promising cryptocurrency Ethereum (Ethereum). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47c/4d3/f4b/47c4d3f4b13eb0922e8c4f3ebd5245e7.jpg"><br><br>  Ethereum is mined using ordinary powerful graphics cards.  They connect to motherboards that have many PCI-E slots through these adapters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa9/f65/202/aa9f6520257773aa95ea8f8129249b8a.jpg"><br><br>  Bitcoin and Litecoin are mined using special equipment.  This ASIC processor, used for mining Bitcoin, was developed in HashCoins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/728/a8b/d92/728a8bd92bfbeb013c556608ce4b5ea8.jpg"><br><br>  November 27, when I launched my cloud mining Bitcoin cost $ 440, today it costs $ 657.  For seven months, I had 1.5239 BTC ($ 1001.2), that is, the invested amount ‚Äúgot out‚Äù.  Now mining starts to earn.  Capacities are bought indefinitely and work as long as there is a sense in it and the amount of money charged exceeds the cost of electricity. <br><br>  I distributed the attachment in half - $ 500 on mining Bitcoin (algorithm SHA-256) and $ 500 on Litecoin (algorithm Scrypt).  In the beginning, SHA gave more income (in January, SHA income amounted to 0.1324 BTC, Scrypt income - 0.0955 BTC), then SHA income fell sharply and continues to fall, and Scrypt income grows.  In May, the SHA gave only 0.0428 BTC, and Scrypt - 0.1550.  Bitcoin and Litecoin courses change almost simultaneously.  In hashflare, all calculations take place in Bitcoin, so I specify all values ‚Äã‚Äãin this currency. <br><br>  July 9, 4 months earlier than expected, the payment for the Bitcoin block ( <a href="http://bitcoinclock.com/">bitcoinclock.com</a> ) will be <a href="http://bitcoinclock.com/">halved</a> .  The nearest decrease per Litecoin block will occur only in August 2019 ( <a href="http://litecoinblockhalf.com/">litecoinblockhalf.com</a> ). <br><br>  We discussed with Sergey the situation in the cryptocurrency market and mining prospects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78a/4d4/66c/78a4d466c327f429c02ac4000c61701c.jpg"><br><br>  Bitcoin rate is growing and if it continues to grow, mining of this currency will still be appropriate, if it falls, many mining farms will close, because of this, over time, the mining profitability of this cryptocurrency will inevitably increase and in the long term mining bitcoin can again profitable. <br><br>  Mining lightcoin is now very profitable - with $ 1000 invested, monthly income now amounts to 0.2088 BTC or $ 137.18 with a Bitcoin rate of 657. If the rate does not change, the investment will pay off in 7.5 months and start generating income that is quite possible for quite a long time.  But there are a couple of problems.  Now no one in the world produces equipment for mining according to the Scrypt algorithm, and the one that was almost finished.  Hashflare is likely to stop selling Scrypt‚Äôs power in a month or two.  But since it became profitable to mine the lightcoins, but there is no Bitcoin, probably powerful equipment will appear.  And as soon as it starts to work, the income from mining will drop sharply, because the reward is always divided into all mining participants. <br><br>  New Ethereum currency recently suffered a serious blow - the algorithm was cracked, it was necessary to stop mining around the world and the rate plummeted.  Now the ‚Äúhole‚Äù was patched, mining started again and most likely the yield from Ethereum could exceed the yield from Litecoin.  But there is a nuance.  Hashflare sells mining facilities for SHA and Scrypt for life, and Ethereum only leases facilities for a year. <br><br>  Of course, no one knows what will happen globally with cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin rate is now high, but it is not secured and this ‚Äúbubble‚Äù may blow off. <br><br>  In the fall I risked my money and did not lose - they returned and the mining continues.  I will report on the results for the year. <br><br>  If you also decide to take a risk, register on Hashflare at my link <a href="https://hashflare.io/r/9D534238">Hashflare.io</a> and I will also get something in the form of a bonus for your registration.  :) <br><br>  Important note.  It is necessary to understand that there can be no absolute guarantee of income and a refund here.  Never invest in the investment of the last money, and the more credit money. <br><br>  It is possible to pay for computing power both with an ordinary bank card, and with btc, emc transfer, as well as through webmoney and payeer payment systems.  You can buy Scrypt computational power from 1 MH / s for $ 9.90.  The injected is displayed on any bitcoin wallet, and from there money can be withdrawn to any payment system or cash using exchange services. <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D278078"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369449/</a></p>
