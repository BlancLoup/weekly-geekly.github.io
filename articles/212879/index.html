  <section class="page js-page"><h1>x3650 M4 - do you need HD?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The x3650 M4 server has long been and still remains an IBM sales hit.  It seemed that in the segment of small 2-processor servers no radical changes were foreseen, never change the winning team.  But the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù x3650M4, a model with an HD (High Density) index, entered the market, and questions immediately arose.  New advantages for comparable money or is it still the best enemy of the good? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Basic model and HD index </h5><br><br>  Obviously, it is necessary to compare x3650M4 HD, first of all, with the base model.  The differences are clearly visible in the table compiled according to IBM specifications at the beginning of December 2013.

The main difference is in the storage subsystem. <br><br><h5>  Storage: flexible configuration </h5><br><br>  Actually, x3650M4 HD is called a storage server, which is not surprising, given the opportunity to increase storage capacity to 41.6 TB against 25 TB from the ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù.  Compared to the base model, the number of hard drive bays has dramatically increased in the new server: 24 2.5 ‚Äùdrive bays are located on the front panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c4/876/9a9/1c48769a9e5c14289b5392f8cba978b6.jpg"><br><br>  Alternatively, you can install 16 HDD and 16 SSD.  And in terms of configuration flexibility, this is a very valuable feature.  Here it is already possible to structure storage resources on the principle of fast / capacious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e01/766/761/e0176676164ab91b99acf309a21c55bd.jpg"><br><br>  This is the server with 16 installed 2.5 ‚Äùhard drives and 16 1.8‚Äù solid-state drives - this configuration of the storage subsystem, if you use car jargon, can be called ‚Äúfull stuffing‚Äù.  And all drives available from the front panel support hot swapping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d09/a49/436/d09a49436c793753d590dec2aa59bea8.png"><br><br>  Another 2 compartments are located on the back side of the server.  An optional RAID adapter allows the system to boot from these two disks, which helps to completely isolate the OS from production data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d55/308/b70/d55308b703f8d2ae96cc0dee3c418589.jpg"><br><br><h5>  RAID </h5><br><br>  Serious storage subsystem - so you can expect different from the standard set of options for RAID.  Indeed, in addition to the integrated (without occupying a PCI slot) RAID level 0/1, it is possible to use the hardware ServeRAID 5210e and increase the data transfer rate from 6 Gbit / s to 12 Gbit / s.  Standard with ServeRAID 5210e updates are available to levels: <br>  <i>- RAID 5/50 without cache</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- RAID 5/50 1GB with cache</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- RAID 5/50 4GB (expected in Q1 2014) / 2GB / 1GB with flash</i> <br><br>  In addition, with the FoD feature (Feature on Demand), an upgrade to RAID level 6/60 is available. <br><br><h5>  Independent zone cooling </h5><br><br>  As soon as the system offers the opportunity to increase the number of disks and increase the possible load level, the question of cooling immediately arises.  Agree, in the 3650 M4 HD, this question should be particularly acute.  The server uses a 2-zone cooling system: 4 fans operate independently of each other, serving, relatively speaking, 2 temperature corridors, separate for each processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e60/386/786/e60386786674309c9b7f7c394a7ee5b6.png"><br><br>  Here again, can not do without the automotive analogy.  Imagine a dual-zone climate control that provides optimal cooling in different parts of the cabin.  How much more efficient is this air conditioning system!  And, of course, all 4 fans support hot swapping. <br><br><h5>  Control </h5><br><br>  In the administration of the system here without surprises.  We can say that the set of tools is traditional, customary and proven to be effective.  IBM Systems Director and IMM2 (Integrated Management Module).  In combination with the traditional Light Path Diagnostics LED diagnostics panel in System x servers and the PFA failure prediction system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acc/1e3/b54/acc1e3b54e66bbae33db310817d4e996.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Application scenarios </h5><br><br>  If the model is x3650 M4, positioned as a server to support cloud environments, virtualization, applications for teamwork and, of course, infrastructure applications, then x3650 M4 HD, in addition, is suitable for serious work with large amounts of data.  And primarily to support business intelligence and data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) operations at high speeds, which requires both significant computing power and large storage capacity. <br><br>  To whom such a combination of characteristics can be beneficial?  It is hardly possible to somehow limit the range of potential interested parties.  Not only government agencies that have to work with huge amounts of data, large corporations and their branches, but also companies from the SMB sector, which today are increasingly working with their SQL databases in virtualized and cloud environments.  In addition, a powerful server with a serious storage subsystem will be a good solution for working with video.  The volume of video data in corporate environments is growing rapidly.  The recordings of surveillance cameras, instructional videos, video presentations, commercials - all this is not only for large enterprises, but also for companies that are rather modest in scale. <br><br>  Summing up all the possibilities offered by the x3650 M4 HD server, we can confidently say that it will be at least as popular as the base model.  Very good computing power and scalable storage subsystem - all in a 2U chassis. <br><br><h5>  PS: Buy fast.  Instead of an afterword. </h5><br><br>  Until now, the basic x3650 server model was the most powerful solution from the System x product line, which can be purchased using the IBM Express Seller program.  This is important, especially when server deployment time is limited.  Express models are ready-made configurations, actually ‚Äúboxed products‚Äù in the distributor's warehouse.  Fast order, fast delivery and instant readiness for work.  At the same time there are no restrictions on the subsequent upgrade.  This is a crucial moment for the server 3650 M4, in the title of which there are letters HD. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212879/</a></p>
