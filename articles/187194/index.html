The time has come, as I promised, to talk about our metrics system when choosing experts and their typologies, and to top off ask you to participate in a survey on the relevance of certain courses. <br><br>  So, here's an insider:

The expert works for a successful company in a cool position.</b> <br><br>  This type is the simplest, we a priori rely on the system of filters and selection in large companies (Nival, Svyaznoy).  We believe that one of the top people in the company is most likely suitable for us to record a course on their profession.  But we still leave skepticism and check the author during negotiations and creating a preview.  If the author himself is adequate, develops a clear, logical structure of the course, does not pour a lot of water, does not behave in the frame inappropriate - then he is suitable for us. <br><br>  <i>An example of a good expert: <a href="http://www.guro.com.ua/">Roman Guro</a> , Art Director of Nival.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An example of a worthless expert: one man working for a very serious structure was rude, ignorant in his correspondence, and wanted us to pay him a lot of money.</i> <br><br>  <b>Type 2. An expert who has titles and regalia in a certain area.</b> <br><br>  This type is the second in its simplicity of work with it.  As in the case of cool companies, we take a professional, assess the significance of his achievements, slightly supplement the background with information from the network and personal communication with an expert, and make a verdict.  Titles and regalia can be different, the main thing is that they define a person for a top expert in a particular area.  By default, the top expert is TOP 1-3 on its niche. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>An example of a good expert: <a href="https://vk.com/gusakdmitry">Dmitry Gusak</a> , bronze bodybuilding champion of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Felix Stein</a> , bodybuilding and European champion, one of the most titled makeup artists.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An example of a worthless expert: a yoga trainer with a fictional diploma, a fictional community of yoga trainers, in which he himself is also the founder.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Type 3. An expert who has established himself as a cool coach.</b> <br><br>  This type is a little more complicated than the first, because you can easily run into a skilled rogue.  We began to solve the problem easier - to contact directly to customers of the services of a coach, and find out everything from them.  Student success is the most important criterion for this type of expert.  Sometimes, experts simplify our task and leave a super detailed video reviews of their partners with all the details and contacts. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>An example of a good expert: <a href="http://businesscom.biz/">Sergey Koshechkin</a> , a person who advised on sales of Porsche salons, 1C and Kaspersky companies.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.copywriting-on-demand.com/len-smith-copywriter.htm">Len Smith</a> , copywriting and sales coach for Vodafone and Lloyds.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Example of a worthless expert: one woman who was engaged in business art therapy, had a mythical list of partners and threw her bare legs on the table in preview :)</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Type 4. An expert who has made a fortune in his business, or is known to a wide range of admirers, and both are better.</b> <br><br>  This type is the most complex and collects the most diverse experts in one list.  In the first case, if a person made a fortune on his own abilities and skills, then we carefully check whether this is so.  No, no one penetrates the house and does not follow the object :) There is information on the network for any unencrypted person.  In the second case, if a person is not a millionaire, but is known by the people and is extremely respected - we count the number of his followers and the author‚Äôs references, we use a certain level established by us. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>An example of a good expert: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D1%2580%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Vladimir Eremin</a> , a coach in acting and dubbing, which we all know as the voice of Hopkins, Al Pacino and Mickey Rourke.</i>  <i><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Gennady Balashov</a> , business coach and millionaire, who is now actively promoting the introduction of the new tax system in Ukraine.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An example of a worthless expert: a man who cut down money in the 90s and now teaches others how to make money with the help of his swollen business muscle.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Here is such a small insider before launching the platform, and to top it off, as promised, a survey for participating in which I will be extremely grateful. <br><br>  Ps if you missed something - add.  If there are on the mind the top people to whom we need to go and write a course from them - write.  We go and write.  And to the person reporting - the course is free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187194/</a></p>
