  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frontend Conf - with user care</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will not argue that the frontend is more important than the backend, or support the controversial concept that "the backend in the modern web is not mandatory."  Leaving aside holivars, we simply recognize that the front-end developer deals with the client side of web projects, which means that his work is most visible to end users who are struggling for.  That is, not to give proper attention to the frontend, simply impermissible luxury. <br><br>  We decided on this, it remains only to figure out, and how now to do everything cool.  Where do they write about it on the Internet?  - Yes, everywhere!  And now, in order to deal with all the variety of modern technologies, frameworks and libraries, we are holding a professional conference Frontend Conf.  Selecting topics for it, we focused not on high-end, but on the usefulness of reports.  Any professional front-endender coming to the conference can be sure that he will find many useful reports corresponding to his level of knowledge.  Which reports as a result were included into the program, I will tell under a cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/os/pi/nv/ospinvi-veihtg9o_aofabbto-8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Input data <br></h2><br>  The <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/">2018 Frontend Conf Moscow</a> Conference will take place <strong>on October 4 and 5</strong> .  We will devote two days to the discussion of technologies and approaches to the development of the client side, we will pay attention to such issues as: increasing productivity and quality assessment, choosing a framework, interface design process, working with API, layout.

      In three streams in three halls in two days <strong>40 reports</strong> will be presented, master classes and meetings in a variety of areas: API, layout and UX, performance, frameworks, testing and others. <br><br>  When composing the program, we chose those that would <strong>be useful in the work of the widest possible range of specialists</strong> .  But they didn‚Äôt leave behind even narrower issues, in the Gamma hall there will be reports about tools that may not be needed by all polls, but definitely for some people are the most popular.  It will be even more convenient to discuss these issues in a relatively narrow circle, it will be possible to thoroughly deal with everything and find like-minded people.  Anyway, almost all speakers are based on their own experience and offer concrete solutions that they <strong>listened to - and implement</strong> .  Is that quite a bit of space left for just informative speeches such as, for example, about <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4095">mining cryptocurrency in the browser</a> . <br><br>  The full <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/schedule.html">schedule</a> is on the website in an interactive way, and in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zylhgjgpqr4mtx/FC2018-schedule.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">pdf</a> with the symbols of the themes - it is arranged so that if you come for a particular topic, you can get to all the reports on it.  And now let's look at the topic. <br><br>  The first day, Thursday of the fourth day, will begin with four reports in English - to warm up. <br><br><h3>  Breaking the norm with creative CSS <br></h3><br>  <strong>Aga Naplocha</strong> works in <strong>Adobe</strong> , and also develops the educational project ‚ÄúThe Awwwesomes‚Äù.  In his <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4210">report,</a> Aga wants to share with us <strong>new CSS features</strong> that allow you to create truly amazing things.  The bright future of web graphics and CSS is just around the corner - we will finally be able to quickly implement our bold ideas and create website designs right in the browser.  Aha urges not to stand aside and <strong>recharge yourself with a fresh spirit of creativity</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Accessibility vs latest Web APIs.  Can't we just get along? <br></h3><br>  <strong>Mauricio Palma</strong> in SinnerSchrader serves as a kind of proxy between design teams and developers and believes that most of the developers refer to the problem of <strong>accessibility of the interface</strong> as something that should be thought of last. <br><br>  In his <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3856">report,</a> Maurizio, using the <strong>latest Web API</strong> , promises to show effective speech recognition and synthesis techniques and the creation of convenient and accessible user interfaces using them. <br><br><h3>  I threw away my mouse <br></h3><br>  Inspired by the work of Laura Carvajal, <strong>Manuel Matuzoviƒá</strong> decided to <strong>run an</strong> experiment and did not use the mouse for two weeks.  In his <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3620">report,</a> Manuel will show successful and unsuccessful examples of sites that he met.  On their basis we will discuss the most common problems, and talk about how to solve them.  Let us see why it is important that your website is possible and convenient to <strong>use from the keyboard</strong> , and to whom it is actually <strong>beneficial</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Empathetic Design Systems <br></h3><br>  On Frontend Conf, <strong>Jennifer Wong</strong> (Envoy) plans on the basis of her experience to <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3967">tell you</a> how to develop a design system from scratch, not forgetting accessibility and taking into account the needs of users and developers.  Jennifer even made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FrontendConfRussia/videos/234032520624801/">video</a> in which she invites you to her report. <br><br>  After that, there will be a lunch break in the halls of "Beta" and "Gamma", a very interesting report will begin in the "Alpha" hall. <br><br><h3>  How we developed a completely offline offline application using persistent storage <br></h3><br>  Web development, and Offline First applications no longer seem unreal.  What was the advantage of native applications is also realizable in web applications. <br><br>  <strong>Timofey Lavrenyuk</strong> (KeepSolid) plans to <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3851">tell</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  how to port a native application for working with documents, while retaining one of its main advantages - working in Offline; </li><li>  which libraries to use for working with IndexedDB; </li><li>  how to connect Workers working with the database and the application itself. </li></ul><br>  The story is based on real experience and will not do without a description of the pitfalls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/nk/cl/dhnkcltnigwcv5nrgii2suqakci.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Performance <br></h2><br><h3>  garbage.collect () <br></h3><br>  We are used to the fact that the browser not only executes our JavaScript, but also cleans up the remaining garbage.  Yandex.Maps API developer Andrei Roenko considers it important to understand this process and suggests <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4081">finding the answers</a> to the following questions together: <br><br><ul><li>  Where does garbage come from and what to do to make it smaller? </li><li>  Who collects garbage and when? </li><li>  What are the tools to analyze memory consumption and search for garbage? </li><li>  How do browsers try to optimize memory performance? </li></ul><br>  Detailed analysis will help you understand how garbage collection affects the performance of our applications. <br><br><h3>  Life hacking for front-end developers <br></h3><br>  <strong>Aleksey Zolotykh</strong> has been developing the frontend for 10 years and has saved quite a lot of lifkak: ways <strong>to do something quickly and easier</strong> than it seems at first glance.  In his report on Frontend Conf, Aleksey promises to <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3951">share</a> these life hacks, for example, learn how to show the result of your work from a local computer or make a website in one evening.  Also look at <strong>lifehacks in the console</strong> and more. <br><br><h3>  Fast service without Server Side Rendering <br></h3><br>  Ultimate Guitar is a service that is visited 65 million times a month, but which dispenses with Server Side Rendering.  Andrey Yakobchuk will tell why this path was chosen.  And more about the report <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FrontendConfRussia/videos/312197459581959/">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Zaheshiruyte it <br></h3><br>  Caching in the browser is quite a flexible mechanism.  Do you use its full potential?  <strong>Vsevolod Shmyrov</strong> (Yandex.Maps) <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3513">promises to</a> step by step analyze all available caching levels when the browser tries to load any material.  Both from client side and from server side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2-/vy/sj/2-vysjwdl0mtbxnoxjjiotj8sw0.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Design <br></h2><br>  This section includes reports that are less tied to the context of the fontend.  Basically, they will have less code, but more structural considerations, which does not detract from their usefulness. <br><br><h3>  The process of creating complex animations in the web: from idea to finished project <br></h3><br>  Spectacular project can not be created without spectacular animations.  In any case, <strong>Natalya Gabitova</strong> and <strong>Yegor Savintsev</strong> from Rambler &amp; Co think so and promise to share their experiences in: <br><br><ul><li>  how to assemble a team of developers and motion designers; </li><li>  how to assign roles and control the result; </li><li>  what tools to learn, what to understand; </li><li>  how to integrate animations from different sources into the site. </li></ul><br>  Let's see how it works in Rambler &amp; Co and what techniques can be used to maintain order, avoid memory leaks, synchronize different animations. <br><br><h3>  Developer experience and API as a product <br></h3><br>  What details when you create (or when choosing) a product with an API should you pay attention to provide (or receive) the best developer experience?  <strong>Anastasia Goryacheva</strong> at Intento deals with dozens of AI APIs and, by their example, offers to <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4069">disassemble</a> <strong>8 API features</strong> such as: reliability, ease of start, maintainability, and something else.  We will see which of the giants of the industry creates more headaches than provides functionality.  The same ideas can be useful when choosing a payment service for the site.  Or building communication between backend and front-end development teams creating one service. <br><br><h3>  PDD approach for planning an IT project <br></h3><br>  <strong>Ksenia Konovalova</strong> from Digital Security is going <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4059">to prove</a> that <strong>every developer should be able to make prototypes</strong> .  XD (no, this is not a smiley) from Adobe will help you to get started reactively.  We learn how to use the prototype: to formulate the requirements for the product;  design the product architecture;  <strong>test hypotheses without code</strong> .  And after the report we can effortlessly find a common language with your favorite customer, <strong>save the project budget and shorten the development time.</strong>  In any case, this promises us Xenia.  Even for one of these points, it is worth trying to delve into prototyping. <br><br><h3>  JSON API - we work according to the specification <br></h3><br>  <strong>Alexey Avdeev</strong> from Neuron.Digital will help to understand the JSON API specification.  This <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4001">report is</a> very rich in technical details, but also got into this section ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù, since it is not tied to the front end exclusively.  Alexey will tell you what the essence of the JSON API is, how this approach <strong>complements RESTful</strong> and how it <strong>differs from GraphQL</strong> .  As always, let's look at the pros, cons and pitfalls. <br><br><h2>  Frameworks <br></h2><br>  Of course, the topic of trend and new frameworks on Frontend Conf is indispensable.  We tried not to get too involved with them and selected only a few of the most practical reports. <br><br><h3>  React, Vue or Aurelia: how we chose the framework <br></h3><br>  There are many criteria for choosing a framework, and in each new task you have to re-weigh the pros and cons.  <strong>Alexander Taran</strong> (Acumatica) will <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3920">present</a> his conditions and his opinion.  For example, tell: <br><br><ul><li>  how to evaluate the "cost of error" in the selection; </li><li>  what to implement prototypes for hypothesis testing, </li><li>  How does HYIP and business tasks affect? </li><li>  summary results and decision making. </li></ul><br>  It will be interesting also because in the end Alexander became the <strong>Aurelia Core Maintainer</strong> . <br><br><h3>  StoreWars (ngxs, redux, vuex) <br></h3><br>  In the continuation of the framework framework, there will be a <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3829">report by</a> <strong>Kirill Yusupov</strong> and <strong>Maxim Ivanov</strong> (Cinimex).  In the main part, we analyze <strong>state management</strong> , consider examples in small and large projects for all three - ngxs, redux, vuex.  And as a conclusion, the speakers promise to explain why ngxs should be used, not ngrx, and why the <strong>choice of the framework is not as important</strong> as the choice of the store. <br><br><h3>  Vanishing frameworks <br></h3><br>  <strong>Pavel Malyshev</strong> from Mustlab proposes to start with the basics and to begin to figure out why we actually use frameworks, and why <strong>classical frameworks are not suitable for all projects</strong> .  In the <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/3753">report we will</a> talk about the new trend of ‚Äúdisappearing frameworks‚Äù on the example of SvelteJS, and try to understand why this is not ‚Äúyet another javascript framework‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/-k/j3/ic-kj3pfwlbfrykj_ryteogrthu.jpeg"><br><br>  The conclusion is obvious, there is no silver bullet, but these speeches will help you make a reasonable decision in each case.  Sometimes it may even turn out to be a self-written solution <br><br><h3>  Better a day to lose <br></h3><br>  <a href="http://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4111">The report of</a> <strong>Alexey Okhrimenko</strong> from IPONWEB did not enter into any of the sections, he is alone.  On October 5, right from the morning, we‚Äôll find out whether we should develop <strong>our own tools</strong> , and if we‚Äôve spent a lot of time, we can save it in the long run.  Alexey will share his experience in writing tools for <strong>debugging, testing, optimization</strong> , scaling, and validation for various projects.  He will tell you what benefits existing tools can bring and whether it is worth spending time on it at all. <br><br>  Of course, this is not all.  But even this should be enough to convince anyone that <a href="https://frontendconf.ru/moscow/2018/">Frontend Conf Moscow 2018</a> will be the largest and coolest front-end conference in Russia.  Come for two days to immerse yourself in a professional atmosphere, listen attentively to interesting reports, learn about new useful things, chat with other professionals.  Yes, in the end, just have a good time. <br><br><blockquote>  Manage to <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/fc2018-moscow.html">register</a> if you feel (or the <a href="https://habr.com/post/424479/">test</a> prompted you) the need for professional growth - only a week is left! <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421139/</a></p>
