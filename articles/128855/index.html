A laptop that can replace the computer of the middle class.  Acer Aspire 5560G-6344G64Mnkk. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/91c3b69f/9e823b34/853fc13a/a1ead3d5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What is it like? </h1><br>  Outside, the notebook is a classic 15.6-inch laptop, a dark gray cover, the inside is slightly closer to brown, and the frame around the screen is black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/829ba891/cf828a15/b9aba02e/15b31798.jpg"><br><br>  By design, the laptop is more like the recent works of the company ASUS.  I did not see new trends here. <br>  Is that a ‚Äúlock‚Äù of the battery looks nice?

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/18aad86f/ba52c702/b7da3068/acbfe4f0.jpg"><br><br>  The display is a standard matrix with a glossy finish and a resolution of 1366x768 pixels. <br>  The touchpad supports multitouch, gestures, and also has a dual key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dedd8042/26a23b0d/ea21cb26/2d9e7419.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard is full, with a digital block, island-type keys, under which dust and debris will clog. <br>  The usability of the keyboard is quite ordinary.  Long texts are typed without problems. <br>  Indicator lights are blue (on indicator), orange (wi-fi, battery charge). <br>  All indicators are clearly visible.  The power indicator is inscribed in the power button, and the remaining indicators are placed on the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3c59de53/7224bc34/7b2d73bf/c0febacf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d3453747/cf8718af/d95a8684/f1f47087.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7445114e/231420a6/a32092b1/2d3e9ec5.jpg"><br><br>  The cover of the laptop opens up about 150 degrees.  I think this is sufficient.  The lid comes on the back panel, so there are no connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e12d2e73/d546ba17/d9f2f2a0/6a0c7f9e.jpg"><br><br>  The connectors spread all over. <br>  On the left, the charger connector, RJ45, ventilation grille (warm air blows to the left, right-handed people are happy), D-Sub, HDMI, USB (2.0), headphone and microphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/75f9231d/0ca5ccca/78eba387/2add0031.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ead3d807/b1c48758/2dedad0f/0c21eae0.jpg"><br><br>  On the right are two USB (2.0) connectors, as well as a drive (DVD-RW). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b366182b/eef1ce00/a0389ce7/b8824029.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/593eabca/dda107aa/94984f63/542840e4.jpg"><br><br>  On the front side there is a card reader and the already mentioned status indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/513dc3d4/4949db9f/bad4993f/c771348b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f997afb9/cf0c19dc/d9acd299/6817f6a0.jpg"><br><br>  On the cover, besides the gloss, fit a webcam.  1.3 megapixels, quality is standard.  Using interpolation, it produces 720p (but the quality is not so hot). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ddaa3474/a488b87d/afe143fa/2c07d051.jpg"><br>  By the way, the charger is standard, a small integral unit (memory and network cable). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8f61f61c/a57c9813/86961cfd/0c28e439.jpg"><br><br><h1>  What's inside? </h1><br>  Inside this laptop is a novelty.  AMD A6 processor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bd/b17/efc/2bdb17efc3d6af578033e5a16abaacbe.jpg"><br><br>  Quote: <br><blockquote>  The AMD A-Series A6-3400M (codename Llano) is a quad-core processor for entry-level laptops.  It belongs to the AMD Fusion family of hybrid processors (APUs).  On a single chip with four x86 processor cores, the integrated high-performance video card Radeon HD 6520G is placed.  The processor runs at 1.4 GHz, however, thanks to the Turbo Core, this frequency can increase to 2.3 GHz. <br><br>  The memory controller integrated into the A6-3400M supports dual-channel DDR3L-1333 memory and PCIe 2.0 interfaces. </blockquote><br><br>  For my part, I would compare this processor with an Intel Core i3 processor of the 2011 family, or even an Intel Core i5, but with the same performance, AMD will be significantly cheaper than quad-core Intel Core i5, or the same price with Intel Core i3 (2 cores). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/45f3f26c/894ce85d/e81b8454/9ed90a29.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cc64acfa/0b69b029/95d6147c/2b413d6b.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the video card integrated into the processor, there is also a discrete AMD Radeon HD 6650M adapter.  Again quote. <br><blockquote>  The AMD Radeon HD 6650M (also known as the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 6650) is a fast midrange graphics card for laptops.  It supports DirectX 11, is the successor to the HD 5650. The card features: higher frequency, 80 shaders, support for Eyefinity + and the new UVD3 video decoder.  However, the adapter is still manufactured using the 40nm process technology and is based on the Whister chip, as are the 6700M and 6600M series cards.  In fact, the 6650M card is a 6750M adapter with DDR3 memory. <br><br>  480 stream processors are based on the ‚Äúold‚Äù 5D architecture, similar to the one used in the 5000-series cards.  Consequently, the number of shaders is not comparable with the number of one-dimensional shaders in NVIDIA GPUs.  Tessellation performance with new cards will be improved (the same as in the 6800-series desktop adapters).  Stream processors can be used with DirectX 11, OpenGL 4.1, DirectCompute 11 and OpenCL.  They can also be used to perform common computations, such as video transcoding. <br></blockquote><br>  I will also say a word about the video card - a very good option, while the graphics card built into the processor and the discrete one can work in hybrid crossfire mode!  And it gives even more performance!  You can get acquainted with the "parrots" below. <br><br>  RAM (DDR3) is 4 GB (dual channel mode, of course).  Hard disk - 640 GB. <br>  In my opinion - more than enough for modern average needs. <br>  The gigabit network card and wi-fi class n complement the picture. <br>  The entire configuration is powered by a 4400 mAh battery.  It is not enough, in my opinion (on average it is 1.5 hours with a good load and 3 hours in the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù mode). <br>  Since the laptop has a discrete video and 4 cores, I decided to test it on the question ‚Äúplay‚Äù. <br>  Benchmark programs gave these numbers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c6a37391/5ba8e818/6c72934c/d611f794.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1f96247a/937032f1/2e398977/db7c6635.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/871b6ecd/3f724152/3e91cc48/3b8161c7.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the laptop is not very hot and does not make noise with a cooler like a vacuum cleaner. <br>  Having installed Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Fallout: New Vegas on it, I played without problems, on medium settings, without brakes in general. <br>  Pleasantly surprised by good performance. <br>  My monster on the core i7, of course, pulls it all better and at maximum settings, but then 15 inches - you can carry it around and play wherever you want! <br>  Schoolboy's dream!  Great work tool (Autocad, MathCad)!  And just a replacement for a bulky desktop. <br>  By the way, about the price - <a href="">less than 20 thousand rubles</a> for it, I think one of the main advantages. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  Positive sides: <br>  + Good performance <br>  + Almost not heated <br>  + Nice design trends <br>  + Low (and even low) price <br>  Negative sides: <br>  - Gloss <br>  - The keyboard, though beautiful and comfortable, is not very practical. <br>  - No USB 3.0 (it‚Äôs time to put it everywhere) <br>  - Not very long battery life <br><br>  Bottom line: a great solution, for those who have little money, but need performance. <br><br><h1>  Specifications </h1><br>  Display diagonal 15.6 " <br>  HD / LED display type <br>  Display resolution 1366 x 768 <br>  Display Coverage Glossy <br>  AMD Llano A6-3400M processor model <br>  Number of cores 4 <br>  Processor frequency 1.4 GHz - 2.3 GHz (Turbo) <br>  UMI processor bus frequency <br>  Cache size L2 4096 <br>  ATI Mobility¬Æ Radeon ‚Ñ¢ HD 6650 Laptop Video System <br>  The amount of video memory 1024 Mb <br>  RAM capacity 4096 Mb Memory type SO-DIMM DDR3 <br>  Maximum memory capacity 8192 Mb Memory slots 2 <br>  640 GB hard drive capacity <br>  Type of optical drive DVD ¬± RW <br>  Wi-Fi <br>  10/100/1000 Mbps Network Card <br>  SD / MMC / MS / MS Pro card reader <br>  Interfaces D-Sub, HDMI, RJ-45 LAN, USB 2.0 x 3, Card Reader, Headphone Jack (2 pcs.) <br>  Laptop battery capacity 4400 mAh <br>  Installed operating system Windows 7 Home Basic 64 <br>  black colour <br>  Complete set Power adapter, Battery, Documentation <br>  Weight 2.60 kg <br>  Width: 382.00 mm Height: 33.00 mm; Depth: 253.00 mm </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128855/</a></p>
