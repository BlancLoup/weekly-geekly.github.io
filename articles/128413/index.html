Do they really want to destroy once and for all an entire population of such a beautiful subspecies as a bureaucrat official ?!  Do they really want to cross out our entire century-long history and turn the process of obtaining the necessary information into a fast, boring and impersonal ... What will happen to our people if they are deprived of the opportunity to communicate with large officials of a small passport office? <br>  But my fears were unnecessary.  The introduction of advanced technologies only served as a driver for their rapid evolution ... They were able to adapt, in spite of all opponents of Darwinian theory ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that I had a desire to get a passport.  I read a lot of reviews about the portal gosuslugi.ru and I realized that a lot of money was spent on it, and all the negative reviews are quite old.  This means that the portal works and can be used. <br>  In order to gain access to public services, I had to first send a request for an activation code that comes through regular mail.  Just in case a request was sent to me and to my spouse.  I will not talk in detail about how, a month after the keys arrived, I had to refill the questionnaire 3 times: the saving function for some 15 million dead American presidents is not provided, but in my request ‚Äúwhere did I fix the house number‚Äù and ‚Äú where my statement was returned ‚Äùthe support service did not respond persistently.  The most interesting began a little later.  When we wanted to get a passport for a child. <br>  I offered to do this to my wife.  In the end, she, too, came the coveted envelope with the access code to public services.  We went to the site, entered numbers, and in response only the red line: "wrong activation code."  Tried several times.  All the same.  And I decided to call support.  I must say - answered quickly.  But their answer surprised me and amazed me.  It turns out that some time ago, my spouse was able to enter the site without an activation code (I opened the envelope myself, and I have no doubt that it was sealed) and DELETED MY PERSONAL OFFICE.  I began to ask the girl operator how such a thing could be.  How to delete your account without activating it?  She began to tell in every way that these are advanced technologies and that you should be able to handle them.  This is the Internet, baby, everything is possible here.  It is so strange to feel when competent and competent "electronic" girls assure you that you did something, but you do not remember it.  Here it is.  Came quietly.

      But that's not all ... This story has an even more interesting continuation.  I decided to apply for the passport to the child through my personal account ... I went in, filled out ... and at the bottom there is a red inscription ‚Äúcheck the accuracy of the entered data‚Äù and the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button is locked. <br>  I checked the correctness for 30 minutes and refilled the questionnaire 3 times.  The result is the same.  Where she did not show the incorrect data.  And I decided to look at the source code.  And there everything is very clear.  The "Send" button will never be unlocked.  No way.  They simply do not. <br>  3 years have passed since the launch of this craft.  It is the launch, not the development.  But nothing has changed.  Money, as I understand it, continues to spend, and the result is 0. I'm wondering, but where is the average developer the advanced miracle?  What is the motivation that lives in him, that he goes and does it?  Do you think they are here on Habr√©?  I really want to hear a first-hand story about the birth of this unusual portal. <br>  And it is also very interesting, the one who ordered this music in general hears that the musicians are not able to play? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128413/</a></p>
