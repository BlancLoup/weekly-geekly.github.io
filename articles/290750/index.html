  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main tasks of a freelancer on the road to becoming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The person who first decided to become a freelancer, is forced to solve many different problems and problems before he gets a steady income.  In this article I will discuss the main. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/089/4ac/90f/0894ac90f2275da96fe4b1d9d3f83913.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, I will give tasks in the order of their occurrence and possible solutions.  I will also make an assumption (although it is rather rude) that the freelancer already knows what he wants to do and has some skills. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So the first task for a freelancer is the choice of exchanges on which it will work.  Of course it is best to work on all significant exchanges in order to have access to the greatest number of projects.  However, this is not very convenient and requires spending time on registration and development.  In addition, different sites have different rating systems and additional services (paid).  Therefore, a good solution would be to choose a few of the largest exchanges or optimal ones in terms of competition and dumping.  But even this option requires some time to explore various options.  Therefore, the most common is the choice of the exchange with which the person first encountered (found through a search engine, advertising, etc.).

      The next task is to gain access to the execution of the project.  When solving this problem, there are two accompanying it: <br><br><ol><li>  How to determine the profitability of the project (the amount of time spent / profit).  Relevant for projects with a constant budget. </li><li>  How to estimate the likelihood that a customer will choose you among other offers. </li></ol><br>  These are complex and nontrivial tasks that are solved by freelancers, as a rule, intuitively, based on experience.  Failure to solve these problems leads to the fact that the freelancer chooses either too unprofitable (‚Äúworking for food‚Äù) or too complex (‚Äúwhat if it happens‚Äù) projects.  As a result, either the freelancer or the customer is dissatisfied. <br><br>  And finally, the strategic task - how to determine its further development and growth.  This task is purely individual and can be solved both purposefully and by chance.  The main options are: promoting yourself on the stock exchanges, teaming up, working primarily with a group of regular customers, a career in a company, etc. <br><br>  Each beginning freelancer faces these tasks, and his success depends on his ability to solve them. <br><br>  Meanwhile, few novice freelancers pay them proper attention.  For example, those who came to freelancing in search of quick and easy money.  In turn, such uncertainty leads to a prejudiced attitude of customers towards beginners. <br><br>  Each of the above tasks deserves a separate and more detailed consideration.  Here you can also add topics of interaction with the customer and an adequate assessment of the value of their work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290750/</a></p>
