  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of several popular Russian cloud / regular Windows VPS providers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day it took me to choose a virtual machine for my own project.  Because  I write on Windows / .Net / Mssql, then, obviously, and hosting needs appropriate.  I chose only from Russian providers because of the need for good pings and simplicity of calculations, since  it will be necessary to work with jur.  the face.  After a not very successful Q &amp; A Q. I myself tested several providers. <br>  <b>Updated</b> Added another provider, added a final comparison <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, as I conducted testing: <br>  I made VPS in the minimum acceptable configuration: 1GB of memory, 1 core (or more, if given), 20GB hard drive or more, the issue price is up to 1500r.  Everywhere I used test accounts, except for scalaxy (I threw 100 rubles there after the limit was exhausted). <br>  Then: <br>  1) Installed all updates on windows <br>  2) Measure speed using Speedtest.net <br>  3) Measured speed of disk operations <br>  4) Compare subjective feelings when working through RDP with work locally <br><br>  So let's get started: 
      <br>

    <h4>  Parking.ru, he's Slidebar.ru </h4><br>  The most brake of all that was tried.  Give the minimum amount of resources for comparable money. <br>  Subjectively - when working through RDP it slows down everything.  Tests of speed of the Internet and disks I will not bring. <br><br><h4>  Cloud4y.ru </h4><br>  Discs.  Give 20GB, you can ramp up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fb/7c9/183/1fb7c91833a6d55aeb0bfaeaff0033b7.png"><br>  <b>Internet:</b> download ~ 70Mbit / s, return 9.5-9.7Mbit / s <br>  <b>Give one core</b> , min.  1330 MHz warranty, up to 2660 MHz <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a41/9ee/c57/a419eec577e259a44be1c2455ae894c6.png"><br>  Subjectively, everything works well, not tupit, updates were made quickly. <br><br><h4>  Scalaxy.ru </h4><br>  Discs.  Give only 15GB, more - for the add.  fee. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fd/98b/10d/8fd98b10d0e1bcf8bd4ae9c50d752097.png"><br>  <b>They give 16 (!) Cores</b> , however at the same time they guarantee 450 MHz per slot, as they say, to be honest, it is not clear. <br>  The Internet! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/486/65f/59b/48665f59bc248d940deb76d56118c37b.png"><br>  I have no words.  And before that I created a VPS with a different address - everything was more / less.  I wrote in support, quickly answered, but the problem was still not solved after 8 hours (# 16494 if that). <br>  Subjectively - everything flies, except for the Internet. <br><br><h4>  1Gb.ru </h4><br>  He was a favorite in terms of price / quality ratio (only 1150r per month), if it were not for one fat BUT that crossed all the advantages. <br>  So: <b>Disks</b> - unfortunately the picture did not work, because  see BUT.  In general, they work satisfactorily, they give immediately 70GB, which is very nice.  The speed is slightly worse than scalaxy. <br>  <b>Give 2 x 2400 MHz</b> , it is unclear whether it is guaranteed <br>  <b>Internet:</b> download ~ 80 Mbit / s, return 9.5-9.7 Mbit / s, which also pleases. <br>  Subjectively, everything works well, the only thing is that for some reason the updates were dumb for a long time, then they were quickly installed. <br>  <b>And now the very thing BUT:</b> I am sending a fiery greeting to this wonderful company and thank God that, to my joy, I did not take hosting from them.  Note that the stated test period is 10 days.  Last night I created a test PPS, and today at 13.00 I received a letter of approximately the following content: <br><blockquote>  Dear hosting user 1Gb.ru <br>  Your xumix account resources have been blocked by an administrator or system because  Account activity violates the rules of using hosting services. <br>  First of all, please log in to your personal account.  Most likely, you will receive a message about the reason for blocking. </blockquote><br><br>  Naturally, there was no reason in the personal account.  Naturally, I did not break anything, all I did was install updates and test the speed of the disks / Internet.  After a letter to the support, after 5 hours, an answer was received with the following content: <br><blockquote>  The test period for your VDS is stopped because  resources required paid users.  You can continue to work, if you pay for services, VDS is not deleted. </blockquote><br>  To which I replied with such a letter: <br><blockquote>  Well, after what happened, I had a little less than any desire to use your services, especially for money.  Thank God that I did not buy right away, although you were the first contender for the move.  Even more glory to God, that this fact happened right away, and not when you would have the projects.  I can only advise to be more attentive to customers, and for example, to warn before disconnecting, and also to write the reason for disconnection. </blockquote><br><br>  Thus, from all in favorites Cloud4y was beaten out, since  only he got an acceptable quality / price of services.  Scalaxy would also look very nice if it were not for a problem with the network. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><h4>  Infobox.ru </h4><br>  The virtualka was created for quite a long time, I hope the rest works well. <br>  Wheels: Give 60GB, which is very nice, the speed also pleases <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/350/8bc/f9c/3508bcf9c0791dd566e263e10d6a81dd.png"><br>  <b>Processor:</b> 1000 MHz - a guarantee, in fact, 2 * 20% of 2 Xeon 5000 series cores (depending on the host) are allocated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6de/8d3/337/6de8d3337e4a67ff321c44d4f22b1718.png"><br>  <b>Internet:</b> 86Mb / s jump, <b>76 Mbit / s upload</b> , very pleased <br>  Subjectively - it works very quickly, I hope so not only on the test period :) <br><br>  <b>UPD2: Prompted</b> <br><h4>  Ihc.ru </h4><br>  <b>Disks:</b> At a 1GB rate (the only one that is given to the test) they give only 10GB, at a 2GB rate they give 25GB already, which is enough.  Also, prices are very affordable - only 1200r for 2GB of airspace.  The speed is very good. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/961/29d/de6/96129dde657d0803e96f53ef16e5897d.png"><br>  <b>Processor:</b> <s>Harp cut hardest.</s>  <s>reserve, here</s> I was wrong in the calculations.  This is the only hoster who writes the <b>maximum</b> frequency.  On the test account, it is noticeable that the runners of operations run unevenly (when logging into the ring system, when checking the progress bar updates), apparently, this is just a consequence of the processor limit on the test rate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/373/046/e45/373046e4547e0423cdd22c8e5aaea190.png"><br>  <b>upd3</b> It would be more logical to compare their tariff for 1200r and 1000-2000 MHz processor, but they do not give it for tests. <br>  <b>Internet:</b> 30-1000 Mb / s jump, 6-150 Mb / s upload, I was slightly shocked, because the speed jumped strongly depending on the server.  Max value - server in the Moscow region, min values ‚Äã‚Äã- in Siberia. <br>  Subjectively - it would be good to try VPS with a lower CPU limit. <br><br>  <b>UPD4: Corrected some</b> text for ihc.ru, added CPU tests <br><br>  <b>UPD5:</b> <br><h4>  vpsville.ru </h4><br>  At the tariff up to 1500r they give quite good resources 2x1600 MHz, 60Gb, 2Gb Ram <br>  <b>Wheels:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/034/08f/80c/03408f80c776fa47c715716a9757cc9f.png"><br>  <b>Processor</b> Such a feeling that the VPS blunts periods, then it works quickly again, although according to tests everything is chocolate.  By the way, the processor - Core i7 920 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/898/f85/7f7/898f857f70ffb3a9bcc27c799eb90e2a.png"><br>  <b>Internet:</b> Everything is clear from the picture - they are hosted / hosted by hetzner <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18c/efc/857/18cefc857b9197ce81ca419d45b86ad4.png"><br>  Subjectively: The site did not cause trust, the control panel is poor, but there is a RDP web client.  VPS itself works well, if you do not take into account incomprehensible slowdowns <br><br>  <b>In total</b> , <s>the leaders were Infobox.</s>  <s>In all respects, the fastest of all, with the proviso that ihc.ru cannot be tested not at the cheapest rate.</s> <br><br>  Vpsville.ru - excellent declared characteristics, in fact, slowdowns are noticeable.  On tests cpu - ahead of everyone.  Internet Germany. <br><br>  Infobox.ru - Good in performance, excellent real speed of cpu and disks, there was not a single lag at work.  Excellent network speed.  Download from microsoft.com 9-9.5Mbyte / sec.  But for 2 days I already managed to catch this: VPS16428 \ (Unplanned) <br><br>  Ihc.ru - Also, with excellent specified characteristics, excellent network speed, but speedtest.net blows away the roof from them, the feeling that the channel is uneven.  Download from microsoft.com 1-1.5Mbytes / sec.  On their 1GB rate, the responsiveness of the system is lower than on similar infobox boxes, possibly due to the two cores of the latter.  For a little more than an infobox, money already gives twice as much cpu and memory, so for now I'm leaning towards this option :) <br><br>  <b>UPD6:</b> <br>  I switched to the 2GB tariff in ihc.ru, the result is strange 1) the subjective responsiveness became better + the flash became less blunt in the browser 2) however, the tests show the incredible: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be4/3b4/a17/be43b4a1760242c4414491781a8e52f6.png"><br><br>  To finish the comparison, I put sql express on the infobox and itz and measured the installation time: <br>  Infobox: Start time: 2012-01-27 18:17:41 End time: 2012-01-27 18:25:26 <br>  Ihc: Start time: 2012-01-27 18:18:17 End time: 2012-01-27 18:26:32 <br><br>  <b>Total Final</b> <br>  Ihc has more memory, but worse with a processor and space <br>  Infobox has better processor and space, but less memory <br>  Choose what is more important to you :) <br><br>  If you have a more positive experience with other providers - you are welcome in comments. <br><br>  For comparison, the speed of the disks on the host machine: <br>  Work hdd <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ca/b22/362/7cab2236204fe8435769f7e1f51e1dfc.png"><br>  Work SSD <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/927/bdd/30b/927bdd30b214f4972986e596edb22c95.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136995/</a></p>
