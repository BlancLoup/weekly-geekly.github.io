Rather, it is difficult to call it a start-up, since the idea was not very new and the mobile marketing market, on which we were going to work, was already formed. <br><br>  Together with a friend, we created the company SMS Pro Group (I will talk about it later), the blog of which we start on Habr√©.  Now it's not about our company, but about the project that we are launching under its wing.

      Throughout my adult life, I didn‚Äôt like ‚Äúbaryg‚Äù - people who make money on people‚Äôs ignorance - no matter whether it‚Äôs informational or legal illiteracy.  <b>It is necessary to create values, and not exploit flaws.</b>  Therefore, I have always admired examples of creating interfaces for ordinary people ‚Äî for example, 1C programs, which reflect in an accessible form all aspects of accounting activity for managers of a small company. <br><br>  <b>Charming Lawyer</b> - a collective image of the ideal assistant.  Smart, beautiful, always available (for emergency communication). ==&gt; <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The birth of an idea </h4><br>  One day, sitting in the tax and seeing crowds of people who, confused by the statements for registration, statutes and protocols, appealed to various "muddy" firms engaged in the registration of LLC and IP, a thought occurred to me.  We must try to somehow shake up this market for profit on the forced inconvenience of people, I thought.  They do not have to understand the constituent documents and documents for registration, but why they pay 5,000 rubles for the preparation of documents, PLUS a fee and STILL for submitting these documents to the tax? <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service <a href="http://easydocs.spb.ru/">Easydocs.spb.ru</a> , a service for preparing documents for registration of LLC and IP in the Russian Federation, grew out of my outrage.  Using Easydocs, you can easily prepare the necessary documents for filing them with the tax <b>authority</b> , as well as get free advice from a <b>charming lawyer</b> . <br>  As a result, our users will be able to receive constituent documents for only 500 rubles and submit them independently.  I will not tell you more in detail - there is an <a href="http://easydocs.spb.ru/%3Fpage%3Dabout">‚ÄúInstruction‚Äù</a> page. <br><br>  Easydocs.spb.ru allows you to register your company in 5 simple steps: <br><ol><li>  Fill out the form on the site and </li><li>  having paid for our services, you get ready-to-print documents for registration, including a receipt for the state fee - </li><li>  Pay your receipt at any bank! </li><li>  A package of ready documents to you in 5 minutes (plus travel to the office) will be certified by our notary. </li><li>  It‚Äôs not terrible to hand over documents for registration to the tax office - an electronic queue and a maximum of 45 minutes over a cup of coffee. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  A little about creating a project </h4><br><h5>  Software part </h5><br>  At the end of 2009, we had a lot of action on mobile marketing and developed various tools for internal use, it was hard to even catch a couple of programmers and designers to create a project.  Everything has fallen on me - a physicist and an economist. If the project succeeds, refactoring and redesign to improve performance is guaranteed, so please do not judge strictly :-) <br>  For programming the interfaces, the <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> js-library was used, the beautiful <a href="http://creativepony.com/demos/sliding-tabs/">SlidingTabs</a> module for Mootools, as well as not-so-crooked hands for javascript and html.  In the depths of the server are hidden PHP + MySQL, which are used to load the address database of KLADR, as well as PDF generation of documents using the fpdf16 library. <br><br><h5>  Site design </h5><img src="http://easydocs.spb.ru/girls/julia/01.png" alt="Julia is a charming lawyer at EasyDocs.spb.ru" align="left"><br>  The charming girl you see on the site is our employee and part-time CEO of the new legal entity ‚ÄúDocuments Online‚Äù - Julia.  She is a lawyer, and for her these are new opportunities in her profession.  A small photo shoot of Charming Lawyer - and here she is on the site.  There was a great temptation to make a more erotic bias ... Do you want?  :-) But we do not need the flow of ‚Äúsouthern guests‚Äù with the phrase ‚ÄúHey, Natasha ...‚Äù ;-) <br>  ... Although the consultation form (on JS and Jabber-server from Olark - conveniently configured and easy to integrate on the site) would help not to cross the line between online and "live communication" ... I saw a post on Habr√© about such systems, and so used then, if you do not develop your own. <br><br><h4>  Here, in principle, and all + distribution of elephants </h4><br>  I will note at the end some points: <br><ul><li>  The legal entity itself, LLC Documents Online, was registered using our service. </li><li>  Payment with RoboKassa </li><li>  For all users and readers, Habr will be acted upon this month. If you send the check number you received after filling out the registration form to <a href="">habr@easydocs.spb.ru</a> or directly to the <b>Charming Lawyer</b> in the form on the site marked ‚ÄúHabrahabr, open! ‚Äù, In response you will receive a link to the ready documents for registration absolutely free. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81595/</a></p>
