I was one of the first to get a novelty on the test.  Despite my alleged dislike of Android, I really liked the device, and Jelly Bean especially. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/785/386/d18/785386d1832b552c5efd7a74199d6efc.jpg" alt="image">

      It looks like 7-inch tablets are becoming the standard for a minimal, pocket-sized tablet.  Some time ago it seemed that the standard would be the device, most likely with a 5 or 5.5 inch display, like the Samsung Galaxy Note.  But first, Samsung itself released several tablets with 7-inch displays, then BlackBerry curbed the same diagonal, then Huawei merged with this trend.  In fact, not only these manufacturers chose exactly 7 inches for their mini-tablet models, but most importantly, now Apple is also going to finally release an iPad mini with a display diagonal of just 7 inches, thereby securing a new standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1a/5b1/bb3/d1a5b1bb37d52dd69e59475976492696.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this series, the release of the joint 7-inch tablet by Google and Asus looks completely natural.  Google Nexus 7 by Asus (that is the name of this device, branded by Google and only manufactured by Asus) was introduced in June of this year and has already been sold in the USA and Europe for several months.  Naturally, gray supplies leaked to Russia.  Moreover, if in the States and Europe, the 8 GB version costs $ 200, and 16 GB costs $ 250, then <a href="">according to Yandex.Market,</a> 8 GB ‚Äúgray‚Äù Nexus 7 costs from 9.5 tons, and 16 GB version - from 12 tons . R.  And this despite the fact that accessibility was declared by manufacturers almost the most important principle of this device.  However, there is every reason to believe that now, with the advent of a certified device at a recommended price of 9,990 rubles.  change and the overall price scenario for this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e2/564/1c7/8e25641c7994886d02eaeb7d6c790d68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately I will say, in order not to return to this topic, that in addition to a more adequate price and warranty from the manufacturer, the certified Nexus 7 has one more advantage.  The fact is that after the device arrived at the stores in the USA and Europe, there appeared <a href="http://7nexus.ru/news/162/">user feedback on sensor and display marriage</a> .  Problems were recognized by manufacturers and corrected in subsequent batches.  So, the Russian, certified Nexus 7 is already from those parties in which the problems have been fixed.  The sample I tested had no problems with the responsiveness of the sensor, as well as with the rest of the hardware and software.  So, I strongly recommend taking exactly the "white" version of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a76/53f/c12/a7653fc12b7f5821cb52b10a143eeb48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now I propose to consider a closer device itself.  So, we have a 7-inch tablet with a TFT IPS-display with a resolution of 1280x800.  The number of pixels per inch is 216, which is not so much, however, the image on the screen looks very clear.  Viewing angles are excellent at all - the image on the display does not deteriorate and does not fade even if you look at it at an angle of 180 degrees.  As a protective coating for the display, not the familiar Gorilla Glass was used here, but another development of the same company, called Corning Fit, which is primarily distinguished by greater transparency.  Perhaps due to this, the image on the display looks really very clear. <br><br>  Above the display is a 1.2 megapixel front camera for video telephony.  The main camera is not here at all, which, in principle, may even be better than having a very average device, for example, a 3 megapixel camera, which is clearly incomprehensible for what will fit, and the device makes it more expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1d/78f/358/e1d78f3581dde9a67f66a8e57e9dc236.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back, non-removable cover is made of rubberized and textured plastic, which is very well reflected in the fixability of the tablet in your hand, and just nice to the touch.  Tablet thickness 11 mm.  Side faces slightly rounded.  On the right side of the side, in the upper part there is an on / off button, it is also a screen lock / unlock button and a volume rocker.  At the bottom there is a micro-USB connector and a 3.5 mm headphone or headset jack.  At first glance, that's all the connectors, but in fact, not all.  On the left side there are contacts for audio-doc, - a certain docking station, either with built-in speakers, or with the ability to connect speakers to it.  In short, these contacts are for audio peripheral equipment that is not yet on sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bae/9d6/18a/bae9d618aade5ab581a869395667b377.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now a few words about the hardware stuffing.  The heart of this tablet is the 4 + 1 nuclear processor NVIDIA Tegra-3, which has already managed to adequately prove itself in many flagship devices from different manufacturers, including Asus.  RAM - 1 GB.  Flash memory - 16 GB.  In the USA and Europe, the 8 GB version is also being sold, but it will not be officially sold here.  As for the performance of all this stuffing, both AnTuTu and Quadrant gave him solid bronze: AnTuTu - after the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and HTC One X, and the Quadrant - after the HTC One X and Asus Transformer Prime TF201.  In short, the performance of the tablet does not hold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/195/d30/011/195d30011e7c201d877ddf31fc5a467d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite this hardware power, considering the Nexus 7 in absentia when it was first introduced, I, frankly, did not see anything attractive in it, well, except perhaps for the price.  There is no 3G module and slot for removable microSD cards, the main camera is also missing, I thought.  Jelly Bean ?!  - Anyway, and the same Android with the same advantages and disadvantages as the simple four.  In general, according to the descriptions Nexus 7 did not make a special impression on me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/649/2da/ced/6492daced6586237c4dac71c9f60760b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But as soon as I had the device on my test, I immediately liked it very much.  The first day I just felt that I like the device, that I did not just want to return to it, but I didn‚Äôt even want to let it out of my hands, but I attributed all my sympathies to the tactile sensations from the back cover.  To hold the Nexus 7 in your hands is really and nice and convenient.  The animation in the Jelly Beam is really much smoother compared to even the ICS, not to mention the previous versions.  The possibility of voice dialing offline is very pleasant, although not critically needed.  Improved notification interface - a much more useful innovation.  Google Now's customized help system for individual alerts is a very elegant interface in terms of interface, which, however, still needs to learn how to use.  The same pleasant and convenient innovation is the ‚Äúsmart keyboard‚Äù, which learns your vocabulary and does not stubbornly impose its own on you.  By the way, the keyboard itself looks, especially when the tablet is vertically oriented, somehow crookedly located, but in practice it is wildly convenient to type text with just such a shift of letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1b/ec4/893/a1bec4893c7f87a4ab9464a7cb4fc22b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But all this, all the same, was not enough to articulate clearly what is particularly pleasant in this device.  I formulated this only the next day, when I realized that by charging the tablet up to 100% last morning, I forgot to put it on charge at night, but when I woke up, I found that there was still 32% in the battery.  And this is despite the fact that yesterday I almost never parted with the device: installed applications, browsed the Internet, listened to music on SoundCloud, watched videos on YouTube and Vimeo, then played Dark Meadow for an hour, and looked at the next dream Vkontakte "Live your life" Godard.  Well, then I slept for 7 hours, and all this time the Nexus 7 remained connected to Wi-Fi. <br><br>  I decided to use it even before the battery was completely discharged and as a result I had almost 18 hours (I subtracted the sleep time) of almost constant work.  This is despite the fact that the manufacturer has stated that 4325 mAh will be enough for 9 hours of viewing Full HD video, which, by the way, firstly, it‚Äôs not clear how to look at the display with a resolution of 1280x800, and secondly, these same 9 hours Full HD videos will not fit on a 16 GB flash drive.  Well, okay, whatever it was, the battery lasts for the most full day.  And this is what Google-branded devices are really good at: perfect software optimization for hardware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98c/403/de8/98c403de8a209e44722a81f912f5036d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, in my opinion, the product is definitely a success.  The restrictions that seemed to me flaws (the lack of a 3G and micro-SD card slot) on the third day of testing seemed absolutely logical to me.  I realized that the Nexus 7 is a very good and at the same time inexpensive tablet, which in style and functionality will suit any family member: a child for games, a teenager for watching a movie or listening to music, dad for business correspondence or browsing, mom for Skype talks, for example.  Of course, he has competitors, in some respects, they outperform the Nexus 7, but in terms of ergonomics and the pre-installed Jelly Bean, they are clearly losing. <br><br>  Well, I think it‚Äôs not necessary to talk about 635 thousand applications in the Play Market.  It is better to look at the review, which shows how all this looks and works in practice. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3-7ouCJlOc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDJkGaXkRGP1qqoUvSvHx3kyheyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154785/</a></p>
