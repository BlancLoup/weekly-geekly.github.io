Unlike the rest of the big three, he looked somehow more or less honestly in my eyes ‚Äî he did not throw in advertising (after the statement), did not pick up prices in Russia, did not connect services himself.  Therefore, despite periodically lower prices from competitors and I did not leave him - there was no desire.  Because, naively convinced of the honesty of my operator, I never ordered the details. <br><br>  But sometime everything happens for the first time, and the excel sheet is unusually lit up in the list of ‚Äúcompleted queries‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      But what do I see in him?  <s>Make me see it out!</s> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cf55a51a/380eb062/fab2fa3f/f48c0ce3.png"><br><br>  and many, many, many such lines. <br><br>  In the end, which of us, biline customers, sitting in a vehicle or standing in a traffic jam did not get a phone out of one‚Äôs pocket and didn‚Äôt read a couple of pages from it on a habr?  So: we <b>paid for it twice</b> , because the effective managers of the respected Beeline decided to charge Opera Mini traffic separately from the rest of the traffic.  For example, from her own DNS query (the only one she performs at startup).  It is this <b>single request that costs 67 kopecks</b> - there is nothing more than him in the session, rounded up to 100 kb. <br><br>  Knowledgeable people suggested a <a href="http://safe.beeline.ru/">section on the Beeline website</a> with a big inscription "Beware scammers!", Which, undoubtedly, symbolizes.  There I stumbled upon a <a href="http://safe.beeline.ru/download/PremiumTraffic.xls">list of sites with premium pricing</a> .  However, the Opera was not there.  I read the contract (by the way, they can unilaterally change it at any time) - there is nothing there either. <br><br>  It's time to <s>reinstall the shind ...</s> contact technical support! <br><br>  Having listened twice to the fact that this was done for my own convenience, I didn‚Äôt understand according to which piece of paper these guys manage to double one physical session twice.  And if so, then after fifteen minutes a written appeal was created, in which my entire experience described above was presented, but in a somewhat more official form.  But the link to this post is also not forgotten in it, just in case. <br><br>  And to you,% username%, I want to advise one obvious thing.  If you have nothing to do at work - download the details and see what you pay for.  Surprises guaranteed. <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/17/2011 23:07</b> I called in the STP.  They said that the charges are correct, piled everything on rounding up to 100 kilobytes.  When I asked about the letter, they said that they had not yet seen the letter (although they promised to meet at 4 o'clock).  We will call tomorrow ... <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/18/2011 10:28</b> Again called STF - they asked to send the letter again.  I sent them cso my mailbox to gmail - suddenly they have angry antispam.  I slightly corrected the text of the letter - I added at the end <i>‚ÄúI would like to emphasize that this situation is publicly discussed at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/126536/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/126536</a> ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/18/2011 15:39</b> I received an answer!  I quote it literally: <br><br>  <i>Answering your question, I inform you that the traffic generated when establishing a connection with the DNS server is not ‚Äúpremium‚Äù, but is charged according to the rates of your tariff.</i>  <i>‚ÄúPremium‚Äù traffic is the traffic that is charged at a price that differs from your tariff plan for the most part.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You rightly pointed out that immediately after launching Opera Mini establishes a connection with a DNS server.</i>  <i>A single DNS request is sent, containing the DNS address of the Opera mini server.</i>  <i>Next, Opera Mini establishes a connection with the selected server and data exchange begins.</i>  <i>Technically, this action is implemented in two different sessions.</i>  <i>This pricing is due to the principles of the work of services based on GPRS and odnakova for all providers that provide services of this kind.</i>  <i>This happens with all addresses, in all applications and browsers, whether paid or free content.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>Do they want to say that they charge TCP connections?</b>  Rounding them up to 100 kilobytes?  Open the tariff plan, read the following: <br><br>  <i>21. The volume of transmitted / received data during the session is rounded up with an accuracy of up to 100 KB.</i>  <i>Session is the time from the moment when the Internet connection was established until its completion.</i> <br><br>  But what is an ‚ÄúInternet connection?‚Äù GPRS session or TCP session? <br><br>  I sent them a letter with this question.  Waiting for an answer. <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/20/2011</b> I began to explain that without a TCP connection, data transfer will not work.  Interestingly, do they know about UDP? <br><br>  <i>Dear Artem!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for the trust that you have shown using the services of our company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Answering your question, I inform you that this tariffing is a feature of the work of services based on GPRS, incl.</i>  <i>browsers and applications.</i>  <i>In another way, without a TCP connection, the ability to access the Internet from your mobile device is not implemented.</i>  <i>Technically, the session data in the detailed report is reflected in this way, and there is no other representation of charges for Internet access.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/24/2011</b> Actually, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/126536/%3Freply_to%3D4189023">first progress</a> is. <br><br>  <b>Free detailing only 8650rub per month for Moscow!</b>  <a href="">mobile.beeline.ru/msk/news/russia.wbp?id=aac8dd78-c78f-4f4c-9e4d-5e968450bcf5</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126536/</a></p>
