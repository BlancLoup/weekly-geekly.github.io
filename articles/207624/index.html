  <section class="page js-page"><h1>White and black</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the publication of a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telebreeze/blog/206880/">review article about IPTV players</a> , one of the comments to it led to the reasoning and comparison of Internet services for watching Russian TV online.  The most popular by ear is the TV Picture service, but, unfortunately, it is fully paid.  Therefore, I cannot say anything about the quality of the video, about the usability of it.  But one advantage can be noted, the picture broadcasts not only through the Internet service, but also through the player, which can be downloaded from their website, and also sells its Set-Top-Box.  Thus, they endeared themselves and fans to watch online, without any installations of various kinds of program, but also those who prefer to have software specially for themselves.  Next, I will talk about free services that you can "touch" yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/442/281/4e2/4422814e20f730ebd6f5c04c5bf82dce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first, on request "tv online" in the google search engine, the Boar TV is displayed, so let's start. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://kaban.tv/">Kaban.TV</a></b> <br>  Boar TV provides only Russian TV channels.  In the arsenal of service 19 channels.  The site has a TV program for each channel, you can view already broadcast live TV shows from the archive.  The service is only aimed at showing the video.  therefore, no additional features are provided.  But with such a focus on the exceptional provision of video content, the picture quality could be better.  In general, if it is important for you to watch some very important issue of the TV show and you are not picky about the interface or the quality of playback, feel free to go in and start watching.

The site has more than 1000 online broadcasts of Internet and TV channels from around the world and their number is constantly increasing.  Channels are divided by broadcasting countries and by category.  The picture quality is better than the previous one, although not by much.  A big plus is that the broadcast speed is indicated opposite each TV channel, in general it varies from 100 to 5000 kbit / s.  These points are not taken into account in vain, on the website you can evaluate your speed and compare it with the one shown next to the TV channel.  There is also a list of necessary players that need to be on the user's computer in order to watch TV, you can add TV channels to your bookmarks for easier navigation through the site, but in order to use it you need to register.  In general, the service contains a large variety of content from different countries of the world and for the user on the site the most necessary points are sufficiently taken into account for ease of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64e/95f/235/64e95f235e2e7596d328f96502baa95b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://tvspectr.ru/">Tvspectr.ru</a></b> <br>  They offer about 140 Russian-language channels, which are divided into categories.  Good picture quality, user-friendly TV channel selection interface - the TV channel selection icon is located in the control panel.  The important point is that you can choose the quality of playback, the service offers two options - HQ and LQ.  In addition to watching TV online, the service offers to listen to the radio online and a separate online cinema.  This service is very convenient, you can watch your favorite TV shows, separately download online your favorite movies and listen to your favorite radio wave using one service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dd/e15/978/7dde1597859b703d9782efe759a0f6d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://gipnomag.ru/">Hypnomag</a></b> <br>  To watch TV online, you need a flash player installed in your browser.  The service offers for viewing about 100 TV channels.  It should be noted, in comparison with the previous considered services, high quality pictures.  The service itself is supplied with various additional chips for the user besides online tv - online photoshop (honestly, I don‚Äôt know what it is here for. Probably to help if you suddenly remembered while watching tv that you didn‚Äôt process ‚Äúavatar for contact‚Äù), online ISQ and online video chat "Roulette" (the first addition is necessary if suddenly you urgently need to chat with someone of your friends or just got bored, and the second - to search for new friends, or again just got bored).  Sport blocks, Yandex live broadcast are highlighted in separate blocks (you can watch what people are looking for right now, but here you need an Adobe Flash player).  There is an online radio and online aquarium (a little entertainment for those who have nothing to do).  This service is very pleased with the quality of the video.  In general, he is very suitable for those who are constantly watching TV and loves to talk, and when it gets boring for him, he wants to somehow diversify his time-consuming pastime. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/384/0c8/8323840c8e503cbcee5207b529cb80ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://ovego.3dn.ru/">Ovogo</a></b> <br>  A large number and variety of TV channels, the service provides about 1,500 channels, sorted by category.  There are also additional features like watching online radio, online games, watching individual videos online, a forum and a speed test.  In general, the service contains everything that is necessary for the user's entertainment, in my opinion there is nothing superfluous.  There is a mini chat and the right on the site constantly shows the latest news.  The creators constantly keep in touch with users, arranging mini-polls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5e/d22/f6c/d5ed22f6c84d670b0784f744306c38ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://megaonlinetv.narod.ru/">MegaonlineTV</a></b> <br>  At first glance, there are 70 TV channels divided into three main groups: Russian TV, Foreign TV, and Ukrainian TV.  I was pleased that each channel is provided for viewing in several bitrate options.  You can choose the most suitable for yourself.  Additional contains online radio.  and a separate block highlighted series.  So far there is only one series in this block, but the creators have room to grow.  Also, the creators are worried about the user's convenience and offer on the site to download the necessary plug-ins to view. <br><br><br>  And lastly, consider the simplest service <b><a href="http://lapti.tv/">Lapti TV</a></b> <br>  In the arsenal of service only 20 channels.  Pleases good picture quality and the ability to view from the archive.  A program is provided for each channel. <br><br><br>  In principle, everything!  It remains only to find out your opinion about what is better: <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telebreeze/blog/207624/">TV in the browser</a></b> or <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telebreeze/blog/206880/">TV in the player</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207624/</a></p>
