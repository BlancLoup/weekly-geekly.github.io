Although even if you did not finish anything, I think you didn‚Äôt lose much. <br><br>  What is happening in our time with the education system, why instead of good specialists (and as far as this olders' opinion is said to be a graduate, let's not forget that the greatest people were more often not graduated) we get old farting people who consider themselves educated. <br><br>  Of course, in this article I will not raise, beer and laziness trainees, and consider only the teachers and the style of teaching in the CSP.  Why a person who must become an engineer cannot distinguish a screw from a nut by the 5th year, why the future economist does not know the economic system of our country (not to mention the economies of other states).  No, not because.

      Not because these unfortunate specialists do not study, the fact is rather that there are no teachers in Russia, there are professors, but the professor is far from a teacher.  The fact is that the main part refers to the process of teaching more like how to beat a person in the head with a formula, and not how to teach him to think, why tell him that the crossed surface is the surface that someone else crossed if you can give He has such knowledge that would allow him to give such a definition to himself, without referring to the dictionary of explanatory words. <br><br>  Yes, it turns out that way - although I, as a student, have often heard from a teacher, we want to teach you how to think, but after a second, for some reason, a person forgets these words and again tries to hammer you into the formula of fake success.  What we can get from a person who graduated 40 years ago from a university, naturally, against the background of the whole gray mass, he stood out, so he chose the path of lecturer, but no one ever thinks about being a teacher, you have to be not just smart ... <br><br>  Let's look at people who teach technical sciences, what they lack to teach a person to think correctly, of course, there is no such elementary concepts about psychology and pedagogy in his skull box, as well as the fact that all these people were brought up in those times of great old years, and therefore they carry this old age to the new generation, which in turn imperceptibly begins to permeate them, although this new society is trying to show the opposite.  And what we have in the end, of course, is that old-age lives and thrives with new forces, in a new society. <br><br>  But nevertheless, where is that glorified education system about which the whole world has been talking for centuries.  Why is it only in the center, but this is the correct answer.  Of course, the whole thing is in a state that does not stimulate the transition of people from the same Moscow State University to the periphery.  Well, God bless him.  Still, why old-age thrives mostly outside large metropolitan areas ... the question is very complex and the solutions to it will give rise to a truly great state.  And we can only think and fight, may the gun be with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5742/</a></p>
