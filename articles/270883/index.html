  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HighLoad ++ 2015 through the eyes of a foreign speaker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  Once upon a time, 4 years ago, when I was sitting in Bishkek, I watched the video from the conference and thought what kind of speakers were cool specialists and did not even think that I would get to this conference as a speaker.  In this article I will tell you about that.  how I applied, how I prepared and how the conference itself took place. <br><br>  I submitted the application on January 19 of this year, and on October 5th it was approved.  There was a lot of joy, of course, and it was time to prepare for the report. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Training </h5><br>  My colleague helped me with the preparation of the report and we prepared it with us for about 3 weeks. <br>  The organizers themselves also helped very well with the preparation, arranging webinars on the structure of the report, slides, ability to speak in public, and also gave personal trainings on Skype.  Due to this, the report turned out to be very interesting and detailed.  Then we practiced with him in the office, presenting it to our colleagues and flew to Moscow.

    <h4>  Day 0 </h4><br>  Upon arrival, we settled in the hotel "Aquarium", which was located in the same building where the conference will be held, the rooms in which were provided by the organizers.  On the same day, full-time training in public speaking was scheduled.  The essence was the following, that you need to make a report for 10-15 minutes, and people in the hall gave a feedback on the behavior on stage.  It was very interesting to see their mistakes in the behavior on the stage, to communicate with other speakers and also to look at the construction and installation works.  Indeed, on this day the conference hall was being prepared, and in general, it was very interesting to observe the construction site and to start to orient ourselves around the site. <br>  Also, it was very hard for us to imagine the scope of what will be at the conference itself. <br><br><h4>  How was the conference </h4><br>  Came the first day of the conference.  We came to the place, started to check in and were surprised at how well the queues were balanced, so we were registered in a minute. <br>  I liked the package that we were given during registration. <br>  It was: <br><ol><li>  A folder with two notebooks: one with abstracts and a second empty notebook for notes </li><li>  Badge </li><li>  A pen </li><li>  Sheet with the conference program. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bc/1a0/948/8bc1a094862141e99d138d343b649773.png"><br><br>  Passing into the hall, we found a huge number of people.  They were very different.  Bearded and not very.  With a stomach and thin.  The concentration of gurus was high.  There were also many booths for those who want to talk with the developers of a particular technology.  There were both Nginx, and Sphinx, and Erlyvideo, located under the Video stand, and MySQL, and Postgresql.  Each booth sparked interesting discussions with developers. <br><br>  The first day turned out to be very rich in acquaintances and conversations on the sidelines.  They even brought out for themselves several technologies that they wanted to plan, touch and get to know them closer. <br><br>  The second day was just as interesting.  On the second day, after the first coffee break, I made presentations on how to build an architecture for a fail-safe taxi service. <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/55104806&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7uMFxtCTRXTuZNnR0QBO3qgKG3w" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h5>  General impressions about the conference and interesting acquaintances. </h5><br>  When there is an opportunity to talk about the technologies that you use with the developers of these technologies - it is always cool.  You can express gratitude for their work and products, and for one thing, ask about development processes, new features and release dates. <br>  They asked the guys from Nginx about nginScript, HTTP / 2.  In Percona, on the release of percona server 5.7.  We talked for a long time with the guys from Posgtres-professional about the cluster in PG and using it as a whole. <br>  They also asked Qrator labs about interesting cases they had in practice. <br><br>  In general, all people could catch the language and something to discuss for a long time.  There were also open discussions in the tech talks format, in which this or that technology was discussed. <br><br>  An interesting observation is that the guys who make open products themselves are very open to communication. <br><br>  And it was also very convenient to go into one room after the coffee break and listen to all the reports about post-breaks before the next coffee break. <br><br><h4>  About trends </h4><br>  This year's trends were: Postgresql, In-memory DB, Docker, DevOps, frontend performance. <br>  From the reports I liked all the reports about the databases, the report from classmates, how they switched to the new Linux distro, and about testing accidents from them. <br><br>  The only thing that was not convenient throughout the conference was the fact that the Internet did not work.  No wi-fi, no mobile in the building. <br><br><h4>  Completion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say thanks to the following people: <br><ul><li>  Oleg Bunin - for the opportunity to participate in the conference as a speaker. </li><li>  Roman Poborchy - for training and preparing for the conference on slides and the general structure of the report </li><li>  Maxim Lapshin - for technical assistance in the structure of the report. </li></ul><br><br>  Well, in short, the conclusions are: <br><ul><li>  Those who think whether to go or not, the answer is to go. </li><li>  Those who think whether to apply for a report - try, it is quite possible that you will be lucky :) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270883/</a></p>
