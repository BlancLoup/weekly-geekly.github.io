It is worth noting that now we will talk about "real" advertising mailings, and not about informational messages from the cellular operator or from your bank / provider. <br>  On October 22, 2013 I received another advertising sms, I didn‚Äôt give a call to this company asking me to explain how I found myself on the mailing list, and I decided to apply to the FAS (Federal Antimonopoly Service). <a name="habracut"></a>  It should be noted that this happened before the decision to cancel the reception of sms from senders containing letters in the "From" field, this SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55e/332/d6e/55e332d6e1530eaca7161f4ee6d27263.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the FAS rules, an application must be submitted at the place of residence of the person to whom the advertising sms was sent.  Go to the local site of FASA and see the link <a href="http://altk.fas.gov.ru/news/6475">RULES FOR SUBMISSION OF COMPLAINTS TO NAZOUSIV SMS-advertising</a> .  I had to go to the office of the mobile operator and take a copy of the service agreement, describe in my own words the fact of receiving the SMS message, attach a screenshot of the phone, a copy of the agreement and call detail.  If you want to write there, then do not forget to write in the body of the letter consent to the processing of personal data (this is important).

      After a month has passed, the operators are taking certain steps to limit the activity of spammers, and on November 25, 2013 a representative of the junk spammer company calls me, calls me by name, and tries to make an appointment for me in my city to ‚Äútalk‚Äù about my statement to FAS .  I did not succeed in getting an explanation of the purpose of our meeting from him, but it seems to me that I could be forced to take the application out of FAS, the next day due to lack of time I refused him a meeting, after which they sent outright threats and promises to regret. <br>  And really.  Today, I received a lot of calls from people who were puzzled why they would advertise various goods and services from <b>my</b> cell number, from home delivery of alcohol to plastic windows.  The offended company must have arranged an sms-mailing, but not just with my number, but where my number was the sender, and in the text of the letter was my name. <br><br>  Summarizing, I will say this.  By submitting a complaint to the FAS, you agree to the complete processing and transfer of your personal data (full name, mobile phone number) not only to the operator, but also to third parties, including the spammer himself.  Once again realize this - along with a complaint about spam from the OFAS, an unscrupulous advertiser will receive your number and possibly your full name.  (proof <a href="http://altk.fas.gov.ru/news/6475">altk.fas.gov.ru/news/6475</a> ) <br><br><blockquote>  In accordance with the Federal Law of July 27, 2006 No. 152- ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù, in your appeal, you must express your consent to the transfer of your personal data (full name, cell phone number) to the mobile operator or to third parties on sending SMS of an advertising character, as well as to law enforcement agencies for carrying out operational investigative activities. <br></blockquote><br>  Know, dear habravchane that you can easily make a newsletter, where your mobile number will be the return number, and the operator will have nothing to do with it formally (in Megaphone, they found it difficult to explain this only by accepting the complaint and promising to write in writing) <br><br>  And the last.  I am writing this post to warn everyone who is complaining about sms-spam, so that they know what a FAS complaint is about spam.  If you provide insufficient data in the application, who will return it;  if you specify all the necessary data, they will be used against you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/fc2/771/8e2fc27714dd288570c11bda637f9390.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/78PCp"><b>The decision of the OFAS from 07.29.2014</b></a> <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204000/</a></p>
