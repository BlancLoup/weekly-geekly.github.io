In this topic, we will be delighted by <b>Anastasia Koshkodayeva</b> and <b>Andrey Tselibeev</b> , a senior localization engineer and manager for documentation and localization of Kaspersky Labs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c8/537/3c7/2c85373c7894a64e2e2fe9d12323da84.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Anastasia Koshkodaeva</b> , Senior Localization Engineer.</i> <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab's anti-virus software is sold all over the world - from the USA to Japan and is available in more than a dozen languages, including Arabic, Chinese and Norwegian.  The product line is updated every year, and in almost every case the interface and technical documentation are changed.  Imagine the volume of localization.  Anastasia and Andrew are working to ensure that all materials are first prepared and then translated without errors and discrepancies of terminology in a very short time and with the most optimized costs. <br><br>  At Kaspersky Lab, the translation process is highly technological: a translation memory, controlled documentation language with minimally project-dependent wording, cross-project databases and a single glossary of languages, and an interesting project planning system are used.  There is something to learn. <br><br>  In her report, Anastasia and Andrei will reveal methods of two-step quality control: at the translation stage, using the tools of visual localization, and at the stage of linguistic / cosmetic testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f05/d0b/09f/f05d0b09f7a1a5fc6387ecae7043bb8e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Natalia Gladkaya</b> , Head of Plarium localization department</i> . <br><br>  Natalia Gladkaya, head of the Plarium localization department, will make a report on the topic ‚ÄúLocalization of games‚Äù.  Plarium is one of the fastest growing game developers in the world.  Their products invariably occupy the tops in the Appstore and Google Play.  However, the "experienced Jedi Knights" Plarium is not often pleased with public speaking, so their performance at LocKit can be called exclusive. <br><br>  Natalia herself in her specialty is a teacher of economics.  Experience at school prepared Natalia for any trials, which is why she decided to go into the gaming industry :) In Plarium she has been working since 2011, first as an editor-translator, since 2012 she is the head of the localization department.  During this time, under her leadership, localized more than 10 game projects in 8 languages. <br><br>  The working title of the report is ‚ÄúLocalization of social games: theory versus reality‚Äù (perhaps it will change).  We will discuss the localization of social games on the example of the ‚ÄúRules of War‚Äù - the flagship project Plarium.  Natalya, together with the audience, will track all stages of the project localization and talk about how the game localization rules work in the military field. <br><br>  Novice developers (and not only them ...) will also benefit from the report of Nadezhda Lynovaya ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/epoha3004/" class="user_link">Epoha3004</a> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/allcorrect/blog/190324/">here is her entry on Habr√©</a> , by the way), the head of the quality control department of localization at All Correct Language Solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/a5e/fea/981a5efea0a9e38fdb551991b83c39b6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Nadezhda Lynova</b> , Head of Localization Quality Assurance, All Correct Language Solutions.</i> <br><br>  Nadezhda is responsible in our company for the development of localization technical processes and the implementation of quality control systems in them.  For 4 years of work, she took part in almost 150 projects: from tiny casual toys to large-scale MMORPGs.  Her experience as a speaker is also diverse in formats and ‚Äúsizes‚Äù: from ‚Äúvigorous five minutes‚Äù on FlashGAMM to a two-hour localization seminar on KRI (who are interested, can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfMojBxnPcww%26list%3DTLMd5NfQRIjSw">see the recording here</a> ). <br><br>  This time, Hope will talk about how the technology of preparing the game for localization depends on its genre.  The following examples were chosen: a social game in the genre of farm / city builder, a mobile game in the genre of hidden object, a mobile game in the genre of word puzzles. <br><br>  In his report, Hope will consider the following questions: <br><ol><li>  Localization of the interface into different languages: working with windows, buttons, line length. </li><li>  Localization of in-game text: extracting text from the build of the game, correctly composing lokkit, preparing materials for translation. </li><li>  Farm / city builder - a system of achievements, helping friends: learn how to work with tags. </li><li>  Hidden objects - when the context is vital for the translator.  Work with additional materials, linguistic testing. </li><li>  Word puzzles - how to make the game interesting in different markets.  Consideration of the features of various localization languages. </li></ol><br>  If you want to learn how to properly prepare materials for localization, so that it would not be excruciatingly painful for aimlessly spent money, or just to see what Chinese crossword puzzles look like, come!  It will be interesting! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/0b7/f0c/d0c0b7f0cfbcd7a90b57e307c0a8dd30.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Abdurakhman Zulumkhanov</b> , Head of Linguistics, Multillect.</i> <br><br>  Machine translation in localization - is it possible?  Abdurakhman Zulumkhanov, Head of Linguistics, Multillect will tell us about this.  Multillect is a unique automatic machine translation system that embodies the most modern approaches in the development of such systems. <br><br>  From the report, you will learn about the shortcomings of existing machine translation systems, how to adapt modern machine translation systems to localization and get a rapid increase in quality, and, of course, about the solutions and prototypes of the Multillect system. <br><br>  By the way, in the last announcement we mentioned the competition.  We are glad to announce that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/scalywhale/" class="user_link">scalywhale has</a> won a free ticket to the conference, our congratulations! <br><br>  Registration for the conference continues, hurry to <a href="http://www.lockitconf.ru/"><b>register for the conference</b></a> and find out everything about localization. <br><br>  In the end, as always, thanks.  The <a href="http://softoolkit.com/">Internet project Softoolkit has</a> become the sponsor of the LocKit conference.  On the project website, you can find a description of various translation and localization software, starting with Translation memory and ending with terminology products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193248/</a></p>
