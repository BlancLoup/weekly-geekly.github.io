  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geoffrey Moore's Double Penetration Theory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably many startups know how the markets are developing according to Jeffrey Moore's theory - from innovators to the early majority (pragmatists), jumping across the chasm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6a4d3f51/b75dbc48/48a478e1/cbf00587.png"><br>  It turned out that this theory is applicable not only to the markets, but also to the development of, in fact, human communities.  Here in Kopini the theory worked in these two planes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We started working with providers in January 2011. Cold contacts were creaking, especially meeting the companies was impossible due to geographical reasons: they called, knocked, persuaded, promised, made remote presentations, developed scripts, techniques, etc.  We processed about 300 providers, spent a lot of nerves and energy.  As a result, the needs, structure of companies, development priorities were well researched, and several desperate innovators were recruited who decided to implement the <a href="http://copiny.com/">service</a> . <br>  Within a few months, Copiny brought real benefits in numbers (reducing the load on support by 50-70%), even the ROI from implementation was calculated.  Then, after some lull, the providers began to knock themselves. <br>  Moore predicted this: common parties, forums, places where potential customers communicate, will eventually work as a catalyst - innovators who have successfully introduced the product, tell colleagues about our decision, share their experience and people start thinking ‚Äúdamn if the solution works, it brings benefits ... and already with several colleagues, why not pay attention to him. " <br>  And everything ... it started ... more than 50 providers in Russia and the CIS themselves turned to us, the agencies that work with them began to call, in general, ‚ÄúTornado Mura‚Äù is expected =) <br><br>  Exactly the same situation arises within communities, among the company's clients: at first, people are not very willing to go to the community, many do not believe in quality support, do not see the point in appeals.  Only innovators who are interested in a new communication method are ‚Äútesting‚Äù it.  But when a certain number of topics accumulate (for providers according to our statistics 50-100), a high activity begins, an early majority comes, and the very community is formed. <br>  Customers see that the company can be easily and easily addressed, that they can be heard, they start asking urgent questions, and if the company answers them and admits that it may have problems, rather than sending customers somewhere, it‚Äôs fantastic loyalty grows in a way, the negative is smoothed out, brand advocates appear who, without any salaries and other motivations, help to respond to appeals and participate in support. <br><br>  The bottom line is that the <b>main thing is not to give up</b> .  Neither the services that throw the case in half way, nor the companies that despair to communicate with customers.
