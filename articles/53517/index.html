  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top sites of the Belarusian Internet: February 2009</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our study covers the period of February 2009 and is based on open sources.  Summarized data are presented in the summary table.  Sites are located in terms of average daily audience, recorded by various statistical systems. <br><br>  The largest number of resources bynet is in the Akavita rating.  We took from there the first two pages of the overall rating.  A significant number of sites are present in another Belarusian ‚Äúcounter‚Äù - Open.by (or all.by), although there are not entirely Belarusian ones among them.  The data on the same site for these two ratings sometimes differ, in some cases the difference reaches several thousand visitors and more.  In the final table, we took the greatest value. <br><br>  Akavita distinguishes Belarusian and foreign audiences.  The leaders of the rating, with rare exceptions, can rightfully call themselves Belarusian resources, since the share of the local public in them exceeds 90%.  A number of sites, on the contrary, are more in demand abroad, and their participation in our research is controversial.

      Some resources - and there are quite a lot of them - do not participate in ratings in principle and do not advertise their attendance.  Despite this, Internet services make it possible to enlighten these ‚Äúblack holes‚Äù and roughly estimate their weight. <br><br>  Search engine number 1 in the world - Google - assigns rank to all known resources, PageRank.  The biggest rank has ... you guessed it?  - actually Google, 10 points!  For comparison, the Russian equivalent, Yandex, deserves only 8 points.  Of our sites, few reach 7, but this is a very, very good mark.  (Only 9 sites out of 100 have such an assessment!) <br><br>  Yandex has its own, more understandable and open tool for measuring the value of a site - Citation Index.  Focusing on it, we flipped through Yandex.  Catalog: Belarus, choosing Belarusian sites with high IC.  There are 30 resources with a CI of 1000 or more points.  As in the case of Google PR, you can get the value of Yandex Yandex yourself by entering the url of a specific site in the next search string. <br><br>  Finally, Alexa measures the popularity of sites using the special Alexa Toolbar, displaying the mysterious Traffic Rankings.  According to the report of this company, among the 100 top resources assigned to the Belarus region, only 33 are creations of Belarusians and local residents, and the rest probably attract the attention of the Belarusian audience. <br><br>  So, the absolute leader of the Belarusian Internet is the portal TUT.by, the desktop website of the Internet.  The total audience of all of its projects, most likely, is 300-400 thousand people every day!  No one breathes in his head and no one encroaches on his leadership.  The top three includes another well-known portal Open.by and the cute Onliner that has stepped over the borders of the Bynett.  At the same time, it is necessary to investigate the growth dynamics of the audience of other sites.  At the end of February, the estimated amount of visitors to the remaining projects included in the review reaches 560 thousand;  let's see what will happen in six months. <br><br>  With regard to the subject of the resources presented, it does not differ much.  Mass media, help, thematic resources, announcements clearly dominate.  Nearby are sites of the same orientation.  Private and "home" resources coexist along with portals and large commercial projects. <br>  Source: <a href="http://tishkoffconsult.com/bynet/top_sites_bynet_200902.php">tishkoffconsult.com/bynet/top_sites_bynet_200902.php</a> <br>  Site summary table: <a href="http://tishkoffconsult.com/bynet/200902_all.php">tishkoffconsult.com/bynet/200902_all.php</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53517/</a></p>
