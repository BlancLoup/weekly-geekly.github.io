  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why professionals go out of business unimportant</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is more to life than the unarmed brain sees. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  A week ago, I, in the company of two of the smartest people, participated in the negotiations on the development of one interesting and promising service.  For myself, from these negotiations, I brought several contradictory truths.  The first was the truth that ideas and resources (people, money) are only part of what you need to take off. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      <strong>Trap lack of experience</strong> <br><br>  Developing a concept for three variegated resources in parallel, I very well see and feel the ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù of the position of a new person - even after finding an idea and money, you can lose people and not achieve anything just because you lack experience.  You do not have all the knowledge, but you have to make decisions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Paradox: if I try to hire someone or include in the project as a partner to take advantage of his experience, a professional may prefer me to more experienced companies, even if their conditions are less attractive in some way.  No experience - it means that you need to recruit it, but to get experience, you already need a certain level.  Vicious circle. <br><br>  Experience is what venture capital companies invest in start-ups, if they at least understand something about the topic for which they undertake.  Yes, often the venture fund has enough business plan and the intuition of a project selection manager to buy a stake in a promising project and get rid of it.  But in this venture process, it is not only about simple resources.  Venture invests management decisions and builds business processes inside the emerging company.  Yes, it often happens that other people's business processes kill the creative energy of a startup, but without understanding and experience, too, rarely does anyone survive. <br><br>  <strong>Practice sinker</strong> <br><br>  This became the second truth: venture companies are therefore smaller than the rest - the ‚Äúout of ten survives alone‚Äù model is not universal, not because the market will not survive, but because people will not suffer: professionals do not like to risk precisely because see both risks and barriers.  They know how to do it.  And because of them rarely get good entrepreneurs, unless it is a frame from a rare category of revolutionaries. <br><br>  Experience as an investment is tightly connected with the experience of a sinker, pulling down if you create something new, or just your own, and do not go along the beaten paths. <br><br>  <strong>Gradual rule</strong> <br><br>  The third truth is more from the practice of negotiations, an elementary truth about the inner comfort of the negotiator.  In order for you to be calm, your <em>real</em> sentence should have more than you give in the form of a formal sentence. <br><br>  In other words, if you are building a dam for a hydroelectric power plant, then a good offer consists not only of justification, a package of documents and approvals, but also includes a miscalculation of the long-term environmental impact, and moreover, also a forecast of social consequences and prospects for the development of industry and transport in region.  You cook it, but you don‚Äôt show it right away, giving it in portions instead, so as not to surprise and confuse the customer.  Gradually, gradually.  In ideal conditions, the customer becomes the designer of the designer‚Äôs plans - your plans, because even before the real foundation construction work began five years ago, and three years ago the first turbine generators were put under load, you already calculated that it will be here in fifteen years old. <br><br>  This is what distinguishes the perfectionist-designer, who lays in the project more detail than requested in the order.  This is what characterizes a professional.  And this is what most projects bury before they start. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Whoever talks with you, whoever is on your team during such discussions - try so that no one is aware of all your trumps and layouts.  This leaves room for maneuver, and you will always have one last chance - to give something that will allow the customer or contractor to understand that he has received more than he expected.  Underpromise, overdeliver.  This too seldom succeeds, appreciate and create such opportunities. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Be quiet. <br><br>  Journal Discussion: <a href="http://urbansheep.livejournal.com/1576701.html">Experience as an investment-and-anchor, and about aces in the sleeve</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3628/</a></p>
