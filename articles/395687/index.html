Last weekend (June 17-19), <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/">2GIS</a> was held by City Hackathon in Moscow.  As you may have guessed from the title - the event was dedicated to improving life in urban environments - such a concept of "smart home", scaled to "smart city". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cf/f84/c48/6cff84c4896a6f69acfdad5a1d55e9dc.png"><br><br>  The main criterion by which the projects were selected - the connection with the urban theme and the solution of the problems of residents.  There were additional bonus points for using the provided gadgets and technologies, but even without them, as many as 37 teams came to the start, and the choice of the winner made our experts break their heads.  That was interesting on the hakathon, how it went and who won - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">About projects</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://hackathon.2gis.ru/projects/">All projects</a> could be divided into 4 categories: solving technical or organizational problems, solving logistics and transportation problems, projects for commerce and projects for leisure.

      According to the hackathon participants, the main problems of the big city are the ecology, trips to work / home and difficulties in organizing rest and walks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/300/cb5/75a/300cb575ab6422660047e5de67f93774.jpg"><br><br>  This time one of the most popular ways to solve the problems found was the creation of telegram bots, which, however, is clear - this is not a service + mobile application with all the charms of the backend / frontend / interface type to do.  Faster, easier and with the demonstration of special problems will not be.  :) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Commerce projects and aggregators</font> </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of projects</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">Schedules</font> </h4><br>  Mobile application designer for scheduled organizations.

A little later, a fourth, special nomination from the partner of the hackathon, M.Video, appeared, which involved developing solutions for smart devices and wearable gadgets as part of the comfortable life of a modern person in the city.  The company believes that the distribution of bracelets, trackers and other wearable devices will in the future affect various spheres of our life, from rest to the use of urban transport.  The main thing - how to manage all this. <br><br>  However, the ‚ÄúBest Design‚Äù position was not in demand, but one of the applications thwarted applause and made the entire audience laugh at the pitch and present the results several times, for which they received the ‚Äúre-nominal‚Äù award ‚ÄúFor passion for work‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">So, the winner in the category ‚ÄúFor passion to work‚Äù - the project ‚ÄúWhere is Schaverma?‚Äù (With greetings from Peter!)</font> </h4><br>  Fantastic dedication to the shaver business, love for this kind of street-food and the fiery story of the author that he runs a blog with reviews of various ...  Shavermachechnyh? .. Shavermennyh? .. In general, you understand.  For humor, for devotion, for the whole audience laughing and applauding - a well-deserved reward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2eb/ac2/630/2ebac26304d7a8fc441715265ca3c91b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">A special nomination from ‚ÄúM.Video‚Äù went to the project ‚ÄúNo Stress‚Äù.</font> </h4><br>  The main criterion for obtaining a place in this category was the use of smart gadgets from our partners, and here the guys turned to their fullest.  Combining the technologists of the smart home and the ability to track when the user left the workplace, the guys made a system that helps to rest and relax after a hard day.  Just imagine - you come home, and there your favorite temperature, comfortable level of humidity and level / color temperature of lighting, a computer and all the necessary programs are running (it would be nice if the dinner was hot, but this feature is not there yet).  And in the afternoon everything was turned off and no one burned electricity for nothing.  Definitely deserved! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">Best App for the City - House Rankings</font> </h4><br>  It is one thing - a residential residential complex, and another - an objective reality.  Take data on the environment, transport and social infrastructure, mix with reviews and information about the state of the housing stock, add a little programmer magic and you will know where to live better.  Or refer to the House Rating project - they have already done everything for you and for you.  Respect! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/300/6b6/fcc/3006b6fcc030fac1a6665a08f11d6fb2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">Best Technologies - API Sal</font> </h4><br>  Despite the strange name and not very clear description of the project, the guys demonstrated just amazing stuff.  You take a GPS track, feed it to the service, and it ‚Äúgoes‚Äù for you along the street and tells about everything that he saw.  Landmarks, interesting architecture, photos and videos.  And, of course, you can add, edit and improve the descriptions by adding photos and videos with geotagging.  Not an easy task and very cool that the team was able to demonstrate a working prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b09/3b4/727/b093b472749b75eec569cda372be50ed.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#6c6c6c">Main winner - Go Ahead</font> </h4><br>  The concept is simple: have everyone seen in the computer races of the "ghost" rivals - the best lap, world record and so on?  This is called asynchronous multiplayer.  Now take the routes in the city for skaters, roller skaters and scooter lovers, add a mobile application to them and ... win our city hackathon.  : D Excellent application, serious work has been done, a convincing result has been demonstrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67a/fea/b23/67afeab23731cc99c92534bcb77eb647.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Expert opinions</font> </h2><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46c/3d3/310/46c3d33103694966bbc83f835fed0cd6.jpg" align="left">  I am Vadim Eremin, manager of the category of digital accessories ‚ÄúM.Video‚Äù.  We came to Hackathon 2GIS to support new ideas in the field of smart technologies.  At the start it seemed to me that in two days to create a product ready for commercial use is simply impossible.  How wrong I was!  Most teams coped with this task: they showed real working prototypes, coupled with original ideas, while all of them solved the existing urban problems to some extent. <br><br>  On the hackathon, I primarily evaluated the use of smart gadgets.  Now this part of the market is actively growing - over the past year, sales have doubled.  We are following with interest the entire ecosystem of "smart" things, choose the best new products and offer them to the Russian market.  In the nomination "M.Video" we noted the team "No stress".  Their project allows you to improve the quality of human life - this is one of the most likely directions for the development of smart technologies. </blockquote><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57f/eb0/0ff/57feb00ff6be9800112feb06268736cc.png" align="left">  Hello!  I am Sergey Zubkov, I work in the IT Department of the city of Moscow.  Most of all I liked the projects aimed at self-organization and interaction of residents.  I am also ideologically sympathetic to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontactless fare payment, although with the introduction of it in our conditions, as you understand, there are a number of intractable issues. <br><br>  I want to advise the guys coming to the hackathons - communicate with experts.  Your project may be noticed at the development stage and offer cooperation after the hackathon.  For example, we exchanged contacts with members of areas of interest to us, and perhaps we will work together. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86d/85f/96d/86d85f96d39dcb0f52ff7d29837ebf9a.png" align="left">  My name is Evgeny Lisovsky, I am the executive director of Maps.Me.  Since my area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork is related to cartography, I first of all appreciated the services I understand.  I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe guys from SportsCity - now it‚Äôs difficult to find a party and a place for doing sports.  Geochats has an interesting feature, but it seems to me that it does not pull on an independent project.  But on the module to the popular mapping services and API for applications - yes.  Well and, of course, pleased the guys from API Sal.  They obviously need to do something with the names, but the work done and the demonstrated result are impressive. <br><br>  I advise all participants of hackathons to make a start not only from ‚ÄúI want‚Äù and ‚Äúinterestingly‚Äù, but also to study their ideas from the point of view of business analytics.  Build a simplified model, evaluate the investment potential and possible monetization.  As they say, you love to start up - love and drive tsiferki in Excel. <br><br>  PS: Oh yes, I almost forgot.  ‚ÄúWhere is Shaverma?‚Äù - van lav, waiting for release.  :) <br></blockquote><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f1/324/945/9f13249457e6bb1720e9fb1792deecb7.png" align="left">  Hi, Andrei Karmatsky in touch.  I lead Urbica Design - we analyze and visualize complex data about the urban environment.  As a rule, these are near-cartographic intractable projects. <br><br>  On the hackathon, I really liked the desire of the guys to realize interesting and technologically complex projects.  In addition to the winners, who presented worthy projects, I would like to mention a couple of teams.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontactless payment of fare on the bus is very nice, indeed, it could well improve life in the city.  I was especially pleased with the optimism of the author and the desire to collect all the components of the system during these two and a half days of the hackathon. <br><br>  The guys from Crowdata are definitely worth noting - they analyzed the accumulations of people in the city by activity on social networks, it is difficult to explain why this is to the end user, however, it could well be done to implement useful business in the service sector or municipalities. <br><br>  Many teams tried to develop and come up with a technology that processes any content, this is great - information is becoming more and more, you need to learn to pull out the most interesting.  At the same time, it would be great for participants to think about where they would take, create or retrieve this very content. <br><br>  It also seemed to me that in some teams, the business component was pumped up - there was no understanding where these guys would take money for development.  It is not enough to make an excellent technology or come up with a cool feature, does not mean at all that the product will be successful.  Many thanks to the organizers of the hackathon for the invitation, I am sure that all the participants and experts spent these two and a half days with mutual benefit. <br></blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Results of the event</font> </h2><br>  Two days of hard work were not wasted.  Each team showed excellent results, to some extent demonstrating a working prototype.  Thanks to everyone who came with his team and took part in the hackathon.  You have shown that in just two days, modern technologies can significantly simplify life - from finding housing and traveling companions to working to solving social and organizational issues and active leisure.  We hope that you will not stop at what has been accomplished, bring projects to mind and come in a year with new ideas!  :) See you! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395687/</a></p>
