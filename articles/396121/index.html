  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Olive smart suitcase with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and 3G / 4G support will bring its owner to the front desk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On wheels, or without them, stylish and fanciful or purely business-like, massive large-sized travel bags to very few people are able to inspire positive emotions.  A suitcase is always a routine, discomfort, hassle, corrections in time and other inconveniences, one way or another waiting for a wandering tourist.  And they are especially keenly felt by those whose schedule of travels and flights is maximally condensed.  Get rid of the "big suitcase complex" and look at the situation from a slightly different, unexpected side suggested startup Ikap Robotics Olive, which we describe below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f24/63b/ec6/f2463bec6d98b762130d20724eafff5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea to cross segway and a travel suitcase came to the engineers of the Iranian company <a href="http://ikaprobotics.com/ikap-research.html">Ikap Robotics</a> , who rightly considered that in the age of high technology and artificial intelligence, forcing a person to exercise in any form is a perversion.  Attempts to solve the problem were made earlier, but the maximum that the authors of similar ideas claimed was to automate the suitcase so that it could move alongside its owner or drive up to it on command given from the application. <br><br>  This solves the problem only partially, it was decided at Ikap Robotics, and brilliantly combined the possibilities of autonomous personal electric transport and a self-propelled suitcase.  This is how Ikap Robotics Olive was born - the world's first smart segway bag capable of delivering its owner to the front desk.  However, the possibility of Olive, which already does not turn the language, to call simply a numbered unit of baggage, is not limited to this.

And for complete consensus with their owner, the developers have provided Olive with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, GPS and 3G / 4G modules. <br><br>  What is ready to please Olive its owner in addition to travel with a breeze? <br><br>  The gadget is equipped with a miniature stereoscopic tracking camera that can create a visual map of its surroundings in real time.  Thanks to the same camera and programmed support for contour tracking algorithms, the suitcase will follow its owner or go to it on command from some distance, even in a crowded room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa6/e39/085/aa6e39085b0fd2096edcd437644d8dea.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e8/909/3b8/0e89093b812ede1215807156b1ac2868.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Olive - the first and only smart suitcase of its kind, which will remind its owner of the need to hurry.  He will notify about exceeding the allowable weight, analyze the distance to the nearest terminal and, if it is sufficiently remote, push the footrest, inviting you to make an exciting trip, and, if necessary, will become a backup source of electricity for your smartphone or tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d58/cb8/249/d58cb824964e66f36a87255f97d0f695.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Olive is paired with a mobile device via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth through an application that provides the ability to fine-tune the parameters of the gadget and complete control of the device from a distance.  GPS and 3G / 4G technology will help you locate Olive in real time.  The automatic locking mechanism will work if the baggage is left unattended for a while.  And if an intruder shows interest in Olive, who remains unattended for a while, the security system will give an alarm signal.  Cherry on this certainly appetizing cake - support for the gadget lock of the NFC technology, which saves its owner from having to press any keys. <br><br>  At Ikap Robotics, we sincerely believe that Olive has been waiting for its target audience for a long time, and investors and promising partners will take the project of a smart suitcase seriously, especially since it is already at the final stage of implementation.  The final cost of the gadget, taking into account the likely prospects for finalizing the prototype and additional costs, is not yet advertised. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yyHJiTdoHs4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqBO3em3EKhUJ8b291kXxJTDqzIg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://oliverobotics.com/">Project website</a></sub></i> <br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
