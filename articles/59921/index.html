Two bedroom house from <br>  300 dollars a week.  You can buy something decent for 300k, loans <br>  etc.  are available.  The center is inhabited by Chinese and students.  Local population <br>  prefers home with lawn. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you go alone, you can share an apartment / house with someone.  The price of such <br>  from 100 per room and so many people live this way. <br><br><h4>  Job </h4><br>  The minimum payment is 10 dollars per hour.  Contract programmers - from <br>  30-100 per hour.  The crisis crippled the market seriously enough, but it has already become <br>  gradually straightened out.  Russian programmers on the background of the Chinese and <br>  Indians look advantageous.

    <h4>  Girls </h4><br>  Indigenous people and former British, how to say a little <br>  plump.  Of those who came in many beautiful, for example from the Latin <br>  America.  On the, in a general sense, not the best situation with girls eyes <br>  washed out in six months. <br><br><h4>  Cars, roads </h4><br>  Right-hand drive, as in Japan / England.  Everywhere there are arrows <br>  so as not to confuse.  At first, you still confuse, especially hard <br>  Decoupling and ring are given.  The speed limit in the city is 50, according to the speed <br>  (analogue of the route) 100. Large fines - in the city of 65 km / h it costs 80NZD. <br>  You can drive after the beer bottle. <br><br>  The police are friendly, especially outside the city.  Somehow lit our <br>  half-dead car, and the next day we stopped in order to <br>  suggest which service is better to go.  Well, the very look of them resembled <br>  agents from People in black. <br>  After entering the country, you can drive according to Russian rights for a year (with <br>  translation), and then retake, which is also not difficult. <br><br>  Rent a car in a season around 40NZD per day for a Corolla-type sedan. <br>  Gasoline 1.7NZD, diesel 1NZD, but there is an additional tax on diesel. <br>  Buy a car on the go - from 1000NZD, expenses - registration 120 per year and <br>  30 checkup every six months.  All but the inspection is done through <br>  the Internet. <br><br>  Parking in the center is expensive and practically absent, behind the center - free on the street. <br><br>  A friend can easily lend you a car, if you are stopped, you will need to give the name of the owner and that's it.  However, they stop here very rarely, rights are asked even less often. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br>  the New Zealand dollar fell into crisis from .8 to .5 to USD.  No matter how <br>  strangely, the price of sausage, beer and cheese is not affected.  Banking system <br>  developed, all shops accept cards. <br><br>  Transfer from one account to another is done within a day, for transfer <br>  you need to know only the account number.  Through the internet of course. <br>  Paypal works in full. <br><br><h4>  The medicine </h4><br>  For those who are on a work visa and residents for free.  With the exception of <br>  therapists (50nzd) and cosmetic surgery. <br><br><h4>  Types of visas </h4><br>  Limited - it is given if you really don't want to give it to you, because of it <br>  rigid framework, during which you need to leave the country.  Change or <br>  to extend this visa while in the country <br><br>  Visitor's shop is a regular visa, you can study for 3 months.  To receive <br>  need to show that you have money to stay.  Extends to 9 <br>  months. <br><br>  Student - is given if you are going to study for more than 6 months, <br>  extended or changed without problems.  If learning was not language, and <br>  not less than a year, then at the end you are given a work visa. <br><br>  Working - standard, you can work, change, extend. <br><br>  Business - I do not know anything. <br><br>  Resident - give if you score enough points, allows you to live in <br>  the country indefinitely, or for two years to leave the country, but not <br>  more than half a year. <br><br>  Resident's constant - if you have been on the residence for two years, and nothing <br>  did not break.  Essentially no different from citizenship except <br>  passports <br>  Citizenship - give after five years after receiving residency. <br><br><h4>  Russian-speaking community </h4><br>  A large community arrived in the 90s, while the entry was practically free. <br>  Golden youth studying in uni.  Quite a lot of people with <br>  Kazakhstan, the state pays for their studies abroad. <br><br><h4>  Internet and Telephone </h4><br>  Expensive and slow.  They like to give 12 monthly contracts.  I pay 80NZD <br>  for 15yr, adsl.  There is no alternative.  Trying to stretch the optics, but it <br>  not soon.  10 bucks for SIP with a local number. <br><br>  Mobile, 39 for 200 minutes in the network, 20 minutes urban, 2000 sms + 10NZD <br>  for 100mb 3g.  Provider in GSM one (vodafone), the second is pulled <br>  in a month. <br>  On the contract can give any phone, also at an inflated price. <br><br><h4>  Travel </h4><br>  Many tourists from all over the world come to the country.  Summer surfing, hiking <br>  routes.  In winter, skiing and snowboarding.  The South Island is especially popular, <br>  It is easy to ride a month, although the distances are generally not large. <br><br><h4>  Attitude towards Russians </h4><br>  Russia is somewhere far away, and very big.  There is a mafia, KGB and <br>  vodka.  Russian on the general background come across quite rarely, but from <br>  cities know Moscow, St. Petersburg and Vladivostok with Khabarovsk.  Such here <br>  strange combination. <br>  Constant jokes on the topic that Russians drink vodka <br>  from morning to evening, but ghastly.  Russian accent is similar to Germanic - often confused. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Expensive and delayed, it tells the distance.  Can be ordered by mail <br>  no problem with that.  There are local brands like kogan, f &amp; p. <br>  Small selection of household appliances such as styralok, refrigerators. <br><br><h4>  A crisis </h4><br>  At first it wasn‚Äôt felt at all, then babats gasoline dropped from 2.2 to 1.5.  And in <br>  In February, I decided to change jobs and found that instead of 80 vacancies, <br>  Hang a measly 8 and then from the agencies.  Mostly affected construction <br>  firms. <br>  The government is not lost and has ceased to give working visas <br>  guards and waiters. <br><br><h4>  post office </h4><br>  Zeeland Courier - 6NZD.  Delivery within 24 hours.  30 bucks to <br>  Canada, for 10 days.  By mail, you can do re-registration <br>  cars (9bucks). <br>  A lot of everything can be ordered through the mail.  Bank cards rights, etc. <br>  also come in the mail. <br><br><h4>  Start your own bissnes </h4><br>  Ltd. opens via the Internet, it costs 160NZD.  Takes a week. <br>  You can without it, but then you will respond with your property.  On <br>  expenses can be written off part of the housing, office equipment - as usual. <br><br><h4>  Children </h4><br>  Garden fee, 200NZD per month and more.  Schools for free. <br>  At the university give state.  credit. <br><br>  Some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lasc/sets/72157604125794406/">photos</a> . By the way, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lasc/sets/72157604126005722/">Pornstar on Bikes</a> parade is held once a year in Auckland, but the flicker will not show them until you register. <br>  Descriptions of the <a href="http://lasc-kiwi.blogspot.com/2008/05/south-island-of-nz-summary.html">2 week trip</a> , there you can find information / tips on immigration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59921/</a></p>
