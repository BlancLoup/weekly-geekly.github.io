We learned where to attract the audience and how to buy advertising. <br><br>  Recall the basic formula in arbitration: <br>  <b>(Product + People who can buy it) &amp; Tell these people about this product = $</b> <br><br>  Consider the third element of the formula - tell people about the product.  The main question: how to tell?  Remember that in arbitration two components: <br><br>  Science - science and technology <br>  Art - art, marketing, copywriting. <br><br>  In arbitration mathematics, there is a formula: <b>EPC&gt; CPC</b> <br><br>  How much we earn per click (EPC) is more than how much we pay per click (CPC).  If this formula is satisfied - we get a profit. <br><br><h2>  How to increase EPC </h2><br>  Recall the results of the last block: about CPM, CPC and write down the formula for calculating EPC: <br><br>  <b>EPC = CR (%) * Landing Page CVR (%) * Payout ($)</b> <br><br>  In order to earn more, we need to increase the EPC.  What to do? <br><br>  <b>Zoom CR offer</b> .  Directly, we do not affect the Conversion Rate of the offer, the offer is affected by the advertiser.  What we do: we take several different offers, send the same traffic to them and choose an offer on which CR is greater. <br><br>  <b>Zoom CVR - CR Landing Page</b> .  We first send the user to the Landing Page, tell him about the product to heat interest.  After we send it to the offer page from the advertiser.  We apply knowledge and approaches: we use different creatives, technologies and proper targeting to show the presenters to the right, targeted users.  We can make a separate landing page for women or for men.  We can make a separate landing page for those who come from Facebook and make it in the style of Facebook.  The user will not even understand that he has moved to another site and will trust the advertisement more. <br><br>  <b>Increase the payout</b> .  We can find this offer in another affiliate program, chat with it and agree on individual payment terms: so that we are paid more for conversion than usual. <br><br><h2>  How to reduce CPC </h2><br>  Recall the <b>CPC</b> formula <b>: CPC = CPM ($) / CTR (%) / 10</b> <br><br>  What can we do to reduce CPC? <br><br>  <b>Decrease bid</b> (CPM bid).  How to do - get higher CTR.  When we buy by CPM, clicks are cheaper, and we get higher CTR due to the approaches and creativity.  We can also choose the right targeting and get a higher CTR and a lower bid. <br><br>  <b>Agree on the best conditions with the advertising network</b> .  In addition to Art and Science, there is business and networking.  We beat out favorable conditions when working with partner networks, with advertisers: we negotiate a discount and get clicks and impressions cheaper.  We recall about the Fill rate at 100%: the advertising network sells clicks cheaper if you buy in bulk. <br><br>  <b>Increase CTR</b> .  CTR is in the denominator - if you increase it, the CPC decreases.  CTR, as we said, can be increased by Art: using approaches, creatives and through Science: using the correct targeting. <br><br>  The whole arbitration comes down to the fact that we use both its components: Art and Science to increase the EPC and reduce the CPC.  We will analyze these two components in the following blocks. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  The following two training blocks will be devoted to the main components of arbitration: <br><br><ul><li>  marketing and copywriting (about Art); </li><li>  Traffic analytics and making the right decisions based on data analysis (about Science). </li></ul><br>  Let's talk about mood and motivation.  What is needed for a successful start? <br><br><h2>  Tips for arbitragers </h2><br>  We give some tips for novice arbitrators. <br><br>  Arbitrage is not easy, it is not work at home, not part-time and not easy money.  In arbitration, there is a lot of work with data, analytics, routine work and search of creatives.  This is a full-time job and you need to be ready for this.  There will be many difficulties that you will encounter: <br><br><ul><li>  general understanding of the market, </li><li>  hard start </li><li>  failure, lack of motivation and stress, </li><li>  perseverance and focus </li><li>  zeal </li><li>  constancy </li><li>  financial assets and turnover </li></ul><br>  One of the common mistakes of newbies is to think that it‚Äôs difficult to get traffic.  They begin to invent their own schemes to attract the audience, although everything is extremely simple and works according to basic laws that need to be understood and implemented. <br><br>  We analyze the complexity in more detail. <br><br>  <b>General understanding of the market</b> .  A lot of heterogeneous information: advertising networks, tracking, CPC, CPM, advertising auctions, offers, affiliate programs.  We created this course that streamline market information.  When you listen, you will understand how the elements of the market interact with each other. <br><br>  <b>Heavy start</b> .  It is not clear what to start: with which partner networks and verticals to work. <br><br>  Many questions at the beginning: <br>  ‚ÄúI have registered in the affiliate network, the manager does not answer me, what should I do next?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhy don't the conversions come, nothing works?‚Äù <br>  "I did an advertising campaign - traffic is not coming, what should I do?" <br><br>  There are a lot of questions, and at the start it is hard, over time you will have answers and it will become easier.  The most important thing is to start. <br><br>  <b>Failure, lack of motivation and stress</b> .  Due to market volatility, stress and failures in arbitration, more than in another business.  Approximately as in business, venture investments and trading on Forex. <br><br>  This is a roller coaster - you are happy that everything works out, be sad when it stops and does not work.  Americans say: ‚Äúenjoy the rollercoaster!‚Äù.  This is about arbitration.  Not only beginner arbitrageurs are under stress.  With increasing experience, stress does not go away: the problems that you face are changing.  Arbitrage does not exist without stress.  Accept this fact and prepare. <br><br>  <b>Perseverance and focus</b> .  Do not jump from source to source and from vertical to vertical.  Take one source and one vertical, study thoroughly.  At this very moment you will understand how everything works.  How the traffic flows, how the advertising auction works, what targeting in this traffic source is better, what the audience responds to, what context it is in, and what to show it.  If you jump from source to source, look at the tops and do not get to the deep things that allow you to convert offers to plus and earn. <br><br>  A separate moment - the boundaries and bugs in the system.  The ad network has bugs or borders through which you can go and get a lot of cheap advertising clicks, free impressions.  Search for free targeting, a special feature on the Internet and get a private optimization of click impressions, etc.  It will work out if you thoroughly examine one source of traffic and work diligently, with focus on it.  The same applies to the vertical.  Learn how the vertical works, what approaches work with it, what you need to do in order to get your offers in plus, so that they give you more budgets and pay more for installations. <br><br>  <b>Zeal</b>  Fails and failures - normal.  90% of your work - failures, you will merge into a minus, spend money and not receive payments.  This is normal.  Only in 10% of cases you will achieve success and work in a plus.  From this not to leave, so the market is arranged.  At 10%, you are repaying the losses that you keep on 90% of the campaigns.  It works when you run a lot of campaigns, a lot of offers, you do it all, learn, and then these 90% and 10% start working as they should.  You find those 10% that bring you a profit.  A lot of routine is normal.  You are constantly testing different offers, creatives and targeting.  Campaigns are rejected, you make small edits, re-enter these ad campaigns for moderation, etc.  Every day you work with different offers, but the essence of the work is the same, you should immediately get used to it and accept it.  The path from the beginner to the experienced arbitrator goes through the routine and practice. <br><br>  We show two graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52d/942/954/52d9429541814384939346c9c696b456.jpg"><br><br>  As we said at the beginning of the course, there are more than 25 people in our arbitration team.  We spent a lot of analytics: how they work, what they do, how much they earn. <br><br>  There is a dependency graph: how much a person earns per month, on the number of offers that he tested in a month.  The graph shows: more offers are testing, more profit brings.  Need to test more offers.  The market is so arranged: there are bad offers, there are good ones.  You never know which one is good or bad.  You need to sift a lot of offers: 90% are bad and leave 10% are good.  To find good, you need to pass through a lot of offers through the funnel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/737/0a9/489/7370a9489dc34ae2947e42513c104eaf.png"><br><br>  On the other graph, we have shown how the average profit of an arbitrazhnik grows by months.  We took our guys, looked at their incomes for the first month of their work, for the second and for the sixth.  It is evident that the expertise is growing, due to the large amount of practice, tests of different approaches.  With the expertise and earnings grows. <br><br>  <b>Constancy</b>  He will not be.  Working bundles and campaigns break down, you need to look for new ones all the time.  Everything changes: traffic source algorithms, advertising policies in traffic sources, advertiser requirements, new KPIs appear, competition.  Today you won the auction, and there were competitors and knocked you out of the auction.  Your traffic is no longer cheap and does not pay off.  Do not relax when things are going well.  A common mistake: when everything is bad, you spend more time and try to reduce something to a plus, when everything goes to a plus, you relax and rest.  Work harder when there is a possible bundle, squeeze the maximum profit out of it and rest when something fails. <br><br>  As an example with taxi drivers.  Taxi drivers can often ride all night when there are no orders, trying to find some kind of order.  As a result, they come home very tired.  Conversely, they can complete the plan in half a day and are happy to go home.  They carry out the plan not because they are great, but today is just such a profitable day, you can squeeze more out of it, work out all day, earn more orders.  On the day when there are no orders - do not strain, do not get tired and do not get upset. <br><br>  The same with arbitration.  When there are profitable campaigns, take the maximum out of them and have a rest, when something does not work out, switch to other sources, read forums, read blogs, just relax. <br><br>  And the last moment that absolutely everyone faces is <b>financial means and turnover</b> .  There will not be enough money for tests and for paying advertising sources, not all affiliate programs will be paid on time.  The first point - you need money for the test and training.  Many ask how much money they need to start in arbitration.  No specific amount.  Someone starts quickly, someone needs time: everyone has a different set of knowledge and luck. <br><br>  If we take MyTarget, with whom we work a lot, there is usually enough from 1,000 to 5,000 dollars to understand how the advertising campaign works.  Be prepared for the fact that you will spend the money on the knowledge that you get, launching advertising campaigns.  Then learn, start working in the plus and get profitable offers. <br><br>  Debts and loans are bad, they are not needed for beginners.  Debts affect your decisions.  You do not follow the strategies given by the algorithm.  When everything goes wrong - make decisions in a hurry, merge the extra money on the tests without getting a result.  Avoid this.  Discuss financial terms and overwork with affiliate networks.  Most provide bonuses and discounts and pay the earned money on the balance sheets in the advertising networks.  In fact, you don‚Äôt withdraw money, but deposit it on the account of advertising campaigns, spend again, earn money, spend money again, your real turnover is not big.  If you have good traffic, you can attract it, most affiliate networks will provide you with favorable credit terms. <br><br>  Do not forget about the commission when you consider the profit.  Arbitrage is not only buying traffic, but also all kinds of transfers between wallets, payments from a partner.  It is important to keep statistics and understand how much you really pay for advertising.  Consider the commissions spent as an amendment, the coefficient on the cost of your impressions and clicks that you buy. <br><br>  Finally, add useful materials: forums, blogs, books.  Read, get information, communicate with other arbitrageurs.  The arbitration market is interesting and closed, a lot of information is frayed among themselves in forums or blogs.  It is important to be constantly in the media environment: to find out which offers are hot, which sources of traffic are worth working with, which verticals in the trend, etc ... <br><br><h2>  What to read </h2><br>  <b>Forums</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://stmforum.com/v2/">StackThatMoney</a> <br>  <a href="http://defo.cc/">Defo</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cpaclub.org/">Cpaclub</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.cpacampus.info/">CpaCampus</a> <br><br>  <b>Blogs</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://charlesngo.com/">charlesngo.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.malandarras.com/">www.malandarras.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://barsag.com/">barsag.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://finchsells.com/">finchsells.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://olegapro.blogspot.ru/">olegapro.blogspot.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Books</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CA-HVERTISING-Ad-Agency-Psychology-Anything/dp/1601630328">Ca $ vertising</a> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  We hope you have gained a basic knowledge of how the mobile arbitrage market is organized and made your attitude towards arbitration. <br><br>  Someone may begin to deal with them.
