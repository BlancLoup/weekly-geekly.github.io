  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Should I write long letters in the mailing list? Data on 390 million letters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What should be the perfect letter?  Long to explain everything to the smallest details?  Or is it short, so that a person would like to immediately follow the link? <br><br>  How many companies, so many options for letters.  Someone sends long letters (more than 10 screens), someone capacious and short (no more than 1 screen).  To paraphrase Master Yoda: " <i>Do not try to guess - count</i> ."  UniSender conducted its own <a href="http://lp.unisender.com/benchmark%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Drefferal%26utm_campaign%3Dbenchmark1">unique research in the CIS</a> market of email-mailings.  In this article, you will learn whether to write long letters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We analyzed data on 390,268,887 <b>letters</b> sent via UniSender in October 2014, and found answers to such questions: <br><ol><li>  Does the length of the sent letter depend on the industry of the company? </li><li>  How does letter length affect transitions? </li></ol><br>  But before that you need to find out a few points: <br><ol><li><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Indicators used in the study</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The article mentions such indicators as CTOR (interest in the text) and p (click-through rate).  In short, CTOR (Clickers-to-openers rate) is the percentage of people who have opened a letter who have moved to the site.  A p - the average of how many times a person has clicked in the letter.  You can find out more about them in the previous part of the study. </div></div></li><li><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is 5 thousand characters?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In a letter email-mailing 5 thousand characters - not the same as the 5 thousand characters in Word.  In the usual html-letter, all the elements are registered with the help of the code.  That is, for example, this red text will be written like this: This text is red.  As a result, a standard letter is greatly ‚Äúbloated‚Äù by the number of characters. <br>  5,000 characters fit approximately one screen.  This means that the person will open such a letter and it will almost completely fit on the computer screen. </div></div></li></ol><br>  And now for the study itself. <br><br><h3>  Is the length of the letters in different industries? </h3><br>  As we learned, companies from different industries write letters of different lengths.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f18/ae4/15a/f18ae415a0484739872de29780593c84.png"></div><br>  Consulting companies are characterized by the largest letters with detailed explanations.  In second place is e-commerce with letters, which lists a large number of goods.  Short letters prefer to send banks - everything is clear and to the point;  as a rule, we are talking about the offer of a particular service or a short alert. <br><br>  And now let's see how much the letter length affects the number of transitions.  We compared the three largest (by the number of subscribers) sectors - tourism, e-commerce and education: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaa/456/6dd/eaa4566dd34643c383510d8e907c053f.png"></div><br>  The graph shows that the longer the letter from the <b>online store</b> , the greater the likelihood that a person will click on at least one link. <br><br>  Another situation with <b>travel agencies</b> is the optimal letter length of 20,000 characters (3-4 screens).  The travel company letters are noticeably lower than CTOR: even if the letter is opened, a much smaller number of people go to the site than, for example, in e-commerce. <br><br>  In <b>education</b> , CTOR is also lower than that of online stores.  At the same time, in this industry a high percentage of transitions to the site from short (up to one screen) letters.  Usually these are invitations to webinars or as stylized as plain text letters. <br><br><h3>  How does the length of the letter affect the transitions to the site? </h3><br>  To calculate this dependence, we need to know the CTOR and the length of the letters.  The length we measure in characters. <br><br>  It turned out this dependency: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/d9f/9e2/68cd9f9e262b4dd3843ee3d17ed518b7.png"></div><br>  As can be seen from the graph, the longer the letter, the greater the likelihood that the subscriber will go to your website. <br><br>  And this is not surprising, because the more the letter, the more opportunities to convey to the reader their advantages.  It is much more interesting why people click less in letters ranging in size from five to ten thousand and from 30 to 35 thousand characters. <br><br>  The fact is that up to 5 thousand characters is plain text, or short letters in a template.  They are usually placed on the first screen.  The man opened the letter and immediately understood what was wanted of him. <br><br>  After 5 thousand characters, the letter no <b>longer fits into the first screen</b> - you need to scroll down.  5-10 thousand characters is a letter on 2-3 screens, 30-35 thousand is a letter on 7-8 screens.  Based on this schedule, it can be argued that by receiving a letter on two or 7 screens, subscribers are less willing to go to the site.  Just do not read to the end and do not reach the desired link. <br><br><h3>  Tip: </h3><br><ol><li>  <b>Combine the "short" and "long" letter</b> : first, the main idea and the ability to go from the letter (link, button or any other Call to action), then additional information. </li><li>  <b>Remember the "screens"</b> .  The person opens the letter and sees a certain amount of information.  If he does not see anything important in the first screen, the probability is high that he will not scroll further. </li><li>  <b>Let's write a letter of value</b> .  The more useful information you put into the email, the more likely it is that subscribers will navigate to your site.  If you propose a turner from Moscow to buy time management training in Kazakhstan, then it does not matter how long the letter is. </li></ol><br><h3>  Where to get the rest of the study? </h3><br>  You can subscribe to the research results <a href="http://lp.unisender.com/benchmark/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Drefferal%26utm_campaign%3Dbenchmark1">on this page</a> .
