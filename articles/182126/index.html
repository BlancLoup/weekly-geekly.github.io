  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computex 2013. Day one. Conference ASUS Republic Of Gamers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good Taiwanese evening, dear habrazhiteli!  I start my small series of reports from Computex, which traditionally takes place in early June on the sunny island of Taiwan.  Asia is a continent where special attention is paid to traditions.  The past two years, the morning of the first day begins with the ASUS press conference on products of the Republic Of Gamers line.  On the updates presented in 2013, let me tell you in the first part of the story about Computex-2013. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a3/025/7bf/5a30257bffb6857da9ae7578ecdc6a70.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event was held at the Taiwan International Conference Center.  A huge number of journalists from around the world gathered to look at the latest achievements of ASUS engineers, and, frankly, there was something to see. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/154/71f/1a7/15471f1a7d8131e3502f606cfe54b3fd.jpg"><br>  ‚ÄúI did everything right‚Äù - this is how you can freely translate the conference motto. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a9/042/10e/9a904210e9576679251f29a96e61c9dd.jpg"><br>  The first speaker was the president of ASUS  Jonney Shih. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08d/43f/529/08d43f529ffad4633ad8d3632e9b4f8e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d4/4db/ad2/4d44dbad230b4dd0c8f813df5f64bc0f.jpg"><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis speech was very transparent.  Over the years in the market, ASUS has earned a great reputation and a well-deserved first place in sales.  It is difficult to imagine who currently can really compete with ASUS as motherboards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3a/aee/336/c3aaee336fc16b41a83e1eb1ed21c747.jpg"><br>  The Republic Of Gamers product line includes a wide range of computer devices.  This and ready-made desktops ROG Tytan, laptops, mice, routers, headsets, SSD drives, sound cards and, of course, motherboards and video cards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55a/177/113/55a1771131e370d6f8c89196bd9bd993.jpg"><br>  Are we ready to move to a new level?  Of course, ready! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8e/e82/a52/e8ee82a524794b6a9940e0e802045bbd.jpg"><br>  The transfer was accompanied by the vice-president of ASUS and the manager of the department of motherboards and desktops Mr.  Joe Hsieh. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb0/9f4/628/bb09f4628824cfcb19f0bb2d55001114.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/146/000/f15/146000f151cdf121b908171fc4f79500.jpg"><br>  The first was a new laptop series G750.  The filling is worthy of mention - the latest Intel Core i7 processor on the Haswell architecture, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M graphics processor, up to 32 GB of RAM, with support for two SATA 6 Gb / s hard drives.  Like everything beautiful, this unit is very expensive, but the possession of the most powerful gaming laptop should warm the soul to its owner. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3f/902/f25/e3f902f251b341c642c639af01dd6be6.jpg"><br>  Dear young lady showed this beauty live and the audience was very pleased. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ba/662/8da/7ba6628da0b69cb5a2961e28f8203b01.jpg"><br>  Incredible performance in unsurpassed style.  Perhaps agree.  The backlit keyboard on brushed aluminum looks unevenly cool. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/b77/92a/4cbb7792a61f60476f84e709c2b17ba5.jpg"><br>  In addition to performance, the G750 also offers great sound.  High sound quality is achieved with the built-in headphone amplifier. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbc/9ac/dee/dbc9acdee41ba2564968eb17884c505a.jpg"><br>  To replace the laptop came the desktop.  The huge supercomputer from ASUS looks and works on all five plus. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f8/c76/107/5f8c761074508a8fefb97ba25c1ac919.jpg"><br>  The new generation of Intel Haswell processors is also registered in this decision of the Republic Of Gamers engineers.  A special feature is the presence of a button that automatically performs acceleration to a frequency of 4100 MHz.  Of course, many experienced habrayusers will shrug their shoulders and say, they say, nothing surprising, but for most ordinary people, this is just magic :).  The cooling of the processor is organized using a liquid cooling system, which has a positive effect on the temperature conditions of not only the CPU, but also of the computer as a whole. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f03/1e1/3fe/f031e13fe7883b185ebb9972ea98d7cb.jpg"><br>  A series of components opened the motherboard for gamers - ASUS Maximus VI Formula.  The sixth generation of the Maximus series is back on the horse.  The best solution in class is hard to argue with. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba1/b0c/377/ba1b0c3779db315f669ce4eeb541605f.jpg"><br>  Hybrid cooling system - you want to use conventional air, you want to connect the radiator of the power supply circuits to the liquid cooling system.  The evolution of the system has led to the fact that instead of the propietic fittings, standard G1 / 4 "threads are used, which allows any experienced user to easily adapt the connections to their existing ITS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0c/86b/3d3/f0c86b3d338ca59a00acab020006dd70.jpg"><br>  The sound path has also undergone changes and has become "more better."  The time trends have touched and ASUS - instead of the serial number "five", the sound card was called New SupremeFX. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/949/665/983/94966598326d8ac59dafec8de4c5c0ba.jpg"><br>  Consolidated slide with all the advantages of the board.  In addition to the above, this is a set of additional ‚Äúarmor‚Äù, which not only protects the board, but also improves component cooling, as well as a small mPCIe COMBO II card ‚Äî this device contains a Wi-Fi 802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.0 module and an M2 slot for installing a solid-state drive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bae/f5e/e2b/baef5ee2bf397ccc4c2c1c2c281d5c58.jpg"><br>  Head of Multimedia Solutions Department  Kent Chien spoke about the new attempt to introduce liquid cooling systems in the video card sector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb3/875/a50/bb3875a50d967af2fa2c4b7ff3a8eaea.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/186/ee4/f1f/186ee4f1f605c94c55b6713b6e44fe76.jpg"><br>  ASUS has developed a special solution that allows you to use an air-cooled video card as well as connect it with ITS.  As you can see, the popularization of liquid cooling systems is in full swing and industry leaders are actively taking part in it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb2/68c/309/eb268c309ed836abf0c2f5e1b86ab2d1.jpg"><br>  At connection of hoses  allows to reduce the temperature by 31 degrees.  A hybrid, if I may say so, fan is a combination of axial and injection.  Rumor has it that the first graphics card with the Poseidon cooling system will be the ASUS GTX 770 based on the NVIDIA GK104 graphics processor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/139/64c/628/13964c628cb9b2832eecb9b7dec8bb3e.jpg"><br>  What do Poseidon and Maximus VI Formula look like?  They just look like ‚Äútrump‚Äù - the modding project is executed at the highest level and uses products from ASUS, EK WaterBlocks, Corsair and Antec. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56c/8a1/b9f/56c8a1b9f0e35f34562b275dac937462.jpg"><br>  One of the most interesting events of the press conference is the presentation of the most compact board from the Republic Of Gamers family.  Maximus VI Impact is a product that was very much requested by users and ASUS went to meet the wishes of the end-users. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/831/a7a/44b/831a7a44b87c73fb1317664a1ad5ac4e.jpg"><br>  A powerful power supply system, like on ‚Äúadult‚Äù boards, makes it possible to overclock the processor a little bit worse than on Extreme or Formula boards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/246/46d/775/24646d775b32c0cbe3647f27fe05d760.jpg"><br>  The rear panel contains BIOS flashback, memOK and post-encoder buttons. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5d/e6b/185/e5de6b185867a689a432ede498b89d26.jpg"><br>  The sound quality is not affected by reducing the size of the motherboard.  All the advantages of SupremeFX are embodied in the mini-ITX format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7c/638/db0/e7c638db02d4edc36b3283b6f283b122.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ed/e3b/b4e/2ede3bb4e6dd22e87b39f6bafc83e163.jpg"><br>  Another pretty lady with super compact solutions: ASUS Maximus VI Impact and ASUS GTX 670 DirectCU Mini. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/889/ea8/a33/889ea8a33a4b95ea6a5b60efdcf400df.jpg"><br>  Top product for extremes and advanced users.  ASUS Maximus VI Extreme is the fastest motherboard on the planet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eac/a2b/c9b/eaca2bc9bf541b0aa98efb13ce22eb59.jpg"><br>  Two legendary overclockers, Andre Yang and Shamino, were called to demonstrate their might. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/559/e45/922/559e4592295c93557e86accee42ed186.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dae/f91/9f9/daef919f9c4d4f07ae7990488a481587.jpg"><br>  The frequency of the processor Intel Core i7-4770K was 6861.8 MHz, which is almost twice the nominal operating frequency. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bd/5cd/003/3bd5cd0031f0366030469f05e0b4ecac.jpg"><br>  The ASUS Maximus VI Impact RAM was overclocked to 4100 MHz !!! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42a/389/5c7/42a3895c767f7c4efa4a4a53d9048353.jpg"><br><br>  After the end of the conference there was an opportunity to take pictures of live samples in the demo zone, which I enjoyed using. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/470/8c5/c76/4708c5c76f1945d495887c43f097cb72.jpg"><br>  Real flagship among motherboards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/721/46d/add/72146dadd2b17a79d82aced2902ba52d.jpg"><br>  New among video cards - ASUS GTX 780 DirectCUII OC and ASUS GTX 770 DirectCuII OC - overclocked versions of the recently released models from NVIDIA. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b53/8ec/056/b538ec05600aceb9f85c69af544271d1.jpg"><br>  ASUS Maximus VI Gene is a microATX format board with traditionally good overclocking capabilities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/635/683/3cb/6356833cb5a5731c7cb2fdda836176df.jpg"><br>  ASUS Maximus VI Hero is a simplified version for users with a modest budget but an overwhelming overclocking solution.  The functionality is somewhat simplified, but this has practically no effect on the potential of the board.  The main overclocking capabilities are kept unchanged. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4df/d73/11a/4dfd7311aee272cb0c19a4fab8a2c50d.jpg"><br>  This cyber device is called ASUS OC Panel and is a ‚Äúremote control‚Äù for Republic of Gamers series motherboards.  Built-in thermometer allows you to control the temperature of the processor and video card during extreme overclocking. <br><br><br>  Bonus photo: the small ASUS Maximus VI Impact is barely visible from under the glass of nitrogen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d6/650/788/5d66507882a3f7005d3293364bde7a37.jpg">
