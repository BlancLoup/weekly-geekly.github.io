There is a lot of controversy about an innovative phone, or rather, a smartphone, from <strong>Apple</strong> , and relative opinions about devices too.  Some people, whether dear <u>Eldar Murtazin</u> ( <a href="http://mobile-review.com/">mobile-review.com</a> ) or the less popular <u>Anton Nosik</u> ( <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/">dolboeb.livejournal.com</a> ), are perplexed about the popularity of the device, calling the <strong>iPhone</strong> "a <em>weak solution both programmatically and technically</em> ."  Most <strong>Mac</strong> users and <strong>iPods</strong> who understand the company's ideology still think differently.  I have been using the <strong>iPhone</strong> for almost a month now and want to share my impressions with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Impressions </h2><br>  First and foremost, the longer you use your <strong>iPhone</strong> , the more you like it.  This is not advertising, it is the most real universal impression.  Usually the opposite is true - you buy a smartphone / communicator and the longer you use it, the more you become disappointed.  <strong>IPhone</strong> is different. <br>  When I just had a phone in my hands - I wanted to have more features, a communicator on <em>Windows Mobile</em> or a smartphone on <em>Symbian</em> replaced it, I wanted the phone to be just a phone, because most of the functions were poorly implemented.  The phone should not slow down, build multi-level chains of menu items to access something simple.  In the case of the <strong>iPhone</strong> - this is true.  As they say, <strong>It just works</strong> . <br>  An almost perfect combination of a multifunctional device and a phone, as well as an innovative method of device management, are two main components of <strong>iPhone</strong> success.  Its potential is huge - we will all see it as soon as <u>Steve Jobs</u> reveals the promised <strong>SDK</strong> in February '08 and hundreds of new applications appear. <br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  The kit supplied with the device is simple and concise - just as much as is necessary for comfortable use of the device. <br>  It includes, in fact, the <strong>iPhone</strong> itself, a wired headset (we'll talk about it separately), a <em>Dock</em> , a <em>USB</em> cable (the same as a regular <strong>iPod</strong> ), a <em>USB Power Adapter</em> for recharging from the mains, documentation, and a cloth to wipe the screen . <br>  All you need to synchronize with a <strong>Mac</strong> / <em>PC</em> , as well as travel - fits in your pocket and is a kind of designer.  Judge for yourself - you can plug a <em>USB cable</em> on one side, both on the <strong>iPhone</strong> and the <em>Dock</em> , and on the other, both on the <em>USB</em> port of a <strong>Mac</strong> / <em>PC</em> and on the <em>USB Power Adapter</em> .  In case you just want to charge the <strong>iPhone of</strong> your choice there are 4 design options for recharging.  <strong>Apple</strong> always leaves a choice <img src="http://usemac.ru/engine/data/emoticons/smile.gif"><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  Let's talk about the appearance of the device.  Every familiar person who saw the <strong>iPhone</strong> , took it more than positive reviews.  <strong>The iPhone</strong> is more than a regular phone, and in its dimensions tends to the communicator.  The device is light ( <em>135 grams</em> ) and thin ( <em>11.6 mm</em> ), therefore communication with it causes only positive emotions.  An important feature is that the <strong>iPhone</strong> case is monolithic, so it creates the impression of something finished and completed.  No battery covers with backlash - Uncle Steve saved us from such unpleasant moments.  Of course, the <strong>iPhone</strong> battery can not be changed independently (besides, it still needs to be bought, but for now it is unrealistic), but how long the replacement of the battery does not require depends on how to handle the device.  Without a doubt, a year or even two years of normal life are provided.  During this time, most likely, there will be more than one new version of the device, which will be queued for purchase.  Due to the fact that the <strong>iPhone</strong> is not for sale in Russia, and also due to the lack of appropriate batteries in the service centers of Apple dealers, this can be considered an omission. <br><h2>  Working hours </h2><br>  The battery lasts an average of one and a half days, taking into account 10-20 minutes of calls, watching two or three episodes of the series, 3-4 hours of music and constantly on <em>Wi-Fi</em> .  The result is quite decent, and if we take into account the fact that the <strong>iPhone</strong> can be recharged during synchronization, then you can almost forget about timely charging.  The power saving system in the <strong>iPhone is</strong> implemented simply - the display turns off after a few seconds if the device is in lock mode, or it goes from standby to lock mode after the time specified by the user in the settings (1-5 minutes). <br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br>  On the front surface of the device you can find only a speaker, a display and the so-called " <em>Home Button</em> ", a button that returns the device to the main screen.  Since the device was originally designed for use with the <strong>Multitouch technology</strong> , the control element of which are fingers, Apple very competently approached the screen protection by placing it under a special scratch-resistant glass. <br>  The following video demonstrates the scratch resistance of a similar <strong>iPod Touch</strong> glass. <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/kzbxpSwDetk </video><br>  The display makes you happy from the first seconds of exploring it - the colors are bright and saturated, a diagonal of <em>3.5</em> inches and a resolution of <em>320x480</em> pixels make you feel comfortable, whatever you do - from surfing with <strong>Safari</strong> to watching movies with <strong>iPod</strong> . <br>  Since the display above and below is surrounded by black, when watching a video, it seems that it is somewhat larger than it really is. <h2>  Headset </h2>  The included stereo headset is striking in its simplicity.  It is very similar to ordinary <strong>iPod</strong> headphones, with the exception of the talk button.  Immediately and do not pay attention to it, if you do not know what it is.  In a small button about <em>2x0.5x0.25</em> <em>cm</em> in size, the headset microphone and control element are located.  This button is responsible for the operations " <em>Pick up / hang up</em> ", " <em>Play / Pause</em> " in the <strong>iPod -</strong> parts of the phone, and also with a double click switches to the next song in the <em>playlist</em> 'e. <br>  However, the ears themselves are not as good as we would like.  The sound in them is far from the desired ideal, although not as bad as you might think.  In addition, they always strive to fall out of the ears, at the slightest touch to the headset wires, which may be accidental. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/943/5e3/3d3/9435e33d3938792fad0fa66d7ea398b6.jpg" width="352" height="304" alt="Headset with soldered Koss" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      With the help of simple manipulations with a soldering iron, they have recently been replaced by <strong>Koss Plugs, which are</strong> closer to the heart.  Now the headset sits tight in the ears and provides decent sound quality.  The noise of the subway remains somewhere far behind, thanks to the good sound insulation of the <strong>Plugs</strong> . <br><h2>  Software </h2><br>  While <u>Steve Jobs is</u> only announcing a full- <strong>featured SDK</strong> for the <strong>iPhone</strong> in February next year, many enthusiasts are already creating programs on their own.  No matter how revolutionary the idea of <strong>Web 2.0</strong> would have been, even <u>Steve</u> realized that <em>online</em> applications are limited to browser functionality and cannot compete with applications for <strong>OS X itself</strong> (as we remember, a special trimmed version of <strong>Leopard was</strong> installed on the <strong>iPhone</strong> ). <br>  In order to run third-party applications on the <strong>iPhone</strong> , the first step is to do the so-called <em>JailBreak</em> (jailbreak), which will enable non- <strong>Apple</strong> programs to work through the holes found in the system.  At the moment, <em>JailBreak is</em> feasible, both for the <strong>iPhone</strong> (even with ominous firmware 1.1.1) and for the <strong>iPod Touch</strong> . <br>  After that, the <em>AppInstaller</em> application (or simply the <em>Installer</em> ) is installed on the <strong>iPhone</strong> , which independently, without the participation of a computer, allows you to select and install applications directly from the public repository via <em>Wi-Fi</em> or <em>Edge</em> .  Of course, after installing third-party applications there may be malfunctions in the operation of the device, therefore, installing them, you take responsibility for yourself. <br>  There is a lot of third-party software, but for the most part it is stupid.  Of the total programs, I can only mention the <strong>Russian Keyboard</strong> (the global system hack from <a href="http://russianiphone.ru/blog/">Slava Karpenko</a> , which gives happiness to all Russian-speaking <strong>iPhone</strong> users), <strong>Terminal</strong> (which is somewhat limited in its functionality), the <strong>NES</strong> emulator (funny but uncomfortable to play), <strong>Books</strong> (scroll the book finger is very unusual) <br>  and <strong>SummerBoard</strong> ( <strong>iPhone</strong> interface tuning). <br>  Separate material will be created in the near future for a review of <strong>iPhone</strong> embedded applications. <br>  As I already said, the platform‚Äôs hardware capabilities will provide a wide range of a wide variety of applications after the official <strong>SDK has appeared</strong> . <br><h2>  Cost of </h2><br>  The purchase of a price of <em>$ 399</em> (without tax) is <em>100 percent</em> <em>worth the</em> purchase.  At the moment, an unlocked device can be bought in Russia for a price close to <em>20,000 rubles</em> .  If you want to save money, ask friends who are flying to the States to buy you an <strong>iPhone</strong> .  So did the author of the article, which is no regrets.  Quite often, I monitor the forum of the site <a href="http://iphones.ru/forum/">iphones.ru</a> and recently began to appear news about the unfair work of customs when sending a phone with a parcel.  I advise you to pay attention to this forum if you are concerned about the purchase. <br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  As an <strong>iPhone</strong> owner who has been actively using the device for almost a month now, I want to say that there are many and mostly positive impressions from working with the phone.  The more you use the <strong>iPhone</strong> , the more you like it.  The device phenomenon itself has provided the capabilities of a multifunctional mobile device to people far from the IT industry.  Now everyone can see the movie, find out the weather, watch the latest videos on <strong>YouTube</strong> , see their favorite sites with <strong>Safari</strong> , even if they are not computer savvy.  You don‚Äôt need to go far for an example. Give your beloved <strong>iPhone a</strong> present and you will understand what is being said. <img src="http://usemac.ru/engine/data/emoticons/grin.gif">  The device is made to conscience, multimedia features are beyond praise.  <strong>Apple has been</strong> able to find a middle ground between the phone and the computer, for which she has a lot of respect and honor. <br><br>  <a href="http://usemac.ru/2007/10/30/one_month_with_iphone.html">http://usemac.ru</a> <a href="http://usemac.ru/2007/10/30/one_month_with_iphone.html"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15591/</a></p>
