  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oculus Rift games that can already be played</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are going to host the VR-TODAY exhibition and conference on virtual reality on May 17 at VSHBI.  On this joyful note, we publish in our blog translations from the Upload VR portal on top games for HTC Vive, PSVR and Oculus Rift.  <b>Today we will talk about the top 9 games for Oculus Rift</b> , translation under the cut.  Considering that I have an oculus at home, this is the most interesting article for me.  By the way, all readers of Habr have a <a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">20% discount on tickets</a> for the VR-Today conference on the promo code habr.  And I will be glad to give a ticket to all active participants of Habr with karma 20 and above (write for this in a personal). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0de/fa1/039/0defa103901b47cc994e2dfa981d6864.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We present you 9 games that we consider to be undoubtedly the best among all that the post-touch oculus can offer.  But before we begin, there are a few reservations: <b>Lucky's Tale</b> and <b>EVE: Valkyrie</b> will not be added to our list, due to the fact that they were already bundled with most helmets from the very beginning, although of course both of these games are good.  And also we will not mention unpretentious free <b>Farlands</b> , <b>First Contact</b> and <b>Oculus Dreamdeck</b> . <br><br>  The games on this list do not go in any particular order, we recommend them all equally.  Well, let's start!

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Onward</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkDrMbQhh3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  This is a hardcore VR shooter for hardcore VR gamers.  If you grew up playing games like <b>Rainbow Six</b> , <b>Ghost Recon</b> , <b>SOCOM</b> and other similar tactical military shooters, then you will feel at home in <b>Onward</b> .  It has much more in common with these games in terms of a grueling team game than in terms of running around and shooting, which can be found in modern shooters such as <b>Call of Duty</b> , and the whole game was created by one guy. <br><br>  Starting from using your rifle with both hands and using a walkie-talkie on your shoulder, ending with pulling out a knife, while sneaking up to your opponent, <b>Onward</b> is the very visceral, realistic VR game that many people have been waiting for.  A healthy and fun community makes this game really stand out for gamers among other VR titles. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">DiRT Rally</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/078/d3e/f11/078d3ef111b14f65b70cba444f6ac6dc.jpg"></div></div><br>  <b>DiRT Rally</b> officially replaces <b>Project Cars</b> from this list, as the best racing for the Rift.  Don't get me wrong, <b>Project Cars is</b> beautiful and impressively addictive, but <b>DiRT</b> surpasses its more severe gameplay, which perfectly matches the unique advantages of the VR helmet. <br><br>  The twists from which the knuckles whiten and second-by-second solutions in the off-road races of <b>DiRT Rally</b> perfectly transformed into VR.  Every second sharp turn or terrifying turn of the track is really felt inside the helmet.  It makes you feel the satisfaction of each such difficult to achieve and exciting victory.  Supplement it all with a game steering wheel and get the recipe ‚Äúlike never to see your children again‚Äù. <br>  And remember: do not cut. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Superhot VR</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OyAfKWvc6w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>Superhot VR</b> is a clean, distilled injection of genuine adrenaline that will make your blood run through your veins as fast as stopping time in the game.  With each movement you take, time crawls slowly, and everything from level design to dodging a series of bullets in slow motion is designed to enhance the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game.  From start to finish, she looks like a fantasy torn from any action movie, a real cacophony of visual and gameplay excitement. <br><br>  This is one of the best titles available for Oculus Rift and Touch, and the Forever update makes this game even cooler by adding enhanced game modes, more challenges and challenges, and improved replayability. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The unspoken</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/c4a/1b3/80ec4a1b39a64754b66927424976928d.jpg"></div></div><br>  Before <b>The Unspoken,</b> we were skeptical about how real-time online multiplayer would work with the Oculus Rift.  After <b>The Unspoken,</b> we learned the answer - it is super. <br><br>  <b>The Unspoken</b> is this year's third game in the <b>Insomniac</b> trilogy VR.  He puts you in sneakers, a scarf and a coat of a modern magician who is trying to avoid sinister intrigue in the dark streets of Chicago.  Despite this storyline, <b>The Unspoken is a</b> completely online multiplayer game (with the exception of a few limited offline training modes). <br><br>  In the game you can choose one of 3 unique classes, customize a variety of spells and artifacts, hone skills on the battlefield.  <b>The Unspoken is</b> addictive and fun with the fantastic ability to use new touch controllers.  When you spin a fireball or force a police car to levitate, it all looks and feels quite natural and exciting on a new Oculus platform. <br><br>  In addition, the search for the enemy occurs in seconds, not minutes, which was the main problem before the official launch of this game.  Dive into the world, perfect your magic and find out if you have what gives you the right to be called the greatest VR magician in the world. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Arizona Sunshine</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c1/5c8/8fe/0c15c88fe34a4ba697447dc685bc5577.jpg"></div></div><br>  If you‚Äôve ever sat with your friends and played: ‚ÄúHow could we survive the zombie apocalypse?‚Äù Then the <b>Arizona Sunshine</b> is the game for you.  Its developer Vertigo Games takes you straight to the sun-scorched Arizona desert.  Landscapes would be quite picturesque if they were not filled with legions of ghouls. <br><br>  Being armed only with a handful of firearms, you will need to scour for food, ammunition and shelter, as you work your way through the contaminated terrain in search of a safe haven from an endless horde of zombies.  The gameplay of <b>Arizona Sunshine is</b> satisfying and letting you feel in your gut, the protagonist is superbly voiced, and the story makes you feel despair, which is forced by the feeling of the end of the world. <br><br>  Also in the game there are various modes of complexity that allow you to change the damage of the zombies and the degree of shortage of ammunition.  As a culmination, there is an almost impassable ‚ÄúApocalypse Mode‚Äù that will make you think seriously before each shot.  Horde online mode is great for passing with friends, and the mechanics of the shootout and reloading weapons will retain the feeling of your active involvement in your own survival. <br><br>  In a market crowded with zombie shooters, the <b>Arizona Sunshine is</b> a cut above the rest of the games. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Robo recall</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82wB3zS5ZXU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  Once, Epic Games had a small demo, to show technical capabilities, called the <b>Bullet Train</b> , which was developed for the Oculus Rift and Touch controllers.  The game studio eventually took this idea and expanded it into a full-fledged game that became free for everyone who bought Touch.  It has a huge futuristic city that you can explore and tons of weapons that you can modify and improve as you improve combo attacks and kill an infinite number of evil robots. <br><br>  Retreating, pulling a bullet out of the air, and throwing it back at the enemy, to see how their bodies are torn to pieces, and their weapons fly right into your hands to shoot a robot nearby - this is simply unbelievable.  Few games can make you feel as powerful as <b>Robo Recall</b> , and this is simply one of the most amazing and beautiful VR games. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Edge of nowhere</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsNuUd-sIlo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  Insomniac is one of today's most prolific gaming studios, which has released such hits as <b>Ratchet &amp; Clank</b> , <b>Spyro</b> , and <b>Sunset Overdrive</b> .  <b>Edge of Nowhere</b> is the first Insomniac experience in the world of VR games and is one of the few Rift titles made by a renowned AAA developer. <br><br>  <b>Edge of Nowhere</b> is a third-person psychological thriller that will take you not only outside the cold Arctic, but also your mental sanity too.  Get ready to be scared, as well as an unforgettable VR experience during this game.  It should not be missed. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Damaged core</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HuXs5IL2bbQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  In <b>Damaged Core,</b> you play as artificial intelligence, the task of which is to take possession of enemy robots and use their unique weapons and skills to defeat the evil ‚ÄúCore‚Äù for the sake of humanity.  I think this is practically a masterpiece, as well as the best of the games I wrote about before.  Despite the fact that the game requires a gamepad, the central mechanics of jumping robots creates a deeper sense of freedom and immersion than most of the other similar games I've tried. <br><br>  Add to this an incredible visual accompaniment, addictive plot and interesting characters and you get the most complete and impressive VR game on this or any other platform. <br><br>  <i>At this translation came to an end.</i>  <i>Subscribe to our blog and read articles about the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/miip/blog/326048/">top 9 games for Vive</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/miip/blog/326424/">top 9 for Sony VR</a> .</i>  <i>Live to try the games and non-gaming capabilities of virtual reality can be with us on May 17 from 11:00 to 18:00.</i>  <i>There will be testing of various VR devices, including Epson Moverio BT-300 augmented reality glasses, communication with developers of virtual reality costumes for full immersion, VR project shows, VR attractions, VR cinema and a number of reports with practical cases of introducing VR in various fields .</i>  <i>For all readers of Habr, we decided to make a 20% discount on a ticket.</i>  <i>When <b><a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">registering,</a></b> use the code "habr" in the "from where you learned about the event."</i>  <i>And if you have more than 20 karma, then I will give you a ticket, write for this in a personal.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327098/</a></p>
