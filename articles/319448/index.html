  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúFriday format‚Äù: Salary size matters, or what employers are willing to pay</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The work of IT professionals today is highly paid.  As in any field, the main thing here is to be professional and well versed in your work and industry.  But today, at <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog">1cloud,</a> we will try to find out what employers are willing to pay large sums of ‚ÄúIT people‚Äù and which professions are paid higher than others.  For ease of comparison, all the examples in the article are in dollars and reflect the monthly salary. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/319448/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/5b9/21c/1045b921c80c40e69db64d0d9f9bbb9d.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sterlic/4299631538/">scott Akerman</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a></i> <br><br><h2>  My tongue my friend </h2><br>  It is believed that the value of the salary may depend on the programming language.  Of course, the ability to quickly learn and confident knowledge of algorithms and development principles can be much more important skills.  But if you look at the average, you can identify the most highly paid languages.

      For example, according <a href="https://qz.com/298635/these-programming-languages-will-earn-you-the-most-money/">to</a> Burning Glass and Brookings Institution in 2014, these were Objective C ($ 9,020), Python ($ 8,393), Java ($ 7,909) and C ++ ($ 7,792) and JavaScript ($ 7,622).  In 2016, the situation changed somewhat: Java ($ 9,584), Python and R (more than $ 8,333) entered the <a href="http://blog.edx.org/highest-paying-programming-languages-2016">top three</a> . <br><br>  To get the highest paying job in any field is not easy, and we do not call to learn any specific languages.  Moreover, the ranking of languages ‚Äã‚Äãby average salary for 2016 according to the results <a href="https://fossbytes.com/top-5-highest-paying-programming-languages-of-2016/">of the</a> Packt <a href="https://fossbytes.com/top-5-highest-paying-programming-languages-of-2016/">survey</a> shows very different results: Bash ($ 8,333), Perl ($ 7,917), Scala ($ 7,500), SQL ($ 5,167) and Delphi ($ 5,000).  Or maybe the chosen specialization influences the amount of salary? <br><br><h2>  Software developer </h2><br>  O'Reily Media conducted a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2016-software-development-salary-survey-report">survey</a> in which more than five thousand people from 51 countries took part.  The results of the study showed that an average software developer in Western companies <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/entry-level-software-developer-salary/">gets</a> $ 4,500 per month.  And women developers, of whom there are only 8%, receive almost a thousand dollars less.  And a little about languages ‚Äã‚Äã- the highest paid software developers use Scala, Clojure and Objective-C. <br><br>  If you want to get more, then you should think about moving to the United States, Switzerland, Japan or Australia.  Or think about working in companies that produce equipment and IT consulting.  Another option is to gain experience.  The more experience, the more employers are willing to pay.  As in the case, if the developer spends more than 60 hours a week at work. <br><br>  The maximum salary of this category of specialists exceeds $ 16.5 thousand per month (about 2% of all respondents receive so much).  Here you need to be not just a high-class professional, but also be prepared for a high level of responsibility.  But what else is required at such a place of work?  Of course, top managers receive the highest wages. <br><br>  However, employers are willing to pay more and ordinary developers, if they, in turn, are ready to perform additional responsibilities, which are not always associated with their work.  For example, 70% of respondents write code for joint projects, and 63% check or edit code written by someone else.  87% are involved in web (both backend and frontend) or mobile development. <br><br>  Another responsibility that raises salaries by almost $ 500 a month is planning large software projects.  In addition, many respondents have to communicate with other departments within the company and customers, engage in employee training, perform part of the duties of project managers and manage people, although formally they are not managers. <br><br>  We recently wrote about how communication skills can help in moving up the career ladder.  O'Reily's study showed that employees who work in small teams and do not go to general meetings receive significantly less than their more sociable colleagues.  So, the time spent at meetings directly proportional to the size of salary: if an employee spends 20 hours per week on them, then on average he will receive $ 4-7 thousand dollars a month more than his colleague, who does does not go. <br><br>  But the time spent on writing code has the opposite effect: if a software developer does not write code at all or spends 1-3 hours a week on it, then the chances that his salary will be higher than $ 10 thousand a month is much more than if writing code takes more than half of his working time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46f/03b/801/46f03b801b3d4ce5ac2b4aad521d994b.jpg"><br>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150684305%40N05/31303121384/in/album-72157678818236495/">m1try</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Data scientist </h2><br>  A specialist in data analysis and processing, or data scientist, in the west, on average, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm">receives</a> about $ 9.7 thousand per month.  In Russia, the average salary is more modest and amounts to only $ 1.5 thousand.  You can count on the highest wages while living in the United States, Britain and Australia, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2016-data-science-salary-survey-results">according</a> to the company O'Reily Media, which polled about 1,000 respondents. <br><br>  Salary is almost not dependent on the size of the company, and strong processing in this area is not welcome: employers are willing to pay more only if you work up to 55 hours a week.  Those who work more than 56 hours get less.  And the highest wages are in the financial and banking sectors, as well as in companies that are involved in cloud computing, hosting, and CDN services. <br><br>  There are as many as 20 percent women in this industry, but they still get almost $ 850 a month less than men, with equal responsibilities and experience.  Speaking of experience.  Of course, it is important, but 12 years are enough for employers.  An employee with 20 years of experience behind them will not get much more. <br><br>  But the time spent writing code can have a positive effect on salary; the more hours a week a Kodit specialist has, the more he gets.  But among the duties that can increase the amount of remuneration are the same as for software developers - communication with customers, organization and management of team projects and planning large software projects. <br><br><h2>  Web developer and mobile app developer </h2><br>  For a web developer in Russia, the average salary <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/315992/">is</a> $ 1.4 thousand per month, and the maximum (according <a href="https://volgograd.hh.ru/search/vacancy%3Ftext%3D%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%26clusters%3Dtrue%26enable_snippets%3Dtrue%26salary%3D180000%26only_with_salary%3Dtrue%26from%3Dcluster_compensation">to</a> hh) is $ 5 thousand.  In general, the situation may depend on what exactly the specialist does.  For example, in America, a large salary is received by specialists engaged in development both on the client side and on the service side (about $ 12,000) in comparison with those engaged only in the front-end or backend. <br><br>  The average salary of a mobile developer in Russia <a href="https://www.superjob.ru/research/articles/111800/samye-vysokie-zarplaty-v-sfere-it/">is</a> $ 1.8 thousand per month, and in the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salary%3Fq1%3DMobile%2BApplication%2BDeveloper%26l1%3Dworld">world</a> - $ 8 thousand.  The salary is also influenced by the chosen platform: leading developers on Android, according to research data, receive an average of $ 500 a month more than developers on iOS. <br><br>  Demanded programmer and writer James Somers (James Somers) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/web-developer-its-a-little-insane-how-well-paid-and-in-demand-i-am-2013-6">explains the</a> high salaries in this area in Silicon Valley by the fact that it is up to developers to determine whether a startup will become successful.  Therefore, employers are willing to pay an astronomical amount, just to attract the best of the best and give their project a chance. <br><br>  In addition, salaries are higher for those who are willing to do more.  For example, from additional skills, developers may need the <a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/">following</a> : perception of the interface from the user's point of view, understanding business needs, ability to work with DevOps, proper use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources. <br><br>  Employers appreciate more versatile professionals who are not afraid of processing and are ready to perform additional functions in the workplace.  But not always everything is decided only by the size of the salary, many companies, especially corporations in the field of IT, offer bonuses to their employees (we have already told about this <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318534/">here</a> ). <br><br>  And today, more and more applicants are guided precisely by various ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, because high wages imply greater responsibility, in addition, bonuses can really make work and even life more comfortable, and the cash surcharge is likely to be almost imperceptible. <br><br>  PS You can read other materials about the work of programmers in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318316/">Successful vacation for an IT specialist or some other favorite job</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/316110/">‚ÄúLead me better‚Äù: What will make the work of a novice programmer more effective</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/315230/">What is your profession?
