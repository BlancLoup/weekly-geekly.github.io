They are designed to provide the highest performance for any workload, work with high constant reliability, and be attractive from an economic point of view. <br><br>  Thus, ProLiant Gen10 servers configured with HPE Server Options are the ideal solution for any application workload and any IT environment, ‚îÄ from SMB to a large corporate information center. <br><br>  HPE Server Options integrate with many of the HPE system management tools for easy installation, configuration and support, reducing operational costs compared to non-HPE components.  HPE offers a wide range of storage, memory, network adapters and processors options. <br><br>  <b>HPE Memory</b> .  The selection of the appropriate memory is the key to obtaining the highest consumer properties, system reliability and faster return on IT investments.  The HPE portfolio includes HPE Standard Memory for typical workloads and HPE SmartMemory for memory intensive loads.  Customers can choose from various HPE memory types and DIMM capacity to optimize server performance and efficiency. <br><br>  <b>HPE Server Storage</b> .  HPE Server Storage for ProLiant Gen10 servers include hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD) and Smart Array Controllers.  The new HPE line of enterprise-level RAID controllers for Gen10 servers helps maximize performance, data availability and storage capacity. <br><br>  They provide up to 1.6 million I / O operations per second (Input / Output per Second, IOPS) and 65% better performance, while consuming up to 45% less power than previous generation controllers. <br><br>  The new mixed mode provides customers with high flexibility through the use of both the HBA (Host Bus Adapter) and RAID at the same time, on a single controller, which frees up a PCIe slot for other uses.  The HPE product range includes Smart Array S-Class software RAID controllers, Smart Array E-Class and P-Class. <br><br>  For entry-level solutions with SATA drives, HPE Smart Array Software RAID is most appropriate.  Its features include RAID 0/1/5/10 levels, support for 6G SATA, and access to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) configuration tool. <br><br>  Cost-effective HPE Smart Array E-Class Controllers implement simple RAID for designated storage software (Software-Defined Storage, SDS) with enterprise-class reliability and security.  Its main features are RAID on Chip (ROC) and the implementation of RAID levels 0/1/5/10. <br><br>  These controllers work in mixed mode, encrypt any drive connected to them using HPE Smart Array SR Secure Encryption, and provide the administrator with a UEFI configuration tool. <br><br>  Maximum performance of enterprise-class storage is achieved using the HP Array P-Class Controllers. <br><br>  These controllers are supported in HPE ProLiant racks and enclosures, BladeSystem, Apollo servers, and Synergy Compute Modules.  Their main features are Raid-on-Chip (ROC) technology, Flash Cache support (Flash-Backed Write Cache, FBWC) and advanced RAID levels 0/1/5/6/10/50/60/1 ADM / 10 ADM . <br><br>  The controller operates in mixed mode, encrypts any attached drive with an HPE Smart Array SR Secure Encryption and provides UEFI.  It is available for three types of workloads ‚îÄ enterprise (performance optimization), medium business (capacity optimization) and small business.  It has SAS (12G) and SATA (6G) interfaces and allows two form factors of drives ‚îÄ SFF (2.5 inches) and LFF (3.5 inches). <br><br>  Enterprise-grade hard drives (SAS 15K and 10K) provide the highest levels of application performance and reliability for critical input / output (I / O) workloads. <br><br>  Medium-level hard drives (SAS / SATA 7.2K) provide high performance and reliability for most business applications. <br><br>  Entry-level hard drives are designed for the non-critical needs of today's applications in the storage environment.  These drives have sufficient performance and the lowest cost value ($ / GB). <br><br>  Further acceleration of the execution of applications with intensive data exchange in the corporate environment is achieved using solid state drives (SSD) with high performance and low latency. <br><br>  HPE SSDs can have six form factors ‚îÄ SFF (2.5 inches), LFF (3.5 inches), M.2, M.2 Enablement Kits, Mezzanine and Add-in Cards.  They are available in three categories, separated by their target workloads ‚îÄ Read Intensive, Mixed Use and Write Intensive. <br><br>  The workload is defined as the number of writes per disk per day (Drive Writes Per Day, DWPD) and is usually calculated using the formula <br><br>  DWPD = (GB / Day) / Capacity <br><br>  Ie, how many disk volumes are recorded during the day.  HPE also defines DWPD as "the maximum number of 4K host records for the entire SSD capacity per day over a five year period." <br><br>  <b>Read Intensive SSD</b> , as a rule, have the lowest price and endurance &lt;= 1 DWPD.  They are ideal for downloading applications, web servers and reading the cache. <br><br>  <b>Write Intensive SSDs</b> typically have the highest read performance with a DWPD value&gt; = 10. Ideal for online transaction processing (On-Line Transaction Processing, OLTP), for use in business intelligence (Business Intelligence, and Big Data analytics). <br><br>  <b>Mixed Use SSDs</b> are used for undefined workloads that need a balance between high write and read performance.  The DWPD value for them is 1-10.  Ideal for applications with large I / O streams. <br><br>  All HPE server disks are supported by HPE Digitally Signed Firmware, which prevents unauthorized data access.  Each disc has been tested for 3.35 million uptime.  More information is available <a href="http://hpe.com/info/serverstorage">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Stable memory (HPE Persistent Memory)</b> .  HPE offers the widest range of robust memory on the market, consisting of high-performance NVDIMM and HPE Scalable Persistent Memory ‚îÄ an integrated storage solution.  The solution works at DRAM speeds, combining memory performance with storage stability.  HPE Scalable Persistent Memory is currently supported only on DL380 Gen10 servers. <br><br>  HPE Scalable Persistent Memory contains three main components ‚îÄ DRAM for accelerating applications, a specialized flash memory for providing stability and a backup power source for uninterrupted movement of data from DRAM to Flash. <br><br>  HPE Scalable Persistent Memory implements additional memory functions, performing validation of operations up to x27 faster, and up to x20 shortens the database restart time, ensuring maximum uptime. <br><br>  HPE Scalable Persistent Memory can also be useful in HTAP (Hybrid Transactional / Analytical Processing), SDS multi-row caching, etc. 8 GB and 16 GB HPE NVDIMM modules (the latter are available from the second half of 2017) are supported by flash DIMM.  More information is available <a href="http://hpe.com/info/persistentmemory">here</a> . <br><br>  HPE Server Network Adapters.
