Or, to be absolutely accurate, almost nothing.  In 2007, alizar has published a translation of "The <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/30899/">25 Most Interesting VoIP Startups</a> ", in which Switchvox was mentioned.  And in 2011, two weeks ago, I casually mentioned Switchvox in my article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/voip/122215/">‚ÄúReview of open IP PBX‚Äù</a> .  And all :-) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b22/dd6/1d5/b22dd61d53e0350416f74bf956677d7b.png" alt="image"><br>  Surprisingly, Switchvox is the most popular commercial product created on the basis of the Asterisk telephone designer.  Not only the most popular, but also seems to be the best.  From the very beginning, Switchvox received awards in all telecommunications contests and ratings.  See for yourself: <br><ul><li>  INTERNET TELEPHONY Magazine's "Product of the Year" Award for 2005 </li><li>  INTERNET TELEPHONY Magazine's 2006 Product of the Year Award </li><li>  TMC Switchvox SMB 3.0 - 2007 TMC Unified Communications Product of the Year </li><li>  Switchvox SMB 3.0 - 2007 Communications Solutions Product of the Year </li><li>  CRN Tech Innovators Award Switchvox SMB 3.0 - 2008 </li><li>  Internet Telephony West Best in Show, Best Of Open Source Switchvox SMB 3.5 - 2008 </li><li>  Internet Telephony Magazine Excellence Award Switchvox SMB 3.5 - 2008 </li><li>  IT Expo East 2009 Best of Show, Most Innovative Product Switchvox 4.0 - 2009 </li><li>  ... and so on every year until today (see the <a href="http://www.digium.com/en/company/awards/">full list of awards</a> ).  Last week, SwitchVox received an award for advanced unified communications - North American SMB Unified Communications Customer Value Enhancement ( <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43407456">source</a> ) </li></ul><br>  What is Switchvox and where does it come from and when?  I will tell this story under the best mix of this summer from Aurosonic (our guys!) ... for a habrkat. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSEshNxfvdA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhi0ugDrhQd6XMSvYxPwYB_mlY-Eg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short and in simple words, the saga turned out to be about the same. <br><br>  Mark Spencer writes the first versions of Asterisk, makes them open, and creates Digium, a company that sells Asterisk boards for connecting to traditional communication lines.

      Digium leads two branches of Asterisk - open source and business edition (BE).  The first is available to everyone in the source code, and the second - only in binary form and for money.  Nobody can really explain the advantages of BE (in any case I am :-) - the type is more stable, and includes some unique, closed, questionable mega-features.  All sit on the free version. <br><br>  Digium makes an attempt to create a WEB interface for Asterisk and, on its basis, a ‚Äúboxed solution‚Äù - AsteriskNow, which fails miserably, since the output has turned out to be a creepy Java-scripting monster that no one has earned. <br><br>  Also Digium tried to produce so-called appliances - boxes with the pre-installed AsteriskNow, which also came out without any. <br><br>  Digium was too much involved in coordinating the development of Asterisk, as well as in the low-level development of the Asterisk core, and this, obviously, turned out to be something other than creating simple and convenient user interfaces. <br><br>  At this time, Digium draws attention to the fact that Switchvox, together with its eponymous product, built on the basis of Asterisk, is starting to tear to shreds all competitors in the SMB sector.  Without further ado, Digium makes a strategic move, and buys Switchvox with all the giblets.  This happens in September 2007. <br><br>  It took Digium another 4 years to digest the purchase and develop a strategy, or concept, for the coexistence of free and free Asterisk and closed and commercial Switchvox.  Finally, at the end of 2010, the Digium website is undergoing restructuring, and is conceptually divided into two parts: <br><ul><li>  buy switchvox and enjoy life; </li><li>  no money - download asterisk, and become your own blacksmith of your happiness (just remember first to estimate the time and resources that the forge eats - it may make sense to spend this money now on Switchvox and immediately start to rejoice), well, build your own unique solution . </li></ul><br>  Or you can even compare.  Asterisk for telephony is like Apache for WEB.  By itself, a WEB server without WEB applications is nothing.  Similarly, there is little confusion from one telephony - we need telephone applications that implement some kind of business logic.  Asterisk is the engine.  And Switchvox is a car that requires minimal technical knowledge to manage. <br><br>  And Mark Spencer promised the Asterisk community that Digium would pull various parts out of Switchvox and inject them into Asterisk, thus revealing the source code of Switchvox, which is confirmed in principle - the channel event logging is included in the current Asterisk ( see <a href="">screenshot</a> ). <br><br>  At this point, one can end the story, and begin to talk about what Switchvox is today, and how it captured the minds and hearts of Western IP telephony experts. <br><br>  So, Switchvox is Digium's unified communications solution.  Consists of the following main components: <br><ul><li>  phone core - based on Asterisk. </li><li>  WEB administrator interface to manage the entire system (there is no remote access via SSH, everything is done strictly with the mouse, all you knew about Linux &amp; Asterisk before ‚Äî forget it) </li><li>  WEB interface for employees to configure their own functions, to view the statistics of calls, recorded conversations, faxes.  Part of the user interface is the Switchboard ‚Äî a real-time call control board, and not just calls.  Switchoard is like iGoogle and gadgets, you can put anything on the board for quick access. </li><li>  Built-in Jabber server, as a client, you can use the Switchboard chat panel, or a favorite client. </li><li>  <a href="http://developers.digium.com/switchvox/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Hundreds of</a> XML-API methods that envelop almost the entire Switchvox, and allow its functionality to be embedded in third-party applications.  On youtube you can watch a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1dezVf0qrsw">video</a> on the integration of Switchvox and Microsoft CRM. </li></ul><br>  In the recently released version of Switchvox 5.0, Digium introduced fixed mobility convergence (FMC) features.  The call is transparent (without setting a wait) "flows" from a landline phone to a mobile, and vice versa!  And so you can connect up to 6 phones, regardless of the type. <br><br>  Digium has a similar semblance of the Switchvox demo - <a href="http://www1.digium.com/en/products/switchvox/switchvox-demo">http://www1.digium.com/en/products/switchvox/switchvox-demo</a> . <br><br>  There is still such a thing as a free Switchvox for home - Switchvox Home Edition.  It can be <a href="http://www1.digium.com/en/products/switchvox/support/switchvox-home-edition">downloaded</a> and used for free.  I will write about it in more detail next week when I study its difference from paid ones. <br><br>  Now about Switchvox pricing.  Unlike traditional business models, where functionality is limited, the Switchvox user has access to all functions without exception.  The price consists of: <br><ul><li>  server (several models) </li><li>  user account numbers </li></ul><br>  Options: <br><ul><li>  Switchvox SOHO AA60 (up to 20 users, up to 10 simultaneous calls) ~ $ 2300 </li><li>  Switchvox SMB AA65 (30 users, up to 12 simultaneous calls, 2 PCI slots) ~ $ 4230 </li><li>  Switchvox SMB AA305 (150 users, up to 45 simultaneous calls, 3 PCI slots) ~ $ 5300 </li><li>  Switchvox SMB AA355 (450 users, up to 75 simultaneous calls, 3 PCI slots) ~ $ 7400 </li><li>  Silver Subscription 1 year (Renewal of subscription for technical support. 1 year / price per user) ~ 10 $ </li><li>  Gold Subscription 1 year (Renewal of subscription for technical support. 1 year / price per user) ~ 15 $ </li><li>  Platinum Subscription 1 year (Renewal of subscription for technical support. 1 year / price per user) ~ 25 $ </li></ul><br><br>  It is believed that today Switchvox offers the maximum for its money, compared to its competitors.  Many awards are just for the best of value. <br><br>  Switchvox is not yet Russified, but work is being done in this direction. <br><br>  In conclusion, several videos on youtube: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6O2ugtqnTbA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhoutpWX5ZJ8SejnqXJdItFI0haeQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/euaiEgEe10U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh0jPGp9jkdO6eoYnzQi-6Vbcwpfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6xThufI-9s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIDnTTpx19qg3YVh24W99hq-pTdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was an introduction to a unified communications system called Switchvox.  In the near future, as we study Switchvox, new reviews will be written with a detailed description of this journey.
