In the course of working on the <a href="https://kato.im/">Kato</a> project, we decided to pay more attention to this aspect. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <h4>  Problem </h4><br>  Much of the instant messengers (when we started working on Kato were the majority of these) for one reason or another does not give users ample opportunities for the design of the text - most often you can diversify it with links, emoticons and emoji, but no more. <br><br>  At the same time, the distribution of instant messengers led to the fact that they were also used for business communications, which imply greater structured information.  In this situation, the inability to create a banal list right in the message body is a problem for the user. <br><br>  If you compare the situation with the email, then the email wins, because any popular email client can format the text beautifully, and not just insert emoticons and attach files. <br><br>  Since we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kato/blog/243617/">do not consider</a> email to be an ideal tool for business communication and we want to create a product that would be better suited for this, it was decided to introduce into the Kato messenger more advanced text formatting options. <br><br><h4>  Using Markdown </h4><br>  The best solution to the problem at the first stage was the introduction of Markdown markup support by John Gruber and Aaron Schwarz to the instant messenger.  This solution has its drawbacks: <br><br><ul><li>  This is a simplified, but markup language, and you need to deal with it, which immediately makes it unsuitable for a large number of ordinary users. </li><li>  Markdown documentation is frankly <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">bad</a> - this led to the emergence of third-party and better structured implementations (the creators of one of them called Standard Markdown, John Gruber, even <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">complained</a> and demanded to rename the project so that its secondary nature was visible). </li></ul><br>  However, there are also big advantages, the main of which is the possibility of writing much more complex and richly decorated messages than before.  In addition, Markdown is still simpler than the markup and commands of some other services ... <br><br>  The number of Kato users who use <a href="https://kato.im/articles/cheatsheet/">Markdown</a> in their daily work is already 20% and is constantly increasing, and, according to their reviews, they don‚Äôt want to return to communication in the ‚Äútext only‚Äù mode. <br><br>  Since the markup mode cannot be called the most requested feature for regular users, by default it is disabled.  Markdown is included in the message input window (that the mode is activated, the corresponding mark is displayed under the input field): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/dae/ea5/f08daeea5d654ec3b69c287002f549ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also turn on Markdown mode by default. <br><br>  After that, the user can write operators to create lists, bold or italics, insert images, and so on (we have a separate <a href="https://kato.im/articles/markdown-syntax/">article</a> about the most popular operators): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/27c/2b2/d6d27c2b2bc4b7b205533e34814a270b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, it is possible to view the original Markdown code <br>  messages sent to the chat - to do this, click on the ‚Äúsleepers‚Äù on the left side of the message in the history and click on the Markdown icon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d96/994/e6f/d96994e6f59dc7ac1b96b86c2d6c26e6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the future, we plan to implement a visual editor in Kato that would allow the user to format messages without the need to enter commands (most likely, user actions will be automatically translated into the Markdown markup). <br><br><h4>  Messenger for programmers </h4><br>  Text formatting is a common problem, but for people who work with a program code and use messengers, there is another difficulty - copying the code and inserting it later.  Many services (for example, Skype or HipChat) "spoil" the code - interpret the combination of brackets and colons as emoticons, and when you try to use the code copied from the message, it is no longer compiled. <br><br>  When using these general-purpose chat services, we have repeatedly encountered this problem, so Kato decided to correct the situation.  As a result, another message typing <a href="https://kato.im/articles/cheatsheet/">mode</a> was created, which (like Markdown) is activated separately and allows users to exchange code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/912/a64/1b1/912a641b16bbc6f2155fc5b76e52d130.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Small pieces of code can be inserted directly into the current line and with the help of the same Markdown (special quotes are used for this, located on the keyboard under the ‚Äútilde‚Äù symbol): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/078/d70/6f5/078d706f5485744d67892d4f08df9a72.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the code insertion mode, its small pieces in the chat are displayed in its entirety: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07d/15d/cc6/07d15dcc6df4b350fc26a4f1f051bc94.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Larger sections are displayed using the 'paste' link - a click on it opens a separate window where the code is highlighted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cde/0be/d09/cde0bed09c4e03d16fc623de8cd628e1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74c/3d4/b33/74c3d4b33c7ecc42da0b42818ef48ada.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Kato users appreciated the possibilities of using Markdown and pasting code and thank them for their implementation. <br><br>  That's all for today.  In the next article we will talk about a document that nobody reads, but which is very important - the privacy policy of the messenger and who, when and how gets access to the story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244215/</a></p>
