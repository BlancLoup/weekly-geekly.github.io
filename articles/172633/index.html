The presentation for journalists was held simultaneously in New York and London, and more recently the device was demonstrated in HTC brand stores located in St. Petersburg and Moscow. <br><br>  There are very few things left before the start of sales, but for now we would like to tell you a little more about the smartphone, which absorbed a lot of innovations and realized all (or almost all) the wishes of users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32c/43c/26f/32c43c26f5914f31356881226db21a76.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, you could hear a phrase repeated from the announcement to the announcement as a spell: ‚ÄúThe time has come for design‚Äù.  As you know, they meet by clothes, and with this, the HTC One is all right.  Monolithic metal casing protects the device from all sides, and any backlash or squeaks of ‚Äúplating‚Äù are completely excluded.  And the design here is more than enough, and with this alone the new product already stands out a lot from the host of similar monoblocks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/556/fb2/a44/556fb2a44032c47411694fd3e0bc231f.jpg"><br><br>  The main material of the case is the long-awaited noble metal.  As is known, it prevents the passage of radio waves, so special indentations were made for the antennas of wireless interfaces, and on top of them they were closed with thin polycarbonate plates that form the final appearance of the device.  Despite the need to fit a lot of productive components in a compact and stylish case, the designers managed to achieve a thickness of 9.3 mm, and the width of the tapered sidewalls does not exceed 4 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df9/062/27b/df906227bdbf7393b4d0c41b23259eef.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/937/356/e15/937356e1533f979b95fa83d07e3cdbd7.jpg"><br><br>  From generation to generation, the perception of size changes, and the feeling of ‚Äúshovel shape‚Äù can arise for many reasons.  The value of the diagonal of the display, of course, is taken into account, but is not the determining factor, and the device with a 4.7 "screen is perceived perfectly normal.  The dimensions of the HTC One are 137.4 x 58.2 mm, and this metal bar weighs only 143 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a31/5bc/952/a315bc95254669603e7f27aaae0ac6ee.jpg"><br><br>  Having settled delights at the case materials, a similar combination of which the manufacturers of smartphones so rarely please us, we will have to once again be filled with respect for the manufacturer from Taiwan.  After all, the HTC One is the leader in dot density per inch;  the value of this parameter is as much as 468 ppi!  As you probably already know, the display has FullHD resolution and is protected by the latest generation Gorilla Glass, and in terms of brightness, contrast and color saturation it stands out among numerous competitors.  No problems with viewing angles, and the visibility of the mean March sun of the northern capital also did not let up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe4/8bd/875/fe48bd8758295a47455c4e5b8128319d.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, one of the newest developments in the ‚Äúsystems on a chip‚Äù industry is obliged to make a company on a gorgeous screen, and in this case it is a Qualcomm Snapgragon 600 quad-core platform operating at up to 1.7 GHz.  RAM, as befits the flagship, 2 GB, and the built-in - 32. We must think that this volume will be quite enough to meet the needs of most users. <br><br>  As usual, you can not ignore the numerous packages for measuring performance.  The results of the synthetic tests are shown in the screenshots, but from myself we add - there was not a single reason to accuse One of the slow pace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bcf/6f7/c79/bcf6f7c79205073a8a89bdda81796d69.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a7b/616/d7e/a7b616d7e0302edae3235f7f7519acde.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/506/25b/8db/50625b8dbabce4f448946921765c93fc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41a/c1e/b57/41ac1eb573671883a383c2a2146aeb3f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e93/6da/d0a/e936dad0a1cb4656c03a9310d6f29ce4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33c/14e/9f8/33c14e9f839ca9c09f8f1c088de8e08f.png"><br><br>  Non-detachable case also implies a non-removable battery, the capacity of which is increased compared to its predecessors and is 2300 mAh.  Thus, the only loophole in the interior of the device remains the hole for the proprietary "clip" or any other object that allows you to pull out the slide for the microSIM card of the cellular operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56e/065/6f2/56e0656f2fae8ee85642c76e448dcff1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/231/28b/ace/23128bacee293f35d5eacdb80e272c38.jpg"><br><br>  It's time to turn on the phone.  The usual initial setup procedure now includes advanced options for restoring and transferring data from devices from other manufacturers.  Moreover, owners of the One smartphone will be able to import a backup from the iPhone, made through the manager of iTunes! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f04/9d6/15e/f049d615e67fc42691d41259d19dcd77.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/196/016/b4b/196016b4b844b8149dbc5a34a51ed649.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a4/9b2/a5b/6a49b2a5b26d6e2d71a99a0edf7b024f.png"><br><br>  In short, it remains only to recall the model of the previous device, select it from the list, and the desired content in a couple of clicks will be in your new smartphone.  Simplify the configuration process allows a web interface familiar to us from the review of HTC One X +.  Just go to <a href="http://start.htc.com/">start.htc.com</a> from your computer and select your device to get a ready-made solution with selected widgets, wallpapers and other personalization parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a5/2f5/aeb/1a52f5aeb5c173511d1fde476bdc8ee8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b65/1c0/2f4/b651c02f49cf7a421c9c9bd4983c2984.jpg"><br><br>  However, the updated interface Sense 5.0 is much more interesting to learn on your own, because it is fundamentally changed compared to previous versions, and the number of interesting details and functions just goes off scale.  Of course, you cannot pass by the personalized news feed of HTC BlinkFeed, which displays not only news of the chosen subject, but also updates of social networks along with notifications and weather forecasts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56f/cfc/e11/56fcfce11a14c9d1ef9742e8ccdbd5e5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09f/ab4/39d/09fab439d4f56acfcbc26ebc93b3efe9.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc6/d44/bbd/dc6d44bbd897635cf944c0d89213b135.png"><br><br>  The BlinkFeed service now supports 1,400 sources of content, and over time their number will only grow.  Answering a reasonable question like ‚ÄúWhy is it necessary if you have a favorite RSS client or the same Flipboard?‚Äù, You can say the following: all the content appearing in the BlinkFeed feed is optimized on the NTS server, saving traffic and battery of your device.  By selecting any news, you can quickly run through it in a convenient form for reading, and if necessary, go to the site with the original text in one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43a/c81/b1b/43ac81b1bef8f4ed0eaf95e922cb19e5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41d/437/77a/41d43777aa4fc1a0144dda6a3e8a06d7.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/067/5bb/2b8/0675bb2b8b07c3d186d67f45a027d6cf.png"><br><br>  If you want to see the usual desktop, just scroll to the right.  The application menu is called by pressing the familiar central button in the dock, and the size of the grid of labels can be changed at your own discretion.  It may seem that there is no special benefit from the FullHD screen on a relatively small diagonal, but it is enough to compare the image with a similar 720p display, and the smoothness of the contours in areas of sharp contrast (for example, at the borders of application icons) will be obvious. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea2/28d/12a/ea228d12aa1d5598209658624cd8adcd.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aaf/3fd/913/aaf3fd9130b9c58ff65747e521876764.jpg"></a> <br><br>  For your convenience, the comparative images are clickable.  While you are busy viewing photos, let us continue.  Consuming content has become much more convenient and more enjoyable, and there was not just one personalized news feed.  In particular, our services are pleased to offer stereo speakers located on the front surface.  When they are activated, HTC BoomSound technology comes into its own.  All this is not just beautiful words, One really guarantees a fundamentally new level of sound for mobile phone loudspeakers, and voicing a small room with it will definitely not be a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b8/1d5/d08/2b81d5d087df87a7b7e4298f969981b8.jpg"><br><br>  What's the secret?  For the good work of building high-quality sound, there are as many as two amplifiers, one of which is responsible for outputting the audio signal to the headphones through a standard minijack, and the second, in turn, is the main speaker.  As a result, HTC One was perfectly audible even in the atmosphere of a nightclub, and playing dynamic races or shooters on it is a pleasure! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c0/0c0/196/2c00c0196ad1a0c187479db37629ccbf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96f/375/c63/96f375c6334146729f7af062d4e33e12.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9d/e56/0d3/c9de560d33f2b098566f2db405668fdd.png"><br><br>  On listening to music in the headphones can not speak.  The sound is rich and detailed, there is a fair amount of loudness, and in addition to the traditional lossy formats, FLAC is loved by favorite music lovers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc9/622/88c/bc962288ce8a95df5cd753c32809a8b4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e0/dda/771/6e0dda7710db208f57407ffbc6110e93.png"><br><br>  If you give the go-ahead to download additional information, along with listening to music, you can admire the high-quality animation of the lyrics, and all this without leaving the standard player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85c/60d/e55/85c60de5582ad7cbc130a3f7bd2fae85.jpg"><br><br>  However, plunging into all this magnificence, one should not forget about the main function of the phone, for the sake of which it was once invented.  We dare to assure you that as a device for calls, One is able to show its best. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d6/cbe/0af/0d6cbe0aff3e931e6d5e98d9412362ce.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1bb/415/a4a/1bb415a4aad5fa860da4248adf9f03b4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1a/877/3f4/d1a8773f4b235274638f45faf600ca8d.png"><br><br>  The redesigned dialer with the support of predictive input got the keyboard zoom mode, and the contacts, the magazine and the dialer itself are still tightly integrated to ensure maximum comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fc/02e/ae8/0fc02eae86f99c61bfdd9fa1f098f546.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5d/518/877/b5d518877a909aa1fd386dbd03a1d304.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1e/33e/09a/b1e33e09aeea00aa5d0ae4fa85832e52.png"><br><br>  Tabs with components of the telephone part can be swapped, and this is true for most system applications.  In the end, the user should feel at home, and make a rearrangement in their own home - a sacred thing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa9/cff/774/aa9cff77414b3500781481d6101ba2ed.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c1/df5/84b/1c1df584b6314be339bbbe4fee97fb79.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00f/59f/79e/00f59f79ef9ba5fc521d14e46703c862.png"><br><br>  In addition to traditional GSM bands, 4G (LTE) generation communication is supported, and, most importantly, the device is ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with domestic networks of this standard.  Thus, it is enough to acquire a SIM card with LTE support, and web surfing at previously unthinkable speeds will become a reality in the very near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/071/b7f/94b/071b7f94b62b97593b82292cfd08f40b.jpg"><br><br>  About support for NFC, DLNA and Bluetooth 4.0, perhaps you can not mention, but a couple of letters from the boring specifications of wireless networks, perhaps, should be focused.  The fact is that the HTC One is equipped with the support of the ultra-modern standard Wi-Fi 802.11ac, which allows you to transfer data three times faster than the accelerating specification of 802.11n. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd5/69d/3c5/cd569d3c5d3ecfea0fd0c36229a6c7c5.jpg"><br><br>  The microUSB port supports the MHL protocol for transferring content to a compatible device via an HDMI cable, and another interface definitely got a second birth with the One premiere.  This is an infrared port.  Yes, about the one who, as it seemed to many, died long ago and irrevocably with reference to mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94e/bfa/ee2/94ebfaee2854732933464897aeb9ff0c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/553/686/28b/55368628b3896b55a2cbfa619203ce13.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/252/4d6/32f/2524d632fe5bb4ad3d4ef58a8dfffee5.png"><br><br>  The powerful IR transmitter in One is combined with a power button located on the upper end, so you shouldn‚Äôt be surprised at its knockout color.  In principle, the NTS company could simply implement the management of household appliances using the infrared port and dwell on this, its function scenarios would be found.  But believe me, this is only the beginning.  Around the interface, in fact, deployed a service, predictably named HTC TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80b/6fb/00e/80b6fb00eb7245ac9d46a41296a90ead.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a7b/a9c/195/a7ba9c1951a2279747a99624daaef67c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b4/14b/cd9/7b414bcd98eeeb3ea10ee1ff2221c712.png"><br><br>  He has yet to get used to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existence of Russian television, but it is enough to ask any country to see the potential of the service.  HTC TV allows you not only to set and configure as many remotes as you need, but also quickly displays notifications about new programs and favorite programs, integrating into the BlinkFeed news feed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa3/cb8/6dc/aa3cb86dc70774776bdb95688e895ff8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58e/12a/b68/58e12ab68cbcacccab45ecfed1a6300d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93e/27b/90e/93e27b90e6493c5e0f6f7d662c46005e.png"><br><br>  In order to fulfill the popular dream and get the opportunity to ‚Äúcall to the remote‚Äù, you just need to choose the brand of your TV, point HTC One to the ‚Äúbox‚Äù and turn it on.  Everything, the virtual remote control is saved, and in the future, switching channels will not force you to look for a traditional manipulator, as usual, all the time somewhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0d/596/53b/f0d59653b6c0fc1f4ef26a78ef213588.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d84/a9c/075/d84a9c075826d999948a6302d72c2559.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d50/170/f56/d50170f56f1748686d671e6c51721747.png"><br><br>  If for some reason the desired item is missing in the list, it does not matter - the IR port can boast of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù, and it is enough to point it at the transmitter of the console from the equipment you need and press the corresponding buttons to transfer the commands to the HTC One. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7b/762/3cc/e7b7623ccdc98a51414b0d1f76bb7649.jpg"><br><br>  We dare to hope that you must have heard about the special camera of the new flagship.  The pixel size in the HTC One matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã2 microns (unlike the 1.1 microns typical of most camera phones), and the f / 2.0 high-aperture, back-illuminated sensor and the updated HTC ImageChip 2 image processor make it possible to unleash the potential of the images obtained. as much as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/693/18d/88b/69318d88b6bd5319ec33714e07d2716b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a00/cc3/618/a00cc3618bca6ea1a9e04302ad11bafd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e4/b02/887/5e4b028873bf116e7aa5a7c7ea125bfd.png"><br><br>  Both the main and front cameras record video in FullHD, and in the process of shooting, the dynamic range is expanded.  Yes, now in HDR you can shoot not only photos, but also videos.  Moreover, along with the standard recording speed, there is a fast shooting mode with a frequency of 60 frames / sec (the resolution is 1280x720 pixels).  In the end, the playback speed can be changed directly during shooting, bringing the recording quality from the camera of the smartphone to a new level of entertainment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f1/c95/7c5/3f1c957c59032c6dafa3613e3fe0a0a0.jpg"><br><br>  Traditionally, NTS devices take pictures easily when shooting video, but the most important and deserving attention is the appearance of the HTC Zoe mode.  Thanks to him, you will not miss a single frame, because Zoe will save five photos before pressing the trigger, several frames after and record a three-second video in maximum quality.  The result is neatly mounted by the program in an elegant clip with interesting effects and suitable music, and all this is completely automatic! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/529/05f/c13/52905fc1373e9551247c2be22ecd172e.jpg"><br><br>  It takes only a single button press, and the result can exceed all expectations.  Due to the presence of commercials photos when viewing from the Gallery literally come to life when viewed.  If something from what you see does not suit you, a large amount of source material and a functional photo editor will allow you to remove extra items from the frame and retouch other parameters. <br><br>  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the software responsible for the camera was still in the process of final refinement, so we cannot illustrate it with screenshots of the interface and shooting examples.  We promise to fix it in the shortest possible time, perhaps even as part of a separate material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c67/3f8/5b7/c673f85b741cb8585a8d5a4d2356953d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fef/92f/145/fef92f1456059f360a992d8e07aa5db9.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/041/d57/cb1/041d57cb13f804da22e687f6d3942036.png"><br><br>  As a small compensation, we give statistics on battery consumption.  In the end, the emergence of the association of the form "quad-core processor + FullHD-display = non-outstanding autonomy" is easy to predict, and here the HTC One once again presents a pleasant surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcb/81c/4e8/dcb81c4e865926254defdff2fd276147.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df9/b8e/5ed/df9b8e5ed289b1723f4b414a5234c2f5.jpg"><br><br>  HTC One withstood a couple of days of intense test operation, and in fact the process included benchmark runs, games at maximum brightness and music at a decent volume.  It should be noted that during the battery consumption cycle, the screen activity time was more than three hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcd/b74/ebb/fcdb74ebb38bc0b2a630cdf32ac52916.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, we can safely say that HTC One will be your faithful assistant all day long.  The device will go on sale within a month at an estimated price of 29990 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172633/</a></p>
