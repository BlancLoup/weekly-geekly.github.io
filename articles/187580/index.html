  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easy way to play old games with 3dfx emulation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Warning: this article only applies to people over twenty.  If you are younger - boldly close the browser tab, you will not get such pleasure from it. <br>  Also, someone could know about it, but for some reason I did not find any materials about how cool it works.  If someone can add me - welcome. <br>  My idea is to give happiness to play old games with the largest possible circle of people, to make it as simple and quality as possible.  In my opinion, I found the best way, without much effort, in the maximum quality to play classic games wherever and whenever you want.  Also quick and easy how to install a modern game and play. <br>  If for something you need very serious knowledge - not everyone will appreciate it.  And playing old games is getting harder, and for some it's almost completely impossible. <br>  But not now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you are minus - specify the reason, it is important to me. <br>  If you want to immediately find out what to do - scroll to the last paragraph. <br><br>  After the new year, a wave of nostalgia swept over me, it often happens to me, but this time it pressed me very hard.  Before that, I had several attempts to revive my childhood friends, but for various reasons they ended without much success.  And then I got the first, very rare pilot issue of Twisted Metal, the very first part released by a party of 5,000 copies only for Japan.  Yes, for the computer, for Windows 95!  Under the 98th, I also promised to work, especially since I did not have the 95th, and I somehow am better friends with the 98th.  Only I collected my nostalgic comp, put some games, as my girlfriend occupied, she sees under the 98th Windows the last photoshop does not work and everything is not like that, ‚Äúwhat the hell are you installing here, in general this is my comp, you there is a new one. ‚Äù <br>  Happiness was short lived.  I can‚Äôt play the worst thing on my favorite games on my working steam train, which is overclocked to the very least, as the game units are friendly with Windows 7 x64, even with all compatibility profiles and fixes, and new games aren‚Äôt so fun.  Ok, I put her XP, on her with all the compatibility profiles, all games, even the rarity, TwistedMetal under 95yu Windows!  The joy was even more short-lived, since my joy either namuded something with the drivers because of its photoshop, or set it as usual FIG know what the FIG knows why, but only a couple of games started running from my collection.  Though stand still cry.  The third computer is purely for games in the apartment there is no place to put it. <br><br>  I experimented with virtual computers for a long time, some allegedly supported full-fledged 3D acceleration, but in fact there were weeks of irrational efforts, everything either did not work, or it was unstable.  About the fun of the game, I almost forgot, just kept digging in that direction.

      My next "find" was the image of Windows 95y under the dosbox, with Voodoo emulation! <br>  I found it here, by chance, in the comments I found a link to the DOSBox from ykhwong with the pre-installed Russian Windows 95 OSR2 + DirectX6, and the last firewood for the virtual Voodoo, I found after several months with other combinations of operating systems and virtual machines: <br>  <a href="http://osvirtual.net/ru/microsoft-windows-95-with-software/">osvirtual.net/ru/microsoft-windows-95-with-software</a> <br><br>  There was a lot of joy, but again the music did not play long.  I couldn‚Äôt send my own CD-ROM there, many games require a disk or are not installed from a folder on the HDD, and it took me almost a month to install DaemonTools there, I tried other virtual drives, there was little use.  I won‚Äôt say what it required and what I installed and how, so as not to knock you down with my experience, I‚Äôll just say that version 347 is needed, it exists on the Internet, with different sizes of the installation file, with different performance and requires 3 more to install 4 programs.  If someone makes this way and gets a stable system - I will be very happy to hear how he did it.  I can also tell you what I did and give all the materials that I have. <br>  Anyway, pleased, I was able to get a working image of the system with DT, I was able to install several games ... And then I was disappointed.  No game is playable, sorry for the pun.  In many there are screensavers, almost all of them are slowing down the menu, not one of them has been able to work for more than a couple of seconds, then either crash with the conversion to the wrong memory, or silent death.  Experiments with the settings of the dosbox gave nothing.  Again, maybe you will get luckier and this image is working, I just stopped all attempts to find the way I want to talk about, it is millions of times easier. <br><br>  Then I tried to squeeze all that I could from Windows 98, worked a little more stable, but again 99% is unplayable or it looks like very little ice.  Virtualok has tried a lot. <br><br>  Then a new vmware release was released in which they showed off their 3D support in a virtual machine.  It seemed to me that everyone ignored this, as I did ... almost. <br>  Winda 98 was not pleased with anything again - there is a virtual graphics adapter in it, the simplest games somehow work, but DirectX 5.0-9.0 stubbornly says that there is no video adapter, go for a walk. <br><br>  And then I got a complete overview from vmware out of the corner of my eye - they didn‚Äôt promise to support normal 3D everywhere!  Only since XP!  And we don‚Äôt need more.  For 99% of games, there are compatibility files that allow them to run under XP.  And there it is possible to put the dosbox to the heap so that it is all in one place.  This solves all the problems with new computers!  Plus, this system can theoretically live forever.  If you don‚Äôt install anything other than games, make backups of it (my backup of XP SP3 + Need For Speed ‚Äã‚Äã1-5 in full versions weighs 1! DVD in the archive and 7.5GB in the working form of the vmware image - which is almost imperceptible to the multi-terabyte screw) - your happiness will always be with you. <br>  Everything would be fine, but something was missing.  In my computer room in my childhood there were a lot of computers, but for some reason only one of them had a line longer than now for new iPhones ... there was a small print on the wall written next to each computer that it had for hardware, and that was all like everyone except for one line - everyone had Riva TNT written, and he had Voodoo! <br>  Who knows what I mean, he will appreciate. <br>  Even if the game had a version of Direct3D along with Voodoo, they never even stood next to it. <br>  Previously, I didn‚Äôt really bother, played and played, but when I first saw HOW my favorite Need For Speed ‚Äã‚Äã3 and Counter-Strike 1.6 was different, like dozens of other games, I filled up a line for this computer for a long time.  It seemed magic - all other pictures looked prehistoric and scary against its background.  You should see it all with my eyes. <br>  Anyway, in this my find there was a place for Voodoo.  No, I did not buy it, and it will not work now in a virtual machine without much effort. <br>  Many thanks to the guys from <a href="http://www.zeus-software.com/">www.zeus-software.com</a> - they made it possible, quickly answer questions and quickly fix bugs, which are almost nonexistent. <br>  When I did this, I almost cried.  Orgasm with eyes, otherwise I can not name it, the skin runs goose bumps from high - as if he looked into his memories and everything remained exactly the same. <br>  The blackflies flying to the screen in NFS II, the coolest rain NFS 3, snow, fog, real shadows, I now have a picture from the distant past, at any time when I want and no one can ruin it, even me. <br>  Here you can see the gallery of screenshots made on this virtual machine with this vegger: <a href="http://cryforspeed.com/inspiration/">cryforspeed.com/inspiration</a> <br>  And here - a detailed and step by step guide, although I think it is not necessary, everything is so simple, <br>  these can only be obvious to some little things: <a href="http://cryforspeed.com/classic-need-for-speed/">cryforspeed.com/classic-need-for-speed</a> <br><br>  Since I did this, several months have passed.  It does not take a couple of weeks so that I do not run this virtual machine.  It is loaded faster than some applications on my iPhone, all games work perfectly, as if this is the 90-98th year and you are sitting at a computer with one of Voodoo.  Pure, unclouded pleasure. <br>  Thanks to everyone who has read this far, I want to hear your opinions, additions or corrections, maybe I missed something. <br>  I also want to hear the answer to the question - do you play old games and how often? <br><br>  If you just left looking for a solution to the end or read everything, but didn‚Äôt understand what to do - download the vmware player from their site (it‚Äôs free and can now create virtual machines itself), install XP, install nGlide wrapper, install your games and if necessary install they have compatibility profiles for XP (for 90% of problematic games, there are profiles for XP on the Internet, plus many on the nGlide manufacturers site), we play. <br>  In the worst case, all actions take half an hour, which cannot be compared with the time for getting the same NFS 4 to work on Win7 x64. <br>  If this and still something didn‚Äôt help, the last link just above is a very long and chewed up guide for each action. <br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> Today specially installed VirtualBox and XP, games only go in the weakest SoftwareMode, <br>  at VirtualBox itself, Direct3D support is claimed only experimentally.  When installing the 3dfx wrapper, no game works - a black screen with normal music, only a reboot saves.  It turns out my version is the only one working for games supporting 3dfx. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187580/</a></p>
