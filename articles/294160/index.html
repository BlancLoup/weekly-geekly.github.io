      <i>Different things are suitable for different people, but what turned out to be the best for me.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the university I studied international business with China, the training program assumed 5 months at China University, and then work at GE Capital - I liked China, but not GE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bb7/ad6/d30/bb7ad6d30e96a23a263bf91c5bd09a78.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I moved to London, where I worked on a startup promoting a mobile app, in which I was their only sales person.  The application allows you to order drinks at the bar without waiting in line.  I worked in the company for two months, making the most round number of sales, which can only be - 0. London's bars did not care about such an application or they simply did not want it.  No wonder the startup died a brave death. <br><br>  I planned my departure from there from the moment of my device to a startup and found a job at the TBG Digital social media agency, which I really liked.  It was a cool young company with lots of great people.  She suited me.  Almost a year later, we were absorbed by Sprinklr - a giant in the field of social media.  Many people decided to change jobs.  I was tormented by doubts. <br><br>  I have always been attracted to startups, but in London I had debts and never had time, so I just did not do what I would like.  So in January, I planned out my move back to my parents ... yes, class.  This is not at all what I wanted, but what had to be done.  And frankly, I was lucky that I had this opportunity. <br><br>  By this time, I: <br><br><ul><li>  I used Product Hunt almost daily to search for startups, voted for your favorites and shared them; </li><li>  I noticed the #Startup community on Slack and joined it at the very beginning; </li><li>  He began to contribute to the channels, shared his ideas with people. </li></ul><br>  Since I was not a ‚Äútechie,‚Äù I needed help to help build my own ideas so that I could continue to help the community with all my might. <br><br>  I met two guys and started working on the project ... one of them also gave me an invitation to write comments in the project :) <br><br>  February 2015 ... living in a father's house and working as a social networking specialist for a law firm.  I knew that in order to integrate into the world of start-ups, I needed to spend a lot of work-free time in start-up communities. <br><br>  That's why I am: <br><br><ol><li>  Received an invitation to join the <a href="https://www.makerhunt.co/">MakerHunt</a> - Slack chat for goal-oriented product developers from the Product Hunt community.  Actually, I was not a developer yet, but I managed to see through at the very beginning thanks to Eric Willis. </li><li>  Made there a lot of useful things for the community!  Eric wanted to keep a daily post from the Ask Me Anything (AMA) series, so I suggested that they write about it on Medium in an easy-to-read form - there were about 50 such posts, so I was busy with this project for almost two months.  But I was more than happy to do this, taking advantage of the valuable opportunity to learn from the creators and benefit the community. </li><li>  If we talk about the project of my two friends of guys, then I could not deal with them anymore.  They wanted to go to Product Hunt, I supported them, but stayed away (that product no longer exists). </li><li>  I continued to work at MakerHunt and met many people, one of whom was Bram. </li><li>  I saw a Bram project called <a href="http://startupstash.com/">StartupStash</a> , and I had an idea to do something similar for marketing resources and tools - not glamorous, but useful. </li><li>  I asked MakerHunt if anyone could help me create a website ... <a href="https://twitter.com/mubashariqbal">Mubashar</a> aka Mubs (one of the most active participants and a startup maniac) kindly offered his help. </li><li>  He built and supervised the <a href="http://marketingstack.io/">Marketing Stack</a> with Mubs, was engaged in design tasks from Daniel (this is one of the guys from the previous project).  In the meantime, Eric Willis recommended me to Erik Torenberg to help manage the global Product Hunt community (I also helped with the Product Hunt Book Club and led AMA posts).  I became the most active member of this group and helped everyone I could!  I had no hidden intentions, I just did what I liked! </li><li>  I bought my own apartment and moved. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/marketing-stack">I launched the</a> Marketing Stack on Product Hunt on my 25th birthday, thanks to the help of all those with whom I previously had a chance to connect. </li><li>  He came out with his project in first place in popularity, gaining more than 1,500 votes. </li><li>  I talked with Eric Torenberg from the Product Hunt team, and he asked if I was interested in the position of the community manager at Product Hunt ... Damn, YES! </li><li>  I wrote to Ryan, the founder of Product Hunt, to arrange an interview (there wasn‚Äôt a ton of emoji, of course).  We had a telephone conversation, and I was very excited, but I still had to wait for an answer for a while (which worried me a lot). </li><li>  I received a notification on Twitter: "@rrhoover in your followers."  "Oh, damn!" - I thought: "And now he is going to correspond?" Yes, he wanted to chat again ... </li><li>  Call number 2 - he offered me a job :) </li><li>  I have been working in Product Hunt for several weeks now. </li><li>  Hooray! </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294160/</a></p>
