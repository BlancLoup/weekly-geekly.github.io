Welcome to the plateau - through it pass everyone who studies the language long enough.  Today we will talk about how to pull out your boat from this shoal. <br><br>  How to understand that you were on a plateau?  Very simple: there is a feeling that there is no longer any change, new knowledge and growth, although you are still doing it regularly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why is this happening? </h3><br>  The effect of the plateau overtakes us when a certain amount of knowledge accumulates enough to communicate.  And the brain protests: why learn the new, if you can do the old?  Why fight with Perfect, if it is possible to build a dialogue using only Simple?  What is the point of remembering excellent, admirable and superb, if you can simply say good and calm down on it?

      In addition, over time, the accumulation of knowledge is slower.  And if after a few months of study you were amazed by the fact that you are now able to express yourself in English, then mastering the next phrasal verb at the Intermediate level does not cause such delight. <br><br><h3>  How to deal with the plateau? </h3><br>  The plateau accompanies almost every transition to a new level, and the higher the level, the more difficult it is to overcome the plateau.  But it is possible to break out of its limits, which is what we do at Skyeng.  Here are our methods: <br><br>  <b>Talk about it.</b>  It is desirable with someone who can help - that is, with the teacher.  No need to pretend that there are no difficulties.  Acknowledging a problem is half the solution.  By the way, the plateau is not only your misfortune, almost everyone goes through it. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf it were not for my teacher Irina, I would have left everything for a long time.</i>  <i>When I started losing my motivation, stupid with my homework, she helped find the cause, did not judge me, and showed amazing patience in helping to overcome this stage ‚Äù</i> (Sergey, student Skyeng) <br><br>  <b>Soberly assess yourself.</b>  Do not rush to brand themselves and recognize those incapable of tongues.  In order to achieve truly significant results, it takes at least a year of regular classes and independent work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4g/ua/q2/4guaq2sblttkgwa4pvceemshjog.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Change the format of study.</b>  If you previously studied with a Russian-speaking teacher, go to lessons with a native speaker.  Read many articles and blogs in English - switch to movies.  Keep learning, but change the method. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn addition to the main program, my teacher constantly selects something new and interesting - an article in my specialty, a video, a new film.</i>  <i>And all this then becomes a topic for discussion in class ‚Äù</i> (Elena, student of Skyeng) <br><br>  <b>Do not require too much.</b>  Yes, low self requirements are the key to success.  Be realistic - no matter how hard you try, you cannot reach the new level in a couple of weeks - Intermediate and Upper-Intermediate separate months of study and practice.  If you adjust yourself too much and overstate the bar, you will not overcome the plateau more quickly - you will only become firmly convinced that you have ‚Äúno ability‚Äù.  Paradoxically, the promotion of small steps in this case is much more effective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/jb/qi/myjbqibz1u2rmogvchzb3fiex4q.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf you promise yourself to read a whole book in English in two evenings, you are more likely to fail this mission and label yourself a loser.</i>  <i>But if the plan has only five lines, and you read ten, you will feel like a hard worker and a winner</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  (Artem, Skyeng teacher) <br><br>  <b>Reconsider motivation.</b>  It could have changed - maybe you started to learn the language simply for company or to watch TV shows without translation, and now you need to find a new, truly important goal.  This is also worth talking to your teacher. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI work at Microsoft and initially wanted to tighten up English to correspond with foreign colleagues and partners.</i>  <i>But now I am beginning to think that I am fully capable of passing the international exam and in the future move to live in another country ‚Äù</i> (Anastasia, student of Skyeng) <br><br>  <b>To play</b>  Any fascinating game in English, from the "Mafia" to the "Crocodile" - a great way to relieve the tension that often accompanies the plateau, and finally reach a new level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/kb/dz/ugkbdz45capjldwjf7vvs1tc5ui.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhen I was still learning English, the game Who am I helped me a lot.</i>  <i>or, as we call it, ‚ÄúGuess who I am‚Äù - the player thinks of some celebrity, and the other participants ask leading questions and try to guess who was conceived.</i>  <i>We played in English, and I wanted so much to be the first to guess that all the awkwardness took off like a hand - the excitement of the game helped me to stop perceiving English as an enemy who needs to be defeated at all costs ‚Äù</i> (Anastasia, Skyeng teacher) <br><br> <a href="http://skyeng.ru/go/habra5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/pi/zy/2tpizy6q3xxnk6qyeh8rdd_eyiq.png"></a> <br><br>  <i>Does the plateau still seem insurmountable?</i>  <i>Come to Skyeng Online School, <a href="http://skyeng.ru/go/habra5">sign up</a> for a free introductory lesson and make sure you can do more.</i>  <i>Do not forget to use the <b>promo code HABRA</b> : it is possible to get <b>2 lessons as a gift</b> for new students when you first pay.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/359024/</a></p>
