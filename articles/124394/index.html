It would seem - order a website, and the problem is solved: potential customers find the company's website through a search engine, get acquainted with services and products and buy them. <br><br>  But often things are different.  The site is running, but customers are not added.  At the same time, competitors are doing their best.  The customer blames the developers of the site, appeals to the new developers, the site is being redesigned, but history repeats.  What is the mistake?  Let's see. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Errors and errors of customers in the development of a corporate website </h4><br><h5>  Errors at the site design stage </h5><br>  <b>1. Website development can be entrusted to your system administrator.</b> <br>  Whatever your system administrator is capable of a frame, as a rule, the result of this undertaking is disastrous.  A professional website can only be done by a team consisting of specialists from different subject areas - a marketer, analyst, designer, designer, layout designer, programmer, copywriter, promotion specialist.  Can your system administrator replace these specialists?

      <b>2. I do not want to fill out your multipage questionnaires and questionnaires!</b>  <b>I can tell you the name of my company, its type of activity, give a business card with a logo.</b>  <b>I need a "just a beautiful site", what is there to understand?</b> <br>  Unfortunately, a business card, or even a corporate booklet is not enough to develop a professional website.  Website development involves not only graphic design, but also designing the structure of sections, navigation, presenting your products and services in the most understandable and attractive way.  Therefore, it will be better for everyone if you answer all the questions of the studio set out in the questionnaire, and you will consciously approach these answers.  Otherwise, the studio will not have the source material in order to create a site that will be useful to you and your clients. <br><br>  <b>3. You can create a quality website in a short time and almost for free - there are many such offers on the net!</b> <br>  Indeed, your site may appear quickly and for little money, but most likely it will be of poor quality.  Website development is the work of several specialists who have more than one year of experience and a huge store of knowledge of all the subtleties of this very specific work.  To evaluate the work of each of them in a couple of thousand rubles is absurd.  Think about who these people are who offered you to create a website for such a sum.  Remember, the miser pays twice! <br><br>  <b>4. The cost of maintaining the site is disproportionately less than its creation.</b> <br>  If by site support we mean stable periodic content of the site, including searching, preparing new information, and conducting campaigns to promote the site, then the cost of support may be significantly higher than the development.  Ask in advance how much the site support will cost you. <br><br><h5>  Errors in the design of the site </h5><br>  <b>5. The most important thing on the site is great design!</b> <br>  In fact, the design of the site is only important to its owner, but it is much more important for visitors to quickly find the right product or service and contacts of your office.  High-quality design is needed only on promotional sites, where the emphasis is on presentation and ‚Äúwow effect‚Äù. <br>  Put yourself in the client's place, will you pay attention to the site design, if you need to quickly find a contractor company among the dozen offers?  The client is likely to choose the company whose website will open in a matter of seconds and at a glance it will be clear what products and services the company offers. <br><br>  <b>6. Draw me 3 design options, and I will choose one!</b> <br>  To draw a design, it takes considerable time designers, which must be paid.  Free drawing a few options are usually only agreed by non-professionals.  But this does not mean that they will do their work badly.  Any web studio has a portfolio by which you can immediately evaluate its level and decide whether to work with this studio or not.  Professionals usually create one design option, preceded by the development and approval of the design concept of the future site.  This approach eliminates the need to perform several design options. <br><br>  <b>7. I will sit with your designer and together we will do what I want.</b> <br>  The fallacy is that the customer is always sure that he is the best designer.  The customer is able to change the initial design beyond recognition, turning the main page of the site into a flashing Christmas tree.  Therefore, to ensure that the site does not become hostage to the customer‚Äôs fantasies and to solve the business problems assigned to it, before drawing the design, you must first develop and approve the design concept and prototypes of the main pages.  In this case, the customer does not have to sit with the designer. <br><br>  <b>8. Take as a basis our logo on our business card (letterhead, flyer, etc.) and design the site.</b> <br>  To create any graphic layout, you need images in high quality electronic form or in vector format.  If there are none, do not be surprised if you are asked to pay extra for digitizing raw materials. <br><br><h5>  Errors at the stage of content transfer </h5><br>  <b>9. We have no content for the site.</b>  <b>Think up the texts yourself, and we, if anything, will correct.</b> <br>  In order to create high-quality content for your site, you need to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour activities.  As a rule, the customer does not want to perform this part of the work, or he does not have time.  Believe me, if you do not clearly say ‚Äúwe are doing this and that‚Äù, then no one will do it for you. <br><br>  <b>10. Get content from this site.</b> <br>  Many customers believe that you can copy information from competitors' sites and place it word for word on your site.  Since the goods and services are the same, why reinvent the wheel?  The potential client will really be indifferent to the origin of the content, but the search server will understand that the content is stolen, and the site will not bring anything good.  With this approach, it is difficult to get on the first pages of search engines, so you will lose a significant portion of potential customers. <br><br>  <b>11. Website developers are required to know what the customer‚Äôs company is doing and should easily distinguish the photos of our latest model of the SDV-12 machine from the already outdated SDV-11A.</b> <br>  Unfortunately, this is not the case in order to prevent funny situations, the customer needs to spend time sorting and processing information. <br><br>  <b>12. We will easily fill our future website ourselves!</b> <br>  If we are talking about a large corporate website, then calculate how much time it may take to gather information, process images and place them.  Can you allocate an employee for such a long time? <br><br><h5>  Misconceptions regarding search engine promotion site </h5><br><br>  <b>13. After the launch of the site, he will immediately visit and generate income.</b> <br>  It is not always so.  To attract people to the site, you need to constantly monitor the relevance of information on the site, to hold events to attract people to the site, and this requires considerable effort and time. <br><br>  <b>14. The site is enough to fill with content once.</b> <br>  Search engines are designed so that sites with frequently updated information are given greater preference.  Information tends to lose its relevance.  Do not be surprised if the position of the site in search engines will decline.  Make the site interesting, periodically update the content, and new visitors will not keep you waiting. <br><br>  <b>15. The site can be promoted to the first page of the search engine for the month.</b> <br>  This misconception arose because of the motley advertisements that offer to bring the site to the top ten in a short time.  As a rule, a quick takeoff is dangerous by completely removing a site from a search engine.  Do not buy on advertising! <br><br>  <b>16. My site in the first place in the search engine.</b>  <b>You can break the contract for website promotion.</b> <br>  The site can not indefinitely take a leading position in the issuance of search engines.  Competitors are not asleep.  It is necessary to constantly carry out a complex of works on monitoring competitors' sites, to maintain your site in leading positions. <br><br>  <b>And now let's summarize</b> <br>  With the right approach, you can create a high-quality website with an optimal ratio of price, quality, time. <br><ul><li>  Analyze the current situation on the market, think about the prospects for the company in the coming years.  Think what tasks your future site should solve. </li><li>  Remember - a corporate website is made for your customers, not for yourself, your colleagues and friends.  You need to form a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho your customers are and what they want. </li><li>  At first glance, the site should be clear what products and services your company offers.  Believe me, in the century when every second is dear to people, few people will read a long text about the company, peer into the director's photo and read his welcome speech on the main page of the site. </li><li>  When preparing information for the site, please note that copying materials from other sites may adversely affect the further promotion of the site in search engines.  Write unique texts! </li><li>  After launching the site, do not try to color the headlines and text in all colors of the rainbow, make the text blinking and other nonsense - these are all signs of amateurism and reduce the level of trust in your site. </li><li>  When promoting the site, keep in mind that it should be smooth and gradual.  Do not use the services of pseudo-promoters who promise to promote the site in a few days to the first positions, otherwise it could turn into a complete collapse of your site. </li></ul><br><br>  I hope that my advice will help you properly plan your future site and make the right choice of contractor for the development of the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124394/</a></p>
