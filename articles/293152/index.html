Let's look at the most typical of them, so you can avoid them in your campaigns. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Too complex forms</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I do not know why sales managers believe that the more information they request in the form, the better, but this error is repeated almost everywhere.  The simple fact is that the more information you ask when filling out a form, the fewer people will fill it out.  This also applies to desktops, but is especially characteristic of mobile users.  For example, when subscribing to newsletters, request only a name and e-mail, or even just an e-mail, because you can always ask for more information later. <br><br>  <b>2. Not sure that links work on mobile devices.</b> <br><br>  When you send any link by e-mail, it is vital that you make sure that this link is readable on a mobile device, and that it works regardless of what mobile devices your audience is using.  Can the user easily follow the link and does the site work well on any mobile device?  Can the user use the navigation buttons on it?  Is the site adapted for mobile? <br><br>  <b>3. Lack of focus in actions</b> <br><br>  Do you know why you are sending these particular messages or preparing such content to your audience?  Do you know who your actions target?  You can use e-mail and web metrics to determine which devices your audience is using, to make sure that each user, using his device, can access the information and understands why he needs it. <br><br>  <b>4. Not understanding laws, rules and regulations.</b> <br><br>  Like other areas of activity, marketing is also governed by laws, rules and regulations.  Make sure that you know these laws so as not to violate them.  Consenting to a subscription and protecting information from unauthorized access is very important for most people and should be just as important for you, so do not share personal information about your customers and determine what the legal scope of your marketing activities is. <br><br>  <b>5. Filling the visible area with too much text.</b> <br><br>  Remember that the screen size of most mobile devices is about 8 cm. If this area is filled with text so that the user has to stretch and scroll the screen to read the content, most likely the user will be disappointed and quit reading.  There are ways to optimize your content, which allow you to automatically adjust the format of the type of device that your audience uses. <br><br>  <b>6. Not understanding the importance of creating permanent value for customers.</b> <br><br>  As important as creating value for your audience.  For example, when you create an application, if you do not want to accidentally lose a client, it is important to remind the user about the application, offering updates, renewals, etc.  for everyone who downloaded it.  The value of a long-term client cannot be exaggerated, they are diamonds, so take care of them until someone else does it for you. <br>  <b>7. Ignorance of the purpose before sending the advertising message.</b> <br><br>  Did I manage to mark it?  Each message must have a reason for existence.  Is it to get new news subscribers?  In order to increase sales?  What is the purpose of the message and how can you make sure that your audience understands the purpose of the message, and then the action that you want them to take? <br><br>  <b>8. Creating an application without a prior marketing plan</b> <br><br>  Apps are a great way to enter the mobile marketing arena;  however, creating an application is a whole separate business.  You need to not only come up with an application, but also need to make a marketing plan for its promotion, if you really want it to be successful.  The plan needs to be made before the application is developed. <br><br>  <b>9. Lack of clear calls to action</b> <br><br>  When you know the purpose of the advertising message, it is very important to create clear calls to action.  People do not read your thoughts, so make sure that the reaction you expect from them is clear to the audience.  For this, various Call To Action CTAs (CTAs) can be tested to see which ones interact better with your audience. <br><br>  <b>10. Attitude towards mobile as a separate independent unit.</b> <br><br>  While the mobile attracts a lot of attention, it should be in the arsenal of any marketer who wants to buy or sell online.  It is important to remember that mobile devices are simply tools with which you can access your content.  In many ways, like various web browsers, different mobile devices have different code requirements.  Fortunately, despite this, with the help of HTML5 and adaptive methods, you can make your websites work seamlessly on all devices. <br><br>  <b>11. Phone numbers</b> <br><br>  Mobile phones are great when you come across a website in which phone numbers are displayed correctly.  All you need to do while browsing such a website is to click on the phone number and your mobile phone will immediately call it.  Such a system is well integrated and easy to use, a person does not have to dial a phone number manually ... Make sure that your content, if it contains phone numbers, is encoded correctly and you can get such a convenient advantage. <br><br>  If you manage to avoid such mistakes in mobile marketing, you will become a winner in an online marketing race that is becoming more and more mobile-oriented. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293152/</a></p>
