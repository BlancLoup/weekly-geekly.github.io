  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smoking as a social factor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fact that smoking is evil is known to all for a long time, but nevertheless, many people continue to smoke.  There are many reasons: reluctance to give up, stress, etc. <br>  But let's look at smoking as a social factor, which helps (yes, it helps) to assimilate and expand our circle of friends.  A simple example, you come to a new place of work.  Because  I am an IT specialist, I will consider the situation in the IT field.  So it happened.  I'm a programmer.  I communicate with the customer very little, the project is one, but very large.  From these inputs it turns out that I get very little communication with my colleagues - everyone works a lot, almost all have family and children, so I don‚Äôt drink beer after work, or just talk after a hard day‚Äôs work my colleagues. <br>  So  it turns out that by names I know only those who sit next to me and with whom I constantly communicate on duty.  This is if considered a non-smoker. <br>  Now let's look at the smoking equivalent - a person goes out for a smoke several times during the working day.  And what do you say, but what you want - you do not want, or they will shoot a cigarette, they will ask for a lighter.  There you look and the conversation will start, meet and talk.  There may be common acquaintances and common topics or interests.  Yes, and I begin to greet people more often, and even strangers - people from other departments or offices.  It turns out that smoking employees are a kind of caste within the company, again in the smoking room you can talk to the boss on equal terms or discuss your professional problems, and no one will see this as a crime, no one will say that you are incompetent, and only try to help.  Those.  In the process of smoking, people become more tolerant of each other. <br>  There is a saying - everyone is equal in the bath, I think that in the smoking room too :) <br>  In general, I believe that smoking should be considered not only as something extremely negative.  But also as a social factor - as it were, inside-corporate team building of smokers. <br>  On this all, the main idea is voiced, if anyone has objections or additions - welcome in the comments. <br><br>  <b>Upd: I do not urge anyone to smoke, I just wanted to share my observation, probably the majority did not understand me ...</b> </div>
