  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you entrust corporate data to Internet applications?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The rapid changes that took place this year gave rise to many new and unusual things.  The sum of the long-existing technologies that have gained critical mass, universal attention and a new wave of financial injections have created a virtually new type of sites - ‚Äúmashups‚Äù, i.e.  Websites that integrate services and data from several sources ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)</a> into a whole and brought Internet applications to a new level. <br>  Not so long ago on Habr√© <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/2024/">flashed a good article</a> about the spread of Internet applications in corporations.  In particular, it was said that modern Internet applications are much more progressive than most corporate applications, and ‚Äúsecurity experts will also eventually understand that files in Google data centers may be more secure than in leaky corporate network. <br>  It remains to make believe the corporation.  In this case, control over the data and confidence in their security are decisive, and no progressiveness of new technologies will compensate for the uncertainty.  In the meantime, transferring mission critical applications to third-party companies seems premature. <br>  Of course, the most large-scale example of the use of Internet applications can be called &lt;a href = " <a href="http://www.asu.edu/news/stories/200610/20061010_asugmail.htm">www.asu.edu/news/stories/200610/20061010_asugmail.htm of the</a> <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">University of Arizona</a> at Google Apps.  At the same time, if you carefully read the information about this, then <em>student</em> accounts were transferred, moreover, the transition was only for those who wanted it - the old mail system continues to be maintained. <br>  However, I will return to the casually mentioned mesashes.  The trouble and at the same time the strength of such services lies in the fact that they are not very independent: free access to information and open mechanisms for its use are an integral part of the services of the new wave.  On the last site I took, photos, tags and comments were taken from Flickr, maps from Google Maps, RSS search results - and in general live.com.  And it is clear that problems with one of external sources will create problems for me too. <br>  There are many interesting services for which the failure of one of the source, or even a change in its mode of operation, would be fatal.  As practice has recently shown, these are problems of far from only small sites and services. <br>  At the beginning of the month, a small scandal broke out - one of the partners of JotSpot, a commercial wiki service, told in his blog about the numerous problems caused by the purchase of JotSpot by Google.  Then an anonymous blogger, hiding under the nickname Kevin, was forced to remove his message.  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/30/anti-jotspotgoogle-post-deleted-under-pressure/">TechCrunch was not slow to get interested in</a> this issue.  It soon became clear and who was this ‚Äúanonymous blogger‚Äù - Kevin Hague, co-founder of <a href="http://www.knowesys.com/">Knowesys</a> , the golden partner of JotSpot. <br>  TechCrunch wondered who could force him to delete his post, but let's look a little differently - there was a situation when quite unexpectedly the company on whose product you built your business sends to exist / is being sold / closes the direction / she is going crazy .  What to do? <br>  To make it even more interesting, on December 21, Google updated the Google Maps user agreement, putting many large sites using this Google service <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/%3Fp%3D429">in a rather delicate situation</a> . <br>  So, there are questions that concern almost all online services: no guarantees, no controls either, the code is overwhelmingly closed ... With traditional software, everything is much more predictable - if tomorrow the program maker suddenly ceases to exist, In any case, you will remain active software.  In the case of an Internet service, you can lose everything, including data, in most cases no one will give guarantees, and the amount of compensation will be incompatible with losses. <br>  What is particularly interesting, to think about this situation made Google, which should be the other way round, as much as possible concerned about enhancing the reputation of online applications. </div>
