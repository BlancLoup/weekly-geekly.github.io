Integration with the exchange requires significant resources from both the DSP platform and the exchange itself, so it is important to investigate the available functions and determine their value for your business before investing.  Below are a few things to keep in mind when you want to integrate with the mobile ad exchange. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Unique inventory.</b> <br>  Many exchanges, which offer a large amount, often engage in a simple resale of the inventory of other networks and exchanges, while having low convertible or low-quality inventory, which is only good at first glance.  The key to using a stock exchange is that quality is better than quantity.  Private exchanges are a good option for checking exchanges, they are designed for exclusive, first-class inventory and offer publishers considerable control over their CPM, allowing you to create whitelists of advertisers and DSP platforms, and providing quality control over the management of advertising. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Scale.</b> <br>  Once you have removed from the list of exchanges without a unique inventory, you still need to take into account the volume.  If the exchange cannot offer enough volume to achieve the client‚Äôs goals, integration will be a loss of time and resources.  Before you start working with the stock exchange, specify again the campaign objectives and the necessary resources to better target your search.  Then search the stock exchange, whose inventory is the most diverse, susceptible to more advertising formats, spread over different territories and topics. <br><br>  <b>Highly convertible formats.</b> <br>  Not all ad formats are created in the same way, and this is especially true for the mobile ecosystem.  Banners can offer a huge scale, but adversely affect the user experience and resist random clicks.  To achieve your campaign goals, look for exchanges that offer highly convertible formats such as full screen, video, and Rich Media in all forms.  Exchanges that offer format conversion in applications are especially prioritized.  Plus, choose a stock exchange that offers strong streaming metrics for installing an app, making a purchase, subscribing, downloading, and others that your company identifies as valuable. <br><br>  <b>The real software solution.</b> <br>  Programmatic is a hot topic in advertising technology. <br>  But while many exchanges are trying to capitalize on trends, claiming to offer software solutions, you have to be careful: some of these exchanges simply rebrand their usual solutions using HTML codes, presenting them as programmatics.  Look for exchanges that offer RTB integration, so you can easily make money on the scale of the purchase. <br><br>  <b>Support at the highest level.</b> <br>  A private exchange can be very easy to use, but a highly qualified support team is a completely different level when it comes to campaign optimization.  The help desk allows DSP platforms to get all the help they need to fix, optimize and process the bidding strategy. <br>  The best support team on the market will go further, providing you with a deep understanding of bidding, as well as the resulting inventory changes.  Remember, programmatic does not mean excluding the human element from work.  Nothing could be better than real live human support from qualified technicians.  A focused search for mobile ad exchanges helps eliminate errors and allows you to take advantage of the latest features available for optimization. <br><br>  Good luck in your conscious transition to powerful integration! <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294618/</a></p>
