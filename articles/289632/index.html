      <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14334/"><u>Now I am the owner of an online store (Part 2)</u></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  We have a small online store, we created a convenient and simple website, hired several managers who advise the customer on the product and place orders ... But we ran into the following problems: <br><br><ol><li>  For the normal operation of the online store, we don‚Äôt have enough of a bare site with a basket, in which the user will throw the goods and pay.  As a rule, this story does not work.  After the user has thrown the goods in the basket, it is necessary to consult, arrange delivery, etc.  Moreover, our potential customers call us to clarify all the necessary information on the product.  Previously, we solved this problem with a mobile phone with a SIM - card with the number 495. The client saw a city number on the site, and the call came to the mobile phone.  But we faced a problem when our employees began to run from table to table, transferring a mobile phone. </li><li>  We need to work on prestige and distinguish the company among competitors.  Low prices and fast delivery are certainly interesting, but nowadays this doesn‚Äôt surprise anyone, almost all of our competitors offer the same thing.  We also tried to solve the problem with SIM-kami with city numbers, for this we have placed several phones on the site.  It looked certainly not very good. </li><li>  All calls that come to us on the phone must go to the right department and the right employee.  At the same time, the client should not wait ‚Äúuntil the first released employee answers,‚Äù who is not yet the fact that he can advise on this issue and simply transfer the call to another employee.  It‚Äôs clear that we didn‚Äôt even think about any voice greeting, and the budget didn‚Äôt allow us to hire a secretary. </li><li>  We are a small online store and can not lose a customer if he called, after hours.  Therefore, it is vital for us to see statistics on all calls that were received during off-hours.  The personal account of the mobile operator worked one time, and the statistics could be downloaded only a few times a day, and it was not always possible to track everything that was missed on our phone, taking into account the pace of work. </li><li>  We want to monitor the quality of sales, for this we need to hear all the dialogues of the manager with the client </li></ol><br><br>  At the same time, we do not have a huge budget, and taking into account the crisis situation, every ruble in the account.  We need to solve all these problems quickly and with a minimum investment of money.  Therefore, we cannot spend on expensive PBXs or connect Call Center.  Moreover, we need to understand how effectively calls are processed, poor consultation or error will cost us lost money. <br><br>  We will try to solve all these problems with the help of a virtual PBX RingCloud. <br><br>  So, the first thing we need to do is <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/numbers.php">choose the number</a> that will be posted on the site, in business cards and advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aba/e59/45f/abae5945fab64fee8a8ab272973551eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The number should be simple and easy to remember.  The more attractive the number is, the easier it will be for the client to remember it when it is re-accessed.  You say that it does not matter, because the client can easily find our site.  But, unfortunately, it is not.  We all browse dozens of sites a day, on some of them we make purchases.  Recall the address of the desired site in a month is not always easy.  Yes, you can go in search and try your luck there.  But, we are not sure that the client will return to us, and not to the competitor.  If we can somehow be remembered, it should be used. <br><br>  The selected number is assigned to us and will remain both when moving and when expanding.  In other words, what happens when you use a regular city number: changed office - lost number.  We opened a new office - at the office your number and combining telephony in two offices will not be so easy. <br><br>  What we finally get: <br><ul><li>  Telephony savings (virtual numbers are cheaper than ‚Äúregular‚Äù) </li><li>  The room scales with our business. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>We chose a number, added it to the site, what next?</b> <br><br>  After that, you need to add employees to the system who will work with telephony.  A separate profile is created for each employee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/696/f2e/0c1/696f2e0c178f4fd5bfe43791e67685a4.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Fill out by analogy profiles for the following employees: <br><br><ul><li>  Director of the company </li><li>  Accountant </li><li>  Sales Manager 1 </li><li>  Sales Manager 2 </li><li>  Delivery service </li></ul><br><br>  We get: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ac/d46/a88/8acd46a887b14d7dbcb2616accd0ddbe.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not enough to bring employees into the system, since we want all calls to go to all phones at once, we need to unite the employees of one department into groups. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>In the next section, we will talk about how to combine employees into groups, how to set up call distribution in a group for the department you need, why you need voice greetings, and how to set up the simplest logic for distributing incoming calls.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14334/">Now I am the owner of an online store (Part 2)</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14416/">Now I am the owner of an online store (Part 3)</a> <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289632/</a></p>
