This is another achievement of one of the leading manufacturers in the computer industry, so the phone expects success if the price is reasonable, because there are no obvious drawbacks in it. <br><br>  So far I would like to talk about the capabilities of the phone, technological innovations in the third generation of Galaxy Note. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Screen </h4><br>  A phone with a screen of 5.7 ‚Äùis no longer just called a phone and a smartphone - this is something more and would be worth referring to a certain intermediate link between smartphones and tablets. <br><br>  In comparison with the previous generation of Galaxy Note, there is a tendency to increase the working diagonal of the screen.  It seems that the developers manage to squeeze the maximum out of the desired, based on maintaining the same height of 151.2 mm, whereas the width and thickness of the communicator have become slightly smaller (79.2 and 8.3 mm, respectively). <br><br>  The screen of the novelty is Full HD Super AMOLED with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which in practice means extremely high detail and no pentails (grain).  Galaxy Note 3 has an amazingly balanced display, displaying 16 million colors with a pixel density of 386 ppi.  This screen with very good viewing angles, contrast and color saturation.  The frame around the perimeter of the display is the minimum required size to satisfy the wishes of any person who wishes to pass the time in the game or watch a movie on such a phone. <br><br><h4>  Stuffing Note 3 and Performance </h4><br>  With the release of the latest achievements in ‚Äúsmartphone construction‚Äù like the Galaxy Note 3, it will not be surprising that portable mobile devices can outperform the currently produced low-cost laptops in their tactical performance.  This is certainly not an entirely correct comparison, since tasks that are supposed to be performed on desktop platforms are often different for mobile systems. <br><br>  In smartphones, the performance and responsiveness of the interface and the system as a whole is extremely important.  When OS developers regularly seek to improve their offspring, as well as modifying modules and components, the need for hardware resources increases.  Be sure - Samsung Galaxy Note 3 copes with its tasks. <br><br>  The device stuffing is based on Qualcomm Snapdragon 800. The phone will be supplied based on different processor versions: for the Western market, the launch of devices based on 4-core Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 for LTE networks, as well as modifications for other countries was planned 3G networks - on the Exynos 5 Octa 5420 platform with an 8-core processor with a frequency of 1.9 GHz.  Although in reality only four cores out of eight work with such frequency.  The remaining four cores have a clock speed of 1.3 GHz. <br><br>  The 8-core Mali-T628 chip, which is capable of working with the standards of DirectX 11, OpenVG 1.1, OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, OpenCL 1.1, and is one of the most productive chips, is responsible for processing graphics. <br><br>  The user will definitely be happy to see in his smartphone 3 GB of RAM - in fact it is a record to date among the new smartphones.  The power of the system provides a complete "bumpless" interface in the latest version of Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. <br><br>  In various versions will come with a version of 16/32 or 64 GB of internal memory to store their data.  And also there is the possibility of expanding memory through a microSDXC-card up to 64 GB. <br><br>  The phone traditionally has two cameras - the main 13 megapixels with autofocus, face and smile recognition, stabilization and LED flash, which allows you to take pictures in resolutions up to 4128 x 3096 pixels and shoot video at 60 frames / s in 1080p resolution, and there is also a front camera.  The second camera is designed for video calls, and its resolution of 2 megapixels is quite enough for this task. <br><br>  Samsung Galaxy Note 3 wireless technologies are GSM / GPRS / EDGE 850/900/1800/1900, HSPA + 850/900/1900/2100 communication standards, work in Wi-Fi a / ac / b / g / n networks (range 2 , 4 and 5 GHz), as well as Bluetooth 4.0 data transmission interfaces, infrared transmitter, NFC, A-GPS module with Glonass support. <br><br>  The owner may be pleased with the presence of additional sensors for temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure, a compass.  Do not forget about the battery with a capacity of 3200 mAh.  As you know, the battery life is a traditional problem area for mobile devices, so it is difficult to judge how much a full-time battery with such a powerful filling, a screen, and under what load will actually suffice.  In any case, the owner will always be able to purchase a spare battery. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  The rectangular shape of the phone with rounded edges is made of plastic, the screen is glass.  We were pleased with the back cover with imitation under the finish with a rough skin texture.  The entire perimeter of the protective cover for access to the battery pack seems to be a stitched thread.  This small innovation is undoubtedly a successful design and practical solution, as it will provide a more comfortable hold of the phone with one hand for a long time and reduce the likelihood of accidental slipping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bb6/039/5d3/bb60395d366bd8c49bed37c01ba55b12.jpg"><br><br>  As it was already noted, the Galaxy Note 3 became slightly smaller in comparison with the previous model, and, accordingly, slightly less (now 168 grams, against 183 in Note 2). <br><br>  At the bottom of the smartphone, as in the previous Note series, the S Pen stylus extends.  The pen is fastened quite well and is camouflaged on the case very well. <br><br>  Connector for connecting to a computer is implemented in the latest generation microUSB 3.0 format with USB host and MHL 2.0 support.  Although the interface is backward compatible with the old version, it is better to use the new model cable, which will ensure faster charging and data transfer. <br><br>  The presence of two high-quality microphones on the case will contribute at least to more realistic video recording, and can also be an advantage when working with a wired headset. <br><br>  The buttons on the side edges take their usual places for the Galaxy Note series, so you can control the volume or lock with one hand. <br><br><h4>  Soft innovations </h4><br>  The new Note 3 Samsung improved the functionality for the stylus, so that now appeared an interesting feature Air Command. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/76a/665/c17/76a665c17268f25f3b7427c0ae7f7924.jpg"><br><br>  It provides access to a pop-up menu with text recognition without touching the screen - just hold up the stylus.  Through this menu, you can quickly save an interesting part of the web content in the phone's memory.  An application that performs a number of such features and has become an improvement in everyday tasks (notepad / copier / search engine / window manager) is the Scrap Book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/55b/c67/bee/55bc67beece6c7e09852172caea8d012.jpg"><br><br>  The most interesting innovation is the ability to draw arbitrary squares and rectangles on the operating system platform.  The boxes are immediately recognized, and approximately the same menu window appears.  Inside this widget, you can open browser pages, individual applications, view videos.  In short, this is a useful multitasking, especially for those who like to chat, surf and watch their favorite TV series. <br><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br>  A 15 cm long smartphone is a really big gadget that will seem large to a number of consumers and not practical.  Not everyone wants to get used to such a thing (although if it is a gift, it‚Äôsa sin to refuse). <br><br>  The hardest thing is to guess how comfortable the phone will be in the female hand.  Ultimately, the screen diagonal is not a drawback, so thanks to the 5.7 ‚ÄùFull HD display, the Note 3 display is so interesting to the average consumer today. <br><br>  Perhaps it will be the most productive smartphone for the period September-October, and possibly until the end of the current 2013.  It has a lot of new software features, a high-quality 13 megapixel camera, which is certainly not the weak link in the chain of the standard list of consumer requirements for such gadgets. <br><br>  The indicators of the level of SAR-radiation, which in this Samsung model are rather low - 0.29-0.36 W / kg, can not but be pleased. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195444/</a></p>
