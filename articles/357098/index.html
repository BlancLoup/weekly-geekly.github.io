  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The data flowed car owners of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>The site in the base of car owners allows you to find the phone and the name of the owner of the car by number</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0b/6c1/1f0/e0b6c11f0b0d4f04b5dc7116cdb27c64.png"><br><br>  In Russia, there was a large-scale leakage of these car owners.  This information is operated by the autonum.info site, which allows to determine the name of the car owner and his phone number by car number, Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/05/20/641711-dannie-avtovladeltsev-utekli-internet">writes</a> .  According to the creators of the site, the information posted on the resource, will allow you to quickly phone with the owner of the car, which interferes with travel, or inform the car owner about the evacuation of his car.  Also on the site it is reported that the base is formed by users.  This is hardly the case, since the database of car owners is very large, and the site domain is registered just six weeks ago.

      Information continues to be added - in just one day, 5977 numbers were added to the site.  The total number of rooms in the database is not disclosed.  There are no contacts to contact the creators of the site (except for a contact in the Telegram).  In a random test, it turned out that the probability of determining the true names of car owners with their phone numbers is 70-80%.  The interrogated motorists, whose data could be determined using the service, assert that the information about them was downloaded by a third party, the car owners themselves did not leave any data about themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the Deputy Director General of InfoWatch, Rustem Hayretdinov, there can be no talk of any autocompletion of the resource with data.  Here you can talk about the use of traffic police base or another state organization.  In this case, the site uses not the latest version of the database. <br><br>  According to the managing partner of LETA Capital, Alexander Chachava, the site can be a set of tools for working with big data.  It may well be used to compile the traffic police database and information from open sources.  For example, this may be the data of car owners with Auto.ru, Avito.ru and other resources.  Compiling this is difficult, says Chachava, but you can. <br><br>  The site also has the opportunity to edit the data about the car owner, or delete such information.  This is probably done in order to avoid conflicts with users. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  For some readers, the site began to redirect to the Telegram bot, but for many (including the author of the news) the site opens without problems, everything works. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357098/</a></p>
