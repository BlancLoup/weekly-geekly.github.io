From the earliest days of virtual chess and solitaire, video games have been the playing field for the development of artificial intelligence (AI).  Each victory of the machine against a person helps to make the algorithms smarter and more efficient.  But to solve real-world problems, such as automating complex tasks, including driving and negotiating, these algorithms must be oriented in more complex environments than board games and learn teamwork.  Teaching AI to work and interact with other players in order to succeed was an insurmountable task - until now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0w/yp/z2/0wypz2z6f3iooiduurgr-mjz-qm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2019-05-ai-taught-video-game-beatinghumans.html">Read more.</a> <br><br>  <b>23.</b> Europe should prohibit AI for mass monitoring and evaluation of social credit, the advisory group believes.
