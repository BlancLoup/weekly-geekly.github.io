  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One large bank, access to all customer accounts with a passport copy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all reading and commenting. <br><br>  A very funny story happened to me: once I was offered a job change on Sochi, of course, it was about the Olympics, and, of course, I could not even think about refusal, and besides, the phrase was spinning in my head: in Sochi! ‚ÄùIn fact, it was very interesting what it is and how everything there now looks, by the way, the last time I went to Sochi was in 1993 in February for a sanatorium voucher.  He agreed - flew away. <br><br>  At the new place of work, I was given a salary card of one large bank - in principle there is no difference to which card to receive money for, the main thing is that it would be convenient to remove them - I thought and waited for the first salary.  After some time, I received a text message to the corporate mobile phone about account replenishment.  From this moment begins all the fun. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I had another card of the same bank - a personal card with miles from Aeroflot, with the help of which I managed to fly quite a lot ‚Äúfor free‚Äù, so it was decided to transfer the funds received from the salary card to a personal one in order to continue earning miles.  I went to the bank online, chose a debit card, chose an enrollment card, indicated the amount and pressed the transfer button, entered the received transaction confirmation password.  Batz: ‚ÄúThe indicated amount exceeds the daily limit set by the bank, you need to confirm these operations in the contact center of our bank by phone numbers ...‚Äù - well, the amount does indeed exceed the daily limit, to confirm - we confirm.  Call the contact center. <br>  [Operator CC]: Please indicate the debit card number. <br>  [Me]: Yes, of course, &lt;debit card number&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please specify your full name, surname, report <br>  - Yes, of course, &lt;FULL NAME&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please specify the code word. <br>  - Codeword?  I wonder what code word can be to the salary card just issued?  Surname?  &lt;call my last name&gt; <br>  - Yes, that's right, thank you.  Please specify your address by registration. <br>  - And this is why, but oh well &lt;call residence address by registration&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please specify the last 4 digits of the passport number. <br>  - &lt;I call the last 4 digits of the passport number&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please specify the date of birth. <br>  - &lt;name date of birth&gt; <br>  - Well, thank you, please specify the last 3 transactions performed on the specified debit card. <br>  - Ummm, I do not know, the card is new, I only know about the operation of enrollment in the amount of &lt;amount of enrollment from SMS&gt; <br>  - That's right, thank you, please confirm the transfer amount. <br>  - I confirm the transfer amount in the amount of &lt;amount of the transfer amount&gt; <br>  - Your translation is confirmed, do you have any other questions? <br>  - No thanks. <br>  - Thank you for contacting ... blah blah blah

      A rather interesting situation happened, the translation was made, thanks for that, but I was given a salary card, on which the code word is my last name.  Thanks to the accounting department that they didn‚Äôt bother me because of such petty trivialities as filling out a salary card application form, but all the same - did I have to sign at least in the application form?  Or not? <br><br>  A month later, the first trip, just in case, I‚Äôm calling to check that there are no bans on using a personal bank card in the country I need: <br>  - Please indicate the card number. <br>  - &lt;name card number&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please name the code word on the card. <br>  - &lt;call your old code word&gt; <br>  - Sorry, the code word is incorrect. <br>  - &lt;call my name&gt; <br>  - Thank you, please specify the passport number. <br>  ... further I call everything on the machine, clarify the restrictions on the use of the card, well, I end the conversation. <br><br>  The code word on my personal card has been changed, changed to my last name, I haven‚Äôt changed it 1000%, besides for its replacement it is required to write a statement, and I haven‚Äôt written statements to one large bank for 2 years already. <br><br>  It was decided to conduct a small study. <br>  The essence of the study: getting access to the account \ cards of a person of interest in one large bank. <br>  Tools: payroll project, corporate mobile phone, passport copy.  Please note that only a copy of the passport must be original, and everything else can be obtained by standard legal means. <br>  Victim: I myself. <br><br>  I was fictitiously arranged "somewhere in Siberia" to work for my brother's company with a payroll project in one large bank.  The accounting department issued me a salary card without my participation simply by scanning my passport, a different code word was indicated in the questionnaire, the connection of the mobile bank and the bank was online on the corporate mobile phone of the same Siberian company (everything was controlled by my brother). <br><br>  After 2 weeks, a text message came to the Siberian mobile phone with a notification about the issue of the card, the accounting department successfully took the card from the bank and handed it to the brother, a week later the salary was transferred to the card.  Then, access to the bank online was activated on the new card, where all my accounts and existing cards were successfully displayed - after all, the bank automatically identifies all your accounts with your new card using your full name and passport data and vice versa.  Through the same account, the operation was successfully carried out to transfer the amount from my personal card to my new Siberian salary card in an amount not exceeding the daily limit with SMS confirmation to a phone number tied to the Siberian salary card.  The finish.  I received a notification in the form of SMS on my personal phone about debiting funds from my personal card after debiting. <br><br>  Summary: in order to get access to the accounts \ cards in one large bank of the person you are interested in, you need to have a copy of his passport, then you need to open a legal entity, enter into an agreement with this large bank for a salary project and issue an additional card to the right person , about which he probably will not know anything until he sees a new card at the bank online or detects a change in the available funds on the card / account.  Probably not worth mentioning that this large bank considers customer complaints all in the same writing and for all the same couple of months, despite the fact that money can be withdrawn through an ATM or spent from the card within a couple of minutes after transfer from the card to map. <br><br>  Perhaps the only problem that may arise is if you want to confirm the amount of the transfer, i.e.  If you want to transfer more than the daily limit, or the daily limit is already selected, then you will also need to know the number of the debit card. <br><br>  This information was announced to employees of one large bank a <b>little less than a year ago</b> , to which I received a reply: ‚ÄúWrite an official request, the bank will consider your application within 2 months.‚Äù I tried to find out on what basis the code word was changed on my personal card - the answer is the same: ‚ÄúWrite the application, we will respond within 2 months.‚Äù <br><br>  It turned out that what happened was enough for me, so I am no longer a client of this bank, but on Friday I again heard from one of my new employees an oath to the same large bank about the changed code word on the personal card, i.e.  in principle, nothing has changed - the employee receives a salary card, the accounting department continues to issue salary card applications without the participation of employees, the bank continues to accept such statements and successfully process them. <br><br>  I understand perfectly well that what happened is wine and accounting, which automatically fills out applications for the issuance of payroll cards, but I don‚Äôt understand the bank that allows it. <br><br>  Yes, maybe you ask where to get a copy of your passport? <br>  Well, I will answer you - in any place where you could make a copy of your passport, an application for a loan, registration of mobile numbers, hotel accommodation and so on. <br><br>  PS If someone suddenly found out his bank in this post, then pay attention to the fact that it makes sense to revise the procedure for communicating with customers who do not mind pointing out errors in the bank‚Äôs work - do not force them to write statements, the easier it will be to get such information, the faster you will receive it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188328/</a></p>
