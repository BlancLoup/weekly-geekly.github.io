      If you do not take relatively narrow areas of application of designers, rehabilitation medicine, where the same ‚ÄúLego‚Äù cubes can be used as a means of stimulating the restoration of certain movements and even as a massage tool, then picking up the designer should be recognized as a type of pedagogical activity. <br><br>  Depending on the type and tasks, conditionally, we would divide the designers into ‚Äúcreative‚Äù and ‚Äúaccording to the model‚Äù.  Currently, the latter - much more.  The most popular ‚Äúcreative‚Äù designers now are, of course, ‚ÄúLego‚Äù and the old ‚ÄúMeccano‚Äù.  Their main positive difference is that children were given the opportunity to create objects on their own, without a standard, giving them opportunities that were dictated by their own imagination. <br><br>  However, this does not mean that the creation of "on the model" - is bad.  Most often, the strict subordination of any model looks very logical, taking into account one of the designer's assignments - familiarity with the world around.  After all, most of our lives, our children will live in a world that obeys strict rules and laws, first of all - physics, and not in a world where you can easily make hot cold. <br><br>  To the creation of "on the model" can be attributed, and some electronic designers.  The very same ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/jelektronnyj-konstruktor-mikronik.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3Dmikronik">Micronik</a> ‚Äù turns out to be not so simple on closer examination: first, it develops creative abilities, since the designer in a certain sense is ‚Äúmetaphorical‚Äù.  Secondly, motor skills and attentiveness, as well as the ability to clearly perform certain actions in certain sequences.  The case when you do not collect the designer, and the designer - you. <br><br>  Anyway, you need to select at least two important tasks of the designer in the process of child development: <br><br><ul><li>  Psychological and emotional development </li><li>  Motor development </li></ul><br>  Speaking about the first ‚Äúgroup‚Äù of tasks, it is worth saying that the children's designer is the development of memory, attention, logic, and feelings of symmetry.  In the second paragraph, mention should be made of the ability to work with relatively small details, the development of ideas about the shape of objects and some others. <br><br>  It turns out that finding a ‚Äúharmful‚Äù or ‚Äúuseless‚Äù constructor is rather difficult from a didactic point of view.  However, there are also such models where the entertainment component is in the base, and everything else is already added ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù.  This is the trend of recent years, which we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/265782/">once mentioned</a> , which reached us thanks to the glorious Chinese developers. <br><br>  They are known to you as ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/solar-motion.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3D6">6 in 1</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/robot-na-solnechnyh-batarejah-3-v-1.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3D3">3 in 1</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/konstruktor-robot-14-v-1.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3D14">14 in 1</a> ‚Äù and other quantitative modifications robots.  They should be attributed to the models created "on the model", which is partially offset by the universality of parts and the number of possible models.  That is, they also work out their creative part. <br><br>  In this case, often created models require additional reflection, because they are something fantastic, non-existent.  As a rule, such models have some kind of mechanical component in their composition to bring a simple structure into motion. <br><br>  And one of the most uncomplicated models, as close as possible to real life, is the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/pingvin.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3Dpingvin">Penguin</a> solar-powered designer. <br><br>  <b>What's inside</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/067/162/ade0671624b947c18c4048e39de3dd17.JPG"><br><br>  Inside the box are several plates with plastic elements, two packages of electronic and mechanical components, as well as instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60c/23a/522/60c23a522cd44b01b8d7b63724c4db54.JPG"><br><br>  The instruction is graphic, with small textual comments, probably designed for the fact that some children still cannot read, but can assemble the same on their own.  All elements are numbered: they can not be confused. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/f99/eb8/4c7f99eb84564bfea786600b977ae139.JPG"><br><br>  Actually, the ‚Äúengine‚Äù of a toy is quite simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/fa0/97f/eb1fa097ff534e458becefdffe3dd0ec.JPG"><br><br>  It is proposed to start the assembly.  It consists of several parts: a motor and gears fit inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/784/e50/7aa784e50357485da18cb313cfaffae2.JPG"><br><br>  From above, all this is closed with a lid, the sides of the penguin legs are installed, and the contacts will remain out for the time being: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e09/541/561/e09541561c284f04b351efc7ed9288d5.JPG"><br><br>  The most fascinating part is assembling a bird.  She's really pretty sweet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/a07/ffc/89ea07ffc0d9471abffc623fb3062152.JPG"><br><br>  For convenience, black and white elements are spread on different plates.  The design of the animal is going pretty quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14b/4bf/603/14b4bf6032dc4cbc8ec70025a261b760.JPG"><br><br>  A motor is inserted into the penguin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37a/4f1/7eb/37a4f17eb33343c084608abfcb10c839.JPG"><br><br>  Then wings are hung, which he will wave with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/e3e/68b/98ee3e68ba574a06b10f8b5abd8dcc45.JPG"><br><br>  The constructor consists of two parts: a penguin and a needle.  The house is going after everything, and a solar cell will be installed in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11e/742/32d/11e74232df6e48418a547c589512ad0f.JPG"><br><br>  You end up with something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/377/5d0/887/3775d08871724a26bb27d304fb90da64.JPG"><br><br>  And the assembled design will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c87/28e/aa3/c8728eaa3f3a42fc90cbb0e61549527c.JPG"><br><br><ul><li>  Main material: plastic </li><li>  Assembly time: about 45 minutes </li></ul><br>  Plastic parts are made very well, some fear still inspires soldering wiring and their thickness, so you should be careful and careful when assembling, so as not to add yourself extra work.  Cost everywhere, as always with China, is different.  We have such a penguin - <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/pingvin.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dkonstructor%26utm_campaign%3Dpingvin">499 rubles</a> . <br><br>  The needle is like a penguin docking station.  You can charge the toy so that it moves, either from sunlight or from a halogen lamp.  Charging sets in motion a simple gear mechanism.  The time to charge the lamp is about 10 minutes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tk6GO1mfdp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a result, your penguin should move and flap its wings.  At the docking station during charging, he will also perform some actions: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/heJY1gTniP8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the process of walking, he rather amusingly rolls from his legs to his legs, imitating the walk of a real animal. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/StNGgA_1-70" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403445/</a></p>
