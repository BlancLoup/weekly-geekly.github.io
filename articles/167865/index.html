Many have already got used to the fact that I am writing about Curiosity, or, as a last resort, about some NASA achievement.  Today I will depart from the tradition, and talk about sore native - about the Russian research space.  No, I'm not talking about stealing and not flying anything.  On the contrary, something flies, even there is something to be proud of, although not as much as we would like.  I'm talking about damn stupid and often disastrous work of the public relations departments of our space science. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/beb/f44/571/bebf44571382d7a7a48206d0f73b16ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ( <i>Those who are not interested in the problems of the Russian cosmonautics, but want to see solar eclipses, can skip the text and immediately move to the end of the post</i> ). <br><br>  By the text of the post I pushed a chain of several events and random thoughts.  First came the eye of the announcement with the headline "Interesting results of the early scientific program of the observatory" Radio Astron "."  Hmm, probably worth reading.  If anyone does not know yet, RadioAstron, or Spectr-R, is the Russian space radio telescope.  It flies along an elongated elliptical orbit and at the far point of flight is almost at the distance of the moon.  Together with the terrestrial radio observatory, it can work as one giant dish from Earth to the Moon. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/666/dc3/e83/666dc3e83fc6d65bed8b8a24c7f57d8e.jpg" alt="image">

      News on the site of the NGO.  Lavochkina read: <br><br>  <i>The RadioAstron ground-to-space interferometer continues to explore uncharted territory ‚Äî to study the nuclei of active galaxies with ultrahigh angular resolution.</i>  <i>The interferometer successfully registered the nuclei of the BL Lizards galaxies, as well as objects in the constellations of Giraffe, Cancer, Hydra, etc. on bases from 6 to 11 Earth diameters in the ranges of 6 and 18 cm. For many of these objects, the brightness temperature estimates give about 10 trillion Kelvin (10 to 13 degrees), which exceeded the parameters expected by astronomers, it is extremely important to study the physics of radiation in the nuclei of galaxies.</i>  <i>Such discoveries may in the future force scientists to reconsider their ideas about the physics of the Universe.</i> <br><br>  ... Is everyone clear?  Interesting?  I - just from the fourth just started to understand what was going on.  No less exciting illustrations are attached to the news: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05c/fb6/066/05cfb60664d29e3ef0cfecb3c6ee606f.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e25/2e9/e7b/e252e9e7bd196302b4f64a0dfef2cffe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The color picture is completely irrelevant to the news and was already published in October.  Apparently, without it, the material looked very sad.  <a href="http://www.laspace.ru/rus/news.php">The whole news</a> . <br><br>  It is generally what?  Is this a report on the work of the phenomenal apparatus, which really has no analogues in the world?  Who did they write it for?  Do they even know that in a country, astronomy is in schools only as an elective?  And they tell about galactic nuclei on bases in 11 diameters of the Earth.  Well, at least something else is told.  At the same time, on the same NGO site.  Lavochkin on the page " <a href="http://www.laspace.ru/rus/sostoyanie.php">Current State</a> " the latest news about "Radioastron" - from March 11, 2011: "Already collected now we are experiencing."  Although he has been flying for a year and a half. <br><br>  Okay.  In the same tape there was another news: <b>‚ÄúElectro-L‚Äù 2 years of successful work in orbit</b> . <br>  This is really clear and good news.  For two years now, a Russian meteorological satellite has been hanging in geostationary orbit over the Eastern Hemisphere, which, in the best "Hollywood" traditions of NASA, has been making incredible photographs of the Earth along with science. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ef/35e/866/0ef35e8666f81fb234f82db7598c47c5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ( <i>In the original, the colors are less spectacular, but Photoshop works wonders. And the color does not seem to match, because the near infrared range is captured, and all the greens in orange look, and the deserts, on the contrary, are greenish</i> ).  Full size 120 megapixels on <a href="http://gigapan.com/gigapans/122634">GigaPan</a> .  Detailing: 1 km per pixel. <br><br>  The most funny and sad thing is that foreigners were the first to write about these photos.  That is, first the British and Americans <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2142884/Earth-Stunning-picture-Russian-weather-satellite-shows-definitive-image-planet.html">ofigel</a> from the photos of our satellite, our journalists <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2012/05/14/snimki-site.html">fucked</a> up because of the aliens of foreigners, and rushed to talk about "one <a href="http://science.compulenta.ru/679043/">single</a> 120 megapixel photo."  Then the enthusiasm subsided, and the satellite continued to hang in orbit, carefully taking a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù 120 megapixel photo ... every half hour.  What is most surprising, in the context of Russian space traditions, is online access to almost the entire archive of photos.  On the official website of the Scientific Center for the Operational Monitoring of the Earth (NTs OMZ), a gif is <a href="http://www.ntsomz.ru/electro">posted</a> daily with an animation of daily surveys.  And access to the <a href="http://www.ntsomz.ru/electro/source_images">FTP-server</a> for 2012-2013.  (Just don‚Äôt start downloading everything at once, otherwise we‚Äôll set it as a Habro effect).  Photos there are distributed in folders by year, month, day and hour.  Inside there are two archives: one with raw data, the second with large jpegs.  Outside the archives are the 800x800 preview in RGB and different spectral ranges. <br><br>  The quality of shooting is simply amazing: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb7/92c/a7d/fb792ca7d76b487ca8eecb67c9aef9ae.gif"><br><br>  At the same time, our media did not recall the device, which has been working properly for two years since publication in the Western press.  And the truth is that it‚Äôs boring to write about him: it works and works, let's better discuss the Phobos-Grunt utopian for the 100,500th time.  But scientists, for their part, did not provide journalists with any informational reasons, I think they don‚Äôt even know the term. <br><br>  Looking at how our institutes are preparing news for RadioAstron or even for Curiosity (in <a href="http://www.iki.rssi.ru/events/2012/DAN-2012-12-04.pdf">PDF</a> !), We can conclude that our space science has very distant ideas about what public relations is about, how modern media society lives, and how to attract attention.  I am afraid that the biggest problem they have is understanding why they should attract attention to themselves. <br><br>  The problem is not only in their too meager or too boring reports on what has been done, but also too loud and <a href="http://ria.ru/science/20130125/919757226.html">bold</a> promises of what they will do.  I would ban all five officials of the Russian space program from using turnovers in the future tense in my speech.  They have a problem since the days of GLONASS.  Since 2001, we were promised that in a year.  As a result, 10 years later, when he reached 100% power, he was remembered only thanks to Steve Jobs. <br><br>  True, recently Roskosmos began some kind of work, started a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tvroscosmos">YouTube channel</a> , wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/federalspace">Twitter</a> , even <a href="http://vk.com/fka_roskosmos">VKontakte</a> is there.  But in the Russian space science with PR - complete failure. <br><br>  Let's return to "Electro-L".  After reading the news about his biennium, I suddenly realized that our scholars bravely missed at least three reasons to remind themselves and their work to Russian, and to world society.  Solar eclipses are a free global show for the media, and our satellite has a unique opportunity to shoot the passage of the lunar shadow on the Earth from a distance of 36 thousand km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd2/486/c83/bd2486c83331547a008e5b7dd7eb6887.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2012, there were two solar eclipses that put foreign press on their ears: in May in Japan and in November in Australia.  And both of them - in sight "Electro-L".  True, the Australian failed to remove due to some kind of technical failure - all the frames in half a day are black.  But they managed to find another - partial, which almost no one saw, because  It was at the South Pole: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_25_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%258F_2011_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">November 25, 2011</a> .  And we can see.  True, not from the pole, but from space.  Look, the afternoon shadow across Antarctica runs through. <br><img src="http://cs6209.userapi.com/u14035574/docs/cf999d11162b/25_11_11.gif" alt="image"><br>  ( <i>Unfortunately, for 2011 there are no source images available, so you can only see the animation from the preview</i> ). <br><br>  But the ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù rare ring eclipse turned out in all its glory: <br><img src="http://allmars.net/images/stories/news2012/120521_0000_RGB1.gif" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://allmars.net/photo-hubble-and-others/item/220-eclipse">Size larger</a> <br><br>  And finally, the most important thing <s>for which it was worth sending a satellite at all</s> : a desktop with an eclipse. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d5/54a/1fe/9d554a1fe852507e43b3a9482c60ed32.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">3200x1920</a> <a href="">2560x1920</a> , <a href="">1920x1200</a> , <a href="">1920x1080</a> <br><br>  The satellite always hangs over one point of the Earth, so the angle of shooting does not change.  But the subject changes.  Typhoons, cyclones, dust and snowstorms, volcanic eruptions, forest fires - everything gets on his pictures, you just have to find it.  Now Electro-L has its own <a href="http://vk.com/electrol">Vkontakte page</a> , and I will try to write here how interesting materials will accumulate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167865/</a></p>
