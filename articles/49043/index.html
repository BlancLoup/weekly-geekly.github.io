  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone from MegaFon. Overview of the kit ‚ÄúReady for communication!‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© more or less detailed review did not find (maybe bad looking), just a <a href="http://hellt.habrahabr.ru/blog/46609/">mention</a> .  Therefore, I decided to post my notes on this topic. <br><h4>  Intro </h4><br>  MegaFon offered customers a bundle (and it calls for calling it anti-crisis) ‚ÄúReady for communication!‚Äù From a simple phone and a SIM card at a price of 999 rubles (in some places it is possible to snatch 899).  The price is rather symbolic ‚Äî a certain psychological threshold was overcome.  For the specified amount, the buyer receives a set of phone, charger and SIM cards with 4 tariff plans to choose from.  The device itself is manufactured by Huawei under the symbol <a href="http://www.huawei.com/mobileweb/en/products/view.do%3Fid%3D1680">T261L</a> . <br> <a href="" title="Box with set"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b74/015/31c/b7401531c673061dc55258febfbc9321.jpg" alt="  " title="Box with set"></a> <a href="" title="Inside the box"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8d/d9b/e6f/f8dd9be6fea3733b129f10d401eed5e9.jpg" alt=" " title="Inside the box"></a> <a href="" title="Manuals"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51e/b6d/353/51eb6d3531d52afe5bcee25065f2f2ee.jpg" alt="" title="Manuals"></a> <br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  The appearance of the phone is modest and unassuming, and this draws.  Rather thin and light, it fits in the palm of your hand and lies comfortably in your hand.  But the glossy plastic case not only collects prints, it is also quite slippery ‚Äî the phone can easily fly out of slightly sweaty hands.  But you can not worry about it in principle.  The body is strong enough ‚Äî there is no backlash, swaying and creaking.  I do not know about the reliability of the screen. <br> <a href="" title="View from above"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/631/7f7/413/6317f7413cd2530eadeced73a841a096.jpg" alt=" " title="View from above"></a> <a href="" title="Left view"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/928/7d2/959/9287d295994db59896ac279e23f48d20.jpg" alt=" " title="Left view"></a> <a href="" title="Back view"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c54/5f2/f1c/c545f2f1cb177afe6503f408d15212ab.jpg" alt=" " title="Back view"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Hardware </h4><br>  1.5 ‚ÄùCSTN display capable of displaying 65 thousand colors.  For a set of sms and numbers is quite suitable, and more of it is not required.  Speaking of typing, the keyboard is suitable only for sms writers hardened for years.  The keys are small and taut.  Not that you really need ***, but with intensive recruitment you get tired quickly.  The same goes for the joystick.  A set of SMS is not very convenient, and because of the T9, which is not sparkling with intelligence and inconvenient in terms of the arrangement of capital letters of the layouts. <br>  The sound is clear enough, the volume is good.  About the 16-voice polyphony modestly keep silent.  The quality of reception of the signal is not particularly checked.  The phone is charged via standard mini-USB, which is essentially a big cheat.  In today's electronic economy, there is surely such a cable in reserve.  The battery in the phone is very capacious 1050 mA / h.  Approximately the same capacity batteries are placed in the famous Philips Xenium phones, which are famous for their long-lived capacity.  The described phone also has a decent time from one charge ‚Äî up to 3 weeks in standby mode or about 5 hours of conversation.  Respect and respect to the manufacturer.  There is little memory in the phone ‚Äî you can store up to 50 SMS and no more than 100 contacts in the phone book.  There is no talk about downloading pictures and other content.  WAP / GPRS support is also not.  Interestingly, the Huawei website indicates the possibility of an optional installation of an FM receiver in the phone and the presence of hands-free support.  Neither one nor the other unfortunately.  It's a pity, because it raises the price only slightly, but the popularity would certainly have grown. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d8/c54/4b3/9d8c544b3b4e508829730d9766e6ca67.jpg" alt="backs.JPG" title="backs.JPG"></a> <br><h4>  Firmware </h4><br>  Now let's move on to the soft stuffing, which was created at the instigation and precise supervision of MegaFon specialists.  This fact is manifested in everything.  First of all, the device is locked for use exclusively with SIM cards of this opsoz.  Secondly, a few screensavers, wallpapers, themes are made in the style of the operator.  Even preset melodies are cuttings from MegaFon's commercials.  All standard options such as a calculator, alarm clock, calendar, notes, and other Labuda on the phone are presented.  From other applications there is a timer / stopwatch and ... a utility for calculating the normality of your weight !!!  Driving height + weight, and she says you are thin-fat or everything is fine.  To the dumb question, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this for?!‚Äù I did not find the answer.  Apparently, the company considered that this is a very urgent problem and one cannot do without such utilities in the modern civilized world.  There are two pieces of toys in the phone ‚Äî these are classic Pac-man (for some reason called Elf) and Snake (frankly miserable).  I am amused by the built-in reference to Pacmen / Elf: ‚ÄúAn elf must eat all the rice, be afraid of ghosts if he eats meat on the corner, becomes strong for a while and eats ghosts himself‚Äù.  Somehow it does not sound very familiar and spelled.  In other places the translation is normal, although not without minor flaws.  The phone interface is quite simple and pleasant. <br>  But there is one function that terribly pleased me.  When making a call, double-click the right key and it will be possible to send an SMS to the calling subscriber using a template like ‚ÄúFuck off, I'm busy!‚Äù.  Somehow, I did not come across such a feature in other phones. <br> <a href="" title="BMI utility"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40e/bfb/755/40ebfb755850cbbc069732979c83ae81.jpg" alt=" BMI" title="BMI utility"></a> <a href="" title="Menu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd2/8a1/f3e/bd28a1f3eb19419415f80511dcf10d08.jpg" alt="" title="Menu"></a> <a href="" title="Packman"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/959/195/a06/959195a06cec9e5dd54062a4a3a70591.jpg" alt="" title="Packman"></a> <br><h4>  Outro </h4><br>  Summing up we can say that the price of the kit is just great.  This is really a great deal from MegaFon.  The phone is suitable as a working / second / spare mobile phone.  It is suitable for hiking, traveling and just moving over long distances.  Alternatively, you can purchase his child to learn about the basics of mobile communication.  In principle, it is not a pity to lose a phone, and no one will steal it.  After some time, it will become clear whether the brainchild of MegaFon will achieve popularity or not.  After all, previous attempts by other operators of the big three in this field did not succeed. <br>  PS: I apologize for the quality of the photos. <br><br>  <a href="http://desterman.ru/blog/archives/307">Cross post</a> </div>
