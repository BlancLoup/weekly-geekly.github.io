    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This year the company celebrated 53 years on the market.  The Kyocera inscription does not loom at every corner, but we encounter the company's products more often than we imagine.  For example, the labels Yashica and Contax used to be popular, and now Qualcomm is well known.  You can see the general description in the Wiki, where there is little information, but it is enough for acquaintance.  The company's historical and main business is ceramics, which is directly reflected in the name: Kyocera - Kyoto Ceramics.  Hence the ability to work with silicon, and where silicon is digital technology.  The company's annual turnover is 3 billion dollars, and it is growing steadily, so that doubts about the scale and success of the enterprise are superfluous.  It is important to understand that Kyocera‚Äôs printing and photocopier business is the result of a merger with Mita Industrial in 2000 and, accordingly, the addition of technologies from two manufacturers. <br><br>  The market for devices for processing documents is saturated and it is difficult to compete on it, besides, sorry for the commonplace, there is definitely no ‚Äúbest‚Äù device in any field.  Someone more important speed, someone print resolution, someone is looking for a printer in the color of office furniture.  As for Kyocera, then, of course, all the main parameters - quality, speed, safety, etc., are performed at a very high level.  However, this is a necessary but not sufficient condition to differ from competitors in the best way.  There must be something else.  And this ‚Äúmore‚Äù is also present.  First, the company has one of the lowest in the Total Cost of Ownership (SALT) industry.  What better way to attract a buyer than the opportunity to get all the same as that of competitors, but cheaper?  And, nevertheless, even the champion WWS is not enough for victory, we need ‚Äúraisins‚Äù - all sorts of trivia-nuances that can swing the scales in favor of a particular manufacturer. <br><br>  Many trifles are indispensable for the industry, such as sound insulation over the entire sound range, and especially in the high-frequency region, coolers for internal electronics with a reduced noise level.  It does not affect the result of printing, but is it important?  Of course.  Some solutions are implemented at the technology level, for example, Kyocera devices do not need filters for ozone, since its selection is reduced to zero by the principle of operation: the photo drum is charged not with a corotron, but with a charging shaft, and with a positive charge.  There is no air gap, which means there is no ozone.  You must admit that it is difficult to sell a booming printer or a printer smelling all over the office, so I will not dwell on the mandatory decisions, but I‚Äôll tell you what I liked about the unusual: <br><br><ul><li>  The shift of the pressure roller relative to the heating about 20 degrees compared with the classical scheme and the addition of additional guides led to the fact that the stack of documents in the drive does not tend to become a roll - the sheets are straightened in advance.  Simple and elegant. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/01rolik.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  The color screen is used on devices, even from the lower price segments.  Of course, the thumbnails of the documents will also be shown in color, it is vivid and saves from confusion. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/02colorscreen.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Filing to scan documents of the same size is no longer necessary - you can easily put bales of disparate papers in the receiver.  The degree of effect of such an innovation in promotional materials is described as ‚Äúdramatically‚Äù, and I agree with the characteristics. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/multi_formats_scan.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  A USB host for a flash drive for scanned documents, or vice versa, for ready to print, will always be at hand, and not around the back wall, as sometimes happens. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/usb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Color calibration takes place between copies, in several stages, but the main thing is without loss of time and imperceptible to the user ... </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/caliber.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  In trays with paper, the handles have a normal shape, it is convenient to take them from both the top and the bottom.  Trifle?  But it is convenient! </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/handl.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  A cheap sticker in a tray with a schematic drawing of the paper feed direction and the print side eliminates puzzles in the style of ‚Äúhow to scan two passport turns on one sheet?‚Äù More than once, I was puzzled when meeting with some other printers, and, only from the second attempt.  (I‚Äôll note that lately, similar designations have appeared at all, so it may no longer be an advantage) </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/sticker.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Do you know why the whole area of ‚Äã‚Äãissuing printed documents for Kyocera devices has a dark color?  Because it usually emphasizes white documents, they are easier to select. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/white_paper1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  And the large models have a slot on top, so that even without bowing one could see what exactly is being printed at the moment. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/line.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Built-in browser.  It would seem ... But it may be useful. </li></ul><br><img src="http://lishnee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/browser.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About pleasant things all.  I would welcome comments and suggestions for the following reviews. <br><br>  Cherkesov Maxim. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151499/</a></p>
