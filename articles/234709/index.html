We think comments here will be superfluous. <br><br>  1. Nearly half of mobile games made in non-native languages ‚Äã‚Äãare created on Unity. <br>  2. MAU engine - 640 thousand developers. <br>  3. The number of installed games created on Unity3D has reached almost 9 billion! <br>  4. The company bought a startup Tsugi and renamed it to Unity Austin.  Based on the startup technology, it creates the Unity Cloud Build to automatically build projects from SVN, GIT and other repositories.  This functionality is very lacking.  Many teams made this toolkit on their own.  In addition, it will be possible to fumble builds.  Service is in beta. <br>  4. The beta version of Unity3D 4.6 has become available for download.  It has the following functionality: <br>  - A powerful and fast user interface design system that looks very much like the popular NGUI asset. <br>  - Many ready-made UI components out of the box (buttons, sliders, scrolling lists, etc.). <br>  - On the UI, you can apply effects and set separate sources of lighting. <br>  - Changed the system of 2D objects.  It has become more flexible and equally well allows you to use 2D sprites for any purpose.

Such an extension of the advertising functionality was mentioned in the spring of this year, but now the innovation becomes available to users and developers around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/efc/f0f/a96efcf0f15d40f48f5e78c837cd7d98.png"><br><br>  A detailed list of new products can be explored by <a href="http://marketingland.com/google-rolls-app-promotion-ads-search-youtube-96581">reference</a> , we will pay attention to the fact that Google continues to work actively on the basis of cross-promo for users who are migrating between mobile applications and mobile web - the corresponding functionality will appear in the issue in the near future.  From the current news, it is possible to note a deeper integration with the AdMob and AdWords advertising services for Android devices - it is quite expected that advertisements on iOS will have to be additionally configured. <br><br>  Other "chips" are correct work with applications that are already installed by the user, and the ability to customize an advertising campaign based on recommendations based on search queries not only in Google search, but also in Google Play. <br><br><br><h4>  Zhongji Metallurgical Holding buys the creators of Family Farm for $ 960 million </h4><br>  China is once again blowing up the minds of ordinary people with <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/08/19/funplus-sells-gaming-subsidiary-for-960-million/">news</a> from the local mobile industry.  Not only is the amount too high (for example, Zynga bought NaturalMotion for <s>only</s> $ 527 million).  So also the buyer was a company that has nothing to do with the game industry.  Zhongji Holding is engaged in metal trading, the sale of building materials and real estate. <br><br>  FunPlus Game agreed to sell its division of DianDian Interactive Technology along with such well-known projects as Family Farm, Family Farm Seaside, Happy Acres, Royal Story and another non-announced game.  Zhongji will also receive 120 employees who support these projects.  The deal will be closed in 2015, and FunPlus Game will advise Zhongji for the next 3 years. <br><br>  It is doubtful whether such investments will pay off Zhongji.  FunPlus's monthly revenue is about $ 6 million, and profits are $ 4 million. DianDian Interactive Technology division is about half of the company, and FunPlus still has Barn Voyage strategy, as well as about five upcoming games.  Guide FunPlus even decided not to conduct an initial public offering on the stock exchange right before the deal. <br><br><br><h4>  Gumi opens four new offices and turns into a new market giant </h4><br>  Japanese publisher and developer of mobile games Gumi, known for the games Brave Frontier and Puzzle Trooper, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/223928/Four_Western_studios_and_new_US_boss_for_Japanese_hitmaker_Gumi.php">announced</a> the opening of four new development studios.  Company offices will be located in Austin, Vancouver, Stockholm and Kiev.  This is despite the fact that the company is currently developing 30 new games! <br>  The company also plans to open an office in San Francisco, which will develop business and PR.  The head of the Gumi development department in the United States will be AJ Redmer, a former Xbox Studio manager. <br><br>  All this is done in order to finally gain a foothold in the Western market and in the future to become one of its leaders.  Let's see what happens. <br><br><br><h4>  Bandai Namco launches Pac-Man Friends us and Android </h4><br>  Good old hits continue to bring money.  A new shoot on the old Pac-Man tree from the Bandai Namco gaming unit - <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/08/22/bandai-namco-launches-pac-man-friends-on-ios-android/">Pac-Man Friends</a> on iOS and Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3de/93b/a35/3de93ba352a84519945b87a551d702f4.png"><br><br>  New friends Kolobok, who gave the name of the application, have special abilities - invisibility for ghosts, the ability to pass where others do not pass, and the like.  They are saved and join the player as they progress through the game.  All the Koloboks on the screen are controlled at the same time - shifting one, you move everyone else.  In fact, this is a modification of the old puzzle in the style of PacMan. <br><br>  Time will tell whether to wait for Pac-Man Run and Clash of Pac-Mans, and now the game can already be purchased at app stores, all available seven episodes with 95 mazes, for $ 4.99.  Wow, an unusual price from the Japanese, did someone make a mistake when choosing $ 14.99? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234709/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234709/</a></p>
