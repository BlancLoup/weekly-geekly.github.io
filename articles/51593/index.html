  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shooting an entertainment program - take 1 (start)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that I had a chance to cooperate in the field of various hardware and software with several TV channels about filming various entertainment programs.  Time was enough for a good understanding of the process and technology of shooting such projects.  As a matter of fact, about how, by whom, on what equipment and with the help of what software such transfers are made and there will be a series of articles.  This article will begin it - about how to start shooting entertainment TV show.  The second article will tell about the shooting process itself and the roles of the crew members.  The third is about the hardware and software used (I cannot start with it - without an understanding of the process, it will be absolutely unclear why this or that piece of hardware is needed at all). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Let there be a transmission!</b> <habracut><br>  So in the beginning there is always a word.  "Transfer to be!".  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTV shows comes to different people.  There are hundreds, thousands of ideas!  The winner is the one who has authority on the channel and will be able to convince the authorities.  Like, no way our channel without this transmission.  Ratings will be to heaven!  And a lot of advertising is provided!  I will not go into details about kickbacks, bribes and various political and career motives - just imagine.  Submitted?  Multiply by 10. That's the way it is.  Sooner or later, the soft body of the order "to remove the transfer of such and such" to go under the high signature and covered with a large heavy seal.  With this, transfer begins! <br>  Next - in phases. <br><br><h4>  Pre-paper phase </h4><br>  Uninteresting pre-paper-red tape phase.  The decision to start shooting, estimates, applications, plans, calculations, receipts, etc.  Well nafig.  Not interested.

    <h4>  Pre-preparatory phase </h4><br>  An interesting preliminary phase.  Here the following issues are resolved: <br>  <b>1) Studio.</b>  Do you think your favorite weekly program has its own permanent studio?  Nothing like this!  Such relic monsters can afford: ‚ÄúField of Miracles‚Äù, ‚ÄúKVN‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù(‚Äú Fort Boyard ‚Äù, yeah :)), maybe a couple more.  Everything else is removed in rental studios at the time of film studios, and sometimes in abandoned warehouses or workshops of old factories, among underdeveloped hangars and undeveloped machines.  The atmosphere is sometimes well, just utterly in the spirit of ‚ÄúS.............‚Äù or ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù  And against this background, something new is being filmed, sparkling with neon and white-toothed smiles.  What is no, and art.  Who would have thought? <br><br>  <b>2) Contractors.</b>  The entertainment TV show has nothing but video equipment, no money, and no film crew.  Nothing at all.  But you need to: make the scenery, find the crowd, make the studio light and sound, hang up plasma / LED panels, organize props, special effects, transportation, security, heating / cooling / ventilation, housing, food, etc.  All this is done by external firms (as a matter of fact, I belong to one of them).  And if you find a couple of beads or heels of healthy foreheads for protection - garbage in principle, then at the stages of choosing light, sound, screens, decorators, sometimes you have a hard time.  Well, just for fun, try to find in Google a company that will build your television studio?  Or which will rent you a screen meter 5x8 size?  And in your city?  And who will do it in a week?  And for acceptable money? <br><br>  <b>3) Scenario.</b>  Do you still think that people on television honestly fight, win, think, suffer, etc.?  It looks like this.  Moreover, the participants themselves sometimes think that everything is true and that they are solving something.  But it is not.  Win the one who should.  Rights will be the one who chooses the director.  The one who will be written in the script.  A person can always be pulled out or drowned, scared or reassured.  You can get to get off on the question "2x2 =?" Or suggestive hints to help give the correct answer to the second order diffur.  There is nothing accidental.  In extreme cases, everything is built correctly during the installation phase.  Up to the point that the winner is not the one who won the real shooting.  In intellectual games, the complexity of the questions is varied, in sports - the weight of projectiles, in talk shows - they give the right side more air time and so on.  Moreover, there is nothing accidental at all and nowhere at all!  You are watching a sentimental talk show, where they met 20 years of not seeing each other brother?  These are actors.  Are you watching a hidden camera that shows how ridiculously scared people are on the streets?  These are actors.  On the orange sofas are discussing a love pentagon?  These are actors.  There are no accidents.  An ordinary person will not play an ordinary person as a professional actor.  The programs with live real people also tried to shoot - but it‚Äôs crap.  That person will not look into the camera, then blows his nose at the most scrupulous moment, then he will blurt out something politically incorrect.  Moreover, he, a goat, cannot (and does not want to!) Portray a surprise at the fifth duplicate of the same scene!  He can not be forced to withdraw at 20 hours a day (he does not pay money).  And he says something indistinctly, lisps - he didn‚Äôt have lessons on stage speech.  That's why the actors.  That's why the script.  Here, Mikhalkov is recalled, who, to the question ‚Äúdid the sparrows hit the soldier in the scene on the parade ground, the soldiers jumping on their boots?‚Äù Answered: ‚ÄúOf course by chance!  How can it be different!  And the little sparrows ... and 12 of his doubles, and 3 days of filming this scene, and the trainer's fee in half the salary of the first actor ... all by chance ... " <br><br>  <b>4) Audio-video materials.</b>  Screensavers, beats, background music and graphics, several musical themes - ‚Äútense‚Äù, ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù, ‚Äúgreeting‚Äù, ‚Äúfarewell‚Äù, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù, ‚Äúloss‚Äù, etc.  Transfer logo.  Trailers  As a rule, such things are also hired contractors or announce a tender.  Often there are good, but unnecessary materials.  Already it is a pity.  A separate moment - if the transfer is taken on a franchise somewhere overseas.  Then all this comes in finished form (or as sources for localization). <br><br><h4>  Pre-assembly phase </h4><br>  <b>The task</b> is to make the contractors do everything in the studio to get started.  Dock with each other and with the film crew.  Test everything 2 times.  2-3 days before the official start of filming takes place ‚Äúobject surrender‚Äù - the presence and operability of all elements of the shooting process is checked.  Further, as a rule, there are swears, threats and quarrels - because nothing at this stage is still working \ buggy.  Then comes a terrible night, during which with the help of nails, snot, scotch, some kind of mother and incredible luck everything is brought to a hanging on a hair, but still a working condition.  The day before the shooting, the ‚Äúobject surrender‚Äù takes place again - this time almost always successful.  Here, by the way, you need to once again lower the reader from heaven to earth.  Television does not transmit smells and tactile sensations.  The main thing is how the picture looks.  Because the scenery is made, as a rule, from Vyaky g ... on.  Do you think this is iron?  Plastic!  Stainless steel?  Foil!  Tree?  Fiberboard!  Leather?  Substitute!  Big studio?  Mirrors and angle selection!  Everything is done as cheaply as possible, because every program has a terrible word - BUDGET!  To marry him is heresy and blasphemy.  Burned alive and eaten, not yet removed from the fire.  Invest - get bonuses, praise and the next project.  For the sake of budget, the walls are glued to the floor with a ‚Äúmoment‚Äù, the lamps are tied to the ceiling with adhesive tape and the holes on leather sofas are covered with black paint - and this is considered normal.  Holes will not be visible - people will be sitting on them, lamps are not in the frame either - only light, and the walls - well, they will not fall.  Probably.  If you're lucky‚Ä¶ <br><br>  As a matter of fact, this phase of the preliminary phases ends and the very mystery of the shooting begins.  Next article - in a few days. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51593/</a></p>
