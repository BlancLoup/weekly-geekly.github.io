  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO links: ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After launching the Minusinsk algorithm and updating the AGS filter of Yandex, which reduce the position of sites buying and selling links, only the lazy one wondered: ‚ÄúHow to distinguish a good link from a bad one?‚Äù.  Sergey Viryasov - Director of the Production Department of <a href="http://kokoc.com/">Kokoc.com</a> ( <a href="http://kokocgroup.ru/">Kokoc Group</a> ) <a href="http://kokocgroup.ru/">answers</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/038/67e/764/03867e7643e181d7239304921d0b1581.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yandex has long threatened to punish commercial links and studied their quality.  Today, the search engine has a complete picture of many donors (sites selling links), knows the content of the links, their number and the ratio to the total number of pages.  And if, for example, there is evidence that the donor has 100 pages, on each of which there are 3-4 links to third-party resources, the search engine believes that this site was created solely for selling links.  So, the links he sells are of poor quality. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thus, Yandex punishes websites only for the poor quality of links, in which they are sure.  However, the problem is that the history of sanctions extends to links that are just over three months old.  And if earlier, when the search engine simply did not take them into account when ranking, it was a waste of money, then today it threatens to lose the position of the site. <br><br>  <b>So, how to distinguish a good link from a bad one?</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Practically nothing.</b> <br><br>  Considering that in May the optimizers massively removed links, today in the reference exchanges you can see a site on which there is only one link.  Previously, it was possible to assume that this donor is new and safe. <br><br>  <b>But now the absence of many links is not an indicator.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Perhaps a couple of months ago there were more than one hundred of them on this site.  It‚Äôs impossible to figure out what happened to the donor before, and buying links on a large number of questionable sites threatens to fall under the Yandex filter, even if they bought one link from each of them.  In this regard, it is necessary to conduct a qualitative assessment of the links, to study each donor and all its pages. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www2009.org/proceedings/pdf/p1105.pdf">Madrid ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù report of 2009</a> can help in this situation.  Even then, representatives of the search engine talked about the signs of "bad" donors and links. <br><br>  Another possibility to determine the quality of the resource is to take a risk, add unknown links in WhiteList in the stock exchange, buy them and, after indexation, check if there is a growth in positions by keywords.  For the purity of the experiment, it is better to keep them on different pages.  If there is no growth, then, most likely, the link is of poor quality and must be moved to BlackList. <br><br>  By the way, some webmasters explain the lack of growth by the fact that the new link will work in a month.  But it is not. <br><br>  <b>Good links show the result immediately after indexing.</b> <br><br>  A practical example: in October 2015, we conducted an experiment, put a link from a donor who never participated in the exchanges and did not sell the links.  The site had thousands of pages, so the link was easy to follow.  As a result, after each indexation, we saw an increase in positions. <br><br>  After identifying low-quality links, you must remove them.  And here there may be a problem.  On some exchanges webmasters ask for money for it - about 20% of the cost.  For example, if a link is purchased for 10,000 rubles, you will have to pay 2,000 rubles to remove it.  Unfortunately, this is impossible to get around, and the actions of webmasters who demand money are understandable.  Previously, optimizers bought the so-called "eternal" links: for a one-time payment, they received links that have long influenced the growth of site positions.  In connection with the massive removal of links webmasters lose a significant portion of their income and are forced to earn something else. <br><br>  <b>How to get "good" links for which "Yandex" will not reduce the position of the site?</b> <br><br>  Ways of obtaining them depend on the format of promotion.  For example, SEO agencies solve a problem by ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù donors for each client.  As soon as the company starts cooperation with the agency, 5-10 quality sites are created for it, from which links are made. <br><br>  If we are talking about self-promotion, then there are the following basic methods. <br><br>  1. Go to the site where users discuss relevant topics, for example, forums or communities in social networks.  So, in the topic of fashion trends in the women's forum, you can put a link to an online clothing store.  Of course, it is likely that among these sites will be poor-quality donors.  But their number will be significantly lower than in the case of buying links through exchanges. <br><br>  2. You can develop your own third-party sites, as SEO agencies do, but for full-time optimizers this is a long and laborious process. <br><br>  3. Another possibility is to find sites from which links have never been made, download and check the web archive for the whole period of its existence.  This can be done using the free service <a href="http://archive.org/web/">WayBackMachine</a> : just insert the website address into the search <a href="http://archive.org/web/">box of the</a> resource that will show the results in the entire history.  If the quality of the donor is confirmed, you can contact the webmaster of this resource and ask to put a link.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that such ‚Äúclean‚Äù links will be expensive.  For example, if earlier it was possible to purchase at least 1000 links for 10,000 rubles, now the cost of one link from a quality resource can be tens of thousands of rubles. <br><br>  4. Finally, you can still use the services of reference exchanges.  Even now, if you correctly approach the search, you will be able to find high-quality donors.  For example, there are sites with a large number of pages in the index of search engines.  As a rule, exchanges cannot load all pages from similar sites, and take only the first three levels of nesting of documents.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account the criterion of the TIC (thematic citation index), which can be checked, for example, on the <a href="http://www.recipdonor.com/">RDS</a> website (paid service).  If the TIC indicator was at least once zero, then, most likely, the site fell under the sanctions of the search engine, which means that the links from it were of poor quality. <br><br>  The truth is, the question is how many good links are on the exchange and are there enough for a specific site?  But that's another story. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://oborot.ru/article/902/34">Oborot</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299986/</a></p>
