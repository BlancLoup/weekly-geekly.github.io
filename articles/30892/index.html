      Doc Sears said that the markets are conversations.  I think that communities are formed on three basic principles: <br><br>  1. Information <br>  2. Entertainment <br>  3. Commerce <br><br>  Take, for example, a community of horsemen, or a community of climbers, where the motivation for participants is at a deep human level. <br><br>  By creating a platform that meets the needs of such a community, built on these three principles, I can develop a fully sustainable business that is not geographically tied. <br><br>  Communities form around values, but not demographics. <br><br>  In addition, I believe that by combining user-generated content (UGC), peer production, intra-community trade and knowledge sharing, combined with services and specific entertainment for a particular community, it will grow and develop.  This is the case when advertising becomes content and content becomes advertising.  Advertising becomes conversation and conversation becomes advertising. <br><br>  At the same time, there is an opportunity to listen carefully to the community in order to constantly hone ways to serve it as best you can. <br><br>  There are various ways of flowing money. <br><br>  Of course, looking from the world of mass media, which is tied to a specific territory and is based on outdated models of distribution and business, this sounds like a heresy. <br><br>  <b>In your book, you describe the phenomenon of "multi-brand" (brand promiscuity).</b>  <b>What do you mean by multibrand?</b>  <b>What factors contribute to this phenomenon?</b>  <b>And what steps can companies take to make sure that they still occupy a place in the hearts of their most loyal customers?</b> <br><br>  No doubt - brands are growing and declining.  But brand managers want their brand to always be ahead of the rest for their customers, and that it doesn‚Äôt depend on the price list figures. <br><br>  However, thanks to the search capabilities, customers can thoroughly understand the products and services they are going to purchase.  There is ample evidence that people go online to make inquiries before purchasing. <br><br>  Customers are increasingly paying attention to how their interests are priorities for the company.  In fact, what is more important for the company is its personal interests or its clients. <br><br>  It cannot be said that some brands do not have tenacious fans, many have them and Apple is a great example of the extraordinary loyalty that Apple users are showing. <br><br>  But, nevertheless, we know that by resorting to the search we can find the best option for ourselves. <br><br>  Companies must put the customer in the first place in the value chain, and not at its end.  Disappointment will never be forgiveness.  Brands must understand that engaging in customer service is not a trifle in the pockets of tyrit. <br><br>  I recently flew to the US on the EOS business airline.  For me, it was clearly visible that their service from the beginning to the end was built around consumer experience.  I will recommend this airline to everyone. <br><br>  This experience means that for me EOS will always be ahead of the rest, and they are also cheaper than BA. <br><br>  Similarly, when a community responds viciously to what it considers to be negligent on the part of a brand, the brand must join this community. <br><br>  The most extreme example of multi-brand found in China.  Chinese shops were shocked by the crowds of customers who participated in the Tungou program or group shopping.  Buyers agree on the time of the raid on shops using the Internet.  They are purchased in purse and require discounts - and shop owners are often forced to agree!  Sites such as <a href="http://www.51tuangou.com/">www.51Tuangou.com</a> and <a href="http://www.teambuy.com.cn/">www.teambuy.com.cn</a> offer shoppers forums to help them plan the next goal. <br><br>  <b>Original:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/2007/01/an_interview_with_alan_moore_p_1.html">henryjenkins.org</a> <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30892/</a></p>
