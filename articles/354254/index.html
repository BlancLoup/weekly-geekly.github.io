At some point it is very easy to distribute people on successful and not, despite the fact that one can climb to the top and be invisible, and the second, being at the top, to prepare for a fall. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What would you do if you got a billion? </h2><br>  Unfortunately, the motivational charge after visiting a cinema or an incendiary performance quickly diminishes, and all because you really wanted to get close to the picture that appeared and even may have made any efforts, but when the incendiary effect passed, you were too lazy and switched to something habitual.

      In the course of life, we are faced with triggers that awaken hidden ambitions and immerse in thought.  And there are two ways out of this situation: to humble yourself, or to overcome laziness every day for many years in the hope of success.  And this is the only way to achieve something more. <br><br>  That is why motivational quotes on the desktop and desire boards are so popular.  We all need a daily reminder of the goal.  It is very simple to stop at a comfortable and decent level, and it is much more difficult to make a step forward. <br><br>  The youth of many successful people was not easy, so they did not need additional motivation.  We very often find ourselves trapped in the comfort with which we surrounded ourselves. <br><br><h2>  Where is success born? </h2><br>  Lists of habits of successful people are like design trends.  They are interesting to read (up to a certain point), but they have nothing to do with reality.  Stretching a font or choosing a purple color (or which one is in fashion now?), You won‚Äôt get better as a designer.  And, starting to get up at 4 am, you will not become successful. <br><br>  Finding superficial habits is an attempt to simplify an unpredictable world, in other words - to fool yourself.  Each of us will be lucky several times in our lives, the only question is how we use this. <br><br>  If we take finance, the order in the Forbes list depends not only on the qualities of the leaders, but also on the industry and the time in which this company develops.  A good artist will earn more than a good designer not because he is better as a person, but because people are willing to pay for music and movies, but for sites and applications there. <br><br>  If access to online resources cost money, perhaps everything would be different, and designers, like musicians, would earn millions of rubles a month.  But the world is different, and if you want to achieve something more, you need to daily overcome yourself, change your thinking and, perhaps, the world around you.  And the only unit in which you can make any changes is the current moment. <br><br>  Our life, which seems so big, consists of similar bits.  You can even say - the moments in which you overcome instincts, remember the goal and take a small step in its direction.  And so every day. <br><br><h2>  Everything has its time </h2><br>  At the beginning of the shooting of the film ‚ÄúCoach‚Äù, Danila Kozlovsky was faced with a lack of professionalism.  He did not know how to arrange the camera to start shooting sports scenes.  A little thought, he decided to just start shooting, not knowing how, on the flair and, a few months later, his first directorial work took place.  And what would have happened if at that moment he had given up everything, saying that he could not or did not know how? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/37/rc/ss/37rcssjddvvsy15vj0lkvdpifii.png"><br><br>  Everyone starts small and gradually sharpens their skills, overcoming doubts and skepticism of other people who are not able to repeat your attempts and prefer to lower others to their level with ridiculous comments. <br><br>  Someone else's success motivates, others - annoying.  Some do not want to move forward and will make fun of every other person‚Äôs attempt to do something extraordinary.  Oleg Tinkov was dissuaded from creating the world's first online bank, and what would have happened if he had listened to them? <br><br>  When I lived in a hostel and, for the sake of English classes, I started to get up at 5:30, they told me that I was insane.  But now I‚Äôve got two projects for an international company, 4 articles in English and a working trip to New York. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uu/xl/uj/uuxlujkh0s0zgx2ssgasfw1tges.jpeg"><br><br>  Big dreams always seem hard to achieve and require extraordinary actions, so do not wait for the approval of the majority.  Half an hour after work, which you devote to your own project, can change your life. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/350342/">Restart designer.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/350342/">How to say goodbye to the routine and reach a new level</a> <br><br>  Do not waste days worrying about the years.  Keep working and remember that any achievement is not born in one day, but is the result of daily efforts directed at one point. <br><br>  Show patience, faith, and something good will happen. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFor me, life is pretty simple.  There are things you can control and that don't. ‚Äù- Gary Vaynerchuk </blockquote>  And as Duane Johnson says: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAny success is a focus on a goal and an effort to achieve it.  And we can control both things. ‚Äù </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354254/</a></p>
