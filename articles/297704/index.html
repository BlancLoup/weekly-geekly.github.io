And the crisis only intensifies the trend steepness, our colleagues from Brand Analytcs notice, a system that is used to monitor the views of users from customer and marketing departments of Samsung and Rosa Khutor, Mail.ru and Avito. <br><br>  Is ‚Äúthis‚Äù necessary for your company and is it possible to save on customer support?  How not to disappear after Nokia, Borland and Motorolla, in time did not hear the discontent of users?  What are CMO trends voosche in the world?  For the answer, we decided to translate an interview with one of the industry leaders.  After all, each of us is a client and wants excellent service. <br><br>  Todd Merry is the marketing director at Delaware North, a giant company that most of you probably haven‚Äôt heard about, but you‚Äôve probably interacted with it.  How is this possible?  To begin with, let's present a couple of key facts - Delaware North is a private company, but with revenues of 2.6 billion dollars annually and more than 55 thousand employees worldwide. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Their employees work in such enterprises as TD Garden, MetLife Stadium and Yosemite, serving more than half a billion customers a year.  This is a large amount of experience of interaction with the buyer, although this interaction, as it turned out, is not entirely in their power.  To solve such a complex problem, you will undoubtedly need an understanding of the situation and a pragmatic approach, two key qualities necessary to win the Customer Experience competition from The CMO Club, which Todd achieved this year.  To learn how Todd and the guys from Delaware North achieved this goal, read below: <br><br>  <b>Congratulations on winning the Customer Experience Award!</b>  <b>Could you tell us what you did to improve the overall customer experience in 2015?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  We have a great number of clients in various places - MetLife Stadium, Yosemite National Park, New Orleans Airport, TD Garden are just a few of them, but there is one crucial way we have stopped to facilitate our interaction process - reviews, mostly created a proprietary program called ‚Äú <b>Total Listening</b> ‚Äù, which includes monitoring existing communities, as well as monitoring and analyzing social media.  It is through this program that we can find opportunities to improve our customer experience through interaction with customers. <br><br>  <b>How do you measure customer experience?</b>  <b>How do you understand that everything suits the client?</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  We have a large-scale program for measuring customer experience and satisfaction called ‚Äú <b>GuestPath</b> ‚Äù.  This program has four main roles: <br><br><ul><li>  Define and codify standards for all of our businesses in different parts of the world, </li><li>  Training of personnel interacting with clients on these standards </li><li>  Anonymous measurement of the results of these standards three times a year in each separate geographic area; </li><li>  And finally, the collection, analysis and delivery of information on customer experience through constant surveys. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Many studies say that only 1 out of 10 dissatisfied customers will share their complaints with the company.</b>  <b>How do you handle customer complaints and make sure that no systematic problems have been missed?</b> <br><br>  Again, we already have processes and programs that have been set up for the transfer of comments to the right place and following up on the fact of their processing.  But I agree that only a small portion of customers, even those who are dissatisfied, will receive feedback.  Therefore, we use social media monitoring and analysis to track complaints and negative comments, as well as methods to respond to them.  Most people, as a rule, write their complaints to social media, and using a multipurpose tool for monitoring them will be the best way to catch dissatisfied customers. <br><br>  <b>Do you fully control the customer experience, and if not, how do you mitigate this problem?</b> <br><br>  We do not have complete control over the customer experience, which, first of all, has two basic meanings: we should use the degree of control as efficiently as possible and, secondly, we should have excellent relationships with operators who are our last mile on the way to the consumer.  Fortunately, most of the operators understand the importance of such a thing as customer experience, especially in the modern world, where the opinion of each individual customer has a much greater reach and influence than before. <br><br>  <b>What other company in your opinion is well versed in the question and why do you think so?</b> <br><br>  JetBlue.  They not only almost instantly answer questions and complaints in social media, but also keep abreast of customer experience.  And as one of their clients, I know that they are trying very hard for this - they are interested in my opinion several times a year. <br><br>  <b>What important task would you like to handle in the upcoming 2016?</b> <br><br>  To achieve increased ROI and optimization of efforts to obtain information about the customer experience. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thedrewblog.com/index.php/2015/11/02/cmo-insights-todd-merry-on-customer-experience/">A source</a> <br><br>  PS What is not completed is the translation of the term ‚Äúcustomer experience‚Äù itself.  Is that a shout from the client "Lepot!" Maybe?  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297704/</a></p>
