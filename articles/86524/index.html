      <b>General acquaintance.</b> <br><br>  The camera comes complete with a belt case, battery, HDMI cable, mini-USB cable and charger.  The camera is charged via mini-USB, but there is a funny feature.  In case of loss of the charger, it will not be possible to replace it with any other.  I bought two different chargers in two different places, nominally they had 2000 mA and 5V output, but none of them could charge the dead battery of the camera.  From the company, it also does not charge, because  requires more amperage than standard USB output.  Only two months later I was able to remember where I put the original charging device, and only from it she fed properly. <br><br><img src="http://images20.fotki.com/v533/photos/9/99113/7094450/DSC_0064-vi.jpg"><br><br>  Buttons and holes on the camera at least.  On the round part there are buttons for photographing and shooting video, as well as a zoom lever.  Then there are three control buttons, the purpose of which is described in the manual, and a removable socket, behind which there are headphone connectors with a television output (there is a wire to connect to the TV through the ‚Äútulips‚Äù connectors), HDMI and miniUSB.  To get confused or not understand them is impossible, even a blonde will master it.  My wife and six-year-old son, for example, mastered: o) <br><br><img src="http://images9.fotki.com/v448/photos/9/99113/7094450/DSC_0065-vi.jpg"><br><br>  The side cover hides the battery.  Everything.  The camera has nothing else.  In fact, it is a handle with a lens and a folding display.  Moreover, it is very convenient that the camera turns on in just a matter of seconds - you just have to bend the side viewfinder display: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/URHhneQihQ8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg92OilVzAYWiEn4VLdp1OlF3t-jw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The entire start process takes about 8 seconds, after which you can start shooting.  By the way, both in the video and in the photo you can see that the camera is really convenient to carry in a belt case - it is always at hand and does not interfere with movements: <br><br><img src="http://images54.fotki.com/v242/photos/9/99113/7094450/DSC_0057-vi.jpg"><br><br>  Removes this miracle of technology on the SD card format.  For example, I use, through an adapter, my 8GB microSD, which was no longer needed in the phone.  It still amazes me that you can record almost 3 hours of video in HD quality on a piece of plastic, the size of a fingernail on your little finger: <br><br><img src="http://images114.fotki.com/v655/photos/9/99113/7094450/DSC_0073-vi.jpg"><br><br>  <b>How it shoots video.</b> <br><br>  An example of video shooting made by this camera can be viewed, for example, here: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/9933296&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxi7H5Tt56L5OsBtAiW0KE-dYUZg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Cottage: Laying the 5th crown" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When viewing, you can enable full screen mode, because  in 320x240 format, any video will seem high quality. <br><br>  In principle, there are many modes available - from 1080p to VGA.  I usually shoot at 720p - it‚Äôs almost not noticeable on a computer screen, I‚Äôm not going to mount HD movies, but it saves a lot of space on the card.  When shooting, troubles with image stabilization and autofocus are noticeable, but the first thing I attribute to is that the camera is very light and almost doesn‚Äôt feel its weight, and the second is that you can twitch and not distort the device so abruptly, allowing it to focus on the subject.  In general, I did not see both of these defects as critical. <br><br>  <b>How it takes pictures.</b> <br><br>  The camera has an optical network approximation of 5x and digital - 30x.  Due to the fact that in itself it looks quite unusual and does not pay attention to itself when shooting, she can take great photos from afar without fear of "burning", which I indulged in all last summer.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e67/a89/06b/e67a8906b85fcc864cb59e522988c83f.jpg"><br><br>  This photograph was taken from a distance of approximately 50 meters, from this place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a4/704/6f1/7a47046f111d570294314c3b582b16f8.jpg"><br><br>  That is, the degree of approximation there is such that it turns out about such frames to do without any tension.  Unless wait 5 seconds until the camera focuses: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af3/149/c26/af3149c26ccfd1b1d9a243fb613fa63d.jpg"><br><br>  and you can write down the numbers of this "Volzhan" and consider who it is inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92b/77c/73b/92b77c73b4b8f1fdf9166326093f8b56.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The disadvantages of the camera.</b> <br><br>  Of course they are.  For example, in order not to go far, on the last frame, noise is visible at the maximum approximation.  Also, I can list directly point by point: <br><ul><li>  the camera does not remember the settings and every time you turn it on you must select the mode again </li><li>  no way to shoot in low light (built-in LED does not save at all) </li><li>  It is inconvenient that you can only charge with a native charger and only from an outlet </li><li>  Stabilization and autofocusing are not important, and there is no manual option. </li><li>  not ‚Äúsnap‚Äù, non-ergonomic handle - I constantly have my little finger no longer on the camera, but in the air </li><li>  there is no cap on the lens, it is easy to get dirty with your fingers, for example </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://images114.fotki.com/v655/photos/9/99113/7094450/DSC_0071-vi.jpg"><br><br>  But, honestly, due to the fact that this camera was worth only 7,800 rubles at the time of my purchase, and now the price has already dropped to <a href="http://www.price.ru/bin/price/prodlist%3Fcurr%3D2%26base%3D1%26pnam%3Dcamileo%2520p-30%26cid%3D3711%26sugg%3D1%26vcid%3D0801030204%26where%3D00%26sort%3D1">five thousand rubles</a> , wearable, compact, removes beautifully during daylight hours, is easy to use and pleasant to use, I am ready to forgive her for all the above disadvantages. <br><br>  The final score: ‚Äúbe sure to buy, enjoy and enjoy.  strongly recommend ¬ª </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86524/</a></p>
