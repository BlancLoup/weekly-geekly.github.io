He also, like the first, will receive the literary name - Line-Storm from Robert Frost's poem.  About this Musk wrote in his twitter.  Now it became clear where the second complex will be used. </p><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551866729535721856="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Second boring machine almost ready.

The federal government owns about two thirds of the land, in the depths of which the Mask company will have to dig a tunnel.  As of Friday, it was unclear whether this permission had been granted.  (A representative from the Ministry of Transport told Arstechnica that this land belongs to the National Park Service, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment). </p><br><p>  The first 10 miles that were approved by the state of Maryland will be the starting point of an underground system that could contain the Hyperloop system.  Mask first spoke about the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãHyperloop, for transporting passengers in a low-pressure pipe inside magnetic levitation capsules - in 2013.  As director of several large companies, he decided that he did not have time to bring the idea to life, so he presented the project and challenged start-ups and students so that they could move in the direction of this concept. </p><br><p>  It seems that Ilon Mask changed his opinion that he should not build his own Hyperloop.  In July, Musk tweeted that he received "verbal government approval for The Boring Company to build an underground Hyperloop New York-Philadelphia-Baltimtor-DC."  Musk added that the infrastructure created will allow people to travel from New York to Washington County in 29 minutes. </p><br><p>  In the publication, Baltimore Sun noted that such a project would cost billions of dollars, adding: ‚ÄúThe state does not plan to contribute to a project of similar value.‚Äù </p><br><p>  The Maryland Department of Transportation has told the Baltimore Sun that The Boring Company has obtained permits similar to those that they normally receive to build underground infrastructure. </p><br><p>  According to the Washington Post, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said that he is proud to "support The Boring Company for the introduction of high-speed electric transport in Maryland - capable of connecting the cities of Baltimore and Washington County." </p><br><p>  Arstechnica turned to The Boring Company, but the spokesman declined to comment on anything other than the statement contained in the Maryland press release.  ‚ÄúThe Boring Company would like to thank the state of Maryland, Washington DC and the White House Office of American Innovation,‚Äù the company said.  The Washington Post noted that ‚ÄúIn March, President Trump appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the senior adviser to the organization who headed the office,‚Äù although it is still unclear what support the White House Office of American Innovation has provided. </p><br><p>  A month earlier, another company, Hyperloop One, announced 10 routes to be studied, created in partnership with the Colorado Department of Transportation </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/eb/99/59eb9970c5757833895363.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>One of the 10 possible routes Hyperloop One.</em> </p><br><p>  Source: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/elon-musks-boring-company-is-digging-a-10-mile-tunnel-in-maryland/">Arstechnica</a> </p></div>
