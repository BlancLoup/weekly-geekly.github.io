  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System of selling computer and video games with distributed cost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the light of the latest wave of discussion of possible systems for distributing electronic copies of books and films, I decided to try my hand and write a system for selling games, which in my opinion is different from those currently used.  And at the same time beneficial to publishers, developers and customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is possible that exactly such a sales system already exists, but I did not meet while studying materials.  Therefore, I ask, if anyone knows that "this has already happened," then show where. <br>  And here are my suggestions.  Very interesting is the opinion of gamers and simply interested people in the IT community. <br><br><h2>  The foundation </h2><br>  Implementation is possible when the service is similar to Steam.  Cost allocation occurs by country.  The publisher needs to calculate the approximate revenue for the selected period, for example, 3-6 months, taking into account the start of the company before the release of the game. <br>  The approximate calculation scheme is as follows: cost price + cheat + regional coefficient.  The resulting amount must be started to collect before the release of the game, at least for a month - two, or after the release of the demo.  In this case, the nominal value of one copy (key) must be calculated.  In order that in case of collecting an insufficient amount, the buyers who paid the face value still got their key.  In order to prevent a decline in sales after a fundraiser, it may make sense to set the price for a copy of the game at about 70% of the original. <br>  When the publisher calculates the amount needed for the distribution of keys, it begins to collect.  In this case, a minimum payment of the cost of one copy, for example, 30-50%, can be established in order to prevent micro payments and subsequently receive the key. <br>  The regional coefficient allows you to include in the price of the game additional costs, for example translation into another language, an additional sales method, if the majority of payment systems in the country do not work.  Although it is best to have sales statistics in each country in stock for calculating this ratio, it would be more accurate to calculate the coefficient and level losses from the distribution of pirated copies. <br>  The buyer should be able to make money for the game from one account as many times as necessary, but the minimum amount must be paid either immediately or during, for example, a week after the start of the fundraising company. <br>  If you start the fundraising one month before the game is released and at the same time release a demo version to maintain interest, provided that most people like the game, then collecting the required amount may take much less time and exceed it at times.  Given that the fundraising company is simultaneously launched in all countries, the publisher and developer can recoup a sufficient amount for an earlier release of the game, subject to active sales, and to attract additional forces and development. <br>  In order to encourage buyers to make payments higher than the minimum, the publisher can apply a bonus distribution system.  Perhaps this: <br>  1. Minimum payment - the buyer receives the key after collecting the full amount. <br>  2. Double minimum payment - getting the key after collecting the full amount and a 1-5% discount from the nominal payment for the next game. <br>  3. Nominal payment - the buyer receives the key, even if the amount is not collected before the end of the term. <br>  4. Nominal payment + n - getting the key, even if the amount is not collected before the end of the term and in addition the price reduction for all additions to the game, the next game of the series, etc.  by n / 2. <br><br>  At the same time, if before the end of the fund-raising company the required amount is not collected, all buyers who paid less than the nominal value can get the game by paying the balance if the nominal value is not increased.

    <h2>  Example </h2><br>  Suppose that the publisher wants to receive 66 million rubles for a month - two in a country with a regional coefficient of 1.1; the minimum payment is set, for example, to 200 rubles.  Then, the face value of the copy will be 660 rubles. <br>  Therefore it is necessary that 100 thousand buyers pay a nominal value.  Or, that 220 thousand buyers would pay 300 rubles. <br><br><h2>  The most difficult issues with this sales system </h2><br>  Honest calculation of the proceeds from the sale of the game for a certain period, or at least the calculation of the nominal value of a copy, as well as the sale of localized versions.  Although the problem of localization can be solved by a regional coefficient, taking into account the "depth of localization" interface / subtitles / translation. <br>  There is still the question of selling boxed and gift editions, but I think that they can simply not be included in the calculation of the sale of electronic copies, since their initial cost is higher due to the physical carrier and all sorts of bonuses in the box. <br><br><h2>  Estimated pros and cons of the system </h2><br><br>  + Ability to obtain an electronic copy for a relatively small amount. <br>  + If you pay the face value of the key to the game, the buyer will receive in any case, even if the required amount is not collected. <br>  + Ability to make multiple transfers, depending on their capabilities at a particular moment. <br>  + Publisher and developer will receive a certain amount before the release of the game. <br><br>  - The publisher may well bend the total amount and face value of the copy, so that the advantages of the system will be leveled.  BUT!  The system and is written with the expectation of the responsibility of publishers. <br>  - Some players may be dissatisfied with the fact that they paid 350 rubles, and some 200, and they will still receive copies, but everyone decides for himself how much he is willing to pay for this or that product, in this case. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><br>  As already written, the system is designed for sanity and understanding on both sides.  The publisher and the developer want to discourage the cost of the game, advertising, and get revenue, and the buyer wants to get the game for a reasonable fee.  At the same time, everyone should understand that by making concessions to each other, both sides will benefit. <br>  With a heated interest in the game and a fair calculation of amounts, a publisher and a developer can get a lot more money than if every buyer pays a nominal price, but at the same time they have to wait a while. <br>  The buyer will get what they want and even with the savings, but it will be a little longer to wait for the "goods". <br><br>  It is possible that in the proposed system there will be technical, economic, legal, moral gaps and if they are not eliminated, it will be useless.  But if I am sure that if this proposal finds a response on both sides of the "barricades", then its application will be beneficial to all. <br><br><h3>  UPD: </h3><br>  I think that it is worth making changes to the system so that players would not have to wait until the end of the collection of the entire amount. <br>  As a result, the buyer will see on the page with the game he likes the following options for payment: <br>  - Make a minimum payment (getting the key after collecting the full amount) <br>  - Make a nominal payment (getting the key on the day the game is released anyway) <br>  - Pay any amount (available only after making the minimum payment) <br>  - Pay in addition to the nominal value (available only after making the minimum payment to receive the game on the day of release) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199278/</a></p>
