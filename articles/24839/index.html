There are so many advertisements, and they use standard <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2007/12/19/6-sposobov-reklamirovat-chto-ugodno/">methods</a> in it, and the consumer looks at her half-eyed at best, and at worst, commercial breaks in time increase the load on sewers.  To attract buyers, advertisers use sexual motives or humor.  The latter also attracts attention well, but whether sales increase is a question.  Sometimes advertisers with might and main scoff not only at the product, but also directly at its consumer.  Recently, a letter was thrown into my inbox ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the envelope which was written in large letters "You spam!".  We all know perfectly well what it is, so most of the buyers will react to it correctly and immediately throw it in the trash.  But those who did not throw it away and opened the envelope will be greeted by the remarkable creative phrase ‚ÄúGet rid of this letter right now, otherwise you will learn that ...‚Äù A phrase for those who still doubted whether there is anything interesting in this letter.  Yes, the find can be said to be original, but do those who addressed it read the letter?

This letter stood out from the general stream of spam and involved not logic, but a feeling of curiosity, interest in the forbidden, because the forbidden fruit, as you know, is sweet.  But this example is from a series of low-budget jokes. <br><br>  An even more interesting example is the advertising campaign conducted at the end of 2007 to promote Lada Kalina.  It‚Äôs hard to say at whom advertisers were guided when they gave out in the creative ‚ÄúMade on the knee ...‚Äù and ‚ÄúMade on the peephole ...‚Äù.  The expectation was that the client would be interested in and read the advertising text further, which explains that everything is exactly the opposite, what German robots do and the machines should therefore be of high quality. <br><br>  But what comes out?  Here, the calculation of advertising is not for adolescents and children who perceive jokes, but for fathers of the family of 30-40 years old, who choose a car.  When they read the big headline "Kalina - collected on the knee," the subconscious immediately slips the cliche: "Of course, this is the WHA, and they have never been of high quality," because we know that the phrase "done on the knee" means something very poor quality, and no longer interesting to read.  What's the funny thing, I was driving a car when I first saw the billboard of this campaign.  I managed to read the first phrase in large letters, grinning drove on further, since I simply had no time to peer into the small print at the wheel. <br><br><img align="left" width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11d/3e1/ad4/11d3e1ad469d8bbfa447829b868d036f.jpg" alt="Lada Kalina (Kalina) is made by eye" height="300">  How many cars Kalina, only thanks to this advertising campaign AvtoVAZ did not sell - now it is impossible to calculate, but the joke clearly failed.  Not only did the advertisement not lead to additional interest in the purchase (it happens that the advertisement went out, but the sales volume did not change much, the money for advertising disappeared), but in my opinion, it was so unsuccessful that it had to swing the already weak sales of Kalina downward.  Now in my head, when I occasionally see Kalina on the road, the phrase immediately pops up, ‚ÄúOh, this is the same machine that is made by eye and on the knee.‚Äù <br><br>  PS Recently I learned that this advertisement and videos about Eldorado were made by the same advertising agency.  Successes to you, advertisers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24839/</a></p>
