  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Syncing madness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started this story a long time ago, with the purchase of a Palm Zire, when I realized that the phone book on a computer has the right to life and is very useful.  I also realized then that, despite the excellent hardware and open protocols like SyncML, each manufacturer would be obliged to write its own protocol and storage format for the book, contacts and calendar ... And the software that will be delivered with the device will be enchanting, awful and wry.  So it was with Palm Desktop, which did not understand normal mail and convert documents for 15 minutes.  This was the case with Active Sync, which is probably the best of all, but it has a number of unpleasant features, such as incorrect resolution of conflict entries.  About the cellular software, and I only had business models from Siemens, Motorola, Nokia, SonyE and Samsung, I won't say anything - it was very painful to use them.  4 years I wanted to coincide the note book and calendar on the cell, in Exchange and home computer.  Today I found a solution to 70% of the synchronization problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I have Outlook 2007, iCal + Address Book, Samsung x820 and iPod. <br><br>  The software for Samsung x820 (Samsung studio 3) has 2 major drawbacks: all the records are synchronized, not the selected groups and only 200 calendar events are synchronized, and the oldest ones.  I have not yet found solutions to the 1st problem, and as a result, the phone is filled with all sorts of not-often-needed contacts.  Solution of the 2nd problem - auto-archiving of the calendar to the local PST of events older than 3 months - the ‚Äúship log‚Äù will not be released from the phone (and the Outlook calendar at all), only the business diary. <br><br>  The iPod, of course, is simply synchronized by the poppy as needed without question.

      It remains to link what is at work with the house.  By searching on Google and reading the forums, I tried to use Google Calendar as an interlayer.  I found out that iCal can be subscribed to its exported Google web-ical, but the synchronization will be only in one direction.  I tried to attach synchronization with Outlook: Remote Calendar software does not work with the 2007 version + two-way synchronization status - beta.  <a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/the-holy-grail-of-synchronization-how-to-synchronize-microsoft-outlook-multiple-locations-google-calendar-gmail-ipod-and-mobile-phone-with-funambol-scheduleworld/">Read engtech.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/the-holy-grail-of-synchronization-how-to-synchronize-microsoft-outlook-multiple-locations-google-calendar-gmail-ipod-and-mobile-phone -with-funambol-scheduleworld</a> <br>  and decided to use another 1 layer - schedulesworld.  The result is not comforting, SyncJ does not know how to work with Outlook 2007, it is expensive and has not been updated for a long time, and Funambol again does not work with the 2007 version.  Plus of those parts of these programs that have earned, Russian names have passed only half the time.  However, it turned out that there is a service in the world that does 70% of what I need: a book and a calendar from Outlook (in both directions) and AddressBook (also in both directions) synchronize to your web portal.  However, again, not everything is so joyful - it cannot not only synchronize with iCal, but also give the calendar as an XML or ical stream, although the developers promise to implement it.  But the fact that the calendar, notes and ToDo are available to me through a web-muzzle from anywhere is good.  The service is called <a href="http://plaxo.com/">plaxo.com</a> , paid there is only a premium option. <br><br>  It is very disappointing that excellent programs are written, but normal connectors are not written, Google could have brought Google Calendar to mind.  I hope that Leopard will work directly with my phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8575/</a></p>
