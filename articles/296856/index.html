    <h4>  <b>// Start your letter enthusiastically</b> </h4><br>  Sometimes an employer wants not only to see a list of skills that correspond to the stated position, but a true love and passion for his work and an incredible desire to work in a company.  Agree, it is much more catchy from a human point of view factor. <br><br>  1 / If in fact the love of trade statistics is wrong, then I don‚Äôt want to be right.  It seems that a large part of the team in Chartbeat is of the same opinion, therefore, in my opinion, this is a good reason why my candidacy could be ideal for your sales team. <br><br>  2 / From the age of 10 I have consulted my relatives and friends for free in matters of style and appearance, but for some time I came to the conclusion that it would be nice to get paid for it.  That's why I was happy to find a personal stylist job vacancy in N ... <br><br>  3 / For about three years I tried myself in different roles, taking part in creating startups in N., looking at an infinite number of articles and recommendations on the topic ‚Äúhow to find my calling‚Äù, and finally realized that it was time to recognize for myself and inform parents that I actually have a job.  I tend to think that in reality, I can best write quality content and sell it. <br><br>  4 / When I was a child, my cherished dream was to become one of those street actors who depict living statues on the street.  Fortunately, over time, the scope of my ambitions has expanded, but I still love to entertain people and speak in front of the crowd - and these qualities make me a truly indispensable manager. <br><br>  5 / After graduating from N. University in May last year, I received, it seems to me, bad advice from my business consultant: ‚ÄúAgree to any job, then you will understand the nuances later‚Äù.  And although I am convinced that I could acquire valuable skills and professional experience anywhere, still I would like to be sure that thanks to my first job I will have the opportunity to further improve in my field as a specialist and move up the career ladder, as well as I will get experienced mentors. <br><br>  6 / The other day I passed the test, according to the results of which for me it would be ideal to work in the field of maritime trade.  I‚Äôm not sure that I understand what it means, but this situation made me think: it‚Äôs just a dream to get a position, thanks to which I could combine my professional business skills with my passion for the ocean!  That's how I found your job at N ... <br><br><br><h4>  <b>// Start by expressing interest in the company</b> </h4><br>  If you already love this brand, and even want to work there - this is an ideal option for the company, because you are familiar with its product and are ready to sell it yourself! <br><br>  But with flattery, it‚Äôs better not to overdo it. <br><br>  7 / Many candidates are trying to get into start-up projects, because there you can count on free food, bean bags and the lack of a dress code.  And although for me, as an employee accustomed to standard office conditions, this looks tempting, nevertheless, what attracted me most was the opportunity to work in a cohesive international team. <br><br>  8 / My golden retriever Rudy was the first to find this job as an operational assistant in your company (in general, he actually dreams of seeing me off to work every day).  But as I learned more and more about N., about your politics and how revolutionary you are trying to change the standard SMS chat, I, in turn, could not help but dream of becoming part of your team. <br><br>  9 / When I was seven, I wanted to become a geica geico when I grew up.  In the end, I came to the conclusion that this is not an option, but you can imagine my excitement when, when I discovered a corporate event manager vacancy on the site, I saw my favorite company logo next to it! <br><br>  10 / When a month ago I visited the Jane Austen Film Festival for the first time, I realized that I didn‚Äôt want to leave.  And I decided that I would not leave - so I immediately began to look at the vacancies of your company ... <br><br>  11 / If I were able to simplify the process of finding an apartment for rent in N. for at least one person, I could consider that the nightmare that I myself had encountered during my recent attempts to find accommodation was not in vain. .  And where else could I do this, if not in N., serving customers daily?  Admit it, nothing that would suit me so perfectly, I do not see in principle. <br><br>  12 / I grew up literally as a couple with N. Zoo, which was located in the backyard, and therefore I know firsthand how you managed to become one of the most popular places for family holidays in N ... For 20 years, I was delighted watched your success as a visitor, and now I want to delight guests in the same way as you once pleased me when I was a child. <br><br>  13 / It was only an hour before my first big dinner party, when I suddenly realized that I had forgotten to buy white wine.  In a panic, I searched for grocery delivery sites through Google, and it was then that I first stumbled upon N ... Since then, I have been your regular customer and cannot get rid of the idea that I could help you to attract even more customers - the same ones who are not capable of planning. like me through social networks and communities. <br><br>  14 / Although I am pleased to work as a marketing manager in N., however, having stumbled upon the position of a PR director in N., I stopped and thought.  I have closely watched N. for many years, I have always been impressed by how the company treats its customers, employees and the business community as a whole. <br><br><h4>  <b>// Start by describing personal qualities and achievements</b> </h4><br>  This is also very important, we would even call it one of the most honest ways to attract the recruiter's attention - truth, abilities, achievements. <br><br>  15 / My last boss once told me that with my manner of speaking on the phone I could very well even report on the situation of hostage taking.  I have always been able to establish contact with different people - both light and heavy on the rise - and I think that this skill could serve me well if I took upon myself the duties of an office manager in N ... <br><br>  16 / Among my colleagues, I am known for my ability to assemble parts into a single whole, no matter what their number.  That is why I, as I see it, can easily cope with the responsibilities of managing the customer service department in N. <br><br>  17 / Last December, I took the place of my competitor - one seller in our company - and I occupy him to this day.  But this is a past stage, so now I'm ready for the next breakthrough, which means it's time to try myself for the role of a sales manager in N. <br><br>  18 / After spending three years as an internal communications manager in a company with 2,000 employees, I learned how to plan a quarterly report and office notes almost in my sleep.  So what do I want to do next?  Well, let's say I can contribute my experience in planning communication strategies in consulting companies. <br><br>  19 / And although you will not find in my resume an indication that I once worked as an online community manager, I have been engaged in creating platforms for people on the basis of my blog and N. for three years. <br><br>  20 / If you are looking for someone who can readily execute orders and will not ‚Äúrock the boat‚Äù, then probably I am not the most suitable candidate.  But if you need someone who can dig deep into the data, analyze what specifically works (and what doesn't), and challenge the status quo, then I think we will find a common language. <br><br>  21 / From the very first day of my work in N. (oh yeah, they actually give out free ice cream!) I was set up for a career.  I had my first internship in a professional football team while still in college.  When I finished it, I got a job full-time, and after six months I was appointed to a position in another department.  I thought I wouldn‚Äôt discover anything new.  However, as my professional growth progressed, I finally understood ... that this is not at all the case.  Shock, right? <br><br>  22 / Perhaps you will be interested to know that a veteran of accounting has forgotten in a culinary start-up project N ... Although I agree, this is very strange, but I know that you are looking for an intelligent guy who equally understands fine dishes and financial transactions, so I'm definitely the one you need. <br><br>  23 / For the last 10 years I have been building my career on one simple principle: work smarter.  I track inefficient work patterns, correct them and thereby increase the productivity of everyone near me.  As a result, I received three promotions in my company and now I am sure that I will cope with the duties of analyst N ... <br><br><br><h4>  <b>// Start creatively and with humor</b> </h4><br>  Who does not like to receive pleasant and funny letters?  It is better than the same type of tediousness.  Just check your sense of humor a bit - sometimes it becomes really rather sad. <br><br>  24 / I became interested in a freelance writer.  But before I list all the reasons for which my choice fell on her, I would like to tell you a little about myself: until five years I did not grow hair, so everyone who saw me lying in a wheelchair was sure that I was a boy (and my name is N., I think it will lead you to the appropriate reflections).  I hope I deserve your attention (from N.) <br><br>  25 / Have you ever come across the fact that your mom five times a day refers to you with the question of how your job search is progressing, and in the end he only suspiciously snorts when you say that no progress is being observed.  This is how I live now. <br><br>  26 / But I hope that in the near future I will be provided with a full-time social networking manager.  By the way, the good news: I can be more useful to you than a mom, who demands a report from you in her actions.  Let me tell you more. <br><br>  27 / Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to try myself as a marketing manager in N.!  I happily agree!  Ok, well, I know that so far you have not given me such an opportunity.  Well in this case, here are a few ideas that I could suggest if this were so. <br><br>  28 / You are completely outraged.  You have listed all the pros and cons.  You talked with your coach, hairdresser, with every bariste you know.  Well, in the end, why don't you make a decision?  After all, when you ask someone's advice, it is not quantity that is more important for you, but quality.  If you constantly have to deal with the need to make serious decisions, you need either a lawyer, or a listener, or a good kick in the ass.  In other words, you need to consult with the N / person who wrote this letter /. <br>  At first, I thought that submitting a credit card statement would be a clear indication of how much I love online shopping, but then I came to the conclusion that I would write this letter for the best and list all the reasons why I could raise N.'s case. next level. <br><br>  30 / I never thought that life could change so much if you accidentally drop your iPhone from the second floor window (by the way, this is a funny story, ask me about it).  But thanks to that I discovered N. - and found the job of my dream as a junior employee of the company. <br><br>  31 / If we played ‚ÄúTwo Truths, One Lie‚Äù, then I would say: I exceeded my sales quota by at least 20% every quarter of this year, once I won a contest for high-speed eating pies, and I have a wonderful job in N. The latter is, of course, a lie.  Presently. <br><br><br><h4>  <b>How to achieve this effect?</b>  <b>Here are 5 cool life hacking.</b> </h4><br>  <b>1. The human factor</b> <b><br></b>  Write like a friend.  That is, a friend who you want to tell you about what a really cool candidate you are.  Maybe he does not know about this story.  And she doesn't know why you want to get into the company.  It is not necessary to imagine Vasya, with whom you sat at the same desk and then grew up together - let it be just a man on the other side of the screen who does not want to read the same letters (like you), tired of working (like you), wants to be a little happier and more successful (like you). <br><br>  <b>2. Company knowledge, position</b> <br>  We have probably talked about this a hundred times, but still.  If you want to immediately declare yourself as a professional and a person who does not have a superficial attitude to finding a job and a specific position in the company, then a certain research is simply necessary. <br><br>  <b>3. Details</b> <br>  Because they decide and make your "image" a little more complete and humane.  Your story about your mom / strange boss / interesting situation in which you met the company (this is really cool if you like this!) Will be read to you.  But do not write a huge letter or talk about your life experiences - do not push people away.  Everyone has their own problems. <br><br>  <b>4. Simplicity</b> <br>  Notice that none of the letters contained abstruse words or long sentences with a bunch of turns - they are completely unreadable.  Especially if HR has already opened 58 letter - he looks at its structure, on the first lines, opens the summary.  And already here was born his first impression.  If you were able to form it with the subject of the letter, a greeting and the first sentences, you have already been noticed. <br><br>  <b>5. Aesthetics</b> <br>  Believe me, not less important.  You just need to make everything look neat (stupid word, but!).  If the letter itself has a different font size, color, strange mail, signature, resume attached under the name% # $% @ ^ &amp;!, Then somehow it becomes clear that it‚Äôs not all that necessary for a person. <br><br>  And we brought a unique <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/nelovkij-momentkak-obsuzhdat-zarplatu/">guide for those who are embarrassed to talk about wages.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296856/</a></p>
