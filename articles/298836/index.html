Nevertheless, Nokia continues to work and, moreover, is <a href="http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2016/02/11/nokia-corporation-report-for-q4-2015-and-full-year-2015">gaining momentum</a> .  In 2015, the main profit of the company fell on the division of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Networks">Nokia Networks</a> .  It is one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of telecommunications equipment for mobile and fixed-line operators. <br><br>  Another division - <a href="http://company.nokia.com/en/our-businesses/nokia-technologies">Nokia Technologies</a> - works simultaneously in three directions: the development and application of the patent portfolio, licensing of the Nokia brand and the development of its own products, such as the Ozo virtual reality camera. <br><br>  Net sales for the IV quarter of 2015 amounted to 3.6 billion euros, which is 3% higher than the same period last year.  For the whole year, net sales increased by 6% and reached 12.5 billion euros.

      Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri spoke at the Mobile World Conference ( <a href="http://www.gsma.com/events/mobile-world-congress">MVC 2016</a> ).  He commented on the latest news about the company, and also told about its development plans. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Just today, it became known that Nokia <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160221005149/en/Nakina-Systems-Agrees-Acquired-Nokia">bought the</a> Canadian software developer in the field of network security and network optimization - <a href="https://nakinasystems.com/">Nakina</a> .  The deal is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2016. <br><br>  A few months ago, Nokia <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/18134/">sold the</a> map service <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here">Here</a> .  The Finnish company Nokia has agreed to sell Here for 2.8 billion euros.  The transaction must be closed in the first quarter of 2016.  The customer of the service is a consortium of Audi, BMW and Daimler. <br><br>  Nokia announced in April its plans to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel-Lucent">Alcatel-Lucent, a</a> Franco-American company, for 15.6 billion euros - this is one of the largest deals in the telecommunications industry recently.  Alcatel-Lucent's business is connected with the development of new generation networks - 5G. <br><br>  In the fall, Nokia <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20492/">received</a> final approval.  The deal was due to end at the beginning of 2016.  As a result, a new technology giant will emerge in Europe, which will create "next-generation network technologies and services to create a seamless connection for people and things, no matter where they are." <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek">MediaTek</a> and Nokia have developed a new data transfer technology EC-EGPRS, which should be used in both user equipment (wearable electronics, sensors for a smart home), and for Internet of Things ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">IoT</a> ) devices.  Demonstration of the work of the new standard should be held at the exhibition MWC 2016 - from February 22 to February 26. <br><br>  According to Suri, the above transactions correspond to the 10-year plan for the revival of Nokia, approved in 2014. <br><br>  Today, TechCrunch, citing the words of Suri, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/21/nokia-growth-partners-announces-350m-fund-focused-on-iot/">said</a> that the venture capital investment company <a href="http://www.nokiagrowthpartners.com/">Nokia Growth Partners has</a> created a new fund of $ 350 million.  The Fund will invest in the development of IoT technologies and the development of the ecosystem around them. <br><br>  Rajiv Suri said in June 2015 that the company will return to the development of mobile devices from 2016.  Nokia sold its smartphone business to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in 2013 and will not be able to produce smartphones under its brand until 2023.  Alcatel-Lucent has similar obligations with the Chinese electronics manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCL_Corporation">TCL</a> until the end of 2015. <br><br>  The Finnish company does not plan to independently establish the production and sale of phones.  Instead, Nokia is looking for partners who will receive from it a brand and design assistance.  According <a href="http://hitech.vesti.ru/news/view/id/8678">to rumors</a> , Nokia is negotiating with the Finnish company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittium_(company)">Bittium</a> , which is supposedly ready to provide production facilities for the production of Nokia phones in the brand‚Äôs homeland. <br><br>  Although corporate profits bring the main profits of Nokia, the company is trying to return products to the business for the consumer.  "We consider it our duty to experiment in the field of consumer equipment," said Suri. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298836/</a></p>
