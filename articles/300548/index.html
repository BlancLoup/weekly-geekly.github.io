Get the most out of your budget ‚Äî turn website visitors into subscribers of your group or page on social networks. <br><br>  <b>How to make site visitors want to subscribe to you?</b>  Most likely, you heard about Social Media Optimization (SMO).  I translate it as ‚Äúoptimization of social network entries from other sources‚Äù (for example, offline or website).  In this article we will just touch SMO and see how to increase the desire of visitors to the company's website to go to social networks and subscribe. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  SMO communication and sales funnels </h4><br>  What is a "sales funnel", I think, no need to explain.  The main benefit of using a funnel in marketing (and on the website as a marketing tool) is to understand the degree of interest of the leads at different stages and the ability to transfer them from stage to stage. <br><br>  How interested are people coming to the corporate site to buy?  Depending on the channels of attraction there may be different answers.  But, mainly, on Internet advertising or content placed on other sites, people come with interest, but without the need <i>(‚Äúwarm leads‚Äù)</i> , and people with the need for what you offer <i>(‚Äúhot leads‚Äù)</i> .

      <b>What do you think, what leads should we involve in social networks through social buttons placed on the site?</b> <br>  Think a minute) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/960/180/93a/96018093a4c9456c8c135fafef7393b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The correct answer, in my opinion, is ‚Äúwarm‚Äù.  ‚ÄúHot‚Äù orders will be ordered immediately if they find a suitable service or product, and the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù lead still needs to be brought to the ‚Äúhot‚Äù state.  With the help of social networks it is very convenient to actualize the need for your services / products. <br><br><h6>  Example. </h6>  You are an IT company that sells licenses for the 1C program and services for its configuration, as well as the hardware on which it works.  You wrote an article in a corporate blog, where you could understand how to be and what to do if 1C slows down (a sore subject for many of your clients). <br><br>  To you on the site for the search query "1c server hangs up connection with the database" got IT Schnick.  He liked your article, you got a loyal reader. <br><br>  What to do with it next?  Lead on social networks and prove with the help of content that you can be useful to him "many more times"!  As a result, your loyal subscriber will buy a server from you when they are ready to change the current hardware, which can be one of the reasons for the 1C hangup. <br><br><h4>  Place number 1 for the rebirth of site visitors to subscribers - blog pages </h4><br>  <b>After the reader has read your article, he is loyal to you, and you can easily and naturally suggest that you subscribe to new content!</b> <br><br>  You can make a pop-up window that appears near the end of the article: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/9ea/c46/eca9eac4652c4dca9bf37cab561fe42f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Good tone - on the pop-up window put a tick "Do not show more than ever") <br><br>  If you want to be less aggressive in gathering the audience of your communities, make static buttons or links at the end of the article: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb2/dbd/6ca/eb2dbd6ca1824cc6bd887cc3397d591b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>It is very desirable to make it clear to the person what benefit he will receive if he signs</b> - as Eset did! <br><br>  An example of how very, very unobtrusively offers to subscribe vc.ru: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d6/675/248/4d66752484e5431baad2d68e0e860d15.png" alt="image"><br><br>  They offer to go to the social network to everyone who got to the comments on the article.  The presence of a social network widget near the place for comments seems to imply that a person who has crowded to this place may want to continue communication in social networks. <br><br>  For no obvious reason why to subscribe, it is unlikely that someone will do it. <br><br>  <b>Objection 1. IT-shniki buy from those who give "bonuses", so keep them on the social network is ineffective in terms of sales.</b> <br><br>  How, with the help of a strong expertise, to separate oneself from the competitors, I have already described in the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25934/">article</a> , I will not repeat. <br><br>  <b>Objection 2. If it is necessary to bring the lead ‚Äúto condition‚Äù with useful content, would it not be better to offer to subscribe to the newsletter articles from the blog?</b> <br><br>  True, you can sign it to email-list.  But social networks are still a tool for two-way communication with the brand, and it works great for increasing trust.  And for a person to subscribe to the newsletter, he <u>should already have</u> confidence in you. <br><br>  Compare the offer <i>‚ÄúSubscribe to us on Facebook and follow new articles‚Äù</i> and <i>‚ÄúLeave your e-mail - we guarantee, no spam, only new articles‚Äù</i> . <br><br>  The first, in my opinion, is safer for someone who does not know you, and may have a better response. <br><br><h4>  Place number 2 for placing social buttons - near the top menu or on it </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99b/252/d9c/99b252d9cbbf4ad9be10789b4615fa25.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This location has pros and cons: <br><ul><li>  Plus: it‚Äôs immediately clear where to go to subscribe.  Buttons in the most prominent place of the site - in the menu.  Especially from them you will not get to anywhere, if the menu is floating. </li><li>  Minus: a place for a menu rarely allows you to put an inscription on yourself, why should a passing user turn into your subscriber.  And it is necessary if you want to have a good percentage of transitions in the social network from the number of site visitors! </li></ul><br>  Third-party inscriptions will distract attention from the menu, and in fact a subscription to social networks is not the main conversion indicator of the site ... <br><br>  <b>One-year option: the reason for subscribing to the social network (and the newsletter) is shown in a prominent place and it does not overlap the menu:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/3de/250/6db3de250ee24fab89f7dcabded1a7e9.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Place number 3 for placing social buttons - site footer </h4><br>  Social buttons in the footer ("basement") of the site will be visible from any page.  And anyone, wherever he is, can follow the link to your social network: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6dc/5d4/b3c/6dc5d4b3cfa14d3fa50fd0604ba12710.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But it is unlikely you will succeed in persuading a person to subscribe, as the popular media does. <br>  Suggest a reason why a visitor needs it: for example, to be aware of promotions and sales. <br><br>  How to set up social buttons on your own is well described <a href="http://staurus.net/sotsializiruem-sayt-samostoyatelno">here</a> . <br><br>  I have everything for today. <br><br>  Successful sales! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300548/</a></p>
