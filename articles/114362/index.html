      The last places in the top ten are the carrier model MTS 916 and Acer beTouch E140.  These are already relics - resistive touch screens with a diagonal of 2.8 inches and a resolution of 320x240 pixels looked good in 2009.  Quirky marketers call such devices "your first smartphone on Android," but, as experience shows, this model may well be the last. <br><br>  Verdict: Unsuitable for the first acquaintance with the Android device.  It is better to save money and take a simple "dialer". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db2/c97/cca/db2c97cca93aa7a07826711e1cc3193e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>9th place</b> <br>  <i>Samsung GT-I5500, Huawei Ideos U8150, LG Optimus ME</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 6500-7000 rubles</i> <br><br>  In ninth place, pushing and quarreling, three gadgets nestled at once: the Samsung GT-I5500, sold in Belarus Huawei U8150 Ideos and the LG Optimus ME expected soon.  These are smartphones for 6000-7000 rubles, with 2.8-inch screens and all the same resolution of 320x240 pixels, but already with capacitive displays.  Working with scrollable lists on them is much more convenient than on resistive screens.  And you have to scroll down the lists often, there's nothing to be done.  But both Samsung and LG are making efforts to bring the OS to the mind.  Alas, many games and some programs will not start anyway.  In general, the owner of the top Google Phone as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù for the second number is a worthy option.  Tied to one gmail profile, they would insure each other. <br><br>  Verdict: Only as the second ‚Äúgooglofon‚Äù on the farm, otherwise it‚Äôs worth saving money for a more attractive model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/6bd/788/b246bd78854ba781b4d8556aff3ef3f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>8th place</b> <br>  <i>Sony Ericsson Xperia X8</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 8000 rubles</i> <br><br>  For such a compact gadget, the display resolution is 480x320, capacitive technology and a diagonal of 3 inches - this is not a breakthrough, but a good launching pad to get to know the world of Android.  Plus, the Timescape proprietary shell, which makes working with the device more interesting.  But stuck on 2.1.  OS version, the lack of dualtach and a frank lack of RAM at an average price of 8,000 rubles badly spoil the karma of the gadget. <br><br>  Verdict: Sony fans can buy "to the collection", the rest, please do not worry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/612/f96/227/612f96227ce3e168b464184b4ce2a737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>7th place</b> <br>  <i>Samsung GT-I5800</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 9000 rubles</i> <br><br>  Samsung again gives us a grainy display, but this time also a non-standard resolution of 400x240.  Before buying such a smartphone, it is worthwhile to say goodbye to programs and games unadapted for the screen.  But the diagonal of the display, the set method of SWYPE and Bluetooth 3.0 are not bad, as well as the proprietary shell Touchwiz.  Another of the amenities worth remembering 3-megapixel camera with autofocus, capacious battery and hardware buttons - an acceptable option for work.  Alas, the Russian firmware up to 2.2.  version, in contrast to the European, did not get to the device.  So here either use Android 2.1, or get system access rights and dive into the pool of custom firmware.  At the same time, the device is quite expensive - about 9000 rubles. <br><br>  Verdict: Not bad, but too expensive for such functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a27/5d3/bff/a275d3bfffcbd6f51dc7b9bf4ef1b054.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6th place</b> <br>  <i>Samsung Galaxy Mini S5570</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 9000 rubles</i> <br><br>  He is already out of the box ready to provide Android 2.2 with the Touchwiz shell and SWYPE.  The display, alas, is 320x240 pixels, but this is more common for most applications than the resolution of the GT-I5800.  The design causes only positive emotions, the gadget is just nice to take in hand.  Although, the battery capacity could have been bigger, but the camera lacks autofocus. <br><br>  Verdict: Expensive, but pretty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/1e3/10b/6e71e310b9a38f6f33d11769cf827b8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>5th place</b> <br>  <i>Beeline E300 or MTS Evo</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 8000 rubles</i> <br><br>  This character is one in three persons: Beeline E300 or MTS Evo is actually nee Huawei U8500.  This Chinese robot may well take an Oscar in the nomination ‚ÄúMy first Android-smartphone‚Äù.  Arguments ‚Äúfor‚Äù: capacitive 3.2-inch display, resolution 480x320 pixels and a bonus in the form of operator traffic and SMS (from Beeline).  Against this backdrop, the price of 8,000 rubles is not so biting.  Of the serious drawbacks of the device is the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android 2.1, to which cellular operators strive to ‚Äúsew‚Äù the unrecoverable contacts of their services, a frankly weak 1150 mAh battery and not the fastest processor. <br><br>  Verdict: In six months, he wants to change to a more advanced device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/69a/b12/4bb69ab12d554fcbdeb6a1892d77b20e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4th place</b> <br>  <i>Garmin-Asus nuvifone A50</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 12000 rubles</i> <br><br>  The owner of the largest display in this category: 3.5 inches and a resolution of 480x320 pixels!  As well as out-of-the-box navigation, an excellent GPS receiver and a set of auto accessories.  If you have to travel a lot around Russia, and you are not embarrassed by the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android 2.1, or the infernal combination of a large display and a 1150 mAh battery, this is a good option. <br><br>  Verdict: Suitable for avid travelers.  But if you often walk, and car charging is not available, you need to buy an extra battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/58e/c29/9ce58ec294e095cf48d49854d50a299c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3rd place</b> <br><br>  <i>HTC Wildfire</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 12000 rubles</i> <br><br>  I foresee the question ‚ÄúWhy is Wildfire in third place?  He is a hundred years old at lunchtime, the screen is grainy, the processor without the 3D accelerator is "tug", and there are no hardware control keys ... "I answer.  Yes, because it has just fallen in price to 12,000 rubles, and more recent and interesting models (hello, Gratia!) Cost transcendental money and do not fit into any budgetary framework.  In addition to these shortcomings, Wildfire has a lot of advantages.  First of all, it has a HTC Sense shell preinstalled that transforms standard Android.  Secondly, the 5-megapixel camera of the smartphone is endowed with not only autofocus, but also flash.  Thirdly, there is a trackpad for scrolling through lists and surfing the web. <br><br>  Verdict: If you close your eyes to a low-quality screen, Wildfire is a pleasant-to-go ‚Äúgoogle phone‚Äù.  Although, in my opinion, it‚Äôs still not worth 12,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ece/f7a/ac3/ecef7aac313a08f9648b41f6f8fbc99c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2nd place</b> <br>  <i>Highscreen Cosmo</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 8000 rubles</i> <br><br>  If the navigation ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù is not needed, and the pure Android 2.2 doesn‚Äôt inspire fear, in less than 8,000 rubles you can buy a cheerful Highscreen Cosmo.  Despite the extremely low price, this is a ‚Äúgooglofon‚Äù with no hardware concessions: a 3.2-inch capacitive display, resolution 480x320, the processor is now a popular Qualcomm 7227 600 MHz, able to outperform the same Wildfire.  Yes, and the flashing family of colors of the rainbow lights!  And the assembly did not let us down.  The design is aggressive and in some places some kind of "space".  If you look for something to find fault with Cosmo, you can only complain about the touch control buttons and the lack of autofocus in the camera.  This will prevent the recognition of barcodes and, therefore, will slightly reduce the functionality of the smartphone.  Well, the prospects for upgrading to the 2.3 version still look very dubious.  Everything.  He has no other disadvantages. <br><br>  Verdict: A really good machine for your money, albeit a HighScreen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dd/900/2ab/0dd9002ab70f22a222b158f5be2da333.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1st place</b> <br>  <i>LG Optimus One</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price: 9000 rubles</i> <br><br>  The first place among the budget smartphones on Android is LG Optimus One.  Possessing hardware characteristics similar to Highscreen Cosmo, he is the only owner of 512 MB of RAM in this weight category.  Also among its undeniable merits is a modified Android 2.2 manufacturer, which the company promised to upgrade to 2.3, as well as many pre-installed applications, mechanical control buttons and camera autofocus.  The official recommended price for One is 10,000 rubles, but it can also be found for 9000. <br><br>  Verdict: In terms of price-quality ideal budget Android-smartphone.
