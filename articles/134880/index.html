If you still do not know why we need dresses with Wi-Fi, why the most important thing for winter fashion is the thinnest fabric with heating, how you can use the latest biotechs and how close we come to Surrogates - you can go to it immediately. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/osolar-photovoltaic-bikini.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cut, her lecture on <b>bleeding edge-technologies in fashion</b> , plus the main summary of theses for those who are too lazy to watch.  The technologies of the sea: from banal underwear with LEDs and 3D printing of shoes to changing skin pigmentation and a prototype of a linen bag with built-in electronics to change color on the fly, which will soon go into series.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Here is a <a href="http://knowledgestream.ru/event-06.html">video of the</a> performance in two languages. <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  Alison started from afar: first mentioned the history of fashion as such, recalled that the aerospace industry largely determined the materials of the 30-60s, recalled Paco Raban, who suddenly realized that such man-made materials as rubber, rubber, nylon and other things You can put not only in the tank, but also turn into very sexy images.  Then the game went with the light, and then - the embedding of computers in clothes. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/oShiny_Clutch.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  I have always wondered how quickly the convergence of these two worlds will go: fashion and technology.  And the events of the last 30 years leave no doubt that it happened. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Magical </h4><br>  The lecture began with a short retrospective: an increasing miniaturization of computers, a variety of energy sources, biosynthetic developments, robotics ... in sportswear, for example, the built-in pulse sensors that can transmit data to the iPad are already actively used. <br><br>  More interesting examples are paired shirts with tactile feedback (you can hug a loved one, or you can give yourself in the face).  An even more interesting example of adaptive technology - a glove helps a woman with memory loss syndrome.  The lady touches things her husband has pre-recorded audio information on and remembers why they are needed. <br><br>  Robotics allows a new look at the design of dresses or hats.  Robotic corsets modify the silhouette and design of the dress.  Synthetic biology uses viruses and molds to modify objects.  Alison fell in love with the dress she saw at the exhibition, which filters the air at the expense of the reagents growing on its surface (mold). <br><br><h4>  Real </h4><br>  Alison likes the distribution of 3D printing items.  She says that the theme is already popular in several countries - you can quickly and efficiently make shoes, for example.  Probably, it looks like this: ‚ÄúDear, now he will print out the shoes to my hairstyle, and we will finally go!‚Äù. <br><br>  Alison believes that in the future there will be a lot of augmented reality, tattoos with changes in skin pigmentation, dynamic repainting of the iris of the eye ... In general, Lews believes that changes in the body will soon begin, not just the image.  If earlier hair and hair color could not serve as signs of a woman, it seems that soon there will be many more to be added to this list. <br><br>  In the final, inspired by Alison shows her projects and projects of colleagues developed over the past 9 years.  Not everyone is ready to produce high-grade things, but Alison is sure that accessories with technological elements will definitely become popular in the coming years. <br><br>  In conclusion, she made a premiere of the video about the novelty - a handbag that changes color from touching it: it will be the first linen handbag with integrated electronics that will be produced not at a garment factory, but at a high-tech factory. <br><br>  <b>Here are some interesting things:</b> <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/orings.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Rings for couples that transmit heat touches from one ring to another anywhere in the world. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/ojacket.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The jacket, where you can send an image from your phone via Bluetooth, was first shown in 2004.  For athletes developed a version with a pulse and other vital signs in the picture. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/odress.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A simple thing in terms of technology: a glowing dress. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/oschoes_02.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And backlit shoes. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/opurse.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Backlit wallet.  So Alison decided her eternal problem with finding the right things in a small but very crowded women bag. <br><br><img src="http://s2.itrash.ru/idb/7150954398ce1a2ec2ddc80644ac2cf0/ocloser_01.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A prototype of clothing with physical feedback. <br><br>  The picture at the beginning of the post is a solar-powered swimsuit that can power small electronics. <br><br>  <b>In the discussion a few more points surfaced:</b> <br><ul><li>  In 2015, almost every fashion house will have an R &amp; D department. </li><li>  In the coming years, accessories with high-tech filling will be quite expensive: about $ 500 in the United States.  After five years, the cost will begin to decline, but not at the expense of quality. </li><li>  Now everything is funded through research grants, later it is planned to work with venture funds. </li><li>  For us, electronics accessories are safe.  For the environment - not very.  But, nevertheless, the production of piece shoes to order is harmless than mass production. </li><li>  One of the most anticipated technologies in fashion is a thin heating fabric, which, it seems, is made for the military.  Being a civilian, she will turn in general the whole world of winter fashion. </li></ul><br>  With all this, Alison believes that online shopping for a long time will not replace the usual: after all, any thing you need to watch and feel.  This is to some extent captivating and very convincing in the sobriety of the assessment: after all, a fan of innovation would have argued that the online would soon supplant the real. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134880/</a></p>
