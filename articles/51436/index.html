  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a CMS, suitable for search engine optimization.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Unfortunately, almost every time I undertake to promote a site on a CMS (more often it is critical for self-written, paid systems of various <s>under-</s> design studios) I face the problem of its unsuitability for initial optimization.  And, unfortunately, errors are absolutely simple, such as the inability to specify meta tags or duplicate header (h1) with a title.  As the name implies, focus your attention on the basics and not very much in the field of SEO, I will not, just write a few mandatory things that are really necessary for future promotion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>The main errors of various CMS:</strong> <br><ul><li>  The inability to set your meta tags. <br>  Among SEOs, there is a perception that the role of meta tags has moved to the second (or further) plan.  This is partly true, you can do without them, but this will be more likely a mistake.  First of all, it is easier for SERP to create a snippet using descriptions.  Secondly, though not significant weight from keywords and descriptions is transferred, checked personally on a small experience (I can‚Äôt say 100%, only 6 sites were involved in the experience). </li><li>  Duplicate H1 header (or any other) directly to title <br>  There is a dual error, the search engine may impose a pessimization for search spam (we will call it that way), and the second mistake is that the names can often be the same and / or not much different.  Copying information in any form will never benefit. </li><li>  Forming a title like {nodename | sitename} <br>  In continuation of work with the title of the page, I would like to remind you that search engines perceive far from the entire title / title / meta tag, cutting off its surplus.  This number varies for different PS, but 70 characters will fit just right.  So it is worth reconsidering the formation of the title in full. </li></ul><br>  <em>Conclusions and solutions:</em> <br>  In the field with the creation of the document you just need to add fields such as: keywords, descriptions and page title. <br><br>  Glory to programmers that other errors are much less common, but, of course, there are a number of suggestions that would also help speed up the optimization process. <br><br>  <strong>Flaws in various CMS</strong> <br><ul><li>  Visual editor buttons <br>  Many of you know that the differences between the strong and em tags from b and i are much more profound than writing.  It is understandable, if you say roughly, without going into details, the first ones are designed to emphasize the attention of search engines, and the second - for people.  Dear coders, please, if you do not put the first option, then at least do both. </li><li>  CNC <br>  The SERP is influenced by many factors, including the name of the domain, the address of the document.  The CNC helps to increase the internal weight of the pages, reducing the total budget for external optimization.  Of course, not significantly, but in the fight with a competitor to help, of course, it can. </li><li>  Sitemap (sitemap.xml) <br>  A very useful thing if the project has many pages, and even more so in the case of frequent content updates.  Unfortunately, programmers do not bother to enter an option that automatically / semi-automatically adds new pages to the site map and / or changes the date of the change in case of editing. </li><li>  Weight of pages and doubles <br>  Quite often a deplorable thing happens, your unique text is stolen and put on another site without specifying a reciprocal link.  We will not fight, we do not care.  After all, the owners of the content are we and it is our page that will be unique (it‚Äôs true that system crashes are possible, well, then you have to think).  Now imagine a situation where duplicates on our own site.  Yes, and those with simple errors.  For example, one document can be both with www and without, as with a slash at the end, and without it.  But in the search engines will sit information about each such page ... And, of course, lead to pessimization.  Corrects, everything, of course, without any problems, so why not do it right away?  A simple redirect. </li></ul>

      All these tips will help make your product better and our lives easier.  And most importantly, the client will be happy, which means sooner or later contact us again.  Or play word of mouth. <br><br>  PS: I understand that the programmer must be a programmer, the designer must be a designer, the layout designer must be a layout designer, and the optimizer should be an optimizer.  But in order to perform its task qualitatively, it is necessary to know at least a little about the whole chain of the site‚Äôs life.  After all, every layout designer has ever cursed the designer for making a picture that is really not really high-quality cut, every programmer swore at the designer and layout designer for not having enough space in the blocks for his needs, and how terrified the optimizer is, seeing the content field is located in the lower right corner, seeing styles not rendered in separate files, navigation in pictures or scripts, redirects on internal links, inability to even change file names;) But how much easier it would be if the manager gave a clear  e TK ... So, let's take care of the entire chain of creation of a site, only together can we truly provide a quality product and be proud of it.  Think of your neighbors. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51436/</a></p>
