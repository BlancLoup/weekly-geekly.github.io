In this article, I decided to make a detailed overview of the headphones, which will be to the novice audiophiles.  Of the several hundreds of models on the market today, I tried to select the best, the most top-rated and most popular, but nevertheless fit into a modest budget of 10 thousand rubles.  Listening, studying forums, reading reviews and analyzing tests, I performed a detailed analysis of six pairs of headphones that should interest a potential buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1e/6bf/df6/b1e6bfdf6679a6fe87b42a13e18da673.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  From left to right, according to the photo.

If the headphones do not reproduce these frequencies, then you will feel a loss of saturation and depth of sound.  Naturally, when listening, recording or mixing, a similar effect can seriously interfere. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii -</em> impressive bass, pronounced in the midrange. <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii - a</em> little deeper and cleaner than the model above. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> nothing to note. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 -</em> ultra <em>clear</em> bass. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 -</em> good presence, pleasant knock, soft hum. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod -</em> presence at times better, just fantastic, the buzz a little nicer. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80</em> - strong, clear top bass. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> very strong, smeared bass, more noticeable in the middle, a narrow scene. <br><br><h3>  Upper bass (80 Hz - 200 Hz) </h3><br>  These are the top notes of bass instruments and the lowest notes of other stringed musical instruments.  With the loss of this register, along with it, the sensation of sound power is lost.  As a rule, these frequencies contain the energy of sound, which causes a person to dance to the music.  The main consistency of the energy of the rhythm section is located in this range. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii -</em> remain the same impressive, but slightly worse than in the previous range. <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii -</em> again, deeper and clearer, the punch and banging clear, more detailed. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> not natural, color and distortion is felt at sufficient volume. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 -</em> poor, but much stronger than in the register above. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 - a</em> lot of extra noise on the transition to the upper bass. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod -</em> does not lose presence, more density in sound. <br>  <em>The V-Moda M80</em> is strong again, but not very clean. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> impressive, strong bass, but too bloated and slow. <br><br><h3>  Midrange (200 Hz - 2500 Hz) </h3><br>  It houses almost the entire rhythm, mostly it is a guitar register, up to 500 Hz.  After comes solo violins, solo guitars, piano and vocals.  Music that lacks these frequencies is usually called boring and boring. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii -</em> typical medium, nothing bad, but there is nothing to highlight, they do not show much. <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii -</em> less deep than the model above, clean, with a colored tint. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> not stable, and not everywhere clean, occasionally bright, and sometimes too dark. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 - the</em> absolute winner in this fight, clear, enriched sound. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 - the</em> slope of a warm sound, for the better surprising vocal range. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod -</em> a smoother transition to high mids. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80</em> - the best balance in the frequency gaps, the lower averages are more noticeable, the upper ones are more magnificent. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> very sluggish and flat sound, buried in the bass. <br><br><h3>  High frequencies (2500 Hz - 30000 Hz) </h3><br>  There are few notes in this range, although up to 5,000 Hz there are the highest notes of the piano and some other instruments.  Enhancing this part of the spectrum allows you to achieve a bright, sparkling sound that creates an effect of presence, but if the energy of this band is excessive, then it hurts.  This is an urgent problem of inexpensive acoustic systems that specifically reinforce this part of the range, thereby tiring the listener with excessive musical brilliance.  For most people, the limit of perception is 10,000 Hz, but this is not enough for good sound, and if a bear doesn‚Äôt come to everyone‚Äôs ear, then in the absence of upper highs (10,000 Hz - 20,000 Hz), he will feel some discomfort when listening to records. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii -</em> clear and sharp;  There are not many excessive peaks, sometimes the brilliance turns into a whistle. <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii -</em> restrained, very few peaks, pretty dark and deep. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> beautiful liveliness, fits perfectly into the ranges nearby. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 -</em> clean and smooth;  rare, not particularly noticeable peak maxima. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 -</em> good articulation;  stable, but insufficient energy throughout the range. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod -</em> articulation is even higher, more smoothness at maximum loads. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80</em> - the smoothest of all, but not enough accuracy and clarity, felt unnatural. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> more sluggish than in the midrange. <br><br>  In general, <em>Pioneer</em> and <em>Sennheiser are</em> very similar.  In <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000,</em> high frequencies are more detailed and give more presence, while in <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> their energy is rarely and concentrated, which will be an advantage for some genres. <br><br><h5>  Let's summarize a small [first] result (from best to worst). </h5><br>  <i><b>Bass</b></i> <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> = <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> <br><br>  <i><b>Top bass</b></i> <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><i><b>Mid frequencies</b></i></em> <em><br></em>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 = Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><i><b>High frequencies</b></i></em> <em><br></em>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> <br><br><h3>  Gain </h3><br>  A portable amplifier with a player gives the following results. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii - the</em> top bass seems a bit veiled, but not significant. <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii -</em> louder sound without loss in quality. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> more bass. <br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 - the</em> sound is absolutely the opposite, the quality is worse. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 - a</em> tiny increase in sound. <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod -</em> more control over the bass, more sensitivity. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80</em> - a lot of extra noise has appeared. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 - a</em> little more high frequencies, no more. <br><br>  Let's summarize a small [second] result (from the best to the worst). <br><br>  <i><b>Gain</b></i> <br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> <br><br><h3>  Listening experience </h3><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii -</em> headphones with a bias toward the bass, without any loss in the middle and high frequencies.  The amount of clarity in both bass and high is surprising.  Low and top bass rumbles infrequently, but with minor and minor noises.  At high there is a strong peak: at the beginning, right after 2500 Hz, and in another range: from 8000 Hz to 10,000 Hz.  This is very typical for closed headphones.  After long listening, it seems that mids are slightly drowned and are on the side, relatively high and low. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</em> - more neutral, more restrained.  Everything is as above, but the sound is clearer and more detailed, even on portable sources.  Medium less modest than in the model above. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> - headphones with a bias for high frequencies with amazing energy and lack of good bass.  Connecting an amplifier puts them among the best, adding bass, and showing their decisive importance in the search for good sound along with stunning sound insulation.  For the genre of rock music, the thing is, with a good top bass and bright high, which some seem to be too "whistling", and some have become accustomed to this effect and receive only pleasure from it.  Not stable, because with different tracks the sound is too bright, then too dark.  Upper bass is quieter than normal bass, which increases the audibility, and as a result, the high frequencies are ringing. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> - clean, precise, sterile.  It is difficult to find fault with anything listening to these headphones.  Frequency sweeps are fantastic and completely true.  The sound, as if, the murmur of a streamlet, just as gentle, clear and fast.  Midrange is the strength of the headphones, while low and high are felt dry and brittle.  The main disadvantage of bass in these headphones is its subtlety and cold-bloodedness, without density and reverberations.  For studio use, this can be very useful, but for portable it is a noticeable minus. <br><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 (Pioneer HDJ-2000mod)</em> - headphones with a slope on the bass, which overshadows other frequencies, but nevertheless the overall balance is maintained well.  The sound is definitely discreet, with chunks of warm sound, which causes a smile and joy on the face.  They have a growling, crumbling bass and it is difficult to consider a minus in their sound.  High show themselves perfectly, but they lack the same clarity and brilliance, as in other models.  Medium is not worse than high. <br><br>  <em>V-Moda M80 -</em> well balanced, spacious and attractive.  Surprisingly balanced headphones, but the upper frequencies are blurred and suffer from a lack of detail;  the lower ones do an excellent job, but with some excessive delay, which is even more pronounced in the middle.  Upper bass loses consistency at high volume, which significantly affects the quality. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> coffee is dark, bitter and hot, but people like it.  Most bass headphones from all presented.  The bass is loud, surround, but sluggish.  Even if a person likes an excessive amount of bass, it‚Äôs not a fact that he likes this model, most likely it will appeal to fatal haters of high frequencies.  There is no vocal at all, and the instrumental sounds seem detached and artificial. <br><br><h2>  Other features </h2><br><h3>  Cost of </h3><br>  <em>The V-Moda M80</em> costs about $ 160 and is the cheapest of the entire set, while the <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> costs about $ 300, but the first ones are only available on request and you will have to add shipping costs to their amount. <br><br>  It is important to note about the <em>Pioneer</em> headphones, - at auctions and online stores, buyers often complained about fake models, where the price was less than $ 200, so buying better is from $ 250. <br><br><h3>  Cable </h3><br>  <em>The Beyerdynamic DT1350 is</em> thin, straight, not very tangled and very light, as well as a 1.5 meter long cord that is perfectly suitable for portable use and cannot be removed.  The standard connector is very beautiful, besides it can withstand a good weight (up to 12 kilograms), according to the official site. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> all as above, but with a two-way connection method. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii (Sennheiser HD25-13-ii) is a</em> standard straight cable that rarely changes on headphones of this brand, quite durable. <br><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 (Pioneer HDJ-2000mod)</em> - thick and twisted cord.  Heavy and uncomfortable for portable use.  Equipped with kink protection on both sides.  Conveniently removed through the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR"><u>XLR connector</u></a> . <br><br>  <em>The V-Moda M80 is a</em> Kevlar two-way cord that holds an iPod control device and a microphone.  The cable is made of high quality and looks at a premium level, but is prone to tangling. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> thin, heavy, one-sided.  When buying, you can choose both straight and twisted cable, twisted as a rule, less entangled. <br><br><h3>  Connector </h3><br>  All have one connector - 3.5 mm.  For all models put adapters on 6.3 mm.  They are also all straight, except for the <em>Beyerdynamic T50p,</em> where the connector is L-shaped (for someone L-shaped), which in my opinion <a href="http://urday.ru/">where to go in Moscow is</a> more convenient and reliable.  The largest jack of the <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> , and the smallest of the <em>V-Moda M80.</em> <br><br><h3>  Ear cushions </h3><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 (Pioneer HDJ-2000mod) -</em> completely fit the ears (although not much, compared to other full-size headphones).  For the street, this option seems the most convenient.  Soft leather ear cushions, do not pressure on the head, do not pull anywhere, but are heavy.  Noise isolation is good for closed-type headphones, but this is not enough among current competitors. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii (Sennheiser HD25-13-ii)</em> - small ear cushions that are located directly on the ears.  When buying, you can choose between leatherette and velor.  Firmly fixed and a little more than usual, put pressure on the ears.  Excellent sound insulation and light weight to the detriment of absolute comfort from use. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 - a</em> bit larger diameter than in the previous model, flatter.  They sit on the ear in exactly the same way as the <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> , but the tension on the head is weaker, which gives more convenience.  The ear cushions are tighter due to the material inside, which increases noise insulation, which is higher in this model than in the previous one. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> new models of these headphones already come with ear pads from the older model.  Older, more roundish, and the smallest among all the headphones in the review.  Downforce does not cause discomfort if you wear them correctly.  It‚Äôs not very convenient to mount on the head and it takes some time for a successful placement: the most important thing is that it‚Äôs very important, because the sound (and insulation) from the position of the headphones is very variable, but finding the point where two characteristics will be combined at the same time is very difficult.  Noise isolation at a height perhaps the best among all models. <br><br>  <em>V-Moda M80 -</em> small and hard cushions, located on the "cups" of hexagonal shape.  They are so narrow that the pressure goes right through the whole ear, and not just at the edges, as in previous models, and, despite its rigidity, it is comfortable in them.  When you change the position on the head, the sound does not change much, the ‚Äúcups‚Äù themselves can rotate along the horizontal axis.  Headphones are half-open, which is of course a plus in sound quality (rich mids and a perceived scene) and a huge minus in soundproofing, so much so that in very windy weather it's hard to enjoy listening. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> incredibly soft and comfortable ear cushions and surprisingly the cheapest.  They do not have rods, but their ears quickly adapt to them.  Together with a moderate clamp, they can be called one of the most convenient earbuds among all the headphones, not just this review.  The noise isolation is rather poor, slightly higher than that of the <em>V-Moda M80.</em> <br><br><h5>  Let's summarize a small [second] result (from best to worst). </h5><br>  <i><b>Clamp</b></i> <br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><i><b>Comfort</b></i></em> <em><br></em>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><i><b>Noise isolation</b></i></em> <em><br></em>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> <br><br><h3>  Headband </h3><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii (Sennheiser HD25-13-ii) -</em> headband separation increases downforce.  Outwardly it may seem that this is overweight, but in fact it is not, the headband is the lightest part of the headphones.  The sliding mechanism keeps safely on the head, is regulated very simply.  One earpiece can be turned upwards, which will be useful for DJs. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50 - a</em> similar dual mechanism allows you to hold the headphones on the head a little worse than the <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> and this is due in the first to the very large weight of these headphones.  The ‚Äúcups‚Äù as well as the <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii are</em> moving apart, but this is done less smoothly.  In addition to the benefits for DJs there are no pluses, perhaps the engineers know more, but this design only causes problems.  The headband itself is not very bent and has a peculiar shape, so that people with a lot of hair, as well as with a roundish and large head (like me) will be a little uncomfortable. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p - the</em> design does not move apart.  "Cups" as in <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> can not be rotated.  It really just makes it all easy.  Headphones are better regulated, and when they are already on the head, you feel the reliability of attachment and solidity of the structure.  The headband, as in the older model, bends poorly, but in general the design is more comfortable. <br><br>  <em>The Pioneer HDJ-2000 (Pioneer HDJ-2000mod)</em> is a very narrow headband, which seems very strange for full-size headphones, but from an aesthetic point of view it raises them above the competition.  As <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 "</em> cups <em>"</em> exert pressure in the temples.  Adjusting the position on the head thanks to the sliding and soft headband material is comfortable. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80 -</em> very dense, reliable headband.  It seems that it is the most suitable for survival with the active and long-term use of headphones.  Very nice and comfortable to sit on the head, albeit with a gap in the ear. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> headband made from a metal arc covered with rubber.  The material with which the headband is usually filled is absent, which creates tension (and with time, pain) directly on the crown of the head.  The slider mechanism is reminiscent of <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii,</em> but with a large (two times) pitch adjustment, which reduces the level of convenience due to the lack of a more precise size setting. <br><br><h3>  Portability </h3><br>  All models can be used as portable, although with some it will be more difficult.  For example, the cords from <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> and <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii headphones are</em> bulky and inconvenient, but fortunately removable and easily change to other options.  The best portable cords for models from <em>Beyerdynamic.</em> <br>  Models from <em>Beyerdynamic are</em> easy to wear around the neck, they fold perfectly.  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> do not fold in anyway, also small in order to be worn around the neck.  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> can be folded in a special way and worn at the back by turning the ‚Äúcups‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Reliability </h3><br>  Headphones from <em>Sennheiser are</em> well known for the fact that all their elements are easily replaced and in case of breakage, you can buy something and repair it yourself without making any special problems.  Assembling all the headphones at the height, but the products from <em>Beyerdynamic</em> seem to be more fragile and they will have to be more careful. <br><br><h3>  Case </h3><br>  <em>Sennheiser</em> and <em>Pioneer</em> come with a small laced bag. From <em>Beyerdynamic, the</em> buyer gets a better leather case.  The <em>V-Moda M80 has</em> a fantastic hard case with a company logo, with pockets and shoulder straps inside to fold several types of cables and accessories, apparently earphones from this manufacturer are paying too much aesthetic and ergonomic attention. <br><br><h5>  Let's summarize a small [third] result (from best to worst). </h5><br>  <i><b>Portability</b></i> <br>  <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><i><b>Reliability</b></i></em> <em><br></em>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii (Sennheiser HD25-13-ii) -</em> all the details of headphones from typical industrial materials, not low, but not high.  It is very difficult to select something, everything is trivial and trivial, many have already become boring.  On the head, they do not look compact (although portable) with a gap, which is unusual. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 (Beyerdynamic T50p) - the</em> headband for the worse is different from the rest of the headphone components, in general, the situation is better than that of the <em>Sennheiser</em> .  Small antennas on the head, too, look very funny, but will only interfere with very complex people. <br><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 - the</em> average quality of materials.  Low landing, modest and typical appearance outside. <br><br>  <em>The V-Moda M80</em> is above average, looks cute and definitely attracts attention. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 - the</em> quality of materials is very similar to the models from <em>Sennheiser, they</em> look more cumbersome. <br><br><h3>  Brief comparison of models </h3><br>  <i><b>Pioneer HDJ-2000 vs Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</b></i> <br><ul><li>  The model from <em>Sennheiser</em> concentrates power at low and high frequencies, which gives more vibrancy, while the <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> spreads these frequencies over a wider range. </li><li>  <em>Pioneer</em> has stronger mids and vocals. </li><li>  In <em>Pioneer, the</em> length of the high frequencies is better, but there is no shine and clarity. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Pioneer HDJ-2000 vs Beyerdynamic DT1350</b></i> <br><ul><li>  The <em>pioneer</em> bass is freer and more agressive, while at <em>Beyerdynamic</em> it is cleaner and more polite. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii vs Beyerdynamic DT1350</b></i> <br><ul><li>  Transitions between frequency ranges are better with <em>Beyerdynamic.</em> <br>  Comfort is better with <em>Beyerdynamic,</em> insulation is slightly better. </li><li>  <em>Sennheiser</em> easily win in volume and durability. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Pioneer HDJ-2000 vs Beyerdynamic T50</b></i> <br><ul><li>  It is difficult to compare the ogre and the gnome. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii vs Beyerdynamic T50</b></i> <br><ul><li>  In simple words, in the first there are more "chchchch ...", and in the second, "ssss ...". </li><li>  <em>Sennheiser has</em> clear top bass. </li><li>  In <em>Beyerdynamic, the</em> middle is bugged worse. </li><li>  <em>Beyerdynamic</em> more bold and rectilinear. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Beyerdynamic DT1350 vs Beyerdynamic T50</b></i> <br><ul><li>  The <em>DT1350 has a</em> lot less whistle. </li><li>  The <em>DT1350 is</em> much better bass, but worse top bass. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii vs Sennheiser HD25-13-ii</b></i> <br><ul><li>  In the <em>HD25-13-ii</em> there is a slight improvement in the length of the low frequencies. </li><li>  The width of the sound stage is higher with <em>HD25-13-ii.</em> <br>  Excessive sound peaks are much stronger in <em>HD25-1-ii,</em> more control in <em>HD25-13-ii</em> . </li><li>  Lamp sound is more in <em>HD25-13-ii.</em> <br>  Medium less deep in <em>HD25-13-ii.</em> <br></li></ul><br>  <i><b>V-Moda M80 vs Beyerdynamic DT1350</b></i> <br><ul><li>  And there, and there is an excellent balance across the spectrum. </li><li>  <em>M80</em> more bass </li><li>  <em>Beyerdynamic</em> greatly benefits in terms of high frequencies and their brightness. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>V-Moda M80 vs Beyerdynamic T50</b></i> <br><ul><li>  Have a similar texture. </li><li>  The <em>T50 has</em> more low-quality low frequencies. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>V-Moda M80 vs Pioneer HDJ-2000</b></i> <br><ul><li>  A decent scene and good high frequency control is available on both models. </li><li>  In the <em>M80, the</em> mids are more pronounced, the low ones less. </li><li>  <em>Pioneer has a</em> warm tube sound. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>AiAiAi TMA-1 vs Beyerdynamic DT1350</b></i> <br><ul><li>  <em>DT1350 copes</em> well with vocals, but worse with instruments, the <em>TMA-1</em> <em>does the</em> opposite. </li><li>  <em>Beyerdynamic</em> whisper with <em>high</em> frequencies, in response to <em>TMA-1,</em> where they are deep and slow. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>AiAiAi TMA-1 vs Beyerdynamic DT50</b></i> <br><ul><li>  It is difficult to sravivat "Hulk" and "Sponge Bob: square pants." </li></ul><br>  <i><b>AiAiAi TMA-1 vs Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</b></i> <br><ul><li>  Clear bass from <em>Sennheiser</em> instead of blurry noise. </li><li>  Bright and clean high in return for blurry noise. </li><li>  Slightly recessed scene in the middle instead of a blurry noise. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>V-Moda M80 vs V-Moda M80mod</b></i> <br><ul><li>  In the modification there is a decrease in bass, less distortion. </li><li>  Loss of medium, increase in high frequencies. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Sound stage </h3><br>  The definition needs to be understood literally.  The stage in the headphones shows the apparent size of the musical sound.  If you come to the concert, stand in front of the soloist and close your eyes, you will feel the musicians and the acoustic space of the concert hall.  In headphones, ideally, should be the same.  The three-dimensional image of the acoustic space should not leave the listener for a second.  Similar things are done when recording a composition, but mainly the quality of its reproduction depends on the equipment. <br><br>  None of the presented headphones are suitable for the qualitative sensation of the scene.  <em>The Beyerdynamic T50p</em> and <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000,</em> although they stand out among the competitors, are not enough. <br><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 -</em> large ‚Äúcups‚Äù create a feeling of depth, no more. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> strong mid and high frequencies are more consistent in these headphones, which expands the scene and makes it even larger than the <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350 -</em> not bad, but nothing special. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii - the</em> scene is a bit limited compared to other headphones. <br>  <em>V-Moda M80 is a</em> nice, spacious half-open stage that is too blurred. <br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 -</em> deep medium and high kill the entire potentially possible scene. <br><br><h5>  Let's summarize a small [fourth] result (from best to worst). </h5><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000</em> ‚Üí <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000mod</em> ‚Üí <em>V-Moda M80</em> ‚Üí <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350</em> ‚Üí <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii</em> ‚Üí <em>AiAiAi TMA-1.</em> <br><br><h3>  Compatibility with genres and instruments </h3><br>  Beyerdynamic DT1350 - the violin sounds amazing, the vocals (mostly operatic) also sound very good and this is the best sound from the whole set.  Other instrumental music, jazz and acoustic compositions sound less qualitatively (but also very well).  Sterile sound with electronic and artificial instruments. <br><br>  <em>Pioneer HDJ-2000 - a</em> fantastic cello, rich and rich;  brass instruments do not fail.  Blues guitar leaves an impression.  The balanced balance and a good scene allow you to listen to completely different genres of music on these headphones. <br><br>  <em>Beyerdynamic T50p -</em> wooden instruments play beautifully, the flute pleases.  Wind instruments sound strong, but not as shrill as in the <em>Beyerdynamic DT1350.</em>  Very clean vocals.  Weak drums, the guitar is sometimes too bright.  The sound of the orchestra is mixed, but individual folk and acoustic recordings sound good. <br><br>  <em>Sennheiser HD25-1-ii is a</em> great choice for classical music in general.  Rock and metal are almost as good, guitars and drums sound unforgettable.  At mid frequencies, the instrumental series is similar to the <em>Beyerdynamic T50p.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>V-Moda M80 -</em> capable of all genres, wind instruments stand out, a little worse than stringed instruments, but they feel a certain spaciousness.  Guitars and vocals in the list of quality just below. <br><br>  <em>AiAiAi TMA-1 is a</em> mediocre instrument for listening to music, artificial high-frequency music will sound good. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  And it will not, all the details above - the choice is yours. <br><br>  The original is <a href="http://www.head-fi.org/t/574617/review-comparison-beyerdynamic-dt1350-t50p-sennheiser-hd25-1-ii-hd25-13-ii-pioneer-hdj-2000-v-moda-m80-aiaiai-tma-1">here</a> .
