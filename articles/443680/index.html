  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Four-day work week. Russian experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  This article prompted me to write a wonderful story, as one New Zealand company worked <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441118/">for</a> 8 weeks <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441118/">with three days off</a> .  And as we are proud of them. <br><br><h4>  Context </h4><br>  Last time, I‚Äôm worried about this topic: how can you not become a human-eating corporation from an excellent turquoise team?  Still worry toxic teams, professional burnout and the achievement of happiness.  In labor. <br><br>  We figure out how to manage this and the first tests and experiments, of course, we put on ourselves.  Obviously: we are engaged in HR in IT.

    <h4>  so </h4><br>  <u>Experiment: four-day work week.</u> <br><br>  Place actions: Moscow and Kiev.  Distributed team. <br>  Intellectual work.  Self-sustaining commercial company. <br>  Duration of the experiment: more than 100 employee-years. <br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prerequisites </h4><br>  First, personal and honest: I am cyclical. <br>  I can spark two days.  On the third - I can hardly speak. <br>  Not treated.  Constructive feature. <br>  Observing colleagues and client groups shows that very few people of creative work are able to produce even efficiency. <br>  And not everybody has a weekly cycle: five through two. <br><br>  Therefore, the first task is to adjust the work schedule under the biorhythm. <br><br>  The second task is to reduce the likelihood of professional burnout, that is, not to bring stress to chronic.  Effective staff is not enough - to grow them for a long time. <br><br>  And in general, they are nice people. <br><br>  The third task.  Make pauses in communication.  Any team - annoying.  Family weekends rarely leave room for solitude.  And not every introvert is an extrovert. <br><br>  The fourth task.  Do not walk build.  Those walking around the building have slender thoughts.  We also need - different and creative.  Therefore, we create an opportunity for employees to sometimes not go about their ranks.  And how they will dispose of it - their business. <br><br>  The last task.  Get rid of the "scraps". <br><br>  It is clear that one cannot do without visiting a public office during working hours.  Especially for women, especially if there are children.  So let it be time to visit such places.  Or games with children. <br><br>  As you understand, under the pressure of such arguments could not stand and - decided. <br><br><h4>  rules </h4><br>  The rules that we set for ourselves have changed and improved. <br>  I give the latest working version. <br><br>  1. A four-day work week for those who have worked for over a year. <br><br>  Comment: for the year it is clear that people fit into our rhythm and technology. <br>  And if it does not fit in, then it is no longer ours.  The year is often the starting point for burnout. <br>  A year later, people want some kind of preference. <br>  But no caste and division into management and performers or whatever. <br><br>  2. You can not work any day except Monday. <br><br>  We have a weekly sprint.  And all meetings are held on Monday. <br>  And one more guarantee that everyone will finish the weekend on time. <br>  We know: on Monday the most important thing is to start. <br><br>  3. You can change your day, but in advance.  Very advance.  For two weeks. <br>  Colleagues who plan to use you in their tasks should have time to restructure. <br><br>  4. In the "non-working" working day - you have to work. <br>  At least half a day.  Do not need anymore.  And be in touch all day. <br>  It works like this: everyone knows - he is in touch.  Mail sees.  Need to call. <br>  And they did not call themselves for no reason. <br><br>  5. If the week was short in itself - due to the production calendar - then ‚Äúfreemen‚Äù was canceled. <br><br>  There is another logic: in the short week the competitors went into office sleep mode - which means that the odds should be used.  Enjoyed. <br><br>  Of course, salaries, bonuses and other cookies had no effect. <br><br>  It's all.  Simple, understandable, transparent.  (And only half a year was spent on tuning the rules). <br><br><h4>  How it works </h4><br>  For me.  Personally and personally. <br><br>  I took myself Wednesday.  And that means - two mini-sprints for two days, for which you do not pay too much with your health, even if two days are at a very high rate. <br><br>  Now imagine: you can walk with your child to museums, when there is no one in them, you can ride on free slopes, you can swim on deserted beaches ... <br>  And you can safely work on a large document and think about the eternal. <br><br>  Yes, customers, hearing the singing of the nightingale in the tube - envied.  And we have them - they seduced. <br>  From the way of office and slim.  Another standard of living.  And the pleasure of it. <br><br>  On employees, it worked like this: <br><br>  People really worked out their half day.  Note: without control.  In touch were.  Mail looked.  Cloud services used.  Customers are not dynamic. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  Periods of group procrastination decreased.  Dramatically. <br><br>  In a normal office on a five-day week, Monday morning, after lunch, Fridays, an hour upon arrival and an hour before leaving is absolutely not a productive time. <br><br>  According to our measurements, the average loss (in a non-toxic) office team is about 10 hours per week.  For everyone. <br><br>  That is: at the declaration of the 40-hour week, the staff usually works 30 hours. <br><br>  When we declare the 36 hour week, we get about the same 30 hours. <br>  And another quality of life, or "work-life balance." <br><br>  Revenue, profitability and customer satisfaction did not fall. <br><br>  Requests (with very few exceptions) are over. <br>  Goals achieved. <br><br><h4>  Three more points </h4><br><ol><li>  Some employees did not use this privilege.  For different reasons. </li><li>  When the next crises occurred in our economy, we decided to return to the normal five-day period.  But they could not.  Perhaps this is the main disadvantage of the described approach. </li><li>  Resigning from such a schedule, as you know, harder.  Therefore, the turnover has become less. </li><li>  People suffered and suffered.  Joke. </li></ol><br>  This ends the first story about the ‚Äúfifth paradigm‚Äù.  About happiness in labor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443680/</a></p>
