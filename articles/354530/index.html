So with the penetration of new technologies into the artistic environment, the phenomenon of ‚Äúdigital art‚Äù emerged.  It would seem that a new, more perfect form has turned out, what else can art give, what is it needed in the IT industry. <br><br>  If you are interested in reflecting on this topic with me, continue under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n_/ph/g5/n_phg58clmfqkz-0yjs_8lxutiq.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why did the great scientists combine their scientific career with art?

      Leonardo da Vinci was at the same time an artist, an architect, a musician, a mathematician, a mechanic, an anatomist and a geologist. <br><br>  Albert Einstein played the violin and the piano.  He played a few notes, wrote something down and returned to his scientific work. <br><br>  Nobel laureate, American physicist Richard Feynman, the creator of quantum electrodynamics, played the drum and studied painting. <br><br>  Microbiologist Hilary Koprowski, who created the polio vaccine, played the piano and composed. <br><br>  Back in the Soviet years, scientists in the field of neurophysiology were studying the influence of creativity on the human brain.  Abroad, this topic was picked up by such adepts as Michael Gazzing and Cheslav Milo≈°.  What were they talking about?  It is believed that no more than 10% of brain cells are involved in a person‚Äôs brain during life, while scientists have proven that the brain, which uses 5-7% of cells, is a person‚Äôs brain that doesn‚Äôt solve complex tasks and does not engage in creative activity. . <br><br>  Creative work - playing musical instruments, painting, writing poetry - involves almost 100% of brain activity, but not at once, but in turn, in groups, like lights of a Christmas tree garland.  Art includes areas involving a variety of processes - and analytical activities, and memory, and emotions.  No wonder the ancient Greeks considered poetry, music and theater one of the most important components of human life. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúArt, like any non-working activity, does not directly affect the work of a specialist, however, it provides grain for discussions with colleagues, thereby strengthening the team,‚Äù</i> mobile application developer <br></blockquote><br>  When we admire the paintings, regardless of who they are written by, the Russian peredvizhniki or French impressionists, the occipital part of the cerebral cortex is activated.  When we listen to Rachmaninov‚Äôs Third Symphony or Scorpions album, the temporal lobes are stimulated, and when we read Akunin‚Äôs last novel, the neural network of the frontal lobes.  When we ourselves play the guitar, write a picture or compose a poem, the brain works even more intensively.  When we take paints and start mixing them before we start painting a picture, memory, attention, motor skills, emotions, abstract thinking, everything is involved in complex work. <br><br>  For most of us, it seems that art is useless, as we appreciate the changes taking place in the outside world.  And what is most important is what happens in the inner world - in our brain.  Sometimes it seems that writing a still life is not as useful as solving a complex mathematical equation.  But it turns out that thanks to art, the brain concentrates faster and better.  In addition, during the occupation of art areas are activated in the structures of the hypothalamus, affecting the endocrine system, which is directly related to the aging process. <br><br>  People like ready-made recipes.  How often do you say: ‚ÄúWell, okay, I understand, but you say - how?  How easy is it to write a new code? Or ‚ÄúHow is a house built?‚Äù We, and especially animals, are subject to stereotypical thinking.  We do not need to re-solve standard tasks every time.  But during stereotypical thinking, the brain is like an abandoned village.  Creativity helps to break through stereotypes, to involve a greater number of nerve cells in the brain.  So the brain learns non-stereotypical activity.  The task, which yesterday seemed impossible, becomes solvable.  New opportunities are opening up. <br><br>  It is important in life to set up complex super-tasks for oneself and learn how to solve them not by stereotype.  When solving super-tasks, new connections are formed in the brain and new neurons are formed - nerve cells.  Emerging neural networks begin to work and maintain not only a good intellectual form, but also affect many processes in the body.  A working brain is better able to cope even with the effects of a stroke.  Brain structures that are activated when solving a creative task develop memory, speech, orientation in time and space.  At the same time, they also affect physiological processes. <br><br>  The famous American composer, writer and pianist Leonard Bernstein, in the 80s of the twentieth century, founded a new teaching method - Artful Learning - learning, including physics and mathematics, through art.  Now, according to his creative standard, 43 schools are successfully operating, in which teachers through creativity try to activate analytical thinking in children.  This technique is not yet so popular in the world, but it is slowly and surely winning hearts. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúPainting broadens the mind, leads a person into some other space, another dimension, if we are not talking about salon painting, but more free and highly artistic.</i>  <i>Painting cannot be regarded as a visual sight, it is its own philosophy, its own vision of the external world.</i>  <i>If we are talking about a technician who spends a lot of time at the computer, he certainly has his own philosophy, he looks at the world through the window of this computer.</i>  <i>And painting for him can be an interesting conductor from one dimension to another, where he will be able to look through the window through the eye of the artist, ‚Äù</i> Ashot Kirakosyan, artist, Member of the Moscow Union of Artists </blockquote><br>  Everyone knows the long-standing controversy of physicists and lyricists about the importance of science and culture for the formation of the holistic consciousness of man.  Maybe they are arguing in vain, then how should we communicate and learn from each other more closely?  Learn to experiment and model through sensual comprehension of reality?  When I asked this question to my colleagues, I received an ambiguous answer about the professional deformation of the developer and his perception of art and understanding of what is actually considered art.  Techie every day engaged in analytical activities.  And if he remembers what he liked to do in childhood?  To draw tanchiki on math lessons, to pick up chords on a guitar, to write poems?  Will dust be blown away from forgotten hobbies and easily and naturally discover new ways and opportunities?  Maybe then the question of deformation will not arise.  What do you think? <br><br>  Get involved in the dialogue, let's discuss the role of art in the life of IT in the comments on the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354530/</a></p>
