  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skylink and Friday 13</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year I decided to get a modem from Skylink.  Having come to their office, I learned that they had an action of unprecedented generosity: a modem worth 2770 rubles.  can be obtained in just 1000r.  The essence of the action is very simple. <br><br><ul><li>  We pay for the modem 1000r. </li><li>  Choose one of the three tariff plans (I chose the easiest for 390r.) </li><li>  We pay the specified number of months (in my case it was 6 months) for the Internet into two accounts: the first bill to pay by installments by modem (in my case, it went 5m for 300r. And one 270r.), And the second - to pay for the Internet ( 5 months for 90. and 1 for 120.). </li><li>  After this period, all payments go only to the second account. </li></ul><br>  That is, the conditions are very attractive - nothing foreshadowed trouble, except for the fact that it was ‚ÄúFriday 13th‚Äù (May 13, 2011). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I didn‚Äôt have time to use the miracle of technology for just a couple of days, as the Internet died: it didn‚Äôt connect, returning error 678. Without thinking twice, I decided to call for support. <br><br><blockquote>  In support they work just great people.  I probably have not seen such a symbiosis of incompetence and laziness.  They can not clearly answer the questions, something to suggest, too.  A couple of times I encountered the trick: ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll see what you have there and call you back‚Äù - naturally, no one ever called back.  It was even such that at my request: ‚ÄúTell me how much money I have in my account‚Äù, they answered me: ‚ÄúOh, you know, I need to open another window for this.‚Äù  In general, sincere people. <br></blockquote><br>  The girl, I don‚Äôt remember, with a pleasant voice or not, told me that you probably have something with a computer and need to reinstall the drivers, windows ... In general, they have nothing to do with the fool himself.  Naturally, there was no problem with firewood or windows - everything was much more prosaic.  On the Internet, we managed to find out that error 678 means ‚Äúthere is no money in the account‚Äù.  What, as it were not normal, because everything was paid.

      When free time appeared, I decided to visit the office again and solve this incomprehensible problem.  Through lengthy research and attempts to prove to me that I want to throw them and used the Internet for the whole month, and now I assert that he did not work for me, we found out that the payment was received not on my personal account, but in the name of another subscriber.  With a sense of accomplishment, I received a new receipt for the first payment already for 06.23.2011 and I thought that was all.  But it was not there. <br><br>  Two months later I saw in one of the receipts that I was charged a penalty of $ 800.  Stunned by the hot summer and already cursing the skylink, I went on another crusade.  In the course of a brief skirmish with one of the managers, I managed to find out that, it turns out, I did not pay in one of the months - and this despite the fact that I paid for everything that came from them.  It‚Äôs good, though, that I still have all their forms, with whom I once again visited them and went (well, as I went, I stood in the queue for 1.5 hours and went) straight to that girl, with whom I solved the problem 06.23.2011.  Reminding her of the whole story and having received an affirmative answer from her that she remembers her perfectly, and as soon as the first bill is fully paid off (5 months at 300 rubles and the last month is 270 rubles), she will write off all the penalties from me, because it is their mistake , not my fault.  Without thinking twice, I asked me to write out a receipt for everything that I still have to pay (it was already 10.2011) in order to quickly get rid of them.  She wrote me a receipt for 270r., Which I immediately paid.  Well, naturally I thought that was all, besides, the payment for 270r.  last. <br><br>  As everything, next month I again received a receipt from them with all the same interest and I receive it to this day.  And recently, my friend, to whom I advised to use their action, when it still seemed like a good idea, also started having problems with the account.  We decided to collectively go and fix all the problems at once. <br><br>  During this tour, we managed to find out that it turns out that the money can be received by the wrong person, that the mail does not carry receipts on time and this is our problem.  And nothing that we physically can not pay on time - they charge interest on the account.  And of course bureaucracy in all its glory: write a statement, and then come again, and so on.  etc. <br><br>  Having already arrived home and having considered everything, I found out that it turns out that I had one more payment for 300 rubles.  - because of what a reasonable question arises.  Why I wrote a payment on 270r.  when I had another payment for 300 rub.  And given that I wanted to pay the entire balance at once, it becomes completely unclear.  Why! <br><br>  In general, a strange office of action of which does not color it at all, but rather, on the contrary, kills all trust in them. <br><br>  PS ‚ÄúRostelecom‚Äù is written on the forms, so it‚Äôs not completely clear who is to blame and what to do.  One thing is clear for sure - skylink or their partners are responsible for all this adventure. <br><br>  PPS Has anyone written a statement to the Consumer Protection Society?  I would like to know if such a statement threatens at least with some checks, and who can give an example of such a statement. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141341/</a></p>
