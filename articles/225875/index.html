Development and implementation of software products is carried out mainly in the territory of the Saratov region (customers are factories, large and small industrial and commercial enterprises, individual entrepreneurs), work on the creation of regulatory acts is carried out mainly in the regions of state customers: Smolensk region, Pskov region, Tverskaya Region, Kaluga Region, Moscow.  In 2008  For the first time, we are acutely marked with two problems in working with public procurement: the <b>impossibility of high-quality consolidated search</b> (all tenders are published on their state portals, a single website for public procurement will appear only after three years) companies that analyze the market use either the services of consulting companies or hold whole departments for these purposes).  The year ends with the signing of a one-year contract with the IA Trade.Su, big promises from the staff of this organization, and expectations of a successful business in government procurement.

      <b>2009 - 2010</b> <br><br>  Positive expectations are quickly replaced by disappointment: the necessary purchases are not fully sought, the interface of the acquired resource ‚Äúeats‚Äù time and nerves, the need for analytics of our participation in public procurement is growing, and a reasonable solution to this issue is missing as a fact.  The presence of a strong IT department and the active position of the company becomes a good basis for making a non-standard decision: we will create the best tools in Russia for searching and analyzing public procurement. <br>  In the middle of 2009, a detailed analysis of all existing Russian tender systems is carried out, a technical task is being written.  The main features that created the difference were both in our interface concept <i>(we touch on this in more detail in the blog) and the search engine Sphinx adapted for the project (later the programmers promised to share their work, and now in our indices about 15 million documents, and the project on such an array shows a good speed)</i> .  At the beginning of the project in operation - two rented servers.  In July 2010, the first launch of a still free service takes place with the provision of information on public procurement in the Saratov, Samara and Penza regions.  There is a debugging of the main functionality of the system. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>2011</b> <br><br>  This year becomes for the company the most successful, the most important and the most difficult at the same time.  The appearance of a single all-Russian website of public procurement in Russia (zakupki.gov.ru) greatly simplifies the data collection process (there is no need to collect purchases from each regional portal separately), but it does not make the work of suppliers-participants of public procurement easier and more convenient.  200 million rubles poured into the EP (All-Russian official website), are unable to provide the normal performance of the site as a whole, and its modules separately. <br>  The first three quarters of the service <a href="http://www.ist-budget.ru/tenders">www.ist-budget.ru/tenders</a> continues its non-commercial existence, gradually acquiring its new users;  in November - announces the launch of the commercial version.  In fact, the commercial version becomes the free version of the past tense, to which everyone is accustomed, and the new free version acquires a number of restrictions that do not interfere with working with service tools, but cause significant inconvenience.  The gradual growth of resource users increases the workload, therefore, two more servers are taken for rent and the analytical unit is ‚Äúdoped‚Äù.  The main differences between IST-Budget and OOS are already visible at the initial stage: the presence of full-text search, high speed of work, the absence of lengthy ‚Äúmaintenance work‚Äù, the availability of analytical tools: the forecast of likely participants and tender winner, full reports on the state order participants: Suppliers and Customers .  The development of the procurement management module of the Tender project is being completed, where, according to all laws of the cloud services genre, companies are offered the opportunity to work on any array of added tenders in a single information space, distributing tasks to employees, group work with documents, group chat with reference to each tender etc.  A review of this tool in a corporate blog is a holy cause.  The year ends with a calculation, though not very large (~ 300,000 rubles), but the first revenue.  And the first revenue, you know, is like the first wedding night :-), now of course it looks very funny, but then it was the first feedback. <br><br>  <b>2012-2013</b> <br><br>  At the beginning of the year, the total amount of money invested in the project before the start of the commercial version is ~ 5 million rubles (this is 2.5% of the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the environment), and two priority tasks are defined: active development of the service (here: developing new products , increase the audience of the resource, advertising campaigns) and reach the level of self-sufficiency.  In July 2012, the first major contract is signed with a well-known foreign supplier of medical equipment.  At about the same time, good partnership and friendly relations are established with the largest public procurement consulting portal, Tenders.ru.  The number of regular customers is growing every month, albeit not at a super-fast pace, and with the customers - the company's profits.  The results of 2012 were: total revenue of 7 million rubles, 500 new customers, two newly acquired servers (the rent is gradually being phased out in favor of using our own equipment, now we barely fit on 8 servers), signed partnership agreements with brokers, providing financial services.  The company employs 10 people. <br>  In 2013, a lot of time and resources are spent on the "move" from the old version of the EP site to the new one, and all so that in January 2014 (antirespect lawmakers and EOS developers!) Do this work again.  In July 2013, the company participates in the project ‚ÄúFor Fair Purchases‚Äù under the auspices of the Popular Front, having developed a technology for determining corruption procurement that originally appeared in our additional non-commercial project Roskartel (http://www.roskartel.ru/).  In the third quarter of 2013, the technical department completely recycles the main program part of the resource: the search becomes even better, the speed increases.  Throughout the whole year, there is an active correspondence with OOS tech support, competitors' websites are being closely studied (in some places obvious plagiarism is found).  It would be foolish to say that everything goes perfectly and without jambs.  A certain part of the time is spent on working with claims, on ‚Äúextinguishing fires‚Äù, but it is this component that helps us to make our service better by ‚Äúcuring‚Äù it from shortcomings.  The result of this path is a team that has grown from 10 to 30 people, profits that surpassed all expectations, 1500 new customers, good ideas in the development of new services for public procurement, and confidence in the future prospects of our project.  Here comes the understanding that the IST-Budget service took place as an independent, self-sustaining project and laid the first ‚Äústones‚Äù at the base of two new projects: legal and social. <br><br>  <b>2014</b> <br><br>  The beginning of the current year, for us, can be easily compared with the martial law: the law on the contract system comes into force, the environmental protection policy is subject to global processing online.  Constant hourly surveillance of the official site orderly ruffled nerves.  And what else can be done when the environmental protection developers ‚Äúupdate‚Äù the site almost daily, data collection by parsers becomes impossible, and as a result, the data can be collected much later from ftp, having lost its relevance.  However, by the beginning of March 2014, the situation becomes more or less stable, and the company returns to its priorities: attracting new customers, working with the ‚Äúold‚Äù audience, refining existing products, and brainstorming to create new and fresh.  The resource functionality has been improved: the ability to search by the registry of contracts, by the procurement plans, by the registry of unscrupulous suppliers has been added.  Much attention is paid to advancement in search engines.  From household trifles: repaired the office, purchased furniture, we are preparing for a thorough expansion of the public procurement market, there is still work and work. <br>  The story does not end there.  In general, there is a feeling that everything is just beginning.  Every day of the work process is new discoveries, new people, new highs and, sometimes, falls.  The article is introductory, general.  Further there will be more specifics and a lot of interesting things. <br>  And the final thought is very important for us: the IST-Budget project in 2014 does not just work to pay for itself and bring profit to the owners, which is not bad at all, but also gradually invests in new projects: with money, time, human and mental resources. <br><br>  The current year was the year of the birth of a new company concept, in a word, it can be described as ‚Äúmulti-design‚Äù.  More fully, this idea can be expressed as follows: an IT company should have several projects, with its own teams, budget and working conditions;  at the moment of exacerbation of some problems of one of the projects, resources from other areas are attracted, thus avoiding the unpleasant effects of the crisis.  Of course, we will tell you more about our projects a bit later, including with the words of our technical experts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225875/</a></p>
