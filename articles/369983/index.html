In the comments to the <a href="https//geektimes.ru/company/pocketbook/blog/281980/">post</a> dedicated to <a href="http://www.pocketbook-int.com/ru/store/products/pocketbook-631-touch-hd%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%2B%26utm_medium%3Dobzor%26utm_campaign%3Dpocket_kindle">PocketBook 631 Touch HD</a> , I promised to compare this reader with one of the models of Amazon Kindle.  And in the process of explaining why when choosing a reader in Russian conditions, I prefer PocketBook.  Actually, in this material I will fulfill the promise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/407/917/032/407917032e464b39a0f92f7dc20dff15.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But for starters, a couple of explanations to all those who consider me a frantic and blind PocketBook fan (there were similar comments on recent posts, and many) that do not recognize devices for reading other brands.  First, I have no negativity towards Amazon.  And I readily believe that these are quite high-quality readers.  Moreover, I do not believe, but I know, since I dealt with them.  However, I have several "but" in relation to them.  The first is poor compliance with Russian realities.  Yes, I first of all speak about the support of book formats, but not only about them.  Ordering a Kindle to Russia is not as easy as it sounds.  Now for this it is necessary to use one of the numerous intermediary firms, whereas - I read about it on the Internet - it will not be possible to order a device to a direct Russian address.  I did not believe it and tried it myself.  I finally got a message from Amazon:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d43/f58/0d1/d43f580d1cab4d8590f5267b5f6fd34a.jpg"><br><br>  Once again: if you live in the USA, you can safely take the Amazon Kindle - this is a great option for the local market, where there are no problems with payment and delivery, and you can buy all the necessary literature on the same Amazon in a couple of clicks.  I really think so: a couple of years ago, my own aunt, who has been living in San Diego since 1992, found out about the existence of readers and asked me to advise her on such a thing.  I decided to give her a reading room and transferred the amount necessary for the purchase, advising me to buy a Kindle (which she did).  And this is despite the fact that a couple of months after the request, my aunt was planning a visit to the Russian Federation, where I could easily hand her the same PocketBook.  This is because situations are different, and I do not think that buying a ‚ÄúPocket‚Äù is justified in 100% of cases.  In Russia, the optimal choice is PocketBook, in the USA Kindle is optimal. <br><br>  However, I‚Äôm in Russia, where buying Kindle Paperwhite 2015 without ads on Amazon.com for the official $ 140 (about 9,000 rubles at the current rate) will not work.  Considering the situation described at the very beginning, you will also have to pay an intermediary with a US address.  I will not understand in detail the question of how much it costs - a cursory analysis showed that you can specify the number ‚Äú1,000 rubles‚Äù and not make a big mistake.  Well, or you can take Kindle Paperwhite 2015 already in Russia from resellers.  In this case, you will have to pay 11 thousand rubles.  Approximately 9,000 are asked for the version with advertising, but I do not take it into account.  In PocketBook 631 Touch HD, there is no advertising, and therefore it is correct to compare with the version of "Kindle" without displaying ads. <br><br>  And yes, I will immediately answer the question - why it was decided to take Kindle Paperwhite 2015 exactly. And because this particular model is the most popular among Russians.  Where does the information come from?  Well, of course, there is no official data on Kindle sales in the Russian Federation, and third-party analysts haven‚Äôt considered the reader‚Äôs market for a very long time - it‚Äôs more interesting for them in recent years to check how much Samsung has grown / grown and what are the successes of the new iPhones.  Inquiries at Yandex tell about the popularity of Kindle Paperwhite, as Russians most often search for this particular model. <br><br>  Well, if so, then we will compare Paperwhite 2015 and PocketBook 631 Touch HD. <br><br><h2>  Screens </h2><br>  On paper everything is almost the same: 6 inches and E Ink Carta, and the resolution is actually the same - 300 ppi (1448 x 1072 points in PocketBook and 1440 x 1080 in Kindle, which does not make any difference in practice). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/c61/c95/717c61c95f67498e89ab5ae0df1d6586.jpg"><br><br>  The PocketBook 631 Touch HD uses an infrared touchscreen, which has fewer layers than the capacitive one - just the capacitive screen we see Kindle Paperwhite 2015. The downside to using the ‚Äúinfrared‚Äù is that the display in the PocketBook is recessed deeper into the front panel of the case that gives higher bumpers.  But the image quality is a bit higher in PocketBook 631 Touch HD - apparently, due to the smaller number of layers in the screen.  Well, here I will note that I did not notice any difference in the quality of processing clicks.  With the Kindle Paperwhite 2015, it responds well to the fingers that the PocketBook 631 Touch HD.  Scold readers not for that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08c/fed/f47/08cfedf4787b425ab1448888a818ca9f.jpg"><br><br>  Illumination, as I said, is in both models.  Its maximum brightness is comparable, the uniformity - too.  That is, neither PocketBook nor Kindle has any annoying highlights or, on the contrary, unfinished stains.  It surprised me more.  For some reason, in Kindle Paperwhite 2015, the backlight cannot be completely turned off, it always works (that is, instead of turning off, you can set only the minimum brightness).  Surely the developers from Amazon were inspired by the laws that obligate car drivers to always keep the dipped beam on, even during the day? .. The joke, of course, and yet I don‚Äôt quite understand what the logic of this decision is.  We read not always in the dark or at least in a dimly lit room, but also in parks, on beaches, in well-lit aircraft cabins.  Yes, the power consumption of the minimum illumination is not huge at all, but it is, it is a fact.  So the solution in PocketBook seems more optimal to me - there the backlight can not only be regulated, but also completely turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/2ed/f81/87d2edf81b9245e2b7289c00432fbed9.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, I add that the quality of text display screens in both devices are very decent.  Still, E Ink Carta technology, coupled with a pixel density of 300 ppi, gives an excellent result: the fonts are clear, all the curls are visible on them, there is no ‚Äúremnant‚Äù of the old page on the new one (as in E Ink screens of previous generations), and so on.  If you want to get a reader with the maximum quality of displaying textual information, choose one of these two.  Nothing better has yet been invented. <br><br><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><br>  Cases of both readers are covered with ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù, that is, rubberized plastic.  The devices are assembled perfectly, no squeaks and other unpleasant things have been fixed.  Trouble found in another - where I personally did not expect them.  It turned out that specks of dust, strings and other small garbage quickly stick to Kindle Paperwhite 2015.  It was thought that I suddenly became somehow so careless ... But it turned out that it is really so - the Amazon model gets dirty pretty quickly.  For example, Sergey Kuzmin from Mobile-Review.com, a comrade who cannot be called a Kindle hater (he is just a big fan), writes in <a href="http//www.mobile-review.com/articles/2015/amazon-kindle-paperwhite2015.shtml)">this</a> material about this problem.  There are two options for resolving the issue: use a cover or never put the reader on a cloth surface (for example, on a blanket).  Otherwise, it will always look untidy, and you will wipe it clean.  PocketBook 631 Touch HD doesn‚Äôt have such a problem - that's why there‚Äôs nothing to talk about here.  The case of the "soft-touch", pleasant to the touch.  Dirt and dust does not collect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/d85/1d7/d68d851d709c40b194f5fbb55097ffac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32d/2ef/486/32d2ef486f6a4dd097219f94499e22ac.jpg"><br><br>  PocketBook weighs less - 183 g versus 205 for Kindle.  I will not say something like ‚Äúfrom the Kindle, the hands begin to fall off after half an hour, and the pocket can be held at least a week away.‚Äù  But I note that in practice, the difference is still noticeable.  And if you imagine that you will read for three hours in a row, then the extra weight - even if it is only 22 grams - is certainly not a positive thing.  So here you can praise the PocketBook 631 Touch HD, because it weighs less, although there are more functions in it (more on this below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b8/f1b/d60/5b8f1bd60ff5465dbb8591d88d42f553.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about holding in hands.  In the PocketBook 631 Touch HD, in order to keep the reader more comfortable in the hands, hundreds of dimples on the rear panel are designed - they provide a secure grip with finger pads.  More precisely, ‚Äúmore reliable than the Kindle‚Äù: thanks to the ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù, the latter also does not strive to slip out of the hand, but the PocketBook model is ‚Äúglued‚Äù to the fingers a little bit better. <br><br>  Control options, again, more in PocketBook 631 Touch HD.  Because in this model, you can wander around the menu and turn the pages using both the touch screen and the keys under the display.  That is, two options.  In the case of Kindle Paperwhite 2015, only touchscreen control is possible.  It is clear that in the comments to this post they will argue that the buttons are a rudiment, an anachronism, a foolish way to complicate a simple device, etc. In order to have no such comments (or at least to moderate the fervor of orthodox Kindle fans), I will give the following example.  I have a good friend with one unpleasant feature of the organism for him - he has constantly wet hands.  (A friend was healthy, checked, and they said to him: you are not sick, but special!) So I once lent him the reader PocketBook Touch 2, which also has a touchscreen and buttons.  Two weeks later, he said something like: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great that the keys were left in it.  I tried to turn the pages with my fingers from the screen - and he began to scream in an hour.  Therefore, he used the buttons further and did not know any problems. ‚Äù  This is a concrete example of the utility of several ways to control a device.  Two options are always better than one.  Point.  And yes, if you think that my friend is the only one with such a problem, then no - I know at least five people of both sexes with forever wet hands.  And all of them are much better suited "Pocket" than the "Kindle". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/b23/247/cc2b232477e9406381e6bc925cb6a058.jpg"><br><br>  More about the differences in the design and management of PocketBook 631 Touch HD and Kindle Paperwhite 2015, nothing, perhaps, can not be said.  More precisely, no.  There is another difference.  The PocketBook 631 Touch HD has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a memory card slot.  But this is dictated by the exceptionally wider functionality of the device, and not by the shortcomings of the Amazon developers (such as, for example, strange body material). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aeb/c27/507/aebc27507a8b4ce5ad08d73dbb302988.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Functionality and features </h2><br>  For a start, I'll go back to the topic of formats.  PocketBook 631 Touch HD works with 18 formats, namely PDF, PDF (DRM), EPUB, EPUB (DRM), DJVU, FB2, FB2.ZIP, DOC, DOCX, RTF, PRC, TCR, TXT, CHM, HTM, HTML, MOBI and ACSM.  Meanwhile, Kindle Paperwhite 2015 is ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with only 6 formats: TXT, PDF, MOBI, PRC, AZW3 and AZW.  Of which two are proprietary formats Amazon, and therefore I would not consider them useful for the Russian consumer, who in 99% of cases looking for books on the Internet (I personally buy them and advise you, but now we are not talking about the right behavior, but what is observed in practice).  Yes, on Kindle, you can open some more formats - for example, DOC - if you use the Send-to-Kindle browser extension or simply send books via mail.  In this case, files will be converted into formats supported by the reader.  However, the FB2 and DJVU Amazon reader will not open.  (Once again: you don‚Äôt need these formats specifically. And 99% of users from Russia use the same FB2, so you shouldn‚Äôt write something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to personally !!!‚Äù) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd3/e23/0a3/bd3e230a3d2b4c41a1f7a0f3ae53ef7b.jpg"><br>  <i>Files in memory PocketBook 631 Touch HD.</i>  <i>Then you and MP3, and FB2</i> <br><br>  In general, if you summarize, it turns out that the omnivorous PocketBook models will outperform Amazon models.  It is the "model", as this is true for all "Pocket". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/908/eb9/e9b908eb91984fd6ade8d94a587a5c18.jpg"><br><br>  By the number of text settings, the PocketBook 631 Touch HD is also in the lead.  I‚Äôll just bring this tablet - it will tell about the situation better than any words: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1c/240/665/d1c240665cfb4183aebaabb388d47adc.jpg"><br><br>  Kindle Settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e2/574/3df/5e25743df5424d869cc4529cfb1dbf31.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc6/a25/da2/cc6a25da2cf645d58076cf7ecb54701e.jpg"><br><br>  PocketBook settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/410/a45/563/410a4556324b4febb1501fb54d7e7426.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/762/856/d6f/762856d6f59f4876b9893e77f7ec3e20.jpg"><br><br>  Again: I am inclined to believe that the more settings in a particular device (reader, player, smartphone - it does not matter!), The better.  PocketBook 631 Touch HD by the number of text settings puts the Kindle Paperwhite 2015 on both blades, and there is nothing more to add here.  In addition, even matching settings are implemented in PocketBook deeper and more interesting: more font options, much wider range of adjustment of letter sizes.  So, in terms of customization capabilities, ‚ÄúPocket‚Äù is more interesting. <br><br>  There are four options for downloading books to readers ‚Äî that is, there is a parity (both models support Wi-Fi 802.11n, which makes wireless downloading possible). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/361/f16/1ae/361f161ae76342ac8232a28367a1ac9e.jpg"><br><br>  Here I can only note one thing: in general, of course, there are much more books in the Amazon store.  But if we talk about the Russian-language editions, then BookBand.net poketbuk is preferable. <br><br>  Additional functionality PocketBook 631 Touch HD and Kindle Paperwhite 2015, perhaps, I will also describe the tablet.  All the details about the implementation of the features of PocketBook 631 Touch HD are in a <a href="https//geektimes.ru/company/pocketbook/blog/281980/">separate review</a> , so I see no reason to repeat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/6cd/41c/ff26cd41c578435e9ca6af8dfc7a8145.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, a tangible part of the readers will think something like ‚Äúwhy do I need a calculator in the reader,‚Äù but I personally hold a different opinion.  The PocketBook 631 Touch HD interface is implemented in such a way that if you don‚Äôt need all these additional functions, you will never encounter them during the operation of the device.  Because you can open books from the main screen, where everything necessary is provided for this, in particular, access to the ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù section.  Well, if additional.  options are still needed, then welcome to the main menu.  The concept is about the same as in Android, the shortcuts of the most important applications can be displayed on the desktop, and let all the garbage roll in the main menu.  Also in the "Pocket": reading is available immediately, and other applications are in the menu.  And these very others, in my opinion, are by no means superfluous: sometimes in the process of reading I really need to look at a certain date, but there is no phone nearby.  Because after 9 pm I turn off the sound, postpone the smart far away so that the authorities do not get through and do not load with valuable instructions, and just indulge in reading.  It‚Äôs the same with toys - sometimes you don‚Äôt feel like reading, and, for example, flying a plane for a long time.  You can even hack chess!  Or listen to an audiobook that Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2015 won't do for you.  (I don‚Äôt like to listen to music on the smartphone in flight, so as not to land the battery for good reason.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/163/27f/d0016327fd804a4eb3608dbdc43f2569.jpg"><br>  <i>Main menu PocketBook 631 Touch HD with all applications</i> <br><br>  What is left with us?  Memory!  And again I will resort to the plate - so most clearly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20c/611/062/20c611062dd9410097f6b50bb978ed47.jpg"><br><br>  I‚Äôm not going to blame Amazon for the lack of an expansion slot: the model does not support audio, so it doesn‚Äôt need much memory.  However, Kindle Paperwhite 2015 works very well with PDF, and files of this format can be of any size - there are instances of 100 and 150 MB each.  For example, I regularly get presentations on my work with whole lines of gadgets that will soon be introduced to the market.  And this file can weigh even 200 MB.  I now have about 5 GB of such presentations on my computer (I haven‚Äôt opened any of them yet, and I‚Äôll have to study them soon!), And they simply won't fit in Kindle Paperwhite 2015.  But in the PocketBook 631 Touch HD - yes, and even if the internal memory is not enough, then a flash drive will come to the rescue.  It is clear that everyone has different tasks and needs, I just want to say that the phrase ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need !!!‚Äù are valid only for you.  For you personally.  But not for everyone. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  Since I initially set the ‚Äútabular‚Äù tone of this narrative, then let's start with a summary of the results from the table.  Let us estimate the advantages of PocketBook 631 Touch HD and Kindle Paperwhite 2015: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/ada/db6/734adadb6b4341c8b534397e31bc5e5d.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I can state that PocketBook 631 Touch HD and Kindle Paperwhite 2015 are just devices of different classes, in terms of the possibilities between them, if not the gulf, then the ravine.  The PocketBook model can do a lot, the Kindle model is much smaller, plus it has a number of design flaws (no buttons, the screen is green, the backlight does not turn off).  At the same time, the difference in price, in my opinion, is disproportionate to the difference in possibilities.  The PocketBook model costs 2-3 thousand rubles more than the Kindle (depending on the type of purchase - see the table), whereas the fair price difference, considering the far wider possibilities of the Pocket, should be 5-6 thousand.  Here comes to mind the model Kindle Paperwhite 2015 with Special Offer with the display of advertising, you can buy it for 8-9 thousand rubles.  In this case, the difference in price is more or less fair - the Kindle turns out to be really cheaper as much as it falls behind the PocketBook.  This is, in fact, the whole conclusion: if you need a device with good ergonomics and for all occasions, then you should overpay and take the PocketBook 631 Touch HD.  If you are an unassuming user and do not expect much from the device, then you can safely order a Kindle.  Only better with advertising - a model without it is not worth your money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369983/</a></p>
