  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Heroic Symphony for Developers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Tuesday, March 18, a conference-presentation of three new Microsoft products from the professional line <a href="http://heroes2008.ru/">was held</a> at the Moscow House of Music: Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2008. The temple of art was filled with IT professionals almost to the eye: more than 3 came to the event 000 people.  They were addressed by several domestic and foreign experts, representatives of the company and its partners in Russia and the world.  The leitmotif of all the speeches was the slogan ‚Äúheroes among us‚Äù, implying that each of those present, together with millions of their colleagues around the world, working on IT in their companies, moves the world forward. <br><br>  The word "exciting" ( <em>exciting</em> ) sounded from the lips of foreign speakers countless times.  This is understandable: this conference was one of 200 similar ones that in March-April, Microsoft holds around the world (including 12 of them in the cities of Russia, from St. Petersburg to Khabarovsk).  According to the general director of the Russian branch of the company Birger Sten (Birger Steen), all this together is the most important and largest launch of new products in its history.  So that no doubts remain, he brought the amount of expected profit from the new products - according to IDC estimates for MS and all its partners, it will be $ 120 billion, and only the twentieth part of them will go to the software giant itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At professional seminars in 5 halls, they discussed in detail special issues of development and server and database administration.  Earlier, at the opening of the conference, senior marketing director for the Windows Server line, Bob Visse, and representatives of Microsoft‚Äôs Russian office talked about innovations: enhanced deep support for virtualization, security improvements, a focus on ease of teamwork and the integration of all the right tools in one product .  After that, the press explained in a little more detail what was the purpose of all that was happening. <br><br>  Microsoft's attention to domestic professionals was briefly explained by Jim McCarthy (Jim McCarthy): ‚ÄúThe Russian developer community is the best on Earth.‚Äù  After such a statement from a living legend of programming, marketing and project management in one person, questions about the company's plans for our market certainly did not disappear, but it was nice.

      Later it became clear a little more.  According to the company, more and more Russian-made software is being sold to the West, and the domestic market is growing.  Increasingly required educated talented professionals.  Despite the usual words that training in our country grows on fruitful soil, rich in the traditionally high level of teaching mathematics and algorithms, everyone is well aware that fresh knowledge now still comes from abroad in foreign languages.  Young people who do not have a sufficiently high level of knowledge of the same English, are experiencing a strong information hunger.  Therefore, the mission of the complete localization of Visual Studio and the MSDN library (totaling as 10 volumes of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia) is doubly useful.  First, the education of the younger generation is worth any investment.  And secondly, raising the younger generation in relation to Microsoft products ... really worth any investment! <br><br>  In the future, all MSDN materials will be published simultaneously in English and Russian.  The work on localization will be completed and put into routine by the 4th quarter of this year.  The specialists employed in it are 80% our compatriots.  These include some universities, including MSTU.  Bauman. <br><br>  It was interesting to learn about the company's work with corporate clients.  It is not only about joint efforts to overcome holes in the legislation, which allow controlling bodies, to put it mildly, to go too far in the fight against piracy, but also about experienced product introductions.  Information about some of these experiences, we may soon see on the banners on the right side of this page, but for now we will briefly list: R-Style with servers running on Windows Server 2008,. Masterhost with services based on it (7 more from the first dozens of hosters with Win-servers), the 7th Continent trade network with assortment management based on SQL Server 2008 and software development using VS Team System 2008, Baltika, Caspian Pipeline Consortium and some other names known to everyone.  Exciting promotional videos coming soon on your screens. <br><br>  On the whole, the fact of investing such budgets in the marketing of IT products in Russia looks promising.  Until now, no one except marketers benefits from this.  But, if you look at things realistically, Microsoft‚Äôs efforts will not be in vain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21917/</a></p>
