  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are creating Society 2.0 or a new project from the creators of Web-Observer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141515/">told</a> all the distinguished members of the habr-community about how we were developing the <a href="http://webnabludatel.org/">Web-observer service</a> , and today I would like to talk with you on the topic of a new project, which we have recently started working on. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Without plunging into political debates (don't abuse the habr team), I dare to note that the results of the recent socio-political events in Russia caused depression and apathy among the socially active population of our vast Motherland.  Someone dropped their hands, someone goes to meetings (which imho does not give any result, but not about this post), but someone thinks how to make life better.  Thinking a little, we decided to make a service that will help the society to organize itself and cope with the problems whose solutions cannot be provided to us by the authorities.  And such problems, if you think a lot, for example

      - Spontaneous construction of parking lots in the courtyards, with which residents of nearby yards disagree (for example, children's playgrounds are demolished) <br>  - Rubbish on the streets (if in Moscow it is not so relevant, then in some cities outside the Moscow Ring Road it is really a problem) <br>  - Extortion of money from small and medium-sized businesses by the SES, firefighters, officials and other institutions <br>  - expensive foreign cars abandoned by the owners and blocking the exit of the courtyards or tramways <br>  - violations of various standards by the builders of roads, houses, etc., which leads to consequences of varying degrees of severity - from congestion on the roads to the collapse of buildings.  As far as I know, Yandex with its I-Traffic service carefully analyzes the causes of congestion, but since this is not their main specialization, it would be at least strange to demand regular improvements in the traffic situation in the country from them. <br>  - Theft and misuse of various budgets <br><br>  In my opinion, this list is endless.  Our task is to organize modern society in Russia (and later not only in it) in such a way that it itself includes the mechanisms of regulation, and we would provide it with a tool for this task.  There will also be provided a convenient toolkit for journalists and government officials who are interested in performing their work at the proper level (I am sure that with general dislike for officials it cannot be ruled out that there are honest people among them who also want to make the world a better place). <br><br>  There are several provisions that will be key when working on a project: <br><br>  - The use of top (but necessarily proven) technologies / frameworks / methodologies for the project. <br>  - The source code will be open to all who want to familiarize themselves with it. <br>  - Public figures, journalists, experts from various fields will be invited to work on the project <br>  - Core Team development will consist of leading experts, everyone will be able to commit the code, but it will be reviewed by our experts <br><br>  And now I would like to ask you some questions: <br>  - What problems do you see in your city / region, what or who exactly inhibits their solution? <br>  - Which of the problems are more priority in your opinion, and which are less? <br>  - What functionality would you like to see, what exactly would be in your opinion more in demand, and what is less? <br><br>  It would be great if you could ask the same questions to your friends and relatives, who are not indifferent to what is happening around and share in the comments. <br><br>  In parallel, we have an analysis of the requirements that we ourselves put forward to the product and having received your feedback, we will compare it with our vision and separately I will write a post, which eventually turned out. <br><br>  <b>UPD 0</b> : Another question (creative :)) - how would you call such a social platform?  Do not pledge only on Public control - we have a lot of ideas in our head how else to help our society and we will implement all of them :) <br><br>  <b>UPD 1</b> : I picked up from the comments in the main topic a high-level description of the functional: <br><br>  Our task <br>  1 - to collect information <br>  2 - to structure it <br>  3 - to draw public attention to it <br>  4 - to organize experts in this field. <br>  5 - conduct a series of activities to solve the problem <br>  6 - track the status of what happened and keep the public informed. <br><br>  An example is the absence of a pedestrian crossing on a busy stretch of road.  The system will look like this: <br>  1 - information gets into the system <br>  2 - all the necessary documents / evidence are collected, etc. - a photo of a section of the road, no transition, residents' complaints to the council, etc. <br>  3 - for journalists from the relevant region information is provided in the form required for publication <br>  4 - experts are involved in road works that are in the region in order to assess the time / cost / feasibility, etc. <br>  5 - a working group is being formed, means are being sought, and so on, using the knowledge of a lawyer who is a member of the working group to prevent officials from delaying the deadlines, to say that there is no budget, and so on.  All statuses are displayed in the system. <br>  6 - when the transition is made - the status changes to complete and (for example) grateful citizens can thank the group members for their work one way or another - say a kind word or treat you with beer :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141543/</a></p>
