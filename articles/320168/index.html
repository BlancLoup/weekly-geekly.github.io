This is my first post in which I would like to share my own, albeit small, but still experience on how to make a quality project in our time, being in a rather difficult (at first glance) financial position, without sponsors and only enthusiasm.  This is the first, introductory part of the story about the creation of our version of the computer cognitive-gaming virtual reality model, with great freedom of action, roughly the first version of which we plan to launch in 2-3 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3db/307/5b9/3db3075b910845fbae0219bfe3c580d6.jpg" alt="Depth Part 1"><br><br>  This introductory post is NOT for specialists who have already taken place and who have found their place, but just for beginners, especially for those who are afraid to start their own business, but they really want it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of <b>all, everything</b> is <b>possible that you are ready for!</b>  So, to understand this simple fact for me was the most difficult and main thing, although at first glance it seems childishly elementary, but sometimes it takes years to realize these simple truths.  Yes, and what to hide, we all see, read about successful entrepreneurs and their multimillion-dollar contracts, and if we don‚Äôt immediately put a stigma on them, like: ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt shine for me‚Äù, then the maximum somewhere in the back of the subconscious mind is leaving that maybe once the director of Google himself knocks on my mail and offers me a contract, but there‚Äôs just no such thing (or rarely).

      <br>
      I will tell you a little about myself and how I came to this conclusion, having gone through all the charms and difficulties of creating creative and business projects in our time: <br><br>  At the age of 19, I began to officially engage in business, before that I had only gained experience, one can say that my profile is the path of universalization in everything.  I started drawing avatars and covers for friends in Photoshop, then the advertising field became interesting, opened an advertising agency, designed, then made a city portal (long-term construction), while developing and promoting an Internet portal, at the same time penetrated and worked in various social organizations .  Then, oddly enough, he was engaged in the sphere of public catering (he created and launched a cafeteria diner), a shop and online store, network sales, radio ... <br><br>  It was interesting for me to recognize myself not only in a particular area, but at once not in all, but in many.  This was necessary in order to understand the similarities and differences in the creation and management of projects of completely different (at first glance) fields of activity. <br><br>  Now I have switched to the creation of the next computer Internet protracted, not quite standard, but rather innovative.  I would like to dwell on it in more detail about my own, and not someone's imposed and retold vision, and how it is possible and realistic to create high-quality projects in our time. <br><br><h3>  Basic postulates, knowledge of which is necessary in creating your project </h3><br>  Once again, all that is described below are not phrases from business quotations or marketing masters, these are my subjectively described postulate rules that I checked on myself and concluded that they really work.  Although some of them may seem something mystical and intangible, it is not so important, I have only one rule - until I make sure and check for myself - this does not exist or it is not true :) <br><br>  So, let's go: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eed/a67/166/eeda671667cd4ba2b8200970cc9c3f89.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Rule 1) <b>If "inside" yourself there is no conviction of what you want to do - do not do it.</b> <br><br>  What does ‚ÄúInside‚Äù mean - in the soul, in the consciousness, in the mind ... It makes no difference, it's like talking about God - everyone believes, and describes it in different ways.  So what matters is not how to call it, but what is important is the state, inside you must be full of desire and energy to create the project in question.  If there is such a state, then everything will work out, if not, then whatever money, power, morality you would use, it will still not work.  It is like an inner beacon showing the need or uselessness of your creative intention. <br><br>  Rule 2) <b>Create for yourself and for everyone.</b> <br><br>  If there is an internal response to the first item, then the next step is to determine the main task of your project.  Here I will briefly mention two completely opposite concepts: egoism and altruism.  The selfish way implies the global goal of the project - enriching oneself at the expense of others, without taking into account the interest of those people for whom, in essence, this project is being done.  The altruistic approach assumes that the main goal is just the opposite - to do for others as well as I would do for myself.  In other words, in the first case, the main interest is directed at itself, and in the second case - for all. <br><br>  I will not rant on this topic for a long time, it is important to clarify that selfish projects do not exist for a long time, this will result in some short-term business project, such as cutting a dough and closing it.  I'm not interested.  Therefore, I have always chosen the second path. <br><br>  So, if you are an altruist by nature and inside you are eager to create a cool project that will be used and enjoyed by millions of people (although everyone‚Äôs scale is different), then further reading can help something if you have some kind of plug or fear , well, or any other distraction. <br><br><h3>  Without money? </h3><br>  The next important understanding is that you can start creating your class project and without money.  I also spent my time looking for sponsors and easy ways to achieve the goal, but (mostly) it does not lead to a result for one simple reason: <b>those who have money do not need you</b> .  It may sound rude, but it is. <br><br>  But do not give up, after all, we - Russians are not looking for easy ways!  And all sorts of imported kickstarters and zuckerberg are all well and good, but not for everyone. <br><br>  So then the main thing, if not money?  <b>The main thing is to start.</b>  And again, this is not a fashionable phrase, overheard by the gods of marketing, just because it works. <br><br>  Let's unite all previous statements into one: creating the desired project for people, the most important thing is to start it.  After you start the creation from scratch, and this is known - the most difficult, because  there is nothing yet and it seems, there is so much to do, a lot of work, and there is no need to talk about any results, then the most interesting begins.  When you crossed this frontier and nevertheless decided to go further, having nothing but your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhelping the world, you will feel what is called the ‚Äúduration‚Äù of the project.  That is, from some ephemeral ideas and ideas, you will begin to move on to more specific details. <br><br>  The whole process of creating any project is similar to making a film: at first there is just some interesting story, then someone picks it up and sees potential in it and wants to realize it - first the creator of the picture comes to the general outlines - for example, he sees that it will be some kind of love story, then the details are ‚Äúbrought up‚Äù in the mind, let's say it will be a love story of a cat and a dog, then in more detail, a domestic cat that grew up in a prosperous family and a stray dog ‚Äã‚Äãwho has been wandering and fighting for its survival ... <br><br>  You understand?  It is important to understand that the <b>details are drawn up by you, as you work on them.</b> <br><br>  The next important point, even though the most ‚Äúmystical‚Äù I discovered, is that, like the details, they pull up as we work on them and the picture is more and more detailed and gradually brought to the right form, the same process happens in parallel with people of like minds .  By analogy with the creation of the film - these are all assistants, be it writers, assistant directors, cameramen ... Just like you, as the project creator, you have like-minded people who (even if you don‚Äôt know about it) are interested and want to connect to your the project.  I call it simultaneity or <b>synchronicity</b> , and it works.  In all the projects that I started, I either just started looking for the person I needed, as he was, or did not even have time to do it. <br><br>  The right people are and pull themselves!  Those are the only ones who are best suited for the specific task you need.  This is a truly mysticism, the description of which does not allow the subject of this site, but have you never come across the right person at the right place at the right time and the problem was solved ‚Äúby itself‚Äù? <br><br>  I leave the opportunity to think about it to each of you, but for now I will move on to the next stage. <br><br>  At this stage, all the ‚Äúflaws‚Äù in the form of money, people and everything else are not so terrible, then you will already feel that you are going in the right direction, to move further, through the most basic routine, will help that when you work hard to create a base project and easily find like-minded people who are willing to invest their work "in the future" and continue to receive a permanent profit, but for now just believing in your idea and seeing your desire for implementation, and <b>real</b> assistants (as altruistic as you) before  enough. <br><br>  On this, I round out the first part of the article, in continuation I will tell in more detail and specifically about the steps to implement my new protracted project - the project of embedded computer virtual reality, codenamed ‚ÄúDepth‚Äù, I will say that the idea was peeped and accepted for implementation by the author of similar stories: S. Lukyanenko . <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  And everything will turn out :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320168/</a></p>
