We continue a series of articles about the organization <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">APEIGAMING</a> , and its formation in the cyberspace field.  In the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/apeigaming/blog/278294/">last part</a> , I told why Twitch is needed, disassembled the basic ‚Äúmust have‚Äù settings and explained how this service makes a contribution to the media organization. <br><br>  Having set up the main services (which were discussed in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/apeigaming/blog/278294/">last article</a> ), we <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apeigaming">started</a> searching for ‚Äúelegant‚Äù solutions for organizing the work of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apeigaming">the APEIGAMING channel</a> .  The difficulty lay in the fact that all people in the organization are located in completely different cities and even countries.  There were enough people willing to stream on the main channel of the organization and it‚Äôs not logical to give each username and password from the account from a security point of view.  I tried to find out in our media department how this problem could be solved, and it turned out that no one ever asked such a question. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Having rummaged on foreign portals, I found the answer to this question.  It turns out that such an option is already ‚Äúimplanted‚Äù in the standard settings of the channel, it is enough to set the recipient's email, and a unique API key will come to his mail, which will allow you to connect to the channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dba/0e3/019/dba0e3019614692213912ee513a1e80d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also advise you to add at once all the people who have access to ‚ÄúEditors‚Äù - this will allow them to change the game and the title of the broadcast when you are not at the computer.  This setting is in the information panel, the ‚Äúedit‚Äù tab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0f/60b/e32/f0f60be326d7737fd93a65e3bc805140.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next question was the so-called ‚Äúoverlay‚Äù - a special image with a transparent background, which is superimposed on top of the broadcast and carries various information about the channel.  Ideally, you should have your own ‚Äúoverlay‚Äù for each game, but if you do not have the skills to create your own graphics, then the easiest way is to find a ready-made universal overlay or buy a professional one, which often comes with various additional buttons and frames for the webcam. and background for offline broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/490/bca/331/490bca3310e934916229969918dc9567.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, you get a fully styled channel.  Everything is configured very quickly and without any problems.  We also chose this option, since I see no reason to spend time drawing a unique ‚Äúoverlay‚Äù at the initial stage, but I think that every self-respecting channel should have it, in one form or another. <br><br>  To attract people to the first broadcast, we decided to play 200 Steam keys from various inexpensive ‚Äúindie‚Äù games.  Better more simpler prizes than one, but expensive.  In the first case, the chance to win something rises many times, especially if the channel is just starting its way.  You can also stretch this pleasant pleasure over the entire many hours of "stream."  As a result, each of our viewers received a key, and some were especially lucky, 3-4, and everyone was satisfied.  The channel managed to maintain a ‚Äúlive‚Äù chat and interest in the broadcast, and the audience did not get bored, getting in the breaks between the games the opportunity to participate in the competition. <br><br>  If we talk about the technical part of the competition, everything turned out to be not so simple.  We wanted to give out prizes only to active participants who actually watch our broadcast, and not just sit in a chat.  Also, the rally was supposed to be fair and transparent.  In the end, after several hours of searching, after trying a huge number of different bots, we discovered <a href="http://twitch.moobot.tv/">Moobot</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/780/e4c/9ae/780e4c9aecd7be7416a2e590afeb3aac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, this is the only service that met all our requirements.  This bot works very simply.  Before the start of the contest, the admin includes the option to draw and reports this to the general chat.  After that, everyone needs to write a specific command and the bot will add viewers to the contestants.  After some time, the moderator closes access to the registration of new participants and the bot, at the touch of a key, selects a random winner. <br><br>  By this method, we solve all the above problems.  Also, anyone who has the right to control the channel can get access to the bot, which greatly simplifies working with it.  In addition, the bot has a huge number of other settings, both paid and free, but today we will not affect them. <br><br>  The next service I would like to mention is <a href="https://streampro.io/">streampro</a> .  I do not know why, but this site was not covered in any of the articles or guides on Twitch, and I came across it quite by accident.  This is a very powerful service that allows you to customize a huge number of non-standard "overlays".  Specifically for our channel, we were looking for a ‚Äúfollower goal‚Äù - a target for subscribers that we would like to achieve during the stream.  It is displayed in the form ‚Äú0/100‚Äù and is fully customizable for any needs.  In addition, there are about 50 different ‚Äúwidgets‚Äù and ‚Äúoverlays‚Äù that can partially or completely replace the services described in the first article.  For example, there are widgets for subscriptions, subscribers, ‚Äúhosts‚Äù, and chats.  Each of the above widgets has 3-5 different goals and technical solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bb/4a5/64f/7bb4a564fc2583b16296ddc0548506f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another service I would like to highlight is <a href="https://www.gamingforgood.net/">gamingforgood</a> .  It may be of interest to those who already have a certain database of loyal subscribers.  This platform allows you to expand your donation options from one or two (QIWI, PayPal) to ten.  (Visa, Mastercad, bitcoin, paysave, etc.).  But the most curious for me was the ability to bind to the G2A Wallet, which in turn allows you to transfer not only money, but also to pay off with skins on Steam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b60/d4d/9db/b60d4d9dbb3a41007f173fd786762bc3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the end of the article I would like to say a few words about the ‚Äúcheat‚Äù bots on Twitch.  Yes, all the portals just scream and ‚Äúholivar‚Äù because every second person adds himself bots for broadcast.  Of course, this problem exists, but any ‚Äúcheating‚Äù is opened and tracked very simply.  It does not make any sense to wind up subscribers at all, since it is immediately clear from the activity on the channel and the number of general views of whether the subscribers were turned on or not.  I also don‚Äôt see the point of winding up views, because if your stream is dull and of poor quality, no one will watch it, even if you have 1 million views.  The only ‚Äúcheat‚Äù that has at least some meaning is an indicator of living people online and only to get up from the fifth page to the first in the list of streamers.  Again, if the indicator of ‚Äúlive‚Äù people on the stream is 300 people, and in the chat there is complete silence and ‚Äúpercatipole‚Äù, then an accidental viewer will immediately understand this and come out instantly, automatically recording your channel to ‚Äúignore‚Äù. <br><br>  Returning to the beginning of the article, where I briefly mentioned our e <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">-</a> sports <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">organization APEIGAMING</a> , I want to remind you that we are always open to new active members who are ready to show themselves in any direction, be it management, journalism, or ‚Äústreaming.‚Äù  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396183/</a></p>
