You can keep 2 (or 20) blogs of different directions, but there is another possibility.  Why not start another blog on the same topic, but which will express your views and ideas differently?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have 2 very successful blogs, they are about the same direction - health and a healthy lifestyle - but they have completely different readership and achieved goals.  Although keeping two popular blogs takes a lot of time, during this year I was able to devote myself more to what I really like - writing notes - and giving up part of my routine work-for-pay.  So, I want you to think about the possibility to run a second blog - but in the same direction.  Duplication?  Excessive borrowing?  Shortage of materials?  Not necessary!  Based on my personal experience, I can say that you should think about trying to keep two blogs of the same subject. <br><br><h2>  Experiments and training </h2><br><br>  This does not mean that you should not experiment with a new writing style or the appearance of an existing blog, if it is already successful enough, if it already has a mature reader community and some brand, but in this case it‚Äôs quite risky to carry out any or innovations.  A couple of small failures will not play a serious role, but they will help you learn.  If you are seriously faced with the problem that you have ideas for taking notes, but you cannot figure out how to publish them in the key of an existing blog, the solution may be to create a second similar topic.  And you can always inform your readers about his appearance, and of course, ask to leave your feedback.  I believe that in some cases, experiments in the second blog may be more justified than in the existing one, if such a desire has appeared.  Why do you have to limit yourself or always act with an eye on the first blog, although even this may lead to a loss of image in the eyes of readers?  Why not give yourself a go and try if you really want to try something or learn something? <br><br><h2>  Self-realization </h2><br><br>  The more we study, read and write in the blog, the more we have new ideas, right?  Writing notes allows you to think about new things and makes your interests both broader and deeper.  Sometimes the first successful project lays a good foundation for all subsequent ones.  But how would you find out if you don't try?  In any case, in my opinion, the current blog will only improve the quality of the follow-up simply because keeping two projects will allow you to learn a little more and get a more general picture - although you can work a little less on each, but on the other hand, you will take more objective decisions and focus your efforts on what is really important.  It is also possible that the second blog will suddenly be very successful, and you will have a convenient opportunity to do only writing notes.  In any case, you should try yourself in a new area and see how well it will turn out. <br><br><h2>  Income </h2><br><br>  Why not earn more on the fact that you already know or are interested in you?  Currently, when you have practical tools, a network, and a community, try something new and gain additional experience.  Maybe the first earnings will appear much earlier than in the case of the first blog.  If you have already invested a huge amount of energy and energy in the current blog, then why not get income from their further investments?  There is nothing illegal or wrong if you are moving in several places, if you really invest and create useful or funny notes. <br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br><br>  If you run two (or more) blogs, it stimulates you to highlight the most priority things (do I really need to check the statistics of my site ten times a day?).  Although you can assume that keeping two blogs of a similar subject is more complicated than one, in my experience, this only increases overall efficiency, relevance and productivity.  If you are going to create a second blog, plan the frequency of writing notes, their type and size before you start, and then follow this schedule as much as possible. <br><br><h2>  Minuses </h2><br><br>  As stated, this approach has several drawbacks.  First, this is one of the so-called ‚Äúnon-applicable laws‚Äù of marketing, the essence of which is in the absence of overlaps between products (ie, how many different types of cola do you really need?).  But I prefer to regard the work on several blogs in one category as a reasonable application of my strength: they are different!  By following this path, you can really maximize the benefit from experiments (translate: learn faster, more traffic).  You will work more ( <em>note: work more efficiently</em> ), but you will learn more and create more connections (especially useful if you work from home), and also possibly earn more by doing what you want like.  This is just my personal experience - maybe it will help you too! <br><br><h2>  As a conclusion </h2><br><br>  Sara Ost writes and maintains <a href="http://www.healthbolt.net/">www.healthbolt.net</a> (number one among health blogs (according to <a href="http://medgadget.nl/2007/08/15/sneak-preview-ranking-english-written-medblogs/">MedGadget</a> )) and participates and edits <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/">www.marksdailyapple.com</a> (number 38 among the top 100 health blogs). <br><br>  <em>Thanks to everyone who read this article.</em>  <em>I hope that the next ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù will help you in any endeavors.</em>  <em>I will be glad to your comments.</em> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288096/</a></p>
