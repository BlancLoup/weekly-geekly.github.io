The conclusion, as expected, was one: there is no money in blogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c81/e4e/0d4/c81e4e0d46d62b26415351df58951390.jpg" width="450" height="354" alt="Anton Antich and Dmitry Chestnykh"><br><br>  The head of <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/blogus/">the Blogus company</a> and the former Microsoft employee Anton Antich, using <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/feedburner/">Feedburner</a> as an example <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/feedburner/">,</a> tried to explain that you can make money on blogs - at least with the help of RSS advertising.  True, it turned out that the best and most readable (by Russian standards) bloggers can get no more than 100-150 dollars a month.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Blog communities like LiveJournal Antich criticized outright.  With the help of blogging networks it is easy to find a social circle, but, he believes, it is difficult to get out of it: LJ blogs are not read by those who do not use it themselves.  In addition, this service does not allow you to earn on your content, for which you should create a ‚Äústand-alone blog‚Äù. <br><br>  The Russian Internet market is clearly underdeveloped: the head of Blogus considers the mentality to be ‚Äúpay for attendance‚Äù and not the target consumer as an indicator of this.  The winner is the one who creates the service, where the advertiser can work with the target audience, orienting his marketing strategy not to the number of views of the banner, but to the number of potential customers who become real after visiting the resource. <br><br>  Another important problem of the Runet of Antich is the difficulty of paying for the ‚Äúwork‚Äù of site owners.  All withdrawal schemes earned online are not legally clean.  True, the objection from the floor was quite reasonable: while the volumes of these funds will be so meager, there is no point in taking care of individuals for the owners of advertising networks and legislators. <br><br>  In Russia, according to Antich, there are 1-1.5 million RSS feeds, most of them belong to LJ - ‚Äúlow-quality content‚Äù.  However, Anton Antich calls the Russian market the fastest growing in the world, with the result that bloggers will soon be able to finally make money on their websites.  True, the terms of such bright prospects have not yet been named. <br><br>  Dmitry Honest, a representative of the community of popular bloggers, spoke about his experience of earning in this area.  Having tried to install advertising from Google Adsense in the period from September to December 2006, on the blog <a href="http://sellme.ru/">sellme.ru</a> , I managed to earn about $ 100 a month.  Yandex.Direct Dmitry has not tried it yet, but he believes that it is ‚Äúeven worse‚Äù: this service has fewer formats, moreover, there is no clarity in terms of which sites are accepted into the network.  With the help of Feedburner, which allows you to display banners in RSS, Dmitry, according to his calculations, would earn about the same $ 100 per month. <br><br>  During the discussion that unfolded in the hall, interesting thoughts and judgments were expressed.  For example, <a href="http://yakoff.ru/">Jacob Lebedev</a> can‚Äôt find a blogger on the runet who would write on financial topics;  and it is precisely such a blogger that Jacob and the organization he represents could have paid money.  In the Russian blogosphere it is difficult to find specialists in a particular area, it is difficult to find content, it is difficult to find anything at all, except for ‚Äúrazlekukhi‚Äù.  For ‚Äúfun‚Äù, it is enough to place banners, ‚Äúpay for views‚Äù, and for the time being ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù have to write ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù.  What to do so that they, too, could earn, at this round table, no one, unfortunately, did not say. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288056/</a></p>
