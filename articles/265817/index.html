Who and what he studied, daily routine, carrot and carrot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this publication we will try to tell (and show a little) how 1C: The Club of Programmers spent the next summer school.  We will be glad to receive feedback in the comments. <br><br><h1>  Prehistory </h1><br>  Almost 5 years ago, 1C Company created the <a href="http://club.1c.ru/">1C: Programmers Club project</a> to arouse interest in programming among schoolchildren.  And every year the number of schoolchildren who study under the project is growing steadily, which undoubtedly can not but rejoice.  The whole basic learning process takes place from October to April inclusive.  Having looked at the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholding a summer school with a wonderful school, we decided to try to do something similar for our children.  And now the 4th summer school brilliantly died down across the country.  In 2015  - this is more than 1000!  students.  On the basis of the main office of the Firm "1C" on Dmitrovskoye Highway, 9.  The past summer school turned out to be the most ambitious of all: 59 schoolchildren took part in it, this is an absolute record. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/149/035/f82149035a95c92b18fd201b48dece26.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h1>  Who studied and what </h1><br>  In 1C: Summer School'15 guys studied 4 disciplines: <br>  - Fundamentals of programming in the Java language (see. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/236177">Java for students: learning through the creation of games</a> ) <br>  - System administration for schoolchildren (see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/236535/">Sys.adminstvo as leisure or ‚ÄúSon, make already at home wi-fi‚Äù</a> ) <br>  - Algorithms.  Olympiad programming.  Starting module (see. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/235229/">Yellow bike with red wheels or another course of algorithms from the company "1C"</a> ) <br>  - Management of software development (see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/235521/">Me, about 1C school and about the June module of the course ‚ÄúSoftware Development Management‚Äù</a> ) <br><br>  We tried our best to ensure that the summer school did not turn into a tedious ‚Äúobligation‚Äù for which the parents paid. <br>  We have united the guys who study on the same course in teams, gave them names and slogans.  This is how it sounded: <br>  - The command <b>"java-sources"</b> .  It so happened that this course was not generally planned for the summer school'15 and we conducted it exclusively for the students of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense.  The girls became a true decoration of the summer school and wonderfully fit into the number of participants in the 1C: Club of Programmers. <br>  The motto of the team: ‚ÄúIt is written once - it works everywhere‚Äù <br>  - Team <b>"Olympians"</b> .  We had: almost 30 children, 2 steep teachers, a bunch of solved olympiad problems, a final contest and achivki (we will tell about them ‚Äù). <br>  Team motto: ‚ÄúWe need more gold‚Äù <br>  - Team <b>"System analysts"</b> .  These are people in general from a parallel universe, living their lives among the mountains of components. <br>  The motto of the team: ‚ÄúDid you try to reboot?‚Äù <br>  - Team <b>"Managers"</b> .  These are very serious guys, even joking about them is dangerous. <br>  Team motto: ‚ÄúThis is not a royal business‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/228/b01/8a1/228b018a1e85358a79e8f924d1736679.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  Schedule </h1><br>  8:30 - 8:50 - Breakfast <br>  8:50 - 9:00 - SCRUM rally <br>  9:00 - 10:30 - First couple <br>  10:30 - 11:00 - coffee break <br>  11:00 - 12:30 - the second couple <br>  12:30 - 13:30 - lunch <br>  13:30 - 17:00 - different activities (this part was the most difficult in terms of organization). <br>  17:00 - 18: 00- ... Some of the children went home, some waited until the end of the working day of the parents playing board games.  Many managed to become friends and did not want to leave at all, sometimes we hung out together until 8:00 pm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e6/374/86e/0e637486e8b022b86182d5dc1a70aa32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  "Carrot and stick" </h1><br>  We have introduced a system of rewards and punishments.  The encouragement was "achivki."  They were issued on various occasions, mainly for academic success.  Accumulated achievements at the end of the summer school could be exchanged for any of the prizes (there were a lot of them).  By the end of the summer school for achivki, a non-sick struggle unfolded, but the prizes went to ALL.  For the guys who had 1-3 achivki, we gave a promotional sweetness - for this was purchased 150 chocolates.  The punishments were very humane =) Late for the morning scrum had to be wrung out exactly as many times as it was late.  And at the end of the shift, we deprived all the achivok of malicious violators of discipline. <br>  True, before the final defense and receiving prizes, everything was returned to violators who realized their wrongfulness =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/868/6fa/8dc/8686fa8dcf9df1fb4435fee2251f7d1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/02d/960/76d02d96007fcac650a9849e22003e4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56e/cba/fee/56ecbafee855bd2f59282e0afa212333.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We added a bit of ‚Äúsocial responsibility‚Äù and announced a contest for the best blogger of the summer school.  The point was to broadcast news about the summer school'15 in different social networks vk, facebook or instagramm.  The best blogger on the last day received a bunch of achivok, which allowed him to choose the best of the presented prizes.  The guys on their own initiative created their own group in vk, where all the collected news about the summer school'15 was reposted by the hashtag # 1c_summer <br>  In turn, we also chronicled our daily adventures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ab/e73/024/7abe73024930c8cb8e1d16b5411da9af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, we will tell about the interesting things - where we took the guys on excursions. <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/265985/">To the next part - Interesting</a> </h1></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265817/</a></p>
