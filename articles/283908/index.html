So to say that this is the director for this and that, does not work.  In English, it sounds like the <i>Chief Experience Officer</i> ( <i>cr. <b>CXO</b></i> ).  Let's see. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In most companies, its functions are spread over various positions, but industry leaders, as always, are two steps ahead of the rest of the world and have been holding such specialists for several years.  On the question of the meaning of this term, the Russian part of <i>Vicki</i> is silent, the English-speaking one quite concisely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_experience_officer">mentions</a> , and the Chinese, as always, accurately duplicate the English-speaking one. <br><br>  It is not hard to guess that <b>CXO is</b> one of the newest management positions, the so-called <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title">C-level</a></i> , along with the <b>CEO</b> , <b>CMO</b> and others.  <b>CXO</b> is responsible for the experience of interaction in the organization.  With regard to which let a small lyrical digression.

User experience, <b>UX</b></i> ) - this is the feeling that arises from a person in direct interaction with objects of the surrounding world.  In a narrower sense, the interaction experience characterizes a person‚Äôs personal perception of the functional and emotional characteristics of a product or service in use. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df2/dec/69c/df2dec69c9254078b42aa33dc8877d45.png" alt="What is UX?" align="right"><br>  The importance of industry <i>interaction experience is</i> strongly promoted by <i><a href="http://www.jjg.net/about/">Jesse James Garrett</a></i> - one of the founders of the consulting firm <i><a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a></i> .  In his book <b><a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3925484/">, Elements of Interaction Experience</a></b> (by the <i>way, a very, very good, well-written and readable book</i> ), he says that during product development, its creators pay maximum attention to what it does.  Interaction experience is another, often ignored part of the equation: often how a product works separates success from failure.  <i>The interaction experience</i> concerns not how the product functions <i>‚Äúinside‚Äù</i> (although this is sometimes of great importance).  <i>The interaction experience</i> is related to how the device works <i>‚Äúoutside‚Äù</i> when a person comes into contact with it and uses it. <br><br>  The whole process of developing <i>interaction experience</i> requires that no aspect of the user's communication with your brainchild (application, site, device, etc.) should arise by chance, without your conscious and explicit decision.  This means that at each stage of development it is necessary to understand the user's expectations and take into account any of his possible actions. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  ‚ÄúA design that ignores people is completely rightly ignored by people ..‚Äù </h3></blockquote><br>  <b>Highlight the main functions of the CXO:</b> <br><ul><li>  corporate management of user interaction strategies, </li><li>  management of software and hardware development, </li><li>  creative reviews and development of conceptual models, </li><li>  positioning and protection of the company's intellectual property. </li></ul><br>  <b>To become a good CXO you need:</b> <br><ul><li>  understand user, business and technology, </li><li>  know how a product should develop in order to better fulfill its purpose, </li><li>  stimulate and develop the activity of the development team aimed at anticipating user requests. </li></ul><br>  Thus, the character <b>CXO</b> , is a kind of <i>rock star of the</i> company, providing the very magical <i>experience of interaction</i> .  Boardrooms have not had time to get used to these managers, and many people holding such positions are real pioneers of their work, occupying the <b>CXO</b> chairs <b>for</b> only a few years.  Each of them is responsible for the overall customer experience of the company and its products and services. <br><br>  <b>Who could be the perfect CXO?</b> <br><br>  The most outstanding is the unforgettable <b>Steve Jobs</b> .  Today, perhaps, <b>Elon Musk</b> from <i>Tesla Motors</i> . <br><br>  The views of the business community on the feasibility of introducing the <b>CXO</b> post <b>are</b> divided. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6a/2ce/8bf/d6a2ce8bfef84eb68f6183e3bdbf5f0e.png" alt="Brand rules!" align="right"><br>  Some believe that any company must have a staff member of the <i>C-class</i> responsible for supervising and maintaining holistic interaction with customers.  Although they note that this is for the most part valid for companies that consider a <s>bit of a</s> <b>brand</b> as their primary product as their strategic product. <br><br>  Others express opinions, primarily related to the apparent <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">multiplication of entities</a></i> .  In particular, the <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2588%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">Wharton School of Business</a></i> called the increase in the number of <i>C-grade</i> <b>posts ‚Äúinflation of posts</b> . <b>‚Äù</b> <br><br><h3>  PS </h3>  At first glance, it seems that the introduction of an additional managerial position, with a fairly significant salary, is inexpedient.  But with the increasing complexity of product development and the full <i>customer orientation of the CXO</i> position, <b>we</b> will come to many companies, skeptics, as always, will shout the loudest <b>‚ÄúFOR!‚Äù</b> , And we all as consumers will benefit from it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283908/</a></p>
