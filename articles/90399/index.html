  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Love your client ... or how not to become "Tajik" in website development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Work with clients is different.  It happens easy, simple - which you remember as a friendship in a university - positive and unconstrained.  I would like to congratulate this client on his birthday, inquire about the success of the project and constantly make proposals for development.  With this you can conquer the open spaces of the runet with creativity, he believes in your professionalism and this faith is monetized in his earnings from the site.  He will bring to you his friends, colleagues, acquaintances.  And everyone will be happy.  For such a client you want to move mountains, you like a happy child for candy are bathed in a tender trusting gaze and want to do and do more for this project.  I want to get up at 7 am and reading letters from this client - to start the working day.  And it all comes true. <br><br>  And also work with clients is tedious, prolonged and uninteresting.  These customers call you themselves at 7 am and you are cursing and hating everyone around you, start one more morning with such a customer. <a name="habracut"></a>  You slowly go to work.  You drink coffee and take time not to call such a client.  Professionalism, of course, begins to take over, I want to make a good project.  Tuning into a positive, you pick up the phone and they tell you - but remove this little navel - what?  Is it an important part of the modular grid?  But then we want to make it green.  What?  Green is not combined with red - but it seems to us that it is combined.  And so on.  The main arguments are that we know it better - because we are the owners of the site and pay the money, and we will also do it from Kolya from the next office.  And let Kolyan be blinded by a 13-year-old schoolboy blooper for a bag of chocolates - we see no difference in quality, we need to do so.  Kolyan is the same.  And Kolyan told us that there are a lot of buttons and he will not poke at all - he needs everything to be on the main page - then he understands - how to navigate on this site.  And the work turns into a succession of satisfaction of some incomprehensible Kolyan, then the customer's wife, then mother-in-law, then the sister and daughter of his mistress.  Everyone already knows about the site, the whole small town, but the site is not there yet - and with such an endless list of wishes for completely unauthorized persons - it may not appear at all.  All creative ideas are slaughtered at the root, the quality issue is not worth it at all - the customer cites the example of the sites of the 90s and the question is ripe - why did you come to us - you saw our sites.  The answer is simple - yes, we liked your sites.  And it all starts in a new way.  And yet - often this is attached by speeding up the deadlines and the constant desire of the customer to make everything faster.  And even if initially you could set yourself up for a positive, now there is nothing but nervous fatigue.  I would like to hand over the project, and if I don‚Äôt pass it, I‚Äôll give the entire prepayment - just to get rid of such a native voice in the handset that is interested in - how is it still not ready?  And my son Ivan Ivanich said that you can do everything in 1 night.  But the truth is - our developers only learn from the great and mighty Schoolboy, who makes websites in 24 hours.  It is necessary to hire him to work and get rich. <br><br>  On this phrase, comments were already superfluous ...

      Today, our <a href="http://magwai.ru/">web studio has</a> almost passed the project.  Almost - because there are some little things about programming left - additional suggestions from the customer.  The project began in early February.  2 months we tried to make a quality product.  As a result, we managed to make it simple, low-key and with high-quality programming.  We heard the voice of the customer not only every day, but several times a day.  Every evening we had to report on what we did on the design - because the customer had to adjust everything.  Everything.  We fought, showed a tough position, defended the opinion in 2-3-hour conversations at meetings and by phone.  Something defended, something not.  The very result is unhappy and we will not put copyrights.  This site will not be in our portfolio, which the customer liked so much.  Because this site is unworthy of it.  Paradox. <br><br>  We made a lot of conclusions from this project.  How to identify such customers at an early stage (for example, the customer does not have a clear vision of the site, there are no sites that like and complete confusion in thoughts about the future project).  We realized that it is unprofitable to work with such clients - it takes a lot of working time to waste, and the nerves and morale of the performers also affect the overall situation in the studio.  We realized that as soon as we give up the site, we will not work with these people on any issues, which, of course, will affect the development of the project. <br><br>  But the most important thing is the phrase that is so ingrained in our memory - or rather the case, the story told by the customer - When I had an old car and the engine rattled there, then I came to the gas station and Tajik (note - this is a quote) for me corrected so as not to rattle.  I sat down and still rattled, and the Tajik said that everything is fine - and you - I do not like it, and you say that it is cool. <br><br>  So we were in the camp of the "Tajik" at the gas station, only in our field.  Therefore, the most important point is that if they do not trust your professionalism, if they do not consider you a professional, do not work with these people.  Nothing good will come of it anyway.  Such people are themselves professionals in everything - both in their business, and in the development of websites, and in the repair of machines. <br><br>  Such customers see around the "Tajiks", they will make websites for a five-night at night and will be satisfied.  Such a position is close to them, because they themselves do business.  They do not think that not everything is measured by money - and that for many it is important to make and sell a high-quality product, which then will live, develop, and win contests.  They don't care.  It should be fast, cheap and cheerful.  And it turns out "Our Rush" with Dzhamshuty-web developers, the truth of the crib? <br>  Customers are different and work with them is different.  But when something inside you tells you not to do this project.  When disturbing bells at the subconscious level turn into an intuitive prediction of an unfavorable situation in the material or moral sense - pay attention to them.  If you feel that you are not working together with the customer and that you are on the way - do not ignore the sensations.  This experience speaks to you.  And experience and professionalism go together. <br><br>  Ps and parallel to another <a href="http://raffer.ru/">regional project</a> .  Which turned out well.  Who likes us and the customer.  So life is beautiful, and there seems to be no ‚ÄúTajiks" yet) <br>  UPD.  in the link about the regional project is still a stub, the site itself will work at the end of next week.  Now testing phase <br>  UPD2.  Post is not nationalistic.  "Tajik" - given as a quote from the words of the customer.  Let's close the topic of nationalist disputes, post exclusively on the topic of project management.  There are no underwater stones and hidden intentions to offend people from Tajikistan.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90399/</a></p>
