  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There is an idea, but there is no knowledge: we create an application from idea to release, with zero knowledge of the code</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever been like this: there is a burning desire to create something, so much so that the world can become better.  And it seems like it is in front of you, and then suddenly comes the understanding that the soldering iron is not the one, IQ is too small, programming is not at all mine.  And everything, the desire disappears, and the world will not become better.  That's how we reached for the "finished" product.  Assistant application, for car owners, with the level of car ownership at the level of: drive, brake, steer.  In case of emergency, urgently call everyone in the contact list. <br>  Get rid of the controversy, then the narration on behalf of the ideological mastermind, and after, and my word, in this mess of torments. <br>  As part of the Friday, almost pre-holiday reading, of course.  So no technical details, no code, just an idea! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1st person: <br>  Initially, no goals to write an application did not exist.  I myself am not a programmer, and even with a great desire to write code for me an impossible task, due to the complete lack of knowledge.  Spurred the following.  January frosty day, being late for service, I get a call from my wife with a question: "what to do, the car will not start !!!"  (Yeah, what would it start up at -25C and the Honda battery at 40 Ah).  I am trying to politely explain: ‚ÄúHoney, I need to light some one ... You should have wires for‚Äú lighting ‚Äùin the trunk ...‚Äù In general, he turned around, came home, gave his car to his wife, and started Honda from a neighbor Ford in 10 minutes. <br>  It would be okay, but after a day, the call: "I have something hard in my car from behind, I'm afraid to go on."  They didn‚Äôt evoke a good tow truck, it was a fire extinguisher that had fallen out of the mount, hit the rear shelf of the trunk, when throttling and accelerating, making the sound that the rear axle would fall off now.  All this I was tired of and I decided to make her a memo, from the series IF-THEN.  But since we live in the century of Androids and iPhones, then write a memo on a piece of paper, as it is not comme il faut. <br>  It was decided, I will make an Auto-Helper application to help my wife, in passing for ladies and novice motorists!  But how, I'm not a programmer?  Hiring a programmer was not part of my plans, and in general I prefer to do everything myself first.  Googol‚Äôs search didn‚Äôt wait long and the next 2 evenings I spent in testing all sorts of mobile site designers and applications that any cook can deal with.  As a result, my choice fell on ONE application, which seemed to me quite universal.  And here began my torments of creativity.  Rather cruel and merciless hemispheric struggle. <br>  Left: <br>  - So beautiful! <br>  Right: <br>  - Not a damn read your beauty !!! <br>  Left: <br>  -Text long, abbreviate! <br>  Right: <br>  -I can not all words are important, reduce the size! <br>  and so on.  Plus, the features and limitations of the designer interfered in all of this. <br>  If earlier I thought that this is the only client that can not agree with the designer, now I understand that everything is much worse in the field of mobile applications.  Imagine what the battle is between the creator of the idea, the designer and the programmer, not only Stalingrad.  But, about this I will write another small article, ‚Äúhow to do it right‚Äù. <br>  As a result, after repeated reworking of the content part, the visual part and the general algorithm of the action, the application acquired an almost complete look.  The stage of publishing and testing on real devices has arrived.  Here, of course, I almost became discouraged, since the process of publication, terminology and related things were completely incomprehensible to me.  2 weeks and the help of competent people did their job.  Finally, I baked my first ARC that started on my SGS2, that was luck!  It is working!!!  I remembered my childhood when I soldered the first radio receiver from the designer and it earned !!! <br>  In general, the man said - the man did! <br>  Proud of myself, put the application to my wife on HTC, showed how she can quickly figure out what is happening with the car ... <br>  The next day, call: <br>  -Dear, but what is the name of the application ???? <br><br>  And now let's rewind a little while ago, and go back to the 2nd person, that is, to me. <br>  It so happened that in addition to servers, desktops and other office pieces in my life, not a small part is occupied by a hobby in the form of diagnostics and car repairs.  Of course, I do it occasionally, but in the end, most of the time I still have to spend on communicating with people who willy-nilly found themselves in a car-care center and almost always sound almost the same questions.  By systematizing all these issues, excluding from them obscene words and ambiguities, you can not get a very long list of the most common problems that car owners encounter at the most inappropriate moments. <br>  Naturally two different people, knowing about the torments of each other could not leave it just like that.  Adjusted for the fact that my programming knowledge is limited to small bash scripts, a couple of lines of php or perl code, for checking, so to speak, the next web server and the very remote youth of C language. <br>  No html5, css, flash, Objective-C - just hardcore! <br>  As a result, the initial development experience from the idea to the layout was obtained.  It turns out that 50kb structured text, written, it seems to me, the most accessible language of automotive orientation for the uninitiated average person, the task of incredible complexity.  After all, it would seem that you have a very simple goal: take note of the list of faults, and briefly, almost in tweet format, write a short guide, or rather not a guide, but an indication of what to do next.  But you need to do this in such a way that your text is clear to everyone: from those who are driving the first day to those who are already without your help can make an accurate diagnosis. <br><br>  Something like this, word by word, the text-description and text-decryption for the application was born.  Without exaggeration - more than 2 months of painstaking rearrangement, replacement, again permutation, reinterpretation of words written by you. <br>  And then pure routine: all the designer to collect, prepare pictures.  And dive into the abyss of the requirements google.play and AppStore.
