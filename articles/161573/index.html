  <section class="page js-page"><h1>After the planes and rules</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was going to write a comment, but imperceptibly grew a whole post. <br><br>  I do not agree with half the points and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161563/">this topic</a> , but these are my personal troubles. <br>  In addition, the most important is missing - ‚ÄúAvoid putting anything in the baggage at all costs‚Äù.  I have long, for a long time, used exclusively backpack and ‚Äúunloading‚Äù on all trips.  There is one reason - among my acquaintances, probably half have already become victims of non-delivery of baggage.  Some even twice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will show with an example that I use: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">First, the backpack</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="http://intranet.tatonka.com/infosys/bilder/300/1540015a.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  It should be a practical comfortable backpack, with a volume of about 30 liters.  I prefer the configuration ‚Äúone big department and three or four side pockets for small things‚Äù.  Go to the store for a backpack, take with you the weight and about the same junk set that you will wear in it.  Carefully choose a backpack so that it will be in time for your back and shoulders.  Load it up and walk around the store for 10-15 minutes.  No discomfort should appear.  Otherwise, you will then curse yourself for this purchase.  If you show something for the fact that you "use unpaid goods" send these <s>m</s> crankies to yuh and go to the next store.  Remember, the right backpack is your healthy back. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Secondly, a vest with pockets.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fe/283/68e/6fe28368e88b374e2bbe0c7eddf16f62.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  It shoves all the scattering of electronic gadgets and metal objects such as keys, coins, <s>grenades and pistols</s> .  Why vest?  Because on inspection it is easier to remove the entire vest and send it along the tape to the ‚Äúlumen‚Äù than to unload a minute or two into the box in front of the frame and then load it back. <br>  UPD: Reminded about the excellent company <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/">www.scottevest.com</a> - a great outfit traveler. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Thirdly, cargo pants.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a03/c53/446/a03c534466c70ab733364ba10a22aa79.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  In them, too, a lot of things you can throw.  Especially if the pockets are conveniently made. <br>  In the pants I recommend putting only paper and essentials, type, documents, cards, wallet, scarves and spare socks.  And, thus, to unload in 10 seconds.  Because on the framework they require pockets to be completely emptied.  One day they tried to hold me back when I didn‚Äôt get a toothbrush out of my side pocket. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Special bags.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It happens that a backpack is not enough.  Then they save the waist bags, fastened to the leg.  Like these ones: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a3/c6d/370/7a3c6d3707a911908689d633535e9f04.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Like a vest, it is thrown off onto the tape, then quickly put back on.  No hemorrhoids with discharge. <br></div></div>

      In total, it is possible to put on your own pockets about 5-6 kg of non-tariffable weight.  Very useful, given the tendency to reduce baggage allowance in ticket prices.  For low-fires, where there is no free baggage at all, a trick with pockets becomes extremely useful for a wallet. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Different tricks.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In principle, even folding things like multitools can be brought in a backpack.  I drove several times, tying them to the laptop's PSU with wires.  On a scanner, it looks like a lump of electronic junk with something parallelepiped in the center.  As a rule, do not dig out.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that sooner or later, the sentinel will take away this gadget from you because of the presence of cutting parts.  Personally, it was taken from me by the Kazakhs, who had a broken light and inspected their luggage with handles. <br><br>  If you are flying long and with long docks: <br>  Buy two or three of the cheapest toothbrushes and ‚Äúcharge‚Äù them with toothpaste, pressing it into the bristles.  You can brush your teeth anywhere, anytime, anywhere.  Alternatively, you can take one brush and ‚Äúprobe‚Äù toothpaste.  But it's hard to find.  5 "charged" brushes weigh less than one standard paste tube. <br><br>  Take a pair of "sneakers".  They are not prohibited anywhere.  Will help survive the horse prices zhrachku at the airport. <br><br>  Stock up with soap wipes individually wrapped.  Pieces 20 - approx.  They are not visible on the scanners, so they do not dig up.  Allow yourself to be kept in relative order. <br><br>  Fly to a country whose language you do not know or know very bad?  Googling pictures for all occasions and make them a notebook.  You can in two seconds with pictures explain to people what you need.  Extremely useful thing. <br><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful things if you fly to wild places.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d27/519/1cb/d275191cb8f90e30f934c5a80c6083bf.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  The bracelet (survival bracelet) - 4 meters high strength cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b69/ec8/8fe/b69ec88fe52a5096aa5d3af8ba0e16a6.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Belt (Survival belt) - 30+ meters of the same cord.  things are done in the evening.  Full yutub instructions.  Utility in an extreme situation - is infinite. <br><br><img src="http://images.outdoorpros.com/images/prod/5/Brunton-81-100700-rw-13834-31367.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Magnesium flint is a very useful thing to make fire in wild places.  They did not take away from me and did not ask about it. <br><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What not to do ever.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Never carry an umbrella with you.  Forget it.  In the best case - just take away.  At worst - you will open the skull with a rusty nail and scoop out the brain with a teaspoon (hello, Al).  A raincoat costs a dollar and weighs 30 grams.  Better take five raincoats with you if you need to protect yourself from the rain. <br><br>  Never carry a rope in a skein.  I do not know why, but they dig out.  Unless you are a climber.  But they all fly in the luggage, as a rule.  If you assume the need for ropes, make yourself a piece of a spoiler about wild places. <br><br>  Do not take with you what you can buy on the spot and is inexpensive.  Cowards, socks, soap-rylnoe, lighters and other trash.  This is all the excess weight that you need for inspection.  No liquids, no food. <br><br>  Medicines should be exclusively in their own packaging with instructions for use.  There are no syringes (exceptions can only be for emergency injectors in allergic people, but get ready for a long and tedious explanation of what it is and why it does not explode).  Take a cassette for tablets, but empty.  Bandages = ropes = problems.  Bandages do not take. <br><br>  No glass.  At all.  Even if it is a gift to the local leader.  Even if it is a gift from the local leader.  Especially, if it is a gift of the leader.  On the road, this will certainly prove to be a national treasure, and the Congolese prison - the last place on the planet where you would like to live, you can be sure. <br><br>  No food and, in general, never any vegetation.  No seeds.  At best, you will be dealing with environmentalists.  At worst - with the local GOC.  Bike Zadornov about the bath broom - it's "flowers." <br><br>  If you are going to Africa - do not take any tobacco, even if you smoke three packs a day.  Because at the exit from the airport you will be asked to light a cigarette and you will out of habit give a cigarette.  Hi, everyone - you stuck at least five hundred bucks.  Because in three minutes you will be arrested and a grateful Negro will poke a finger at you and say that you just gave him a cigarette charged by a select Afghan and show ‚Äúthis same cigarette‚Äù of the same brand that you have.  Even if it was Belomor. <br></div></div><br><br>  And finally, I want to remind you separately that the inspection is very biased with respect to any oblong (and flattened) objects on the body.  Tubes, sticks, nail files, rope, throw in the backpack, nykayut among the wires tight straps to look like hell-knows what, but safe. <br><br>  Yes, perhaps with such equipment you will look like great Anatoly, but it will be convenient for you, and this is the main thing.  You don't give a damn about cranks in Hawaii and suitcases the size of a gazelle thinking about you, right?  After all, you will not spend a single second after the passport control at the airport at the airport, and immediately go about your business. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Postscript: why is it worth staying at the airport?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Go to the help desk, where there can be a single person speaking a familiar language for the surrounding thousand kilometers, and find out the following things: <br>  1. Where and how to call during a robbery, fire, appendicitis. <br>  2. Where is your consulate, addresses and phone numbers. <br>  3. The basic rules of conduct in the country, if you have not yet read them. <br>  4. Map of the destination city and the country as a whole, if you go further (where to buy). <br>  5. Mark points 1 and 2 on the map. <br>  6. Where to take a normal taxi (not applicable to Africa, except for South Africa). <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161573/</a></p>
