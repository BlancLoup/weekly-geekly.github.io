      <i>What are the advantages of the MUK group of companies working with Cisco?</i> <br><br>  You should start with a story about Cisco itself.  Since its founding in 1986, a huge amount of investment has been made in research and development of solutions for many market segments.  From the very beginning, Cisco is always trying to be on the crest of a wave in IT innovation.  During 2010 alone, 4 billion were invested in the development of new products and technologies.  Cisco is the leader in the IP communications segment, the company owns the lion's share of the global telecommunications market.  Cisco always looks to the future a few steps ahead and relies on technologies that become dominant in the market in a year or two. <br><br>  On the other hand, Cisco itself creates all the conditions for the development of promising technologies, being a trendsetter in the field of IT.  Cisco products today cover areas of security, unified communications (including video conferencing and web conferencing), switching, wireless data transmission, servers and storage systems and, of course, routing, with which Cisco started.  Thanks to Cisco, the corporate IP telephony market began to grow rapidly. <br><br>  Until now, many companies simply do not realize the benefits of buying Cisco IP telephony.  The cost of ownership of the system must be calculated, taking into account that the user will save large amounts on long-distance and international calls: voice over IP telephony uses only the Internet channel, which is quite cheap today, while the necessary bandwidth may not exceed tens of kilobits.  Many companies that have a branched structure, switching to IP-telephony, save up to millions of hryvnas on a fixed line, so this decision pays off in a year and a half, more than that, after that it works for the customer.  In addition, IP-based technologies allow you to manage content directly from your phone ‚Äî use XML applications.  On the screen, you can display, for example, changes in exchange rates or other content.  There are special applications through which you can dial a number with one click of the mouse.  There is also a rather convenient solution, thanks to which you can see the status of the subscriber - online, went away, do not disturb - as in instant messengers.  If a person is busy, he can change his status to ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù so that he is not distracted from an important task. <br><br>  Also, do not forget that IP telephony solutions are tightly integrated with video telephony solutions, any Cisco IP PBX is ready for video calling.  All this saves a lot of time of employees, working time, which is expensive, especially when it comes to senior managers - every minute of their work on the account, and should be used as efficiently as possible for the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/9f7/c99/f679f7c99605df5e76eead489532c6ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I would also like to note that Cisco has managed to build one of the best service and technical support systems in the world, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Technical support employees are available by phone (toll free global numbers), via the Web or via email.  There is a system of escalation / prioritization of requests and quality control of service, which helps to maintain the leading position.  In addition, there is a system of special service warehouses all over the world, which is serviced by delivery, DHL is one of the leaders in this field. <br><br>  <i>Are there any areas of the telecommunications market where there is no Cisco?</i> <br><br>  The areas of the telecommunications market, where Cisco is not present - I can not remember.  Recently, Cisco has headed for the mass market.  If earlier it was a carrier segment, serious carrier-class solutions and large corporate sector, and only advanced system administrators knew the word ‚ÄúCisco‚Äù, now Cisco has become much closer to the average consumer.  The company has simplified the logo, added the slogan Welcome to the Human Network and began to develop the SOHO segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99f/628/c6b/99f628c6b047949e6f0b7b6df09c90b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>What exactly Cisco products and services might be interesting for ordinary users?</i> <br><br>  Cisco is expanding its line not only in the direction of corporate solutions, but also in the direction of small and medium-sized businesses.  For example, the purchase of the company Linksys, which used to produce equipment for small, including home, networks.  The top product line of Linksys, called Cisco Small Business, is already developing as part of the Cisco brand.  This line represents solutions for small organizations and advanced home users at an affordable price, while at the same time maintaining high quality.  Recently, Cisco has been betting on the development of its products in this segment, thereby stimulating the introduction of innovative technologies in our life.  In Ukraine, more and more providers are starting to provide such IPTV services, Video-on-demand, content sharing and information storage services, and IP telephony projects are launched for home users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/876/ff4/d6a/876ff4d6a6676ae1bec888e5f360919b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>What are the benefits of working with the MUK group of companies in delivering Cisco products?</i> <br><br>  Of course, several distributors offer Cisco solutions, but only the MUK group of companies has taken the path of development as a Value Added distributor and is now the market leader in quality technical support from partners.  Our company also differs from the rest with the most comprehensive approach to the Cisco brand: Cisco has acquired many companies whose equipment and products are not supplied as part of the contract of the standard Cisco distributor.  And only in the package of proposals of the MUK group of companies you will find almost all the products to which the Cisco company is related: Cisco Tandberg, Cisco IronPort, Zoom, VMware, ‚ÄúBulava‚Äù.  At the same time, our highly qualified specialists are ready to develop a comprehensive solution for any level of complexity free of charge, subject to delivery through the MUK.  We are always ready to help substantiate the optimality of the solution proposed by us both from the technical side and from the point of view of end-user business objectives. <br><br>  I will say a few words about each of the aforementioned brands. <br>  Back in 2009, the MUK group of companies signed a distribution contract with the Tandberg company.  And not by chance: on February 1, 2011, Cisco completed the process of acquiring Tandberg and expanded its package of proposals in this direction, ensuring that leadership in the communications segment remains: recently, video conferencing solutions have become increasingly popular. <br>  Indeed, the introduction of video conferencing provides great savings.  Top managers of several large Ukrainian companies have already calculated how much they spend on air travel and how much a video conferencing solution costs, and they saw that the savings on flights would amount to numbers with many zeros.  There are no restrictions in the form of seats on flights, weather conditions and other force majeure circumstances - at any time you can gather a large audience of people from different parts of the country or the world.  At the same time, all participants of the meeting will see each other, and high quality of communication (up to Full HD) will create the maximum effect of presence. <br><br>  As for Cisco IronPort solutions, they allow companies of any size to produce high-quality web and email filtering, protecting against spam, viruses, phishing and information leaks - from anything that could threaten the information security of an enterprise from IT. <br><br>  MUK is also the exclusive supplier of the product called Mace - a module that is compatible with popular Cisco routers and allows you to build secure VPN tunnels using encryption algorithms that are designed according to Ukrainian GOST (DSTU).  I note that the majority of similar products on the market use American encryption standards 3DES and AES - the law prohibits the use of such devices in state organizations for the transmission of sensitive information and secure commercial networks that must be certified according to Ukrainian information protection regulations. <br><br>  In addition, the company MUK distributes products of such a manufacturer as Zoom, which is a technological partner of Cisco - the companies cooperate in the field of development.  Zoom products provide call logging / recording, and is fully integrated with the Cisco Call Manager solution and the Cisco Contact Center. <br><br>  Offering innovative Cisco server solutions, MUK is ready to offer VMware software to its customers.  This market leader in the virtualization segment has recently worked closely with Cisco in the context of data center solutions.  And only at MUK, a comprehensive solution of Cisco Unified Computer System and VMWare can be purchased from one source. <br><br>  I would also like to emphasize that the MUK company, distributing Cisco solutions, which are mainly active network equipment, offers its customers also passive Molex network equipment.  This allows our partners to purchase all the components at the MUK to build an integrated network solution, receiving comprehensive pricing and service support. <br><br>  If necessary, partners in the MUK can additionally purchase also devices for providing uninterrupted power, software for building databases and many other solutions from A-brands. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119519/</a></p>
