  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About social search without images</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  What is the idea? </h5><br>  To process the links issued by the search engine for mentioning in social networks, attach a bit of mathematics and build them in a slightly different order than Google suggests.  The basis of the algorithm was originally based on which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval">reddit.com</a> calculates its trends.  In fact, the algorithm is quite complex and repeatedly described, but at the same time it actually works.  The problem was that it is based on the pros and cons, and we initially only have pluses, that is, we only have likes and tweets.  Therefore, the disadvantages I replaced the number of visitors to the site.  The idea, if greatly exaggerated, is about the same: the number of visitors minus likes and the smaller the resulting figure, the higher its status. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Based on Google and Bing search results.  As a social component of Facebook and Twitter (I would like more participants, but others have something really bad with the API).  As the number of visitors to the API API. <br><br>  Next, take the above formula and run each resulting link from a search engine through it: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a01/151/a1b/a01151a1bfea37f049c85e80bb491bd2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It would be foolish not to use the ranking algorithms of the search engines themselves.  Therefore, the result is still divided by the search factor which is calculated very simply: <br><br>  <b>google + bing</b> <br><br>  Then you should simply sort the results and output them to the user (I decided to display only the first 15 results) <br><br>  During the evening, I coded, launched, looked and decided that this should be seen outside of localhost.  In principle, the results were to some extent expected.  I always guessed that SEO does not stop there, but that huskies can bring such dissonance to the issue I did not expect. <br><br><h5>  So what happened? </h5><br>  It turned out what was expected and wanted to get.  That is, if you are looking for an apartment in Moscow, then there and there you will see realtor cantors.  But in the first case, there will be those in which property is more often mentioned, and in the second case, those for which there are more likes and tweets.  The results with public figures are also encouraging, the people obviously love the negative more. <br><br>  The results of the work can be seen on <a href="http://mfrscc.appspot.com/">mfrscc.appspot.com</a> .  Anticipating the question immediately answer these letters that do not mean anything.  Just when registering a domain, 5 letters were randomly typed, and fortunately the domain was free. <br><br><h5>  What problems can you face? </h5><br>  Possible bugs, exceptions and interruptions (brakes) with hosting.  In IE does not work.  Well, they themselves understand that it works much slower than Google for obvious reasons. <br><br>  For husky special thanks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143965/</a></p>
