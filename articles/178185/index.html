    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Processor cores </h2><br>  In our new pools, we started using Intel Xeon E5 processors.  They are 50% more powerful than previous processors.  This means that now you have one and a half times more productive VDS for the same price (pricing goes in processor cores)! <br><br>  The transition to the new generation of processors allowed the use of 4-channel memory, the bandwidth of which is almost 2 times the previous memory type! <br><br><h2>  SSD drives </h2><br>  After the launch of VDS, it became obvious that the disk subsystem is the weakest link.  Therefore, for new virtual servers, we began to use vaults completely on SSD disks.  It is expensive, but much faster! <br><br>  Prices for customers for the service with the transition to SSD do not change. <br><br><h2>  Appeared mail. </h2><br>  Users of our virtual hosting are used to the fact that the e-mail service is included in the main service and does not even think that it can be provided separately. <br><br>  Those of our customers who started using VDS often ask us a question - how to post mail.  They are ready to administer web services, they know how to configure NGINX and Apache for themselves, they know how to scale the load.  But mail is another matter, which is why we offered our customers to use our powerful mail cluster. <br><br>  As part of the VDS update, we added an email service.  Now it is possible to connect mail for management through a single panel with a single click.  And the creation and configuration of the boxes has become very simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f9/518/f63/5f9518f63ab8013ee601393bdaee796c.png"><br><br>  As part of mailbox management, you can access various TIMEWEB mailbox functions.  In addition, you can use our webmail, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/timeweb/blog/162903/">announced in December</a> , to work with mail. <br><br><h2>  Card binding </h2><br>  We all know very well that payment by plastic card is one of the most convenient payment methods.  We decided to simplify the payment for services by entering regular automatic payment, it is convenient. <br><br>  If you are allowed to withdraw money from your card automatically, then upon reaching a certain threshold - the money will be debited as payment for the next month of work.  You will receive SMS and email about the operation. <br><br>  However, we do not store your credit card details.  The payment system simply repeats the successfully completed payment with a new amount, which ensures the maximum degree of protection of your personal data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff6/ac4/8bf/ff6ac48bf5d42d2f75d1e173e8ef1727.png"><br><br><h2>  VDS cloning </h2><br>  For our clients building high-load solutions on dozens of virtual servers, we have prepared the possibility of cloning VDS.  This feature has reduced the time required to scale the cluster.  Now you can copy several virtual machines and, after making the necessary changes to the server configuration, immediately include them in the cluster.  Deploying scalable systems has become much easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8f/3f9/e67/d8f3f9e67604d334cd4c87783b760976.png"><br><br><h2>  Automatic snapshot creation </h2><br>  What can be more tiresome than manually creating snapshots everyday?  =) We have automated the backup process.  Now you can adjust the number of copies and the frequency of backups.  You are protected from possible failures. <br><br>  We have significantly reduced the price of snapshots.  Now the storage of 1 Gigabyte will cost you only 4 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/962/7f3/e51/9627f3e51a379c7cfdb1113e5a35fad2.png"><br><br><h2>  CD boot and single user boot </h2><br>  One of the first features that we introduced after the previous announcement.  It allows you to perform a number of operations that are impossible in the normal boot mode.  Here is a brief list of the main tasks that this feature solves: <br><br><ul><li>  change root password; </li><li>  change the size of the main disk; </li><li>  system recovery after failure; </li><li>  root file system check. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d07/43a/158/d0743a1588ac42bb59c8adf365badf2b.png"><br><br><h2>  Updated OS set </h2><br>  We analyzed the popularity of installing operating systems on VDS and conducted a number of replacements.  Were removed rarely used operating systems such as Scientific linux and added new, more popular (Ubuntu 12.10, Fedora 18). <br><br><h2>  API </h2><br>  From the very start of the service, there have been many requests for an API.  It was in our plans, so we were happy to engage in its development.  The API works on the principle of POST requests, which makes it easy to write requests in any programming language. <br><br>  API documentation is available at: <a href="http://help.timeweb.ru/api/">help.timeweb.ru/api</a> <br><br><h2>  User documentation for the service </h2><br>  We have expanded the service documentation to include the most frequent scenarios for using VDS, some new operations that have become possible in the updated panel (for example, changing the size of the main disk), as well as the traditional FAQ that will help answer frequent questions. <br><br><h2>  Development and plans </h2><br>  We are not satisfied with what has already been achieved and continue to work on improving the VDS service.  Follow the announcements on our website and blog on Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178185/</a></p>
