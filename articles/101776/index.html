  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spintronic media - who is the author?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.sciam.ru/2008/1/img/phisical.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have always been interested in new products in the world of technology, in particular, information technology.  A few days ago, on the 10th of August, I read on the <a href="http://www.fian-inform.ru/%3Fmode%3Dmnews%26id%3D635%26page%3D1">LPI page</a> interesting information about spintronic structures, which make it possible to create the latest non-volatile magnetoresistive data carriers.  The essence of the method is the use of not only the electron charge, but also the spin of the electron, which, as is well known, can be controlled by means of a magnetic field.  As a result of the creation of the newest nanostructures ‚Äúferromagnet - insulator - ferromagnet‚Äù on the basis of FeSix, MgO and FeOy, the realization of real information carriers that work on this principle is possible.  In general, the case is necessary, new media are needed more than ever.  But another thing is also interesting - today I found a publication (approximately the same time as the Russian one) on the <a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/spindata.htm">pages of the Ohio State University website</a> , where what I have already read on the FIAN website repeats word for word.  The point is not in the idea itself, but in the fact that the scientists of the first and second organizations created similar models of the spintron system. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In general, there is usually nothing strange in the fact that research organizations working in roughly the same field make similar discoveries.  But there‚Äôs a lot of coincidence here.  Not only do scientists explain their discoveries about spintronic nanotechnology with almost identical words, but both publications appeared in early August (of course, both universities are located in different time zones, so the publication time is different).

      Interestingly, in Ohio State University there are such ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù last names and first names as Arthur Epstein and Vladimir Prigogine.  Not a word, not a half-word that universities of the Russian Federation and the United States collaborated on this issue, no - but at first one would think that these two teams of science partners decided to publish their work in separate journals so that was quickly noticed by the scientific world.  But, as we see, it seems to be two independent teams of scientists who published the results of identical studies on the same day. <br><br>  Generally speaking, at first I wanted to publish on Habr√© a review of this interesting technology, after reading the original source in Russian.  He began to rummage in English-language sources, and that's what happened as a result - we find it seems like the same thing, published by completely different people. <br><br>  An interesting case, how do you think?  Perhaps someone from habravchan in the course of events and can explain how it happened what happened?  Or it is worth fighting with copy-paste not only in Habr√©, but also in serious scientific journals (although, there, copy-paste is also quite a lot, especially in the humanitarian fields).  Or is it generally a normal case, and there is nothing strange in what is happening ... <br><br>  I would very much like to know who the author really is, who is the leader in this discovery?  Somehow it is not very hard to believe that such highly specialized studies in almost identical conditions give identical results in two different teams, which, apparently, work independently of each other.  In any case, an interesting situation, even if it is a coincidence.  If, nevertheless, these are really two independent teams, we can see how identical initial data lead to identical results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101776/</a></p>
