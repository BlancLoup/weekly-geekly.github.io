  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The results of the action with Groupon. Practical experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several months now I have been developing <a href="http://langnote.net/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreference%26utm_campaign%3DRussia">LangNote.net</a> , a service that allows me to improve a foreign language.  The essence of the service is extremely simple: users write a note in a foreign language, the teacher checks it for errors and returns the corrected version with its comments.  Edits and comments are highlighted visually for ease of reference. <br><br>  A month ago, I decided to hold a promotion with a collective shopping service to speed up the promotion of Langnote.  After a bit of analysis, the choice fell on Grupon, and the action took place on September 16.  Already, the results show that such services can be used to significantly accelerate the business at the startup stage.  This will be discussed in the article below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why did you need a special offer? </h4><br>  Since the launch of the <a href="http://langnote.net/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreference%26utm_campaign%3DRussia">LangNote</a> service <a href="http://langnote.net/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreference%26utm_campaign%3DRussia">, the</a> main promotion tool was contextual advertising, which, with a budget of 2,000 rubles a week, gave an average of 300 transitions to the site, about 30 registrations and two users who started writing notes.

      At the first stage of <a href="http://langnote.net/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreference%26utm_campaign%3DRussia">LangNote, the</a> main issues for me were: a) the presence of value in a fairly new product for the audience and b) how to manage limited IT resources (choose the right steps for development).  To answer these critical questions needed writing users in large numbers, and as soon as possible.  The speed of 2 users per week for 1000 rubles for each, of course, was unsatisfactory: I did not want to wait for several months. <br><br>  As stated services like Group, they can quickly lead new customers.  In return, you are required to make a discount of at least 50% to the price of services.  I figured out the conditions and decided to hold the action. <br><br><h4>  Essence of the action </h4><br>  The structure of the action was offered by the manager Groupon.  The choice offered options: <br><ul><li>  75% discount (250 instead of 690 rubles) for the smallest set of 10 notes. </li><li>  80% discount (300 instead of 1190 rubles) for an average set of 20 notes </li><li>  a discount of up to 85% (350 rubles instead of 1690 rubles) for a large package of 30 notes, which is enough for an average of three to four months. </li></ul><br>  For their services, Groupon takes 50% of the funds raised.  With this in mind, in all the proposed options I received less cost, i.e.  went into minus.  The biggest minus came out in the case of the maximum package of 30 notes - about -700 rubles.  It was also taken into account that not all who bought use the packages of notes completely, and the real losses will decrease. <br><br>  See how the action looked, you can <a href="http://www.groupon.ru/moscow/langnote">here</a> .  On the day of sales, it hung almost in the last place among the new shares of the day.  The action was national - that is, in all cities where Grupon is present. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  In the presentation, Groupon promises the following benefits: <br><ol><li>  new customers </li><li>  word of mouth (friends of new customers) </li><li>  advertising to a multimillion audience (e-mail newsletter) </li><li>  additional sales </li></ol><br>  Let's go in order: <br><br><h5>  1) new customers </h5><br>  The action hung on the site one day (Friday).  By the end of the day, 132 coupons were sold (under the terms of the promotion, one coupon per customer).  Most bought expensive packages of 30 notes. <br><br><img src="http://weallwant.ru/pics/2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Total revenue amounted to 32,300 rubles, half of which, with 100% activation of coupons, will be transferred to me by groups. <br><br>  The system allows you to see details about customers: <br><br>  Gender and age distribution of buyers: <br><br><img src="http://weallwant.ru/pics/3.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://weallwant.ru/pics/5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From which cities buyers: <br><br><img src="http://weallwant.ru/pics/4.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  2) word of mouth </h5><br>  It is too early to draw conclusions: the majority of those who bought just started using the service, and if the radio works, it will be a little later.  Nevertheless, you can look at the "likes" on Facebook and VKontakte.  On the day of the promotion, LangNote earned about 10 likes there and there.  Trifle, but nice! <br><br><h5>  3) advertising on a multimillion audience </h5><br>  Find out how many people paid attention to the action, it is impossible.  Therefore, you can analyze the transitions to the site.  On the day of the action, 1893 people switched to the site.  Just over a week after the event, 2500 people arrived (the link to the action is stored in the ‚Äúpast actions‚Äù and in the distribution letters).  The distribution looks pikoobrazno with a peak on the day of the action on the group's main page.  By the way, with the context only transitions would cost 16 000 r. <br><br><img src="http://weallwant.ru/pics/1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the day of the promotion, 218 registrations of new users were received.  Approximately half of the users registered, used the test free note, without buying anything from the stock.  These registrations can be considered ‚Äúfree‚Äù, but in the case of context they would cost about 6,000 rubles. <br><br><h5>  4) additional sales </h5><br>  Talk about add.  Sales is too early: most coupons who have bought have not yet used all the notes in the packages.  Nevertheless, it is already clear that many users are not in a hurry to use the purchased coupons: after 3 weeks only 60% of those who bought them activated their coupons.  Most likely, the rest have not yet reached their hands, and in the future the number will increase. <br><br><h5>  Additional value - comments on the groupon site and jobseeker resume </h5><br>  In addition to all the above, I received feedback.  Responding to the comments to the action, the Group support service contacted me and asked questions.  From such questions it turned out to extract a lot of useful things and to understand well how potential customers perceive the product. <br><br>  In addition to clients, the action attracted teachers: I received a resume from 4 specialists who wanted to start cooperation. <br><br><h4>  Dry residue </h4><br>  So, at the moment, the results of the action for me were: <br><ol><li>  2500 new visitors to the site </li><li>  218 new user registrations in one day </li><li>  already about 150 people have already started writing notes </li><li>  4 teachers' resumes </li><li>  a large number of feedback and suggestions </li></ol><br>  Using the context, I would pay about 150,000 rubles for a similar number of users who started writing notes.  In a campaign with groupon, I made an offer below cost and the actual amount of expenses will depend on how many users use their packages of notes completely.  In this case, the costs will not be exactly more than 90 000 rubles, and this is already quite profitable than the context. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that I received the results for the action very quickly (for 1 day) and ‚Äúforward‚Äù, and I will pay for them later. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  As the manager told me later, the financial effect of the action was not very interesting for Grupon and further cooperation in the same format would be impossible in the near future. <br><br>  For my part, I‚Äôll say that everyone draws their own conclusions, but I was quite pleased with the results: the promotion was cheaper than with the help of contextual advertising, and a tangible impetus for the development of a still very young project quickly turned out.  Now I am inclined to believe that collective purchasing services, despite their disgraced reputation, can be quite useful for young projects, especially when it is necessary to set a good start at no great expense. <br><br>  And a few words about LangNote.  The project is developing further, now I know that users want to choose which language to receive comments on notes, as well as to be able to respond to teachers on their comments.  There is a great interest in new languages, of which soon we will add German, Spanish and native Russian. <br><br>  I will be glad to answer questions and hear new offers.
