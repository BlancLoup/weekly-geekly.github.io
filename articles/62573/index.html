  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Preparation for certification on Linux / Unix. Step 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I had a desire to improve my knowledge in the field of Unix-like operating systems, and at the same time to receive a certificate, these skills confirm.  This is the first note from what I assume is a long cycle.  So far, just analyzing the information available on the Internet and some of my comments on this issue.  If you are thinking about certification with RedHat Linux, Sun Solaris, or other Unix-like operating systems, then you might be interested in reading this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that since long ago I was used to combining work and study.  And so, after receiving a diploma of higher education this winter, a certain hole was formed in life.  Do not think that I am a terrible nerd who spends all his free time in the wilds of Unix-like operating systems - no.  Simply, firstly, I used to always strive forward and learn something new, and secondly, I have enough free time for everything I want, but there is still quite a large margin that is a waste to waste. <br>  In addition to knowledge, I would like to receive after the end of the learning process also some beautiful paper confirming the presence of relevant skills. <br>  Having rummaged in the wilds of the Internet, I found two RedHat and Sun Solaris certification branches of interest to me. <br>  I was interested in the first direction because I have long been working with RedHat operating systems.  Often it turns out that the first thing that falls into the hands of a person, then becomes his favorite.  So, the first Linux that came into my hands was Fedora Core 4, and in an educational laboratory at the university where I was learning the basics of Linux, RedHat stood, which version I don‚Äôt even remember now.  As a result, the majority of servers configured and supported by me are running CentOS, and if Linux is required on the desktop, I install the latest version of Fedora without hesitation. <br>  The second one interests me since the last couple of years I have been very closely associated with Sun Microsystems: my graduation project was a development for OpenSolaris, I even received a grant from the OpenSolaris.org community.  And, moreover, I was fortunate enough to perform this year at Sun Tech Days, but that‚Äôs another story.  The development has temporarily stopped, but in the near future I plan to continue it, take the project out of the alpha stage and bring it to mind.  After working for almost a year with OpenSolaris as the only operating system, albeit with various difficulties and problems, I was able to find applications for almost all of the desktop needs I needed and make sure that there are many serious advantages in this OS.  So here the desire to learn no less, although the skills, of course, less. <br><br>  So, we will begin our path to certification with the study of available information.

      <b>RedHat.</b> <br>  Everything is painted in sufficient detail on the official website of the company, and in Russian a sufficiently detailed description is available on the <a href="http://www.rhd.ru/certification.html">website of the Invent company</a> .  Nothing unexpected was found in this information: to pass certification, you must have knowledge of operating system features and skills in working with basic system utilities, network configuration, diagnostics and repair problems, installation and configuration of various software: client and server.  Detailed information is available at the link above. <br>  In addition to the materials on the official website, various <a href="https://www.redhat.com/apps/training/assess/">tests</a> are available (after registration) <a href="https://www.redhat.com/apps/training/assess/">for checking the level of training</a> .  Certification on the RHCT is not very interesting, I would like to immediately RHCE, therefore, I decided to immediately pass all three tests presented to test knowledge in this area.  The first - ‚ÄúRedHat Linux Essentials‚Äù - succumbed without any problems, saying that in almost all parameters my knowledge corresponds to the level of ‚ÄúDeep Understanding‚Äù.  The second and third - ‚ÄúRed Hat System Administration‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Hat Network and Security‚Äù - that knowledge is not bad, but learning from before passing the exam would not hurt.  While passing the tests, I discovered several interesting points for myself: <br>  - digging into the depths of the configuration files of all sorts of sophisticated server applications by interfacing them with each other and tracking logs, you often forget quite simple things, so preparation should begin with repeating simple things. <br>  - in the test questions a lot of attention is paid to small details that are rarely used with work with a real system.  Of course, I could be wrong, but personally for all the time I work with UNIX-like systems I have never had to use the ‚Äúchattr + i‚Äù command, so the question is: what does it do?  - put me in a dead end.  Therefore, the second thing that you need to pay attention to when preparing is small, seemingly irrelevant details. <br>  - In the tests, often, there are very strange questions.  For example: how one parameter or another is defined in the application's default configuration file.  Honestly, I never paid attention to the default settings, so such questions put me at a standstill. <br>  However, these tests have a very weak relation to the exam itself.  As far as I know, the examiner is provided with a computer with already installed RedHat Enterprise Linux, on which he performs tasks for 3.5 hours. <br><br>  <b>Solaris</b> <br>  Sun certifications are a bit more interesting and confusing. <br>  Unlike RedHat, you cannot begin certification with passing the exam that you want.  You must start from the first step - Sun Certified System Administrator. <br>  There is little information on the official website, but there is a <a href="http://sailearningconnection.skillport.com/">special portal</a> where you can register, view a list of courses and exams, select the items of interest and (!) Get the necessary materials for preparation.  RedHat materials are provided exclusively for a fee (and rather rather big). <br>  Also, tests are provided for knowledge of the OS, and in this case they are much more complicated and more useful than those of RedHat.  This is understandable: at Sun, these tests are actually exam tasks, that is, passing the test will objectively show you the level of your knowledge and the degree of readiness for the exam.  I will say straight away: the level of my knowledge did not allow me to successfully pass the preliminary exam, which is quite natural: the level of knowledge of the features of Solaris is not very high.  Confident user, who knows many useful things for the administrator, but before being fully guided in the system user, who knows exactly what and how, I still need to learn what I am going to do. <br><br>  <b>About prices.</b> <br>  Prices are somewhat biting.  In RH especially. <br>  For the opportunity to pass the RHCE exam, you will have to pay $ 570 or 14,500 rubles for different versions (on the official website, the figure is generally $ 799).  And if you also want to go through at least an accelerated course of study, then prepare 35-40 thousand rubles at once. <br>  Sun is a bit nicer. <br>  The exam consists of 2 parts, the cost of each - $ 150.  At the same time, if you are a student, if you try, you can get a serious discount and pay all the $ 60 for the exam. (RH has a similar discount of only 10% of the cost).  But the prices for preparatory courses are no less repulsive: from $ 800 for 4-5 days. <br><br>  <b>So:</b> <br>  - Despite the fairly extensive skills with Unix-like operating systems, preparation for certification will be quite difficult and time consuming <br>  - Prices for training courses for me personally are somewhat overestimated.  Objectively, this is most likely due to the fact that in global practice the employer pays for such training.  I will have to pay for it myself, so I will have to prepare at home. <br>  - I would like to get both certificates, but I‚Äôll still start with RedHat: the level of training is higher, and the additional knowledge gained during the preparation process will undoubtedly be useful in obtaining a Sun certificate. <br><br>  In subsequent notes I will cover the details of the preparation, useful settings and other interesting points that I encountered in the process.  I think it may be useful to someone in the future. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62573/</a></p>
