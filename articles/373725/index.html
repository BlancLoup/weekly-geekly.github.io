    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  A game with original art, original music, original idea, original mechanics, original everything.  In a certain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_(%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">kingdom</a> , in a certain state, there lived triangular amoebas called, suddenly, triamoes.  Once six triameb decided to merge together, and it turned out a hexagonal thing called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Volvoks</a> .  And the thing said: to be multicellular cool, let's evolve urgently.  Triamebobi scratched the cell membranes with flagella and decided - and let's.  But since the creatures are still not very smart, they will need the help of a player for this. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXYg2K1I6U0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  From a gameplay point of view, this is a game about rolling triangles.  Some sides of some triangles are marked green, the goal of each level is to combine these sides with the same green marks.  In the palette, however, there are other colors.  The yellow sides are sticky, sticking, triameba becomes motionless.  Reds are explosive;  in a triameboba with at least one such side, you can start <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7">apoptosis</a> , destroying it and everything that it adjoins in red.  The blue sides cancel the effect of any other parties ... In short, there is no time to explain, immediately go to Steam and buy this beauty. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.emu-land.net/consoles/dendy/roms%3Fact%3Dshowonly%26id%3D505">Fire'n ice</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d46/35c/4e7/d4635c4e712ea0588a6a82f229ee7003.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Out!  And we are transported more than twenty years ago.  In the ninety-third year of the last century, this game, also known as Solomon's Key 2, was released. However, if many people heard about Solomon's Key, the sequel went almost unnoticed.  And absolutely in vain.  I stumbled upon Fire'n Ice in the first year completely accidentally, going through all the games that came with the NES emulator, one by one.  I fell out of the reality of the clock for twelve, and this music still sometimes sounds in my head. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_jxlAcz3Qk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  That which makes you love this game is a great ice mechanic.  When you press the B button, the player‚Äôs character pokes the magic stick forward and down, creating or destroying an ice block there.  If you create ice next to other ice, the two blocks become one.  Single blocks can be pushed, while they slide until they hit on some obstacle.  When colliding with fire, the ice destroys it and disappears by itself.  In the course of the game, new and new properties of this amazing substance are found ... <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/530390/">Slayaway camp</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3b/f83/527/b3bf83527a2b382d4fde90d545120702.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you are a lover of puzzles and horror films at the same time, then this game is definitely for you.  In the role of a ruthless killer Cherepomordogo (or one of his unlocked comrades) you have to immerse yourself in the wonderful world of square splashes of blood and cubic violence.  As you can see, I usually try to post a gameplay video, but this time I just can‚Äôt deny myself the pleasure of sharing the official game trailer with my readers.  And at the same time once again look at it myself.  The trailer is great. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1ZAqYHDNtc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The essence of the gameplay retell with words.  It is based on the standard mechanics of ‚Äúmove in one of the four directions, until you rest in something.‚Äù  Cherepomordy makes a small addition: "if you put your weight on something alive, kill it in the most cruel way possible."  However, it is not necessary to kill personally.  If the Cherepomordy finds himself in a cage next to an innocent camp inhabitant, the latter will start to flee from him in horror.  Perhaps a fire will meet on his way.  Or mine.  Or a deep hole ... <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/MrJinx/talesworth-adventure-ep-1">Talesworth adventure</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd8/ef1/80c/bd8ef180cc66d21020942d4aa3f21a53.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Old enough flash toy in two parts.  The screenshot is taken from the second part, in the first chart it is even more unassuming.  And yet they are both very good.  Why?  Of course, because the gameplay. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCpnN_ejghE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The main character - Questy the Adventurer - has chosen the motto ‚Äúdementia and courage‚Äù.  You play for some kind of higher power, which seeks to save his life.  Throwing various objects along the level, one can (and should) control the behavior of Quiche, since it is completely determined.  As long as nothing prevents or distract, he will run forward.  Buried in a wall - turn right.  Seeing the gold - will run to the gold.  And so on and so forth. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/vadersb/paradoxion-express">Paradoxion</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/969/af1/079/969af1079c8a24833d840acda61fca6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A perfect illustration of why a modern copyright system is bad and piracy is justified.  About a year ago, when I decided to buy the favorite game of my youth for money, I found that it quietly, modestly, without any extra pump turned into abandonware status.  Simply put, it was impossible to legally purchase it.  The ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button on the official website did not work, they did not answer me in the support.  Now, right before writing these lines, I checked again, and the situation has changed: the official site has ceased to exist at all.  If it were not for the torrents and other nurseries of Varese, the world would have lost its masterpiece. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1QcQUqKecY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Paradoxion gives a new meaning to the concept of "trivryadka."  There is a field where balls are scattered.  The player must add a few more balls to the field so that in the end everything will disappear.  When three identical balls gather in a row, they disappear in a flash of light.  At the same time, they can push other balls, forming new combinations of three and potentially launching a chain reaction.  As you can tell from the gameplay video, then everything becomes more complicated, but the essence remains the same. <br><br>  Free version with fewer levels.  Interestingly, this is not just a stripped-down version of the main game, the levels in it are original, so it makes sense to go through it before / after the original. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1917983">Full and once paid version</a> <br><br>  and as a bonus: <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.blueskied.com/fruits.htm">Frozen fruits</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/027/17a/509/02717a50965e3243e3a07df74dd128b3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this game, only two things are remarkable.  First: she was once on the disk attachment to the magazine "Igromania".  Second: I once played it to the holes.  Hand on heart, I can not say that it corresponds to the name of the post, being the "best" puzzle.  On the other hand, in the part about ‚Äúnobody knows,‚Äù everything is damn true. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMCyOgjy_4c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You control the ball, and do it quite originally.  On the X axis, you can move it as you please, but the movement along the Y axis can only be accelerated or slowed down by a fixed amount, it can not be stopped or changed direction at will.  Faced with a block of its color, the ball destroys it.  The goal is to destroy all the blocks with fruits (apparently, the very frozen fruits).  Of course, this is a simplified description, the game is not so primitive, and there are many nuances, such as blocks, the destruction of which means losing, blocks, when rebounding from which the ball becomes uncontrollable, and other things in this spirit.  If you are fed up with modern gaming, go for it. <br><br>  I think that was enough.  I will take my leave. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373725/</a></p>
