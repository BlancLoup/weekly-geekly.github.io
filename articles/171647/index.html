It simplifies the analysis of customer service quality, reduces problem solving time, increases the level of protection of your data and makes collaborative work on projects more operational.  In addition to the implementation of new features, specialists have made more than a hundred different fixes. <br><br>  <b>Meet the spring updates!</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Work with contacts has become even more convenient.</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      Do you work with legal entities and individuals?  Now, writing down the phone number, the address of a new partner, client or contractor to ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù, you can sort the contacts - for this, check the box ‚Äúphysical‚Äù or ‚Äúlegal entity‚Äù. <br><br>  For convenience and flexibility of use, all types of contacts are brought to a single form.  All opportunities for individual, corporate and group contacts are preserved. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/175C51436C7FC005.png" alt="image"><br>  We need to urgently warn members of the working group to postpone the meeting, to schedule a meeting for the project partners?  Now you do it even faster - you do not have to search for the necessary contacts and send them information separately.  The new version of contacts in the ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù allows you to quickly send letters to several recipients at once or promptly ring them.  To do this, use the ability to quickly access the desired list of contacts - such lists can be created in advance by attaching several additional contacts to the main contact. <br><br>  <b>2. Confidential information on the lock - use even more flexible access settings in the tables.</b> <br><br>  Realizing that the company's internal information is one of its core values, Simple Business continues to improve the system for protecting confidential data.  In the new version, we added the function of delimiting access to information by columns in tables, for example, in the client database (CRM).  This means that now you will be able to determine which users will have access to read information, who will write it, and who will not get access to the data at all. <br><br>  To configure these settings, go to the Fields tab, select the employee you want, click on the selected field next to the last name and set the access level: ‚ÄúNo access‚Äù, ‚ÄúRead‚Äù, ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/1E634B936EAE63B2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3. Calling has become faster and easier - the choice of a telephone gateway has been implemented.</b> <br><br>  If you use ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù for several companies at once and often make calls on behalf of one or another organization, then your calls will become much more convenient.  Thanks to the new possibility of choosing a telephone gateway, before each call, you do not need to leave one organization and enter another to call.  Now an employee working on several lines can choose from which number the call will be made and from where the funds will be charged. <br><br>  Quickly, conveniently and clearly! <br><br>  <b>4. Do not miss any details of an important conversation - play phone call records at any time.</b> <br><br>  The new version of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù expanded the possibilities for analysis and prompt processing of customer calls.  You will be able to play a record of the negotiations at a convenient time for you, as well as delete phone records or save them to the desired task.  This will not only improve customer service, but also save time.  Imagine that you have held negotiations with the customer, and now you need to familiarize yourself with the ideas that were heard, the entire team that will be engaged in the project.  You do not need to separately explain to each employee what the client wants and ‚Äúplay a damaged phone‚Äù - just save the record to the project task, the staff will quickly become familiar with the record and begin to solve problems. <br><br>  A new customer called you and you want to keep his contact?  Our innovations allow you to create a new contact directly from the history of the Call Center. <br><br>  <b>5. Find the phone you need in seconds - contact access is open</b> <br><br>  Need to urgently find the phone of the partner with whom you spoke on the project three days ago?  Now you do not spend time searching for the same number in the "Contacts" section.  We opened the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù section in the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù tab, which displays the history of working with contacts and users in chronological order.  Therefore, you can quickly find the desired phone, simply by opening the "History". <br><br>  But this is not all a possibility to save time.  When you find a phone, you can quickly call this number, send an SMS or chat with a partner in a chat, if it is registered in the system.  To do this, open the context menu on the user / contact / group of contacts and select the desired action without going to the Contacts tab. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/register/">Join us</a> - work efficiently, simply and quickly.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171647/</a></p>
