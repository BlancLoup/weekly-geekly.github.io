  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manager's Responsibilities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Many articles are written about the differences between Leadership and Management.</i>  <i>Here is the most vivid example reflecting this difference.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The leader is the one who in the group of people lost in the jungle climbs on the tallest tree and shows the direction ‚ÄúLet's go there !!!‚Äù.</i>  <i>A manager is someone who, knowing the direction, organizes people who systematically cut through the road with a machete.</i>  <i>Thus, the Leader must have the ability to rise to a higher level (in this case, a tree) understanding the problem, vision (also called vision) and a broad outlook (when he has climbed high enough).</i>  <i>A manager is the ability to convince / get people to move forward, to organize work / food / sleep, to encourage them.</i>  <i>Of course, it's great when both the Leader and the Manager are the same person.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So back to our logger and his duties ...</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here is an excerpt from Peter Drucker‚Äôs remarkable book of management practice (head of the Manager and his work). <br><br>  Responsibilities of the manager: <br>  1. <b>Setting goals</b> .  The manager determines what these goals should be.  It defines what should be the private goals in each key area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe enterprise.  He decides what to do to achieve these goals.  He makes these goals achievable by presenting them to people, on whose effectiveness the achievement of these goals depends. <br><br>  2. <b>Organizational work</b> .  It analyzes the necessary actions, decisions and relationships.  It classifies work as a whole.  He divides it into activities that can be effectively managed.  He divides these activities into manageable jobs.  In a certain way, grouping these types of activities and work, he presents them in the form of an organizational structure consisting of a number of divisions.  He selects people to manage these units.

      3. <b>Motivation of workers and communication with them.</b>  Of the many people responsible for the implementation of various works, he must create a team of like-minded people.  He does this on the basis of his own practical experience in managing people.  He does this on the basis of his own attitude towards the people he controls.  He does this by applying incentives and rewards for good work.  He does this by using the opportunity to promote the most distinguished employees.  He does this by constantly communicating with subordinates, and this communication must necessarily be bilateral in nature. <br><br>  4. <b>Measurement of indicators.</b>  The manager establishes clear indicators reflecting the effectiveness of the implementation of one or another type of work, one or another work.  He is responsible for ensuring that each employee of the organization has appropriate performance indicators or criteria that take into account both the effectiveness of the organization as a whole and the effectiveness of a particular person, helping him to successfully cope with his duties.  The manager analyzes the effectiveness of each employee, evaluates and interprets it.  And, as in any other sphere of his activity, the manager sets out to his subordinates and the management the essence of these measurements and analyzes the results obtained with their help. <br><br>  5. <b>The development of their subordinates.</b>  The management style of each manager can either facilitate or impede the self-development and self-improvement of their subordinates.  The manager either leads his subordinates in the right way, or, on the contrary, leads them to a dead end.  The manager either helps them to reveal their abilities, or, on the contrary, suppresses them.  It strengthens the personal qualities that form a decent person, or, conversely, destroys them.  He either maintains self-esteem in them, or, on the contrary, bends them "into a ram's horn." <br><br>  All of these actions are the basic elements of the work of any manager - even if he does not know about it.  He can do them better or worse, but he will definitely do them. <br><br>  The ability to set goals correctly does not make a person a manager, just as the ability to impose a simple suture in the right place does not make a person a real surgeon.  However, if a person does not know how to set goals, then there can be no question of the proper fulfillment of his managerial duties, just as a person who does not know how to impose elementary stitches cannot be considered a real surgeon.  And as a good surgeon, constantly improving in stitches, over time, becomes an excellent surgeon, just as a good manager, constantly improving his own qualifications and efficiency in all five basic elements of his work, with time he will definitely become an excellent manager. <br><br>  Here is a list of additional very useful literature: <br>  1. Management overview - Peter Drucker Practice Management <br>  2. Personal Efficiency \ Time Management - Stephen Covey "7 Skills of Highly Effective People" <br>  3. Project Management \ PMBOK - Rita Mulcahy "PMP Exam Prep" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83545/</a></p>
