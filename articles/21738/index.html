      <em>Try to answer the following question:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>A friend comes to visit you, who knows a little about computers, and asks what the Internet is, show me the Internet.</em>  <em>How do you answer him, and that show that he understood, and interested him?</em> <br><br>  So, as you have probably already understood, we are going to talk today about the issue of concern to all of us, what is, after all, the Internet.  More precisely, we are with you, as experienced Internet-wandering, have long known what it is, but now let's try to explain it and interest our relatives, relatives, acquaintances and not so much, in short - everything, everyone, everyone. <br><br>  Actually, a year and a half ago, I already faced this question, when a friend came up to me and asked me ‚Äúwhat is the Internet?‚Äù To which I thought a little, told her, let's call her, let's say, Natalya: <br><br>  - Just imagine, Natasha, are you interested in anything now?  Ask any question to which you would like to find the answer, try to ask about any thing that interests you, and I, having typed a few words in the search box, will find everything you desire. <br><br>  And you know what she asked to search?  She asked to look for information about some kind of feminine illness, and even with such intimate details - that I felt uneasy, especially since this lady was completely familiar to me, and not even a friend at all, that is, my confusion was completely justified, and in my place so would almost everyone.  So, the funny thing about this story is that Natalia, standing behind me, read the detailed description of this disease for a long time and thoughtfully read all these ‚Äúdiagnoses and anamnesis‚Äù, and I, red as a cancer, had to sit in front of the monitor , and look at all this medical disgrace with color photographs of the subject of the disease. <br><br>  In general, the acquaintance left contentedly and with the firm conviction that the Internet is good, and we understood the first conclusion for yourself: if you want to interest a person in the Internet, tell him that there is any, or rather not just any, but absolutely any information from all spheres of human activity.  True, there is a small reservation, I just don‚Äôt remember who precisely formulated it, maybe Exler, maybe Voronezhsky: comprehensive information about, for example, the parameters of the Chukchi plague exists only if there was a Chukchedev fan in the world who was not lazy scan drawings of the plague and make a website about their structure. <br><br>  So, we considered the case if the person you need to ‚Äúput on the Internet‚Äù was interested in some specific issue.  And what if there is nothing to ask?  It is necessary to quietly, with a few suggestive questions, find out a person‚Äôs hobbies, his addiction, and only then sit him at the computer and begin to slip the sites of the relevant subject.  Thus, we get the definition number two: the Internet is a hobby, or rather an active help to it, be it a person's fascination with collecting stamps, some kind of rock-pop-jazz band, etc.  etc. <br><br>  But all this is wonderful, in my humble opinion, only for a person of, say, a tender age, but an adult person who is constantly working and interested in all aspects of human society can use the Internet as a giant, constantly and quickly updated newspaper.  Well, or a magazine, someone like.  This was especially noticeable during the fall of the World Trade Center skyscrapers in New York in September 2001, remember, then, as the planes began crashing into buildings, a continuous CNN live broadcast began on TV, which showed, in fact, one and also.  From printed materials one could learn something about this terrible tragedy the next day, and even then only from newspapers, where, like on TV, there was only coverage of events.  Thoughtful comments, analysis of events and debriefing (God, what a cynical pun) could be read only a week later in serious magazines like Kommersant.  However, the Internet was good during those events, which immediately allowed us to find out the details and opinions about events from different people, not very famous, and to learn the history of the creation of these buildings and immediately see a lot of photos.  Therefore, we derive the third definition of the Internet: the Internet is a large, instantly updated, operating newspaper without restrictions and censorship. <br><br>  The next number of our program will be another definition, so the Internet is a gigantic and versatile field for communicating with people located both in their hometown and on other parts of the globe, and, communicating with them, you will absolutely not see the difference in distance .  As one friend of mine said: a computer that is not connected to the network is not a computer at all.  Judge for yourself: e-mail, numerous chat rooms and message boards (WWW-Board), web-pagers such as MSNMessenger and ICQ.  Even in our Valdai intranet - a kind of reduced copy of the worldwide network - and then the most popular section is the chat, where you can find yourself an interlocutor for almost 24 hours a day. <br><br>  Well, a phrase that I heard (read?) By me in one of the forums can serve as a very commonplace definition of the Internet: the Internet is a giant CD with music and video recordings.  Indeed, there is plenty of something, and there is plenty of music on the Internet, the only thing that you sometimes need to look for, but your work will pay off.  Just imagine - five minutes of downloading the file, and you have any song of any artist of the planet.  The very understanding of this fact is just fascinating. <br><br>  And the games!  You and I almost forgot to give another definition of the world wide web: the Internet is a large playground.  Imagine a giant sandbox where hundreds of thousands of kids constantly play with each other and one by one in various online games, and you can get into this sandbox at any moment and join any party. <br><br>  So, let us once again enumerate the definitions of the subject with which we want to seduce the future Internet dependent creature: <br><br>  1. if you want to interest a person in the Internet, tell him that there is any, or rather not just any, but absolutely any information from all spheres of human activity; <br>  2. The Internet is a hobby, or rather an active support for it, be it a person‚Äôs passion for collecting stamps, some kind of rock-pop-jazz band, etc.  etc.; <br>  3. The Internet is a large, instantly updated, unrestricted and censored newspaper; <br>  4. The Internet is a gigantic and versatile field for communication with people located both in their hometown and on other parts of the world; <br>  5. The Internet is a giant CD with music and video recordings; <br>  6. The Internet is a big playground. <br><br>  That's all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21738/</a></p>
