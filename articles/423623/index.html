There is an inner need to re-pour out your soul.  In this series of publications we are not talking about some dull IT, but about the accounting of personal finances.  But accounting is not simple, but rather geeky.  Come under CUT, in short. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="dlya-chego-voobsche-schitat-dengi">  Why even count money? </h1><br><p>  The question, the answer to which seems to be obvious.  But in fact, almost no one can answer it adequately.  Everyone knows that you need to count money.  (Mom said so) But in fact, almost no one does.  (Mom also forbade drinking, smoking and dating dissolute chan) </p><br><p>  Try asking your friends: how much money did they spend last month on food / clothing / car maintenance?  Nobody will tell you the exact figure (if you are not familiar with me, of course).  Even more prosaic question: how much money did you spend on vacation this spring?  - most likely make your friend lie.  He will tell you a certain number, but most likely there will only be reflected the cost of a ticket / hotel reservation.  About the visa, car rental, purchase of a suitcase and swimming shorts, he will almost certainly forget. </p><br><p>  Having found out that taking into account the money with us and our friends, everything is sad, let's define the concept of <em>money</em> . </p><br><pre><code class="hljs swift"> -   . (<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span></span>)   (  )</code> </pre> <br><p>  All that you consume for money is the result of someone's labor.  The cost of a cup of coffee laid the work of Vietnamese farmers who grew coffee;  the labor of Chinese workers who assembled a tractor for a hard-working Vietnamese farmer;  labor of Russian oil workers, who extracted oil from which diesel oil is made to work, with which a Vietnamese farmer fills his Chinese tractor and so on to infinity. </p><br><p>  At the same time, a cow, for example, does not receive monetary compensation for making a burger from it.  A hardworking farmer (person) who grew this cow will receive monetary compensation for his labor.  Robots on the assembly line of the automaker also do not receive any monetary compensation.  However, the money is received by the engineers (people) who designed this robot and the technical personnel (people) who serve it. </p><br><p>  So money = human labor.  It is obvious that man spends time on labor.  The time of your life.  That is, money = the lifetime of people.  If a person in Russia has an average of 40 years in life, with an average salary in the country of 40,000 rubles, then the working life of a person can be estimated at ~ 19 million rubles (for the 2018th year). </p><br><p>  (From this we can draw an interesting conclusion that only Colonel Zakharchenko alone belonged to the equivalent of 473 human lives in rubles. Zenith Arena cost 2,526 human lives. The Vostochny cosmodrome cost 4421 human lives. At the disposal of Bill Gates, 252,631 Russian lives) </p><br><p>  So, it‚Äôs worth counting money.  Since money is the time of our (working) life.  Life is finite, and it is not worth spending it on nonsense.  The same formula applies to money. </p><br><h1 id="kak-schitat">  How to count? </h1><br><p>  If this article will be demanded by the Habr audience, in the next article from the series planned, I will talk about the programs that I use to account for finances and data analysis.  There will be a lot of Java, Bash, Python, and GnuPlot code. </p></div>
