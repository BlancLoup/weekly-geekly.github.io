Every day, when we travel across the Internet, we are confronted with blocks of contextual advertising.  It is unobtrusive, relevant and can help in finding the necessary goods or resources.  But the most interesting thing is that with Google AdSense you can earn money, and the most real and, with certain skill and skill, rather big.  Today, we will not talk about how to make money on the Internet on contextual advertising with Google (there is enough public information on the network) - our manual (under the cut of the screen) about how to turn the earned virtual money into real money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Initial inventory </h5><br><img src="http://goo.gl/hPEji"><br><br>  Our starter inventory has changed a bit since the last cash quest: <br>  1. <b>Active account in the ePayService system</b> .  Yes, we still need a working account in ePayService - without it in any way. <br>  2. <b>Bank check from Google Adsense</b> .  In this guide, a check from Google will be considered, but any check from an American bank in USD, for example, a check from Amazon, will be suitable for cashing through iCheck. <br>  3. <b>Digital scanner</b> .  Once the rarest artifact, is now an integral part of any, even the most inexpensive MFP. <br>  4. <b>Active member identifier of the WebMoney system</b> (WMID).  This item is optional, you will need it on the condition that you withdraw funds from the check to your WMZ wallet. <br>  5. <b>Active ePayService MasterCard card</b> .  As before, the card is available to any ePayService user with an account rating of 2 or higher.  In fact, this is the best way to get cash on a check from AdSense.

Using SMS or QR authorization, we <s>secretly</s> penetrate into our ‚Äútreasury‚Äù - the <a href="http://goo.gl/MA1au">ePayService</a> account. <br>  2. Find on the main page a neat <s>door</s> button with the inscription "iCheck" and go to the next location.  It is here that the alchemical mystery of turning a check from Google into crisp American dollars will occur. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cd/c28/5d6/0cdc285d61e06986708ab8cbff5c2f46.jpg"><br><br>  3. Carefully read the treatise "Terms and Conditions" and act.  A brief retelling of the main points: <br><ul><li>  iCheck is a check cashing service based on a digital copy (scanned image) of a check; </li><li>  As part of the iCheck service, you can work with checks up to 5,000 USD, checks above this amount are cashed in the usual way (about this at the end of this guide); </li><li>  Before carrying out simple manipulations with the scanner, you need to make sure that you put a transfer inscription on the check, your first and last name (as on the check) and put your signature on the <s>blood</s> (as in your passport); </li><li>  Along the tear-off line, we separate the check from the paper on which it is printed, and scan the original.  The output image should be clear and sharp, without foreign objects; </li></ul><br>  4. We load copies into a special form and wait in accordance with the instructions: <br>  <i>‚ÄúCheck scans downloaded before 6 pm Moscow time will be processed on the same working day.</i>  <i>Check scans downloaded after 18 hours Moscow time will be processed on the next business day.</i>  <i>Check scans downloaded on weekends or holidays will be processed on the next first business day. ‚Äù</i> <br>  5. After verification, the status of our scan will change to <i>‚ÄúScan</i> scan <i>accepted.</i>  <i>Expected original check</i> .  Now, immediately, we send the original of the check to a <s>dark abode of</s> one of the offices of ePayService.  It should be noted that for the convenience of users, at the moment there are two points of receipt of the originals of the check - in Kiev (Ukraine) and St. Petersburg (Russia).  Funds are paid by check subject to two conditions simultaneously: <br><ol><li>  There comes the date of receipt of the check, exposed during the processing of the check; </li><li>  The original of your check comes to one of the offices of ePayService. </li></ol><br>  If the original check arrives earlier than the announced enrollment date, then the check amount will be credited on the established enrollment date.  If the date of enrollment comes earlier than the date of the actual delivery of the original check to the representative office of the company, then the amount of the check is credited upon receipt of the original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a08/3a4/b41/a083a4b41644173eae7427444e80cfe3.jpg"><br><br>  After successfully completing this quest, the reward will not be long in coming, the maximum time for crediting funds to the client‚Äôs account for checks issued by US banks: <br>  <i>- Up to 2 working days from the date following the date of deposit for a check or check amount less than USD 1000.00 per day;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Up to 10 working days from the date following the date of deposit for a check or the amount of checks from USD 1000.00 to USD 5000.00 per day;</i> <br><br><h5>  FAQ </h5><br>  <b>What if I don't have a scanner?</b> <br>  If it so happens that you don‚Äôt have the scanner anywhere in your habitat, you can always cash the check in a classic way: put a transfer letter on the check, sign and send it to the ePayService office (to Russia, Ukraine or the USA).  However, please note that in the case of the classical method, the terms of crediting funds to the account begin their countdown from the date of the immediate receipt (deposit) of your check in our service bank. <br><br>  <b>What if my check is over 5000 USD?</b> <br>  Unfortunately, checks with a value above 5000 USD cannot be cashed using the iCheck service.  However, for such a check is quite suitable classical method of cashing.  Terms in this case will be: <br>  <i>- Up to 20 working days from the date following the date of deposit for a check or amount of checks more than 5000.00 USD per day.</i> <br><br>  <b>Will I be able to cash checks without having your card in hand?</b> <br>  Yes.  The ePayService MasterCard is a separate option available to all users of the ePayService payment system. <br><br>  <b>How much is the premium rate?</b> <br>  The Premium tariff is available to any user at no extra charge and is selected at will.  The only difference from the base rate is low interest and the minimum amount of commission.  Once a year you can change the rates for free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169933/</a></p>
