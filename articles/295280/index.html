  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of reports of the conference LEAN Startup Russia 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It was on the first day of the <a href="http://leanstartuprussia.ru/">LEAN Startup Russia 2015</a> conference (their <a href="">FB group</a> ). <br>  Below is a short story about the reports and some photos (at the end of the post). <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="75%" height="75%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/cad/1be/6a8cad1beb3d474496e1079bb1070e7a.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started not ice.  In a letter describing how to get to the building (was in the area for the first time), something was said like ‚ÄúLast car from the center, get out of the subway, go left, underpass, left, another transition, 20 meters and voila, you're on the spot. "  I got out of the subway, went to the left, ran into the wall.  There is no underground passage on the left, it is on the right, entered it, went out, the road, and within the limits of visibility there are no transitions and <a href="http://www.spacemoscow.com/">Space-</a> clubs.  But, we know these Moscow jokes to entangle locks.  With the help of a survey of Tadzhiks cleaning up litter and orienteering skills on the ground, I went right over the bridge and after 200 meters found the entrance to the territory of the business center. <br><br>  Then, at the entrance, a check at the airport, the frame, took the water with them (one more minus to the organizers in karma).  A long wait ... and finally not at 10_00, but at 10_40, they began to light.  In between the presentations, the presenter (not the girl with Ilya Korolev, but the other, Yarik? Did not remember his name) screamed, ‚ÄúLYON STARTUP OF RUSSIA TWO THOUSANDS FIFTEEN !!!‚Äù, apparently, in case people forgot where they are and tried funny pun (always unsuccessful).  Addict galleries?  Weifai is terrible, the sound is too loud, the balalaika as a sound beating ... As you know, most of all claims from free users. <br><br>  Began.  By the way, I noticed that the cool speakers are on the side of the screen, and not in the center, so that it is easier to take pictures of the preza slides. <br>  Greeting speech.  Conference opening <br>  Greetings from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ikorolev">Ilya Korolev</a> (tracker of <a href="http://www.iidf.ru/">IIDF</a> ) and <a href="">Ploskonosova Yulia</a> ( <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/">LP Generator</a> ).  Lively, so.

      Introduction to Lean Startup.  How to minimize losses on the road to success - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ikorolev">Ilya Korolev</a> <br><br>  Next <a href="https://www.facebook.com/maxim.ploskonosov">Maxim Ploskonosov</a> from <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/">LP Generator</a> .  Speech in the spirit of a patriot-statesman, Russians are the coolest, we are cooler than the USA, Russia is the birthplace of elephants, in terms of the IT market of the Russian Federation 50 times less than the USA, but less than 2-3 times of the coolest projects, it means the RF is steeper than the USA 25 times (50/2 as the author sees).  In the valley, the Russians are in 3rd place after the Chinese and Hindus, and there are many more of them than Americans.  Apparently, someone really wants to get a state grant.  RukaLit.zhpg <br><br>  Next, Michael Romanov (EY) from <a href="http://www.ey.com/RU/ru/Home">Ernst and Young</a> .  Consulting  Start-ups are brought to the market (it was said that it was free, yeah, did consultants do it for free?), They do a lot for telecom, and they generate the most profit.  Serious dude. <br><br>  Further, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/slobodin.mikhail">Mikhail Slobodin</a> from <a href="https://moskva.beeline.ru/">Beeline</a> .  The report "Focus on the client or how to return the spirit of" thrift "in a large company."  Smart, slippery type.  Showed 10 slides how to live (there is in the photo) + 11 slide "do not think about money, think about work." <br><br>  Leonid Melamed - top of ROSNO, MTS, AFK Sistema, Russneft.  Read ‚ÄúManagement in conditions of high <br>  uncertainties.  Lessons for corporations and startups.  So-so.  After the phrase "The product is built 5 ~ 10 years with annual planning cycles," the people somehow got bored.  It‚Äôs not clear why lean and such products (they also have the right to life, for example in telecom, but this is not about small, nimble startups, but about the monstrous projects of large corporations).  There is his report on the pics.  All people have only 3 goals.  Investor ~ market share, investment income, brand prestige.  Employee ~ ZP, interesting work, prestige of work.  Customer ~ quality product, cheap, prestigious.  I clearly disagree with this - there are always a bunch of goals from which priorities are chosen.  For an employee, for example, besides the 3 listed above, it is also important - a comfortable workplace, prof.  height, proximity to home, the possibility of remote work, zagran.  business trips and many others <br><br>  Next, a panel session: Mikhail Slobodin, Leonid Melamed, Andrei Romanenko, Ilya Oskolkov-Tsentsiper <br>  Moderator: Sergey Skripnikov (IIDF).  Talk about nothing, Mikhail Slobodin still pulling the blanket over himself, advertised Beeline.  He promised to all Beeline users on a big date (according to geo-data to determine who visited a konfu) to send a gift to the phone (cheated), already 22_00 nothing came to the phone. <br><br>  Break for a bite (hooray! Free tartlets with juice!) <br><br>  Report "Errors in understanding Lean Startup".  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amoreynis">Arkady Moreynis</a> . <br>  Arkady lit, well done!  He says startups make 6 mistakes: <br>  1) throw shit on the wall hoping that it will stick.  Those generate too many ideas, and no one needs a product.  Throwing from B2C to b2b. <br>  2) the absence of 1 clear hypothesis at each iteration, but we check a lot. <br>  3) misunderstand MVP.  It is necessary to correctly assess the ability to make the product yourself.  People with ideas are not needed, you need the ability to do everything yourself, otherwise you have an incomplete team. <br>  4) do not understand the criteria that the hypothesis is tested.  A poll of people is not a test of a hypothesis, people lie.  Money or users are important in the context of the ratio of ARPU and CPA.  Just if acquaintances bought from you is not an argument that the project will fly. <br>  5) Landing iterations, not product iterations.  Those.  need to change the product, not its landing.  Examples ~ edible plates, Uber for plates.  You need to come up with different versions of the products (90% of the money) and test them as hypotheses, whether they are needed by someone, and not optimize (lick, change the CPA-button or paint it from blue to red and vice versa) the landing of the same invented product (10% of the money). <br>  6) replacement of a dream on a landing page with forms.  It is necessary to do a product that will sever the market, and not optimize the landing, squeeze out of it all that you can, get some money and calm down. <br>  The big idea is ~ 3 approaches 1) do not what others have, 2) do not like others 3) sell not to others, but to others.  At least 1 of 3 should be. <br>  Without #lean, you can make a great, but no-one needed product.  Arkady every VT at 14:00 sits in the Good Republic on Myasnitskaya, advises startups for free (a cunning comrade, perfectly disguised his services as an investor, however, sharks and moray eels also have a great disguise). <br><br>  Further, the report ‚ÄúFinding value for a client using the tools of Customer Development‚Äù by Rob Fitzpatrick - was translated into English immediately and then synchronously translated (in vain, the dude had excellent diction and clearly understands, in simple words, it can be seen that the most primitive creatures with bad knowledge of the great and mighty English-a) <br>  Norm slides, sfotkal everything, nothing new, but it is useful to repeat. <br>  PS: Rob is the author of an excellent book on CustDev ‚ÄúAsk Mom‚Äù - I wrote a review on it <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20090/">here</a> . <br><br>  Further ‚ÄúDiscussion Panel: Why startups learn Lean Startup methodology‚Äù Viktor Lysenko, Arkady Moreynis, Evgeny Gordeyev, Maxim Ploskonosov, Andrei Grigoriev Moderator: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/obrovets">Alexey Obrovets</a> (cool man !!! fucking moderated the conversation, also noticed <a href="http://tceh.com/">#tceh</a> ). <br>  Moreinis said, you need to ask yourself 6 questions ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù In the book of Lin, a startup <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eric-Ries/204614639577692">Eric Rees, the</a> most important thing about Lin at the end of the book (unfortunately, he could not remember reading about these ‚Äúwhy‚Äù that Arkady was talking about, Apparently therefore I am not yet a Forbes list). <br>  Moreynis says there were three stages in the creation of businesses: <br>  Stage 1 ~ 95 ~ 98gg did everything at once ready-made businesses, not startups. <br>  Stage 2 ~ a crowd of idlers "Uncle Give Money" on my dream (he also had a hand). <br>  Stage 3 ~ now the lin stage - people do a lot of things themselves before looking for investors. <br>  Someone else said - We need to do a landing, where right up to the moment you leave an email and it is even better to pay the button.  Let it be said at the time of payment that the payment gateway does not work, but the main thing is to test hypotheses that a) people need a product b) they are ready to pay for it c) there are a lot of these people. <br><br>  Report ‚ÄúLean Startup in Russia‚Äù <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dmitry.kalaev">Dmitry Kalaev</a> . <br>  Well done, experience is felt in performances, very impressively performed without tension.  When it is not clear what to do, keep the focus where we are running.  The most important thing in startups is to quickly test hypotheses ~ 50pcs per 3 months.  Startup fast or dead.  Change 1 metric at a time so that others do not influence.  Lin is not like spending less, but how to spend money.  It's better to make a product for a narrow niche, and not a lot of customer segments.  The best customers are top of the middle class.  There is money (not like poor people) and not a long sales cycle as a large customer.  Do not cut large infrastructure items such as appstore or sales force.  Before sawing the landing page, talk and get to know the customer.  There is always growth potential. <br><br>  The report "Smoky tests" and case study.  Fake it until you make it " <a href="">Marvin Liao</a> *. In English, but everything is clear. Make smoky tests, that is, test hypotheses as cheaply as possible. Do not cut the function immediately, but email the newsletter to those who need the function , paid - by conversion, calculate whether it is necessary for someone. Growth of business through AARRR metrics, of which the main thing in the funnel is 1) activation and 2) retention AARRR = Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral. <br><br>  Interview (online) Brent Cooper * <br>  Lean startup all have to use!  (thanks, but we didn‚Äôt know!) <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> is a cool MVP example of how to test a hypothesis cheaply and quickly.  Lean is needed by investors in turn 1, then the entrepreneur, then the state.  The growth of the economy is in 1 turn the growth of small business.  The state should make konfy, a place for startups, stop supporting large companies (yeah, they'll take Gazprom into 50 small companies right now and cut them up smile emoticon and trillions in Russian Railways will stop sponsoring transportation, the dude is clearly not aware of the situation in the Russian Federation). <br><br>  Lean HR report by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alena.vladimirskaya">Alena Vladimirskaya</a> <br>  Well done, very cool!  Although it is not clear why, I was very worried (or I just do not like high female voices) <br>  Hunt the basis of the team can not.  First we need like-minded people who believe in the idea and want to grow into a billion business.  Everywhere you need to evangelize your project, look for a co-founder on the table.  By the way, recently there was a story in the FB, where the founders worked on the idea, and found the programmer‚Äôs co-founder.  He did everything, and then he took the source code and published it under his own name in Google Play, i.e.  stole the idea - see the <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/feedpry/blog/11953/klassnaya-pouchitelnaya-istoriya-iz-zhizni-moego-startapa-lyublyu-takoe">InstaPry / FeedPry story</a> . <br>  Glavzlodey Jaroslav Fishing is actively fighting off in the comments.  So, in the comments they expressed a good idea that the problem arose due to the fact that they found the coonafter at the startup confer.  There, they say, even though dithers and progers are found, they are entrepreneurs at heart, which means they will not have mental doubts if they steal the idea.  So, what could be better for the CTO to look for in boring government offices, so that they only program, and sales, analytics, fundraising was the project leader (so that the proger had no reason to throw the leader, so as not to do his hard and ungrateful work).  Not everyone in the team should be charismatic.  Comfortably should be together.  Within 3 days, everyone speaks arguments on the idea / hypothesis, but when a decision is made, it is executed, and not discussed, as in the army until the moment of receiving the analyzes or the result of the decision.  The final decision for those responsible for this front of work.  In the letter, all key decisions are recorded, especially shares, and how to share them.  Give shares gradually, so many will leave, and their shares they have left those they are passengers.  Register shares by changeable indicators.  I give you 9% when you reach the following indicators for the next 3 years.  Those are 3% per year.  When we start to hire more than 50 people, the company changes.  Tk 1 ~ 2 layers of leaders arise.  Once a week, everyone gathers and discusses what is happening.  We must praise people to make it comfortable and good to work in a startup, and not in a big company.  Use when hiring a remote.  Do not use studios, because the absence of their own team is a big minus for investors.  Take mentors, many for free (they experience if they like the product), even for a small fraction.  0.5 ~ 3%.  Share share by time and results. <br><br>  Program presentation and day results <br>  Maxim Ploskonosov ~ 1 day results.  At <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/">lp generator</a> you can go make yourself a landing page and check out ideas.  Advertising. <br><br>  PS: Online for 1 thousand rubles you can watch only live broadcasts, not recordings. <br>  That's all.  1 day was free.  On 2 and 3 days I will not go - they cost 12/17.  First, sorry for the money.  Secondly, the concept of a lean startup, which I almost completely mastered on the 1st day, suggests that you need to save money to achieve a result.  I am sure, in theory, I learned / understood, almost everything that is needed to work in the style of learn, it remains to practice.  But if the organizers or friends call for free for 2-3 days konfy (within the support of the writing press), then contact me, I'm not a beast, always ready for mutually beneficial cooperation! <br><br>  PS: Photos from the conference <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.540020919488693.1073741839.100004423696545%26type%3D1%26l%3D1a5d308585">from me</a> and from the organizers ( <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i190ylsvjti63jw/AABIL-tnaUArj4OHbgNBm0ota%3Fdl%3D0">small</a> and the same, but <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k9naeswoxwlnpgs/AABCr2KMS25nDG20z9pnffd-a%3Fdl%3D0">large</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295280/</a></p>
