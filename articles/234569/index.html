They, perhaps, will become your customers, but not earlier than the product of a mass product.  6) Not interesting is the functionality that users want, and why they want it.  7) Almost everyone is ready to do in words what you ask him: a small request, you are full of energy, and they do not need to make big decisions.  8) It‚Äôs impossible to create a good product if you don‚Äôt like potential users.  You should be at least not indifferent to them.  9) Two strengths in the behavior of users: apathy and unwillingness to look / feel stupid.  10) If you have thoughts: ‚ÄúEverything is much more complicated than I thought,‚Äù everything is in fact much more complicated.

And also about why it is necessary to early define ‚Äúgood‚Äù users - subgroups, for which the product should be developed and optimized in the first place.  Continuing the theme: <br><ul><li>  Jeff Sauro suggests <a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/detractor-revenue.php">using NPS (Net Promoters Score) for user segmentation</a> .  Detractors are ‚Äúbad‚Äù users.  They bring "bad" revenue, revenue derived from the deterioration of relationships with users.  If more than 10% of the revenue comes from ‚Äúdetractors‚Äù, then this imposes increased risks on the company - they can easily stop using the product or go to competitors. </li><li>  Cennydd Bowles collected <a href="http://www.cennydd.co.uk/2014/technology-nps-benchmarks">examples of the NPS values ‚Äã‚Äãof various companies</a> .
