According to estimates by the head of the company Ilona Mask, Tesla can supply from 90 to 100 thousand electric vehicles, whereas in the first quarter this number was only 63 thousand. <br><br>  Why are these numbers important for the future of the company, and what other factors influence it?

    <h2>  Importance of numbers on machine supplies </h2><br>  ‚ÄúNow there are a lot of speculations around the figures on our deliveries in the second quarter,‚Äù Musk said in a letter to Tesla employees.  - In reality, we are on the way to <br>  to set a record for all time for yourself.  It will not be easy, but if we give all the best we can do it! ‚Äù <br><br>  During 2019, Tesla shares fell in price by 34%.  One of the main reasons for the fall - doubts about the level of demand for the company's electric cars.  One of its main tasks is to convince investors of the groundlessness of such suspicions, and an increase in the number of shipments of electric vehicles plays an important role here. <br><br>  The previous Tesla record was 90,700 per quarter - it was reached in the last three months of 2018.  According to Ilona Mask, the company has already produced the required number of electric vehicles, but the problem is that not all of them are in the most convenient locations for delivering to customers. <br><br>  Therefore, the main problem of the company right now is in logistics.  If Tesla fails to deliver the right amount of electric cars by the end of the quarter, then it‚Äôs not possible to set the record. <br><br>  At the same time, financial analysts are skeptical about the growth prospects of Tesla shares.  They lowered the target value of the shares from $ 342.84 at the beginning of the year to $ 269.39.  Sixteen analysts polled by Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-26/tesla-has-enough-orders-to-set-delivery-record-elon-musk-says">recommended</a> selling Tesla shares, 8 offered to hold them for a while, and 12 experts recommended buying. <br><br>  The main argument of the opponents of the growth version of the stock - the demand for electric cars was below expectations.  Record deliveries can prove that they were rushed to conclusions. <br><br><h2>  What else affects the future of Tesla? </h2><br>  During 2018, the number of Tesla electric vehicles on the roads of the world doubled.  However, electric cars still make up only about 1% of all cars, and 60% of them are in China.  That is why Tesla plans to build a battery manufacturing plant in Shanghai.  Another plant is planned to be built in Europe - the exact place has not yet been announced. <br><br>  At a recent conference call with the company's shareholders, Ilon Musk announced the need to reduce the cost of batteries.  In addition, the entrepreneur would like to reduce the required charging time and increase the distance that an electric vehicle is able to travel without recharging.  According to him, this range will soon increase to 644 kilometers. <br><br>  Tesla's current battery manufacturing partner at Gigafactory in Nevada is Panasonic.  However, according <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gigafactory-in-nevada-is-critical-to-teslas-future-2019-06-22">to</a> Market Watch, the company is still unable to meet the requirements of the Mask to improve battery performance.  This is too complex engineering task. <br><br>  As a result, a partner for the Gigafactory in Shanghai and Europe has not yet been selected.  Whether Tesla can reduce the cost of batteries by improving their performance will also have a major impact on the company's future. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Not all analysts believe that the future of Tesla is determined by technical parameters, such as the number of machines shipped to customers.  So Matthew DeBord from Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-2nd-quarter-2019-deliveries-what-to-expect-analysis-2019-6">writes</a> in his column that it may be much more important for a company to determine the vector of its development: will it become a automaker for the mass market or work in the luxury segment. <br><br>  For comparison, in 2018, BMW sold about 311,000 cars in the United States.  The line of the company includes 18 cars and trucks.  Tesla has managed to sell 200 thousand electric vehicles with a line of only three models.  That is, with comparable sales, the Tesla line is six times smaller. <br><br>  All this suggests that Tesla, perhaps, should not chase the number of shipments at any cost, but focus on extracting the maximum profit from each sale, the analyst believes.  Being a luxury segment company is better than a manufacturer for a mass market that can barely make ends meet. <br><br><h2>  Other materials on finance and stock market from <a href="https://iticapital.ru/">ITI Capital</a> : </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/">Western securities analysis tool</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/research/">Analytics and market reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/shares/american-shares/">Purchase of shares of American companies from Russia</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458308/</a></p>
