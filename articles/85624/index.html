      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying a wireless headphone appeared immediately after the wire was worn again in cheap Panasonic.  Approaching the matter with all seriousness, I reviewed a lot of options.  The first choice was more budget DR-BT101, but after listening to them in the store, the desire to buy them disappeared right there (although it is possible and unjustified, details below).  I didn‚Äôt really want to leave without buying, but, unfortunately, only this model was in this store.  It turned out that this is not the only Sony store in the district, and that the nearest one is only five minutes away. <br><br>  Arriving at the next store, I saw the DR-BT50.  The first impression was very pleasant, good build, nice black color.  Soft coating on the ears, a snug fit to the head and good sound insulation.  The truth was a big minus - the headphone batteries were not charged, and I could not listen to them :) <br><br>  If something strongly wants, it is usually bought without regard to common sense.  Confirming with the seller that within 30 days I will be able to hand them back, regardless of the reasons - I decided.  The seller here also spun me on insurance and other joys.  True, I knew that they were making a commission on the sale of insurance, and right there I was promoting it for additional discounts.  After receiving the desired box, I hurried home. <br><br><img src="http://missingvasili.sviridov.ca/images/habra_review/1.jpg" alt="Sony DR-BT50"><br><br>  When I got home, I took the headphones out of the box and put them on recharging.  Sony claims that a three-hour charge should be enough for 12 hours of playing music.  So far, this is confirmed.  Finally, the headphones are charged and connected to the phone (Sony Ericsson Xperia X1).  Turning on the playback, I was ready to be disappointed, it didn't sound very good.  I thought - can not be.  Having climbed in the phone settings, A2DP profile settings (BitPool &amp; Sample Rate) were found.  After setting them to the maximum and starting the track again, my eyes closed, and my jaw began slowly, but surely, to sag.  (probably the budget model could show itself better with the right settings). <br><br><img src="http://missingvasili.sviridov.ca/images/habra_review/2.jpg" alt="Sony DR-BT50"><br><br>  The sound was stunning, clear top, powerful bottom, a small amount of distortion.  As my main audio system, I use Yorkville active studio monitors with a very flat frequency response, so there was something to compare with.  After listening to several tracks in different directions from jazz and classical to electronics, I realized that I would not carry them back to the store under any circumstances.  :) <br><br>  Probably it's time to bring the specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  40mm heads with rare earth magnets </li><li>  It works at a distance of up to 9 meters (not just a marketing statement, I calmly move around the office from the kitchen to the toilets without losing sound) </li><li>  Supports A2DP, Handsfree, Handset, and AVRCP profiles </li><li>  Play up to 12 hours on a single charge </li><li>  Fully covers the ears without pressing the ears to the head </li><li>  Convenient control directly on the headphones (start / stop, track change, volume, folder change, pick up the phone and voice dialing) </li><li>  Supports stream in SBC and MP3 (decoded directly in headphones, without recompression) </li><li>  Hi-Fi (20Hz-20KHz) </li><li>  Built-in microphone </li><li>  Different profiles can be associated with different devices, i.e.  You can play music from your computer and still receive calls from your phone. </li><li>  Holds up to 5 associations, you can quickly switch between computers and phone without entering a pin every time </li></ul><br><br>  There are some disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  The plastic on one of the headphones is slightly loose and clicks when walking. </li><li>  Buttons also just when rattling when walking </li><li>  The rewind button is combined with the play button (to pause, you need to drown it into the body, which often leads to rewind to the next track) </li><li>  In the external microphone there is no noise reduction, so when using headphones as a headset on the street leads to a poor understanding of your interlocutor </li><li>  I couldn‚Äôt make the folder change buttons work, but it‚Äôs rather a minus of the AVRCP profile implementation on the phone </li><li>  When walking around the city, especially where there is a lot of wi-fi - the sound is periodically interrupted </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment, the headphones without any problems bred when working with the phone, Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  With Vista did not work, though there is a Bluetooth module from the Logitech MX5500 keyboard, without A2DP support. <br><br>  Recomend for everybody. <br><br>  PS first long post, do not kick much <br>  Thanks for the karma, transferred to gadgets. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85624/</a></p>
