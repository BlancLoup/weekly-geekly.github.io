It turned out to be not so easy, as we initially thought and requires speakers of the highest level, so if you are exactly like that, write to us.  And so, how did the first pancake come out ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first meeting of the Club of Innovators in 2011 was held in frosty Petersburg (and in general it is the 17th in a row).  What else, if not IT, could be devoted to the first meeting of the year.  The event was held at the site of the Council of Rectors of St. Petersburg, which was kindly provided by our dear partner, the leading innovative university of St. Petersburg, <a href="http://www.ifmo.ru/">St. Petersburg State University ITMO</a> . <br><img height="393" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7b/c7d/725/f7bc7d725307680df3fe7eab0321f6f2.jpg" width="590"><br>  Despite the early morning of the Saturday day, 2/3 of those who registered, came to the meeting, and as it turned out, thank God, because  the hall and so cracked at the seams.  For everyone who came, we prepared the most interesting information about the innovation life of St. Petersburg, new projects in the field of IT and several interesting reports. <br><br>  By tradition, our permanent leader Vladislav Kudinov took the floor and spoke about our activities in St. Petersburg and beyond, as well as plans for 2011, and in the end invited anyone who wanted to take an active part in the life of the Innovators Club ( <a href="http://club-inno.ru/better/tasks">I want to help you</a> ). <br><img height="360" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ff/7aa/d68/9ff7aad6866fcd2bc2f0addb65e09a67.jpg" width="590"><br>  Next, Andrei Dodin spoke about the latest news from the life of the Zvorykin project, which pleased few people.  The project, which set itself the goal of being the flagship of innovative activity of young people in Russia, did not find a response among active community members, so in the near future most of the activity in the regions will be suspended. <br>  After the block of information and news, we proceeded to the main characters - the projects.  The projects turned out to be one more interesting than the other and caused a heated discussion among the guests and experts of the Club. <br><br>  The first speaker was Gussenkov Konstantin with the SmartMark project - this is a system for protecting copyright on images, which, according to the authors, has no direct analogues in the world, since  the system allows to determine authorship even after a significant change in the image (noise, rotation, size, ...).  Then Rystsov Denis presented his development of the mathematical search ‚ÄúUniquation‚Äù, which allows finding the context of formulas and at the same time can be integrated into a standard search engine.  The site is already running and waiting for commercial implementation.

      On Denis should stop separately, because  He became the star of the evening, Elnara Petrova wrote the best about him in our tweet broadcast: "Denis Rystsov is a man with perfect order in his head. He does Uniquation - a search engine by mathematics" my search engine by formulas is the future, for the future to be accomplished in him, someone must believe, therefore the future is me " <br><br>  Terekhov, Andrey Nikolaevich, also did not overlook his presentation and said very interesting words that would suit many projects: ‚ÄúAs the head of the department of system programming at SPSU, I really like this project, but as the general director of LANIT-TERMCOM, I am not in this project saw nothing interesting.  Many young guys create unique products that have no analogue in the world, but at the same time, they very often do not think about whether someone needs this product.  Before you start developing a project, try to find problems that people cannot solve on their own and will be ready to pay for solving them, and try to solve them! ‚Äù <br><br><img height="393" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1a/22b/5d4/d1a22b5d45b7a1c671c8edaeaa0b0196.jpg" width="590"><br><br>  Denis exchanges business cards with guys from Yandex <br><br>  Before the coffee break and informal communication, Dima Statovsky (by the way, a new member of the team of organizers of the Club of Innovators), who presented his project ‚ÄúEasyTravel‚Äù, still managed to speak.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is ‚Äúbusiness twittering‚Äù, which allows the travel agency to get closer to its potential customers.  Given the overcrowding of the tourist market, such a service, which assumes a completely new approach to sales, can wait for commercial success. <br><img height="393" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21b/14e/d79/21b14ed798c3d13564bc7752604f3cd5.jpg" width="590"><br>  After the coffee break, we had a no less interesting event planned - the performance of the invited speakers: <br>  Andrei Terekhov (Professor, General Director, ZAO LANIT-TERKOM, Head of Systems Programming SPSU) spoke about some aspects of launching IT projects and uttered a phrase that immediately became winged: "There are plenty of smart people on Mat-Meh , and those who can sell we do not have, and the survey confirmed Andrei Nikolaevich: "Yes - 25 (71.43%), No - 10 (28.57%)". <br><img height="393" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/6b3/bed/e7b6b3bed9835fd393e3c28edfd3e78b.jpg" width="590"><br>  Elnara Petrova and Svetlana Khorosheva (founders of <a href="http://dp.vkontakte.ru/">NextMedia</a> communication agency) told about a new, but very rapidly growing social media market in social networks, and what new business opportunities are opened by social networks. <br><img height="393" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a02/023/5d6/a020235d6f93840b12cac67b3af43c5a.jpg" width="590"><br>  Natalya Petrova (Gen. Director, Neva-Patent Patent Law Firm) held express consultations on intellectual property and, in particular, helped poor Vasya, who started working in an American startup without a contract and is now afraid that that he didn‚Äôt become their property, but was left to him. <br><br>  Fresh Projects, Marko ≈Ωulj (specialist in marketing projects and projects) told why startups should try to do all their informational reasons in the style of "purple cows".  Just imagine you are going somewhere in the woods, and you see a cow stands, not paying much attention - you certainly continue to eat.  And now another option - the purple cow.  In the same way, start-ups should make you pay attention to them, otherwise there is simply no chance of getting with large offices. <br><img height="386" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ff/2ff/833/6ff2ff833429581e66b4e312fb2eabaa.jpg" width="590"><br>  For dessert, Kudinov Vladislav spoke about the new project from the organizers of the Club (we are also not only talkers, but mostly startupers (not to be confused with the old fart)).  The project is called ‚ÄúNext‚Äù - this is an interesting application for vkontakte, which will allow you to take a fresh look at communication through social networks. <br><br>  The meeting ended with an answer to the riddle from the last announcement and the presentation of a well-deserved prize to Cyril Zhdanov, who was the only one who could guess it and earned himself an iPod.  (the answer is for those who are interested: "gentlemen whose talents deserve deep respect" -&gt; Edgar Po -&gt; <a href="http://club-inno.ru/19-01-1809">19-01-1809</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114353/</a></p>
