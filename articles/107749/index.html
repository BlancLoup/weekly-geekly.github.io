The names are no longer so memorable, however, it is easy to understand who is following whom - <b>BBK MP050S</b> , <b>MP060S</b> , <b>MP061S</b> and <b>MP070S</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa3/4b6/9df/fa34b69df64e743d011d92f73fe97f83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not so long ago, these devices began to appear on store shelves, so I decided to acquaint you with what the company released this time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As in glossy magazines, it would be possible to tighten a long song about the fact that the Internet is entering our life more and more and how great it is to watch the right movie with your friends without a computer ... but I hope that such a class of devices like HD media players do not need to be introduced therefore, I propose to proceed immediately to the body.  I decided to take the most "adult" model, namely, <b>BBK MP070S</b> .

Additionally, the device was wrapped in an air bubble film (pi-pi-pi) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbe/580/d37/fbe580d3781f13e75fd035e3786e783c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, included: <br>  - HD-media player BBK MP070S <br>  - Operation manual + warranty card <br>  - Wires for connecting an external SATA disk <br>  - Hex L-key <br>  - Wire 3xRCA-3xRCA <br>  - Audiovideo cable <br>  - Network adapter <br>  - miniCD disk <br>  - 4 screws <br>  - Remote controller <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Bubble packaging</b> is a flexible transparent plastic material whose surface is evenly covered with small projections filled with air.  Used for packaging fragile items.  It was invented by two engineers: Alfred Fielding and Mark Chavann in 1957.  Initially bubble wrap was conceived as a new material for wallpaper, which would be easy and convenient to clean. </td></tr></tbody></table>  Immediately we can note the absence of HDMI-wires in the kit, which is very strange - this is the second most important (after power) cable to the device.  And in the previous models of media players from BBK (like the best-selling Popcorn NP101S), the wire was attached.  There is no patchcord, but at least it's easier to get it.  The instruction is black-and-white and fairly detailed (30 pages), the site has an electronic version of the manual. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The media player is compact enough - a little more than <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/78497/">ASUS O! Play</a> , but significantly less than previous models, much less such combines as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/84069/">Dune Base</a> .  Low weight, which means that the disk has yet to be put - perhaps it will fit inside it. <br><br>  The body is entirely made of ferrous metal, but its texture in different places is different.  For example, the top cover is semi-gloss, the front side has a fine polishing texture, and the side ‚Äúedges‚Äù are pleasantly rough.  Why such a platter is not clear, but on the whole it looks very solid - if it were not for the BBK sign on the front side, then no one would have guessed anything) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/308/19a/095/30819a0953336993da8b9f986a36f3d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front side, there are many unusual things - a handful of buttons duplicated from the console and uncovered connectors (2xUSB, miniUSB and a card reader for SD / MMC / MS) create the basic ‚Äúhype‚Äù - on the one hand, this ‚Äúscatter‚Äù really scares ... but with on the other hand, this is practical, since the user of devices will not have to go anywhere to connect, and it will be possible to control the process without a remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfb/75a/e21/dfb75ae2175cb586fc423d554144584d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the reverse side is another ‚Äúassorted‚Äù - a whole scattering of various connectors.  Ethernet, HDMI (1.3), component and composite video outputs, stereo output, digital optical and coaxial audio output ... There is even eSATA for connecting an external drive - in general, a good arsenal!  Instead of the usual power cord (C13), you will have to use a network adapter, since the device cannot be more than 12V.  Power consumption - less than 16W. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e00/14d/ca2/e0014dca2ec26b3119202ce75bf952f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/C13/C14_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%258A%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC)"><b>C13 / C14</b></a> - a three-pass plug pair (plug-socket) for 10 Amps to connect electrical equipment to the mains.  Used in computing, electrical appliances and communication technology. </td></tr></tbody></table>  There is nothing on the sides except the "ribs" - at first I thought that the system was completely passively cooled, but several vents destroyed all my hopes) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/9c0/8a1/eb19c08a1aa8324cf427dc201bd00fde.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the bottom side there are 4 stylish metal legs with rubber inserts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/342/0e2/e20/3420e2e20d7f858897744087caf89961.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4d/4ab/b7c/d4d4abb7c9c8f279fe8ab5f96fe934fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After carefully examining the case (in search of warranty seals and screws to disassemble the case), I came to the conclusion that no covers are simply removed ‚Äî you have to unwind the case to install a disk;  However, the hex key in the kit is not just put.  This is all written in the instructions ... but inquisitive minds do not read them;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9d/0a0/fd2/e9d0a0fd2e622b1efdcc4333a8f25250.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I was hoping that everything would be limited to 4 cogs on the front side, but as it turned out, they hold only the front part of the case - a neat all-metal plate with holes.  Literally in an instant, I was crawling under the table in search of decorative nozzles that had flown down from all the buttons - they are not fixed at all, so be careful when disassembling (or rather drop a drop of superglue on each button). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/622/361/845/62236184568d80f03eefa5f04f67b714.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11e/2d2/bee/11e2d2beec15ace53bb0cc1c22ce5044.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The board did not pull out, although most of it was already visible.  I had to unscrew 2 more screws on the back side - only then was happiness.  Yeah, the path is not easy - in most cases you have to unscrew no more than 2-4 cogs ... or even insert the disc into the retractable slide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc0/00e/d28/fc000ed28b29c52e6f4231351257d273.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very, very liked the remote!  From which side you do not look at it, it is rather small and light, but all this is not at the expense of the convenience of holding in your hand.  Slightly rough plastic (quality) conveniently located buttons - Power at the very top will definitely be in the dark;  The ‚Äúcircle‚Äù for moving around the menu is clearly highlighted and can be used without moving the remote in your hand;  track control buttons, volume buttons - you will not confuse them with anything either.  Everything is great - the only drawback is that there is no backlight - in the dark in the "small" buttons will not understand (well, or have to memorize everything).  Food - one lithium CR2025 battery on 3B (140 mAh). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc3/f7f/173/fc3f7f1732caedf658a3bd2352c3e437.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Insides </h2><br>  If you look at the top, most of the printed circuit board takes up space for the hard disk - it is supposed to join it to the corresponding connector and tighten the bottom 4 screws from the kit.  At this stage there is an unpleasant trifle - the complete screws have a very large cap, with which they touch a part of the board connectors;  The easiest way is to use "your" screws, but if someone does not have them, you will have to search.  Or work with a file;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/927/ebd/4db/927ebd4dbc8baf13745adf43553c8a87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next to the disc area is a sticker with hieroglyphs, where only ‚Äú1Tb‚Äù is understandable - apparently, this is a restriction on the volume of 1Tb;  it is also confirmed in the manual - as long as the manufacturer promises correct work only with disks up to 1TB (as well as with cards up to 4GB and flash drives up to 16GB). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/447/1bc/7d8/4471bc7d8e7e390efe693dc86ba4e886.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I only had disks for 500 and 1000GB - everything worked without problems.  Although ... I tried the existing 32GB flash drive for the sake of interest - the player fell into a stupor until the flash drive was removed.  All tests were conducted on a 500-gigabyte <b>Seagate ST3500830SCE DB35.3</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/901/446/cd490144617d74513e7b61dbc766640e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is nothing more interesting on this side of the board - soldered buttons, diodes and connectors.  Much "meat" on the reverse side.  Ten two konderov, NAND- <b><a href="http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/flash/HY27UF(08_16)2G2B%2520(Rev0.2).pdf">shemku Hynix HY27UF082G2B</a></b> (controller <b>AU6986</b> ) and a kind of indefatigable <b>Mega 1008NE MPTU1G16DG-AC</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e51/c12/d3f/e51c12d3f7ce527fdae7aa922fba8411.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a23/e45/f94/a23e45f9420ecd64152a20e39ffc666f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are two more ‚Äúprepared‚Äù places where nothing is unsoldered - perhaps something will appear in the next versions of the device, if they are on the same board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a33/d5a/3b5/a33d5a3b538c7a48c64d443e689fb6e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most "tasty" ( <b>Realtek <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/productsView.aspx%3FLangid%3D1%26PNid%3D9%26PFid%3D26%26Level%3D3%26Conn%3D2%26ProdID%3D238">RTD1073DD</a></b> ) is under a small cooler - I did not take it off, as it seems to be on hot melt, which I simply do not have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b58/22b/380/b5822b3801ba23f2da0a88f201e1f950.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first, the device worked on the table (or rather, on the packing ‚Äúfoam‚Äù) in a disassembled form - the main thing is that the cooler does not cling to anything.  It is impossible without it - in idle mode, even on the reverse side of the board it becomes very hot.  In this situation, there is a small hum (‚Äúcooler + hard disk‚Äù at a distance of 50 cm from the ears), but if you put everything in the case and sit a couple of meters away from the TV, you can ignore the noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fe/874/361/0fe8743619c1ba383010b7906cb051ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  The manual says that the remote control must be carefully aimed at the IR receiver, but my signals were received even at an angle of 90 degrees.  After pressing the "red button", the device turns on and comes on full alert for a modest 15 seconds. <br>  First, there is a primary configuration - language (9 languages ‚Äã‚Äãavailable, including Russian) menu, date and time, task of wired network parameters (I trusted DHCP, although everything can be driven in manually; I liked how the fields for entering IPs look like).  Then follows the offer to format the installed disk. <br><br>  By the way, the most primitive interface was to be observed further, to which I was somewhat surprised.  Why did the company develop the ‚Äúsensational‚Äù <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/97846/">mediabar</a></b> shell if it is not here?  But I was hoping to see) Moreover, even in previous models of popcorn, the interface was much more advanced and functional.  Here ... something completely incomprehensible from the past.  But, we have to admit, IT does not slow down at all and, in principle, performs all the tasks well;) <br><br>  So, the main screen consists of only 3 items - ‚Äú <b>View</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>Settings</b> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <b>Copy</b> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ee/240/380/0ee240380bc5b7370a2ae071476b41d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the fact that in each of the paragraphs there is not so much of everything, I will delve a little into intimate details.  I really wanted to make beautiful screenshots, but even with the PIP mode via the component connection, the image could not be captured (and there was no capture card) - so everything was taken with a tripod. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3e/1b9/5a6/b3e1b95a6d4cb0dca84d8bca85c387b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  <b>View</b> <br>  At the very top of this window there are 4 tabs of ‚Äúmedia filters‚Äù - ‚Äúmovies‚Äù, ‚Äúphotos‚Äù, ‚Äúmusic‚Äù and ‚Äúall‚Äù;  This is not a new approach, but as practice shows, it is very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3da/946/e32/3da946e322ed2d1bccaea0e488c8cfd4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/101/ea5/245/101ea524507a2cac6c5cdc1ba3758a44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Below is selected the data source - USB-drive, HDD, DVD, NET or memory card.  It is strange that all this is present, although some of the carriers are simply not in the system. <br><br>  Moving through folders is fast, as well as flipping through the file list.  Each file to the right of the name displays information about it, and in the case of media data, the contents are also shown in the preview window.  It is inconvenient that there is no scrollbar in the file selection window. <br><br>  If you try to create a new folder somewhere, the on-screen keyboard will appear on the screen;  you will have to print on it if you want to log in through the player to any computer on the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3a/2ae/87a/d3a2ae87a5349c58b2e805485b9b36b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, I already lost the habit of such an input method, but in the dark I really appreciated it - I did it very quickly, without looking at the buttons of the console.  He would have the backlight, and so ... But I was surprised that the console from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/106563/">Microlab Solo 6C</a> speakers came up to the player - I just in case wanted to turn down the volume, and eventually got to navigate the player menu) <br><br>  Web preview works even for large files.  There are no problems with Cyrillic, but omnivorous about a little further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  <b>Copying</b> <br>  It's simple.

But there is no wireless module inside) Its presence is assumed by the user - for this case I used the <b>D-Link DWA-140</b> adapter, but I couldn‚Äôt make it work (although I used it quite tolerably on the same Dune Base 3).  The manufacturer recommends using USB devices on RTL 8187B, 8191 and 8192 chips, but I don‚Äôt have such wealth, so I had to without Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7d/5b1/980/d7d5b19807b2f768199e3592083a0fb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, here's what I want to pay attention to.  The process of updating the firmware is done through ... In general, updating the firmware through the settings window did not work for me and, apparently, does not work for others either) And you have to do this: go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website, download the necessary files, drop them on the USB flash drive and already only after that we do our plans.  At least, this is how it is proposed to install the BT client and samba, whose files are on the miniCD out of the box and which need to be copied from there to the USB flash drive.  To my shame, I don‚Äôt have a drive on one of the three home computers (there is one on one, but it‚Äôs slotted, so I dig out more with pulling out the pig), which is why I was left without a part of the device‚Äôs functionality (if you believe the <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D62:17853">forum</a> IXBT, the inside is quite tolerable rocking).  At a minimum, this approach is inconvenient, as a maximum - at the moment I have not found a single file on the company's website.  But it would seem ... <br><br>  As an option, go over HTTP to the IP player - there will be a simple web interface (Neighbor Web) with a primitive torrent client (btpd) ... but this should be entered through the computer‚Äôs browser.

When the file was selected, the message ‚ÄúNetwork speed 30,000 kbps‚Äù jumped out - in the future this figure fluctuated in the range of 25-30K. <br><br>  The player remembers the place where the playback of the file ended and knows how to continue playing from the stop.  If desired, there is a rewind (1.5x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x and 32x - even at the maximum speed, the rewind remains smooth) and slow playback (3 / 4x, 1 / 2x, 1 / 4x, 1 / 8x and 1 / 16x ).  Zoom available - 2x, 3x, 4x or 8x. <br><br>  Subtitles are turned on by a separate button and are quite flexibly configured - encoding, color, size, indent, and synchronization;  It's great that all this changes while watching, and not through the exit to the settings menu. <br><br>  To test the omnivorousness of the media player, I took the standard test kit <b>HDTV Test 1.7</b> , to which I added a couple of large photos and music files.

And here, in fact, even in the top model there is absolutely nothing revolutionary new, not to mention the younger models.  There is no Mediabar, on which the company placed such a big emphasis - and in fact it was so desirable to touch. <br>  But, in fact, consumers have only benefited from this.  The price of all three new products is more than democratic, which means that the cost of previous models may be further reduced.  But for this money a player is offered, the capabilities of which will be enough for most fans to watch even the highest quality films) Excellent omnivorousness both in file formats and supported media - the plastic O! Play or some other foreign Chinese box can hardly boast.  Practical metal body - another plus for aesthetes. <br>  Of course, it wasn‚Äôt enough in this keg of honey and without tar - what is the interface alone ... IMHO, it should be at least a little embarrassing for the public in our time) But on the other hand ... who is looking at these interfaces?  Moving through folders in search of a movie will take a fraction of a percent of the time that the movie goes. <br>  In general, a very good choice for your money - the price / quality ratio is at a more than competitive level.  To be or not to be - here you need to solve the tasks that you want to delegate to this kind of device. <br><br>  As you might guess from the photos, the hero of the next review will be the new iPod Nano 6G.  Cool thing;) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107749/</a></p>
