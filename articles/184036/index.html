Death to Copyright - 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, my name is Alexey, I am 33 years old and I am a copywriter, - he crookedly grinned at the unshaven reflection, clinked glasses with a mirror and emptied his glass with a swoop. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlthough what kind of copywriter I am is the most common bankrupt and alcoholic ...‚Äù <br><br>  And what else remains to be done when the debt is almost one and a half microcoin?  Two days ago, his account was finally transferred from Read only to Access denied mode.  Life is over and there is no way out.

Put a finger - and all problems will be solved ... <br><br>  The problems began a year and a half ago, when Alexey, instead of updating the iron on his mining farm, took a new virtual reality capsule into a mortgage ... <br><br>  The strange thing is language - why suddenly mining and on a farm?  And then what about mine?  However, the last year, the farm still almost did not generate income - everyone ate rent payments and electricity fees ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With the total transition of the entire Internet to secured nominal transactions, the demand for computing power grew so much that enterprising businessmen made no fortune on this ... the edge ... <br><br>  Alexey splashed into the glass, twirled the turbid liquid, looking at the rainbow drips on the glass ... <br><br>  Still, it is surprising, from which insignificant events global changes begin - one archduke alone was enough, but we needed 300 pedophiles ... Are they specifically trying to figure out the numbers? <br><br>  There has always been an amazing consensus about child pornography in the world community - and when the security services revealed another ‚Äúgang of pedophiles‚Äù, patience broke. <br><br>  For three years, a legislative base was adopted and a technological upgrade was carried out - the era of a digital signature has replaced the open protocol, which allowed to remain anonymous.  Now any block of information had to be signed by the creator, and to get it, you had to provide your signature.  Anonymous information transfer was blocked at the provider level.  New network unpretentiously called Internet 2.0 <br><br>  The era of personalization has begun.  According to the initial plan, within five years all the content from the old Internet was to be digitally signed by the authors and transferred to the new one.  Then the term was extended twice, but in the end, by a strong-willed decision, all the remaining anonymous content was signed by the public domain and copied into the archive.  A hundred people came to the commemoration on the Internet ... <br>  Alexey had nothing to bear.  He did not create his content, but he considered it immoral to bark at someone else.  Yes, and this is a matter of jurisdiction - the terms for plagiarism (verification of someone else's content with his signature) have doubled recently and were punished for up to five years of disconnection from the network with the cancellation of illegal transactions and resetting the account. <br><br>  All this damn account ... "Units of contribution to the noosphere," or simply Coin - here it is a real scourge of our century.  "People are dying for hashes." <br><br>  If you want fresh content, kindly pay the creator.  Well, don‚Äôt forget about the obligatory payment to the provider ... Alexei himself tried to write articles on the history of circuit engineering of the 20th century, but low karma did not allow to set a high rate, and even a unit of the same enthusiasts like himself rocked the secret rate.  Something brought the farm, and the rest had to donati for real.  Although given the ever-growing rate of the coin to the ruble, it‚Äôs time to ask which of the currencies is more real ... <br><br>  Yes, copyright is dead ... Now, no one can ban the use of information or content - any program, any film can be watched by anyone, anytime, just to have enough "Contribution to the noosphere."  Coins will automatically be deducted from your account to the account of the author.  Want to use someone else's intellectual product - create your own.  If you don‚Äôt want to create, Donata‚Äôs numerous exchanges will welcome you into their hospitable arms.  But where can I get it, real? <br><br>  Alexey decidedly took the business card and put his finger. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Mr. Ruby turned out to be a charming balding fat man with plump fingers and tenacious brown eyes. <br><br>  - You see, the development of a quantum processor is still at the conversational stage, but all this time the most powerful processor has been idle in each of us!  Billions of neurons, every thousand connections, hundreds of types of signals, and most importantly, all this self-learning wealth is created by nature for this work.  - Ruby chatted incessantly, dragging Alexey through the sterile corridors of the Brain factory. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAbsolutely safe, we use only the visual cortex of the brain, here the soft palm stroked the back of his head.‚Äù  But you imagine how much high-quality content will be created with your help? <br><br>  - I will remember something?  - Alexey asked gloomily.  After yesterday's head, the head broke unbearably and even a weightless touch caused pain. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou see, we have agreements ...‚Äù Mr. Ruby smiled guiltily.  - Serious offices ... but you can believe me, this will be your best year in life ... And in a year you will return as a respected person - 12 milikoins - one for each month of your brain! <br><br>  * * * <br>  The lid of the MRI transceiver slowly lowered, cutting off the laboratory light.  Softly boomed servos.  And only then, having found himself in complete darkness, Alexey realized what he was doing. <br><br>  - Stand !!!  Let go!  I disagree!  - a panic attack caused him to bend a painful convulsion, Alexei beat, tearing off the contacts, a guide hit his forehead, tears spilled from his eyes.  - Do not, I do not want! <br><br>  Consciousness faded for a second, then the lid flung open, revealing Mr. Ruby's face with displeasure. <br><br>  - What are you, my friend, just like a young lady ... 21st century in the yard - you do not want - go, no one will keep you.  Find where else you will be given as much - tell me! <br><br>  Alexey didn‚Äôt answer anything, wiped the contact ointment from his face and, trying not to take off running, left the building. <br><br>  * * * <br>  After 3 hours the city was over.  For another industrial area suddenly opened the field and a small pond framed by green birch trees.  Alexey went to the beach, threw off his sandals and lowered his tired legs into the water.  Around, pleasantly tickling skin, fry spun. <br><br>  He did not see where she came from.  In a light blue dress to the knees and with a stupid wreath of dandelions.  She silently sat beside her and threw a wreath into the water, scaring the fish away.  And when the silence became quite unbearable, she turned to Alexey and, smiling, asked: <br><br>  - Is the truth very beautiful here? <br><br>  And only somewhere far, far away sounded the smartphone, confirming the arrival of the first payment. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183506/">With thanks for the reinforced ration</a> , Denis Vitman.
