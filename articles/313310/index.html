  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DevCon School: Future Technologies, November 1 (Moscow)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  In the summer, we summarized inside the results of the past IT season and made plans for the new year (at Microsoft, the fiscal year starts on July 1).  One such discussion was around working with the developer communities and, in particular, approaches to organizing our own conferences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a62/683/3d4/a626833d41e9475d8eeba5bda7cd7afe.JPG"><br><br>  As a result of the discussion, we made a difficult and, I am sure, timely decision to change our approach to the events and, especially, their format.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Time for a change </h2><br>  If you follow what is happening in the world of technology, then you could not miss some interesting trends: <br><br><ul><li>  First, from traditional conferences (vendor and industrial), the focus of attention has shifted significantly towards regular communities (mitaps), the coverage of some of which is in reality comparable to small conferences. <br><br></li><li>  Secondly, and we saw it in our events, the demand for immersion in technology has grown (workshops, labs, workshops, intensives), in comparison with simple survey reports or a brief exchange of experience.  The latter can be found on the Internet or on the same meetings. <br><br></li><li>  And, thirdly, we, as always, live in the most interesting time, when in parallel began to grow a lot of new directions that are all interesting and difficult for everyone to follow on their own.  This does not mean that they are necessarily complex, rather, they often do not even know where to go. </li></ul><br>  Of course, we began to guess that something was wrong before, so in the spring of this year we added an increased dose of master classes to our traditional conference DevCon and introduced the format of intensives, which in practice (that is, during the event) really dragged on most of the attention of developers. <br><br><h2>  Format change </h2><br>  In the summer, we realized that we need to move on, "so we went on": <br><br><ol><li>  The traditional DevCon conference was canceled in the spring (we also loved it very much) </li><li>  We moved to the concept of regular <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/">schools DevCon</a> , which will focus on a deep immersion in technology. </li></ol><br>  Regular thematic schools will be held once a quarter, periodically mixed with the "big" schools that collect several technologies at the same time. <br><br><ul><li>  In September, we tested the <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cognitive-School/2016-09/">first cognitive technology school</a> .  The second school will be announced later and will be held in December. </li><li>  November 1 will be a "big" <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2016-11/">school DevCon about the technology of the future</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Who do we have schools for? </h3><br>  All schools are focused on practitioners: you are ready to write code, delve into the intricacies, study applied libraries and tools, and it is important for you to get a tangible result.  You are interested in new technologies, you are eager not to miss an interesting moment in the development of the industry, and are ready to promote this development yourself. <br><br><h2>  DevCon School: Future Technologies </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1b/01f/352/f1b01f352fa64a81a749027fc473bd1b.jpg"><br><br>  So, after a week and a half, on November 1, we are holding a one-day event in Moscow.  (At this moment I want to write a ‚Äúconference‚Äù out of habit, but no!).  It will be entirely devoted to the study of new technologies that are already beginning to change the familiar landscape. <br><br>  The school program includes: <br><br><ul><li>  General discovery </li><li>  Machine learning intensive </li><li>  Intensive on the Internet of things </li><li>  Intensive by Xamarin </li><li>  12 workshops on a variety of technologies (today we announced 7 of 12): <br><ul><li>  Using Azure Resource Manager in application lifecycle management </li><li>  Azure Service Fabric - a new generation platform for hosting and managing distributed systems </li><li>  A bit of cloud computing theory - Brewer theorem and its interpretation </li><li>  Chat bots and cognitive services for 2 hours </li><li>  CNTK - tools for the design and training of neural networks </li><li>  Blockchain as a new wave of technological development?  Moving from words to code </li><li>  Practical use of cryptography tools in .NET, Java and PHP </li></ul></li><li>  Evening round tables with experts </li></ul><br>  School participants will have to choose their school participation scheme: visit one of three intensive courses (6 hours) or 3 of 12 master classes (2 hours each). <br><br><h3>  School participation on November 1 </h3><br>  The school is free only in full-time format (without online).  You can get to school in one of two ways: <br><br><ol><li>  You were called there and you have a promotional code </li><li>  You <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2016-11/apply">went through the millstones of selection</a> , responding well to the questions during registration </li></ol><br><h3>  Attention question </h3><br>  If you want to receive a promotional code for participation in the school on November 1, answer in the comments to the following question: <br><blockquote>  How would you explain to a 7-year-old child what quantum computing is? </blockquote><br>  The first 10 people who answered on the merits will receive a promotional code. <br><br>  We will be glad to see you at our schools! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313310/</a></p>
