Games in which you can do absolutely everything.  Games in which everything you see has a reason for its appearance.  No fake doors leading to nowhere.  No trees that can not be cut down.  No contrived plots designed to make the player play.  On the contrary, the user must create his own history and, communicating with the game world, decide what he wants to do. <br><br>  I worked on two games of this type.  I did the first of them together with Rolf - it was called <a href="http://wurmonline.com/">Wurm Online</a> and was braking and impudent, but amazing.  A couple of years later, I made <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> , just at the time when indie games started to become something big, and he just blew up the audience.  Since I love to communicate with players and the community, and perhaps because I always happily share my opinions about things, they began to recognize me, and I got a lot of fans.  Just then my tweets became news from the world of games. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About a year ago, I started working on the third ‚Äúomg you can all‚Äù game, called <a href="http://0x10c.com/">0x10c</a> .  It was assumed that this would be a game on a space theme, where, unlike other such games, you control your character who was in space, and not just his spaceship.  And here you are trying to save your ship, killing aliens with laser guns, fighting fires and programming your own virtual on-board computer.  It was very ambitious, but I was sure I would pull it out.  And even if I don, <i>then what</i> ?  A bunch of my prototypes failed long before they even became at all like something.

      What I did not take into account is the fact that now a great many people are watching my games.  So, they came to a crazy delight, and the pressure created by their concern about whether the game will come out or not, gradually began to spoil the thrill received from this project.  I spent a lot of time wondering if I even wanted to continue making games.  I thought that I could just stop talking about what I was doing, but this is completely inconsistent with my nature.  Then one day, I just stopped working on the project and finally decided to mentally put it aside to try to make things smaller.  It turned out that I like to <i>make</i> games.  Do not promote them and try to sell as many copies as possible.  I just want to experiment and develop and reflect and fix and debug. <br><br>  I recently streamed Team Fortress 2, and they asked me how 0x10c was going.  I said that I wasn‚Äôt actually working on it, and that was news.  And I understood why.  In truth, it shouldn‚Äôt surprise me.  But I really <i>really</i> do not want to be another unfinished dreamy game designer.  In the world of games such and without me is full. <br><br>  Some people from the community 0x10c <a href="http://www.usgamer.net/articles/notch-puts-0x10c-on-icecommunity-heats-things-up-by-going-diy">decided to continue working to make their version of their game Project Trillek</a> .  I think it's amazing.  I really want to play this game, but I'm not the person who should do it.  Not anymore.  I am convinced that the new team, which has less interest from the public, can make a much cooler game than the one I was going to make. <br><br>  Last week, I participated in <a href="http://7dfps.com/">7dfps</a> and made a feverish shooter, inspired in many ways by the game Doom, and called it <a href="http://shambles.notch.net/">Shambles</a> .  I have not received such a buzz from programming for many months.  This is what I want to do.  I want to make small games that can fail miserably.  I just want to experiment and develop and reflect and fix and debug. <br><br>  Actually, that's what I'm going to do. <br><br>  I will also continue to communicate with the players and stream my space jumps to tf2 for anyone who wants to listen or watch this.  But, at the moment, I do not want to work on something big. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190640/</a></p>
