  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another registration LLC or a brutal war with the tax</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a year ago I wrote an article on the registration of individual entrepreneurs on my own.  A year later, I decided to register a limited liability company. <br>  This was the beginning of a warrior with a tax. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  Since <strong>I did not have a legal address</strong> , I began to register the company with my home address, since our law does not prohibit this. <br>  By own forces I prepared all package of documents.  It was not at all difficult.  As a precaution, a copy of the letter of the Ministry of Finance about the illegality of refusals to register at the home address was attached to the package of documents.  I studied all the history of failures, operated on all the laws.  I was fully armed.  At least I thought so. <br>  I applied for registration in <strong>MRI FTS No 13 in the Moscow region in Khimki on October 1, 2010</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Getting an answer </h3><br>  On the 10th day (with a delay) I receive a refusal dated three days earlier, so that I could not get to the bottom of the delay.  Upon receipt of a refusal, they take a receipt from me.  And the refusal says: <br><blockquote>  Among the documents submitted for registration are absent: An application for state registration of a legal entity when it is created in form P11011 (In accordance with Chapter I of the Civil Code, Article 288 p.3. non-residential. The transfer of premises from residential to non-residential is carried out in the manner determined by the housing legislation. In accordance with paragraph 2 of article 671 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, a legal entity may use residential premises only  I have people stay). </blockquote>

      Cunning move, right? <br><ul><li>  First, a delay of 3 days. </li><li>  Secondly, the refusal due to failure to submit a statement, which of course was. </li><li>  Thirdly, the withdrawal of receipts so that I could not prove anything. </li></ul><br><br>  It became quite sad, but I decided not to dwell on it.  There was little chance. <br><br><h3>  Letter 1 </h3><br>  I decided to write a letter to the Federal Tax Service Administration for the Moscow Region, demanding to clarify the situation with the refusal, taking into account the letter of the Ministry of Finance. <br><br><blockquote><h5>  <em>Lyrical digression</em> </h5><br>  While I was waiting for an answer, it just so happened that I had a legal address in Moscow.  I went to the 46th tax and calmly filed documents for the state.  registration. <br></blockquote><br><br>  After about 2 weeks I get a certificate of state registration from the 46th tax.  I am happy.  And on the same day I receive a response from the Office regarding my refusal.  The answer is on 4 pages, of which only the last 5 lines are useful, which say: <br><blockquote>  During the consideration of this complaint, it was established that the package of documents for the state.  The registration of LLC "..." complies with the requirements of Law 129-FZ.  Thus, the MIFNS of Russia No. 13 in the Moscow Region <strong>illegally</strong> renounced a refusal in the state registration of the creation of the LLC "...". </blockquote><br>  It was a victory, while small but already a victory. <br><blockquote>  In the current situation, the Administration of the Federal Tax Service of Russia for the Moscow Region <strong>instructs</strong> MIFNS # 13 to carry out the state procedure.  registration LLC "..." </blockquote><br>  I was shocked.  What does "instruct" mean?  Where does such an initiative come from?  Why do I need 2 identical companies? <br><br><h3>  Debriefing </h3><br>  I went to MIFNS number 13 to understand.  I was kicked from office to office for 2 hours and nobody wanted to listen.  When I got tired of it, I called the head and said that I was going to the police and writing a statement under Article 169 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  After that, I was immediately accepted, explained the situation so that they would stop the registration procedure and demanded a return of the state duty.  The tax authorities were in a state of shock, this was the first time they had a situation; they clearly did not know what to do.  I wrote a statement on the return of the state duty and went home with peace of mind. <br><br><h3>  Return month </h3><br>  A month later, I receive a letter with the refusal to return the state.  fees due to the <strong>absence of authentic payment documents</strong> . <br>  Do you understand, yes?  They demand a receipt for the payment of state from me.  duties that they have in the registration department and I am not issued.  I did not think that it happens. <br>  There was only one way out - to contact management again. <br><br>  This time I decided to make a call, explained the whole situation, demanded to remove from office all the officials involved in my case.  I was told that they will understand and thanked for the appeal. <br>  After 2 hours I call MRI FTS # 13, pretending that I don‚Äôt know anything, and ask why they refused.  They tell me that apparently they were ‚Äúnot completely satisfied‚Äù with their refusal, and they decided to go to a meeting and review it.  As a result, they decided to return the state tax. <br>  <strong>March 5, 2011 the war was over, the state duty was returned to the current account</strong> <br><br>  Results: <br>  During the proceedings, the head of MRI FTS No. 13 in the Moscow region was replaced. <br>  <b>From this moment MRI FTS ‚Ññ13 does not refuse to register at the home address.</b> <br>  Needless to say, everything is bad in our country, we must fight and try to make sure that everything is good. <br><br>  What I relied on: <br>  <a href="http://www.taxpravo.ru/zakonodatelstvo/statya-92962-pismo_minfina_rf_ot_3_dekabrya_2008_g_N_03-01-11_5-159">Letter of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation of December 3, 2008 N 03-01-11 / 5-159</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ukru.ru/code/08/169/index.htm">Article 169 of the Criminal Code</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284596/</a></p>
