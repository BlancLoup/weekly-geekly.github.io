      In order to maximally work out the strategy of reaching target consumers, most brands focus on mobile advertising campaigns during the holiday season.  People go outside their offices and spend more and more time behind mobile devices.  As we have repeatedly noted in our past releases, the mobile is gaining momentum every day, so companies are constantly introducing new tools, practicing new marketing techniques to get the maximum effect in the matter of getting customers. <br><br>  Goods and services that generate the most profit during the summer season include clothing, travel, tourism, air travel, entertainment, and local retail. <br><br>  For example, Expedia, a well-known booking-company, has increased spending on mobile advertising for the entire summer season, as it rightly expects a large influx of people using smartphones to book airline tickets and hotels. <br><br>  <b>New offers</b> <br><br>  Brands that do not have mobile applications, or at least an adaptive website, voluntarily give a significant number of potential customers to competitors who are eager to ‚Äúbite off‚Äù a tasty ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of the market in the summer. <br><br>  Several top brands have released summer offers and incentives for mobile users to reach a wider audience and generate mobile traffic.  The 7-Eleven supermarket chain launched multi-channel communication using SMS, mWeb, social media and mobile advertising.  This approach was used to stimulate future traffic to those users who are constantly ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  The strategy was built on the basis of thematic campaigns that affect consumers in an unobtrusive playful form, corresponding to the mood of the holidays. <br>  <b>Social media</b> <br><br>  Integration of social networks with mobile devices allows users to share their impressions of their summer vacation.  Even a small activity of brands in social networks, their ‚Äúshores‚Äù about new products and promotions guarantee an increase in the number of product views and additional sales. <br><br>  Filling social networks with ‚Äúsummer‚Äù content is a reliable way to attract new customer base.  More recently, one of the largest summer campaigns, Share a Coke, launched the next ad campaign.  Special marked beverage bottles were released, on which were strings of famous songs.  Buyers could record a video with the performance of the song and ‚Äúshare‚Äù it in social networks. <br><br>  <b>83% of consumers say that they trust the recommendations of friends and relatives more than any type of advertising.</b> <br><br>  Thanks to the content that users can share in their favorite social networks, companies receive an additional bonus - information about them will be transmitted ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù, and this is the most powerful marketing tool. <br><br>  <b>Adaptation of promotions for socio-demographic indicators and trends</b> <br><br>  <b>Personalizing messages increases the number of purchases, opening applications and other conversion rates by 27.5%.</b>  Given the latest trends in consumer behavior, you can establish effective communication with customers.  As we know from our past articles, today's marketers have in their arsenal a large set of tools.  For example, they can set the target according to preferences, interests, socio-demographic indicators, which makes communication with the brand as personal and trustful as possible.  For example, during the start of the summer Olympics in Brazil, brands offer special promotions for products of red, white and blue colors and focus on campaigns related to popular sports - swimming, jogging, basketball. <br><br>  <b>Geo-location and time</b> <br><br>  It is no secret that in summer people go on a massive journey.  If your business is located in several places, set up advertising campaigns for those locations that are most popular with tourists.  For example, if one store is located near the lake or on the beach, and another is located in the center of the city, then it is wiser to choose a location near the water, where there is a greater number of tourists. <br><br>  Do not forget that the setting of the time of day for summer campaigns is not identical to the settings for typical campaigns during the work week, since vacationers are in no way tied to a limited schedule. <br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br><br>  And of course, consider the timing of your summer advertising campaign.  Of course, they are limited, but their semantic content should be relevant throughout the summer period.  For example, coupons to the water park or the action on swimsuits in early August may be ineffective, because people are preparing for the school year and are interested in buying school supplies. <br><br>  The period of preparation for school is the second largest shopping season of the year, when parents-smartphone users are most active.  In this case, a personalized newsletter with coupons on the subject of the school and the academic year, targeting mobile devices of customers, will be relevant. <br><br>  Summer mobile marketing campaigns are relevant not only for B2C brands.  B2B marketers should also be ‚Äúon the alert,‚Äù especially if their business is in an industry in which the summer season is key to increasing sales and distributing the budget.  <b>Brands that think over summer marketing strategies in advance are ‚Äúdoomed‚Äù to get higher user involvement, closer and trustful communication with customers and large sales at the end of the season.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr26052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301906/</a></p>
