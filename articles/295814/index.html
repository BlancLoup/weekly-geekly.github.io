Which countries are optimistic about this or that technology, and which - with pessimism?  ABBYY specialists analyzed the base of three million materials of scientific, state, public and value reflection development in the media for the period 2005 - 2015. <br><br>  Mankind is waiting for a cure for cancer and is interested in space, discusses the intervention in the human genome and is not sure of the security of his mind and brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/483/265/a81/483265a81ac2e2de233819f00f6c88a8.png" width="450" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the <a href="http://www.innoconstraints.com/">study</a> , humanity is consistently concerned about the technological challenges associated with health and medicine, education, the impact of technology on culture and values, the role of state regulation of science and technology.  Compared to 2005, mankind has twice become more concerned about how digital technologies are changing our lives.

      The main fears of mankind are the inability of science and medicine to defeat a number of diseases, including cancer and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243983/">tuberculosis</a> , and the inability to eliminate the risks of war and terrorism.  In the semantic field ‚Äúthreat‚Äù, the concepts associated with these two challenges are 19% and 18%, respectively. <br><br>  If Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are focused on discussing the risks and problems related to technology, then Russia, Switzerland and Singapore, on the contrary, see prospects and innovations in technology.  Russia, China and Asian countries are discussing the prospects and possibilities of robotics.  The European Union is focused on threats and risks, people are worried about possible unemployment.  In every fourth text, the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/robohunter/blog/264382/">issue of unemployment is adjacent to the development of robotics</a> . <br><br>  Experts expected to see a lot of attention to the topic of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/264688/">artificial intelligence</a> , but the results surprised them: only 0.2% of the total array of publications are devoted to this topic.  Most often, artificial intelligence is spoken in the USA, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. <br><br>  The disclosures made by Edward Snowden in 2013 led to an explosion of negativity regarding the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/262192/">‚Äúbright digital future‚Äù</a> around the world.  Humanity is extremely unsure about the security of its consciousness and brain: 1.3% of the total base of articles is devoted to the risks that technological explosion carries to our consciousness. <br><br>  The interest of scientists to the problem of GMOs dies away after a peak in 2012.  To feed a multi-billion population is more important than doubts, now we are not afraid to create modified tomatoes.  On the contrary, one of the fastest growing calls to mention is the intervention in the life of a person of technologies of genetic modification, and specifically of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/247240/">human genetic editing</a> .  The concern of scientists with this topic has doubled around the world in seven years. <br><br>  The state and its function in the innovation environment causes irritation in a bizarre set of countries: here the United States, Great Britain, Russia, India and Iran.  In China and Korea, the state as a participant in innovative development is neutral, while in Israel and Japan they are inclined to believe in its smart power in matters of progress. <br><br>  The security threats associated with the risks of war and terror have both the highest rating and the steadily growing momentum of interest. <br><br>  Interest in space is huge - 0.43% of all texts are devoted to it.  This is 2.5 times the total number of texts about cancer drugs.  The technological challenges associated with the health industry are 2% of the total amount of information analyzed. <br><br><h4>  Five main topics </h4><br>  <b>5th place: the impact of the technological revolution on the mind and brain</b> <br>  8.1% of the total volume of texts are devoted to the influence of the technological revolution on the human mind and brain.  The issue of schizophrenia worries people more than unemployment.  Especially about these problems worry in the USA, Europe and Japan. <br><br>  <b>4th place: digital nudity</b> <br>  The Internet is already within the confines of a person‚Äôs private life.  If at the beginning of the XXI century, only a few spoke about this, now - 9.1% of publications are devoted to this topic.  It is about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/264824/">interference in privacy</a> and about cybercrime. <br><br>  <b>3rd place: war and terror</b> <br>  10% of publications are related to security threats, wars and terror.  Bursts of fear associated with the emergence of high-tech and immoral weapons - drones, cruise missiles.  Experts fear new technologies in these areas. <br><br>  <b>2 place: the role of the state</b> <br>  10.2% of publications relate to the field of state efficiency in technological development.  Moreover, in 40% of them the state is seen in a negative light.  Neutral to him are in China, and in Israel and Japan tend to believe in the wise power of the state.  The key complaint of state critics is strict planning.  Others see financing and, again, planning as its advantages. <br><br>  <b>1st place: health</b> <br>  The most important topic for humanity is the health industry, it was written about in 12.6% of the analyzed materials.  People are concerned about the inability of science to defeat certain diseases.  The most anticipated discovery in the last thirty years is the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/264112/">cure for cancer</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295814/</a></p>
