  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sun boom in Japan and myths about alternative energy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the accident at the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant in Japan, one after another, all 54 nuclear reactors were stopped for a routine inspection, which provided 30% of the country's electricity.  Without nuclear energy, the country's economy is waiting for a protracted crisis, but in order to re-launch a nuclear power plant, it is necessary that the local authorities agree at all levels, which is almost impossible to get after the Fukushima disaster.  So far, the government has <a href="http://ria.ru/atomtec/20120614/672837862.html">managed to agree</a> on the launch of only two reactors in the city of Oi in July. <br><br>  If in the short term, at least part of the nuclear power plants in Japan cannot be run without, in the long run, the Japanese have resolutely shifted to alternative sources.  On July 1, a new law on subsidies for clean energy producers will come into force.  For twenty years, Japan will pay 42 yen (42 eurocents) per kilowatt / hour for solar electricity, twice as much as the world leader in alternative energy, Germany, and 23 yen for wind energy, which is several times higher than the German price.  The increased tariff will be set for geothermal installations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Subsidies should provide an increase in solar and wind energy capacity <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-17/solar-boom-heads-to-japan-creating-9-6-billion-market-energy.html">by 3.2 gigawatts per year</a> , or two and a half times faster than in 2011. The government expects to bring the share of alternative sources to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Japan">20% by the beginning of the 20s</a> .  Against the background of reduced subsidies in Germany, Japan could become the new global leader in clean energy.  The Fukushima accident created a unique opportunity for such a breakthrough - the majority of the Japanese population are so strongly opposed to nuclear power plants that they are ready to tolerate a serious increase in the price of electricity, which should occur after the introduction of new tariffs. <br><br><h5>  And now about the myths </h5><br>  Usually in the comments to each article devoted to alternative sources of energy the same standard misunderstanding emerges.  They say that solar panels and wind turbines are a complete sell-off, and for all the time they are in operation, the costs are much higher than their output, moreover, just producing a solar panel requires more electricity than it produces in all its life.  This is not true.  The coefficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested">EROEI</a> (the ratio of the amount of energy produced during operation to the total energy consumption for its production) for solar power plants today <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/100525/">is</a> 7-8.  This is only slightly lower than nuclear power plants, and only two or three times less oil and gas.  EROEI of wind power plants is on average equal to 20. 
      <br>

      These are new technologies, and until their potential is exhausted, it is still very far away, so their EROEI will only grow in the future.  Solar panels have fallen in price several times over the past 10 years, and continue to fall in price.  In wind energy, there is also room for improvement.  And here is the article Habrayuser <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/vovixldr/" class="user_link">VovixLDR</a> " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/28186/">If there is no more oil? Well, sheikh with it</a> ."  In my opinion, she describes the situation in the energy sector very well.  It is also convincing that it was written in 2008, and some things predicted in it really happen today.  So, alternative energy is not a myth, not stupidity and not a scam (if you close your eyes to biofuels with EROEI a little more than one; the family has a black sheep).  Here is another <a href="http://grist.org/renewable-energy/the-truth-about-renewable-energy-inexpensive-reliable-and-inexhaustible/">article</a> about the myths about renewable energy.  The future is closer than it seems. <br><br>  Of course, the very nature of solar and wind energy is not constant.  In order to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, these sources are not yet suitable.  But their share in the overall energy balance is still negligible.  It will take many years for it to reach a critical value (according to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143463/">some sources</a> , up to 25%).  But energy storage technologies also do not stand still.  Here, for example - an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142784/">elegant solution for wind turbines</a> .  In the coming years, Japan plans to put into operation several dozen floating wind power stations, for which such storage facilities are perfect.  Yes, and electric batteries do not stand still.  For example, the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/2/3057856/boulder-ionic-iolyte-lithium-ion-replacement">production of</a> electrolytes from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">ionic liquids</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/2/3057856/boulder-ionic-iolyte-lithium-ion-replacement">is mastered</a> , which will turn ionistors from a niche product into a full-fledged replacement of lithium-ion batteries with much more interesting characteristics. <br><br>  The combination of different renewable sources with different periods of maximum efficiency and a gradually decreasing proportion of old energy capacities on fossil fuels and heavy radioactive materials will make it possible to properly hold out until the advent of an ‚Äúenergy paradise‚Äù of controlled thermonuclear fusion.  According to the assurances of scientists, will have to wait <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7">about forty years</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146027/</a></p>
