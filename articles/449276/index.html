My experience and first successes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br><br>  My name is Marat, I am 40 years old (in my heart is still 25, my wife laughs), I live in Kharkov and want to share my thoughts. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  At 25 years old, with a small baggage of knowledge in the field of programming, I bravely did not fear, as one commentator used to say on Ukrainian television, began self-training in 1C programming.  The years were young, the work went on and although this kind of activity has a lot of negative qualities, in any case you can achieve success and earn respect and other benefits.  In general, in the works, training and coordination 10 years have passed.  And then several circumstances came together at once, thanks to which I made a decision to go to the ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù to android, starting from absolute zero.  I even had a button phone at that time (2014).  It should be noted that for 1c developers it is quite difficult, because 1c itself is a complete product and it does not develop the ability to learn other technologies.  On the contrary, I needed a radical impetus to restart thinking.  Otherwise, I was afraid to become an old <s>fart</s> uncle who is not ready for change.  In the end, after six months of self-study, I was lucky and I was taken as an intern! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The birth of an idea </h4><br>  So, at 36, I changed the vector of development and started to work.  I can say that I worked with the same perseverance as in 1c, but the growth of the level of knowledge and thinking (according to my feelings) was superior. <br>  In general, I was almost satisfied with myself and in addition, unexpectedly for everyone, I got married and became a dad.  And then it began.  I have always been thrifty in terms of costs, kept records during repairs, but in general I knew the entire structure of expenses and income over the past 10 years in my mind.  Keeping records in the program on an ongoing basis for family finances seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time.

      In general, know that when the first child is born, everything changes.  In a state somewhere between panic and hysteria, I decided to start keeping family records of money.  I dug up the applications from the top ten and chose what was suitable.  It is functional, it has a million downloads.  About 9 months later, a great idea was born to do what was needed, moreover, so that it was convenient and pleasant.  Because there were flaws in it, which over time became critical. <br><br>  It's all about the reports.  1c is a powerful tool for accounting, and it has the most advanced technology for generating reports.  My former colleagues will confirm that in the reports I was Chuck Norris.  So, I have not seen a single application in which reports would show me any information that I want to find.  And fast and easy.  Awareness of this increased with each passing day, I kept records, but his analysis became increasingly difficult. <br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br>  In general, I was desperate and wanted to know everything about my expenses.  In the heat of passion, I did not think that the project could be delayed or not end at all.  I had to try.  I took the risk and did not regret it, although the work turned out to be more than I thought.  It was a mixture of work pleasure, lack of sleep and brainstorming.  Completely did everything myself, only 2 pictures my sister drew, for which she takes this opportunity to convey greetings.  And of course, in the best traditions, I conducted the introduction and launch on my account.  From the old program refused immediately.  And now, after 4 months, I am proud to share with all my creation. <br><br>  Technically, inside it is: <br>  Firestore database <br>  Firebase functions <br>  Firebase deeplink <br>  Livedata <br>  Room <br><br><h4>  Opportunities </h4><br>  1. Instant notifications of family members about actions in the system.  Receive push notifications about purchases, transfers, income, editing categories. <br><br>  2. Use the level of detail that is convenient for you.  When entering income or expenses, you can specify categories or subcategories. <br><br>  3. Simple and detailed reports. <br>  - details by category or wallets <br>  - detailing by periods (day, week, month, quarter, year) <br>  - totals by category, by clicking on categories report is built by subcategories or back <br><br>  4. Planning (orders, they are the same shopping list) <br><br>  5. Multicurrency. <br><br>  6. History of actions in the system <br><br>  7. Convenient and visual magazine, with filters and results <br><br>  8. Can be used for work.  For example, the foreman leads cost estimates, the customer can see everything online. <br><br><h4>  Perspectives </h4><br>  Plans for the development of functionality, the development of iOS version. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dua.karelov.beansfree">The application can be downloaded from the link</a> (it is free, there is no advertising or any purchases). <br><br>  I would like to know the opinion of the community, wishes and comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449276/</a></p>
