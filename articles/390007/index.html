  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A good project from the Kickstarter site - LuMini lamp with a light alarm clock</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  March 12, 2014 on Kickstarter started a company to raise funds to finance the project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tabuproducts/lumini-a-simple-bluetooth-smart-bulb-for-everyone">LuMini</a> .  Less than in the month of April 1, the necessary amount for the start of production was collected, and by the end of the company the amount of fees was $ 76,240 dollars.  The company involved 1 171 people.  In principle, for the start of sales it was enough to collect $ 25,000, but with an increase in the budget, additional bonuses were announced in the form of releasing lamps for different sockets.  In addition to the widespread E26 and E27, when the threshold of $ 37,000 was reached, an E14 base was added (a very popular format among small bedside and table lamps), and a slightly more specific and compact E12 was added when the threshold of $ 50,000 was reached.  In principle, the E14 format with a small adapter for E27 turned out to be a winning option, it was in this form that I got this dj. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec3/1f3/4c0/ec31f34c041647559727d261befce3b4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/f70/fb5/18bf70fb5f084706a722d59c29b27ba9.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the packaging of the lamp.  Very decent look.  Some kind of cardboard is very dense, and inside the base on which the lamp is held is generally made of cardboard, as if wooden.  So the inner holder holds the lamp very well, in the center, not letting it lean against the walls of the package.  This is true for transportation, especially since the body of the lamp is ceramic.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d0/26a/48f/4d026a48fc014c428dd161a796563daa.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, yes, no cheap plastic painted with silverfish for aluminum, only rub ceramics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f6/ca1/5f1/8f6ca15f1f6d4c7c8505fa9e1c45c63e.jpg"><br><br>  Together with the lamp inside the package lies the instruction and the adapter base for chambered E27.  That's basically all the equipment. <br><br>  For the initial tests, I have a detail from an old floor lamp, there is just an E14 base, and we will check all lamp modes on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/32e/797/34632e797d314a4bb0eba863b55ee6e5.jpg"><br><br>  We install the application by QR code from the package to the smartphone and turn on the lamp in the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ec/154/f70/6ec154f700a24923b476d5b1e44c5c1f.jpg"><br><br>  After turning on the lamp lights up in white (well, it‚Äôs according to the instructions it‚Äôs white), in fact it is a little bluish.  The fact is that the white diodes have a cool 3500K shade.  If I honestly did at least a little warmer the shade of the first inclusion, it would still be more pleasant, and there is an opportunity to control the color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/f3a/a6d/831f3aa6d0fc48b7b404dc3bef32498d.jpg"><br><br>  Well, it is particular.  As the manufacturer promises, this lamp compares favorably with similar ones in that it does not need to be hooked to a special hub that connects to the WiFi network.  It was developed in 2014, remember?  Now this does not surprise anyone, the Chinese have already put this technology on stream and every second lamp can cling to the phone via Bluetooth.  Although so far the number of lamps with IR remotes is still large. <br><br>  Go to the management of the lamp.  We download the necessary application - ‚ÄúTabulumen‚Äù from the Play Store or Apple-store and install it on the smartphone. <br>  Then we connect the lamp via Bluetooth and it appears in the list of lamps in the application - everything is simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38c/9c0/761/38c9c0761b27430196212dfe9eadd005.jpg"><br><br>  When tapping the lamp, we get to the direct control section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bad/2fa/f20/bad2faf204fc4e0f8dea781d1c34afef.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is intuitive.  You press on the color circle to the desired color - the lamp immediately changes the color of the backlight.  Under the circle is a brightness slider, in the brightest position of which the colors are not so saturated, but they shine brighter.  In the minimum position the colors are more juicy, but the lamp brightness is only suitable for backlighting.  One of the possible applications is the backlight for photographers, although it is possible that a 3W LED will not be enough and you need a couple or a little more of these lamps, but you don‚Äôt need to spend money on backgrounds, and now they are oh so expensive.  One background, for example, stands as 4 such lamps.  By the way, I read that a similar lamp from a subsidiary of Xiaomi - yeelight blue does this with a delay, here everything happens instantly.  In general, yeelight blue is very similar to this lamp, except that the body is not ceramic but aluminum, everything else is an exact copy.  Do not be surprised to learn that this project has been transformed into Yeelight.  For the sake of fairness, I note that I tried the application from yeelight in the hope that it would work, yet there is a more modern design, but alas, it did not see the lamp. <br><br>  The application also knows how to manage a group of lamps, this is a plus.  On the kickstarter page, the manufacturer uses a lamp with six such lamps on a floor lamp. <br><br>  About the visibility of the lamp by the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e60/c89/30d/e60c8930dfbc47589cb641f091b5527c.jpg"><br><br>  In the beginning, I was very stressed that when you exit the application it says that the connection was broken, and at the entrance you can see that the lamp is not connected, and you need to tap on the lamp so that it connects.  I think that there is no connection with the lamp and, for example, a call alert will not work.  But no, despite this strange behavior, the lamp perfectly notifies about the call itself and that you have a missed call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/38f/1c0/6fc38f1c044240a19bb7ca3130d41a92.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/152/916/113/1529161137984e9f948a89b4f2e34d47.jpg"><br><br>  The notification of an incoming call mono set in the corresponding menu, you can set as a specific color and frequency of blinking. <br><br>  LuMini can greet you by flashing when your phone appears on the lamp network, for me it‚Äôs not very relevant, I rarely go with Bluetooth on all the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e34/77e/f58/e3477ef58d394084a9ee8d5d5fbee6bb.jpg"><br><br>  There are also modes for creating mood: <br><br><h3>  Disco. </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNx2wn93JcU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAOp6t_PF0b5nLQg-scurPQLH2sQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Choose a music track in the lamp app and the lamp adjusts to your track.

At first it lights up to the full in one color, then it gradually fades out and the next one turns on. <br><br><h3>  Relaxing light </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjgWM0fFJ1M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgm6KjotbnkwjSwYWg2H6JpmsbYPQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this mode, the light alternates in different colors in warm shades: red, orange, yellow, pink, etc.  Under such soft lighting it will be pleasant to spend time at a romantic dinner, the lamp will work almost like a fireplace, pleasantly lighting the space. <br><br><h3>  Sunset sky </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDLy4OZILIc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJlIgG6aAhXkp0ZXqb6faay2DSDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A similar mode is the previous one, but the lighting is in cold colors.  By the way in blue light they say you want less.  Therefore, a romantic dinner is not suitable.  But fall asleep under such a light like the most it.  The lamp simulates blue sunset light.  Although it does not change as slowly as the sun sets, and who then turns off the lamp if you fall asleep under it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28d/aa5/d06/28daa5d06bff4f54b5daa5e272e6cc27.jpg"><br><br>  If we are talking about a dream, then it is worth mentioning the alarm mode.  Perhaps you have already read about the smart light-clock?  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/268906/">Wake up at dawn.</a>  Lamp TabuLumi can work on a schedule and turn on the alarm at a specified time.  This feature is independent of the phone and works even when Bluetooth is turned off.  The inclusion does not occur immediately at full power but gradually, as in a smart lamp.  The truth of the first 2 levels somehow still does not turn on smoothly.  But then I counted more than 20 steps.  An increase in the level of illumination occurs somewhere once per second or slightly more.  You can set to include white or colored.  Who likes to wake up under purple? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/052/c36/e9a052c3656d49edbdc7dcbdf0a3a44b.jpg"><br><br>  In the alarm mode, the lamp shines for about 30 or 40 minutes, has not caught exactly this moment yet, then it turns off - it's convenient, you can not think about it and do not turn on the application once again in the morning when you are going to work.  But the minus is that it is impossible to set the alarm for the days of the week, for some reason you need to choose dates and no more than 7 days.  A strange decision, to be honest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a8/3fe/b41/4a83feb4160e452f9913b5d0b9a29849.jpg"><br><br>  Well, there is another mode specifically for friends - such as a color strobe.  In this mode, the lamp flashes cheerfully with all the colors of the rainbow conquering your friends and slowly turning them into your slaves like a hypno-lab.  Joke of course, but the most spectacular mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/ee8/2c3/99eee82c39e346efadd47a18bc830931.gif"><br><br>  The disadvantages of the lamp include the fact that it works in the standard Bluetooth 4.0, not lower.  Although in practice it didn‚Äôt work out for me, there were simply no smartphones with old bluetooth chips at home.  So it seems, and minus but not for everyone.  I will not speak about the price, here everyone already decides for himself whether it is worth it or not.  Two years ago, I looked at Philips lamps, everything was biting, and they also didn‚Äôt seem to work directly with smartphones.  In the end, did not take any.  At that time, I think Lumini would be a worthy competitor, but I didn‚Äôt catch my eye.  Thanks to the dadjet for giving me the opportunity to test it now. <br><br>  All functions with a test cartridge have been considered, now we are moving on to the ‚Äúattractions‚Äù.  In my house, in principle, all the lamp base are not quite standard.  Most are Gu10, and there are even more specific ones.  What does it say, and sockets are not like everywhere else - universal.  When I ordered them, I thought, why not take universal sockets?  I often order different gadgets with Aliexpress and e-Bay, and there they often send with a flat plug and an adapter.  With an adapter, I really dislike forks, and flat ones often give additional bonuses, and they are even more compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c8/b91/b1a/0c8b91b1a36d4e88b6238e01986ebde4.jpg"><br><br>  In general, with such sockets, and the lack of cartridges, you can finally realize the long-standing idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa compact luminaire such as a nightlight that sticks right into the socket.  Solved.  Hour for modeling, a couple of hours for printing, and we have a finished housing for this lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4aa/f40/17f/4aaf4017fbe243629bca5181dbd17056.jpg"><br><br>  I did not take the cartridge from the donor but bought a new one with external thread.  Fork I lay in the store.  Putting it all together and voila: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94f/0f8/66a/94f0f866ac194e05bd55234b4fdf8c60.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/dfe/af2/161dfeaf214846b78a8ccfea995052e8.jpg"><br><br>  Ready smart lamp.  It remains to pick up the lampshade from the ready-made Thingiverse and print it on a 3-printer.  Another three and a half hours of printing time and the lamp takes on a finished look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59e/99f/1e5/59e99f1e5f274589a47cb6fddeeb3e37.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/338/c0c/529/338c0c5295ef423da5ae0d3b632f9a7f.jpg"><br><br>  Now order.  My wife is extremely happy and immediately demands that she install an application on her smartphone.  And when I tested and everything was on a stick, there were only caustic statements that this is garbage :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/443/f8b/901/443f8b901f8e4ea6b970b57473b88203.jpg"><br><br>  For those who have access to 3D printing, here is a link to the model of the holder, although there the butt is designed for a Chinese plug with flat contacts: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1338990">Reference to the model</a> . <br><br>  The LuMini lamp itself can be purchased at the dadget shop <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/smart-lamp/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dsmart-lamp%26utm_content%3Dsmart-lamp%26utm_campaign%3Dsmart-lamp_122">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390007/</a></p>
