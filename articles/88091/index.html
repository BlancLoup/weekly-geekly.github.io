Some of our clients are initially scared of such communication, but we try to use this method of contact when we see that a person is on a page of dimensions for a long time or chooses between several products.  Then most often the contact leads to a positive outcome. <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ihNsgqUr7as/S6YzRHbBFLI/AAAAAAAAANw/5A_lDxPx3tk/screenshot_012.png" alt="image">  and <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ihNsgqUr7as/S6Y1jfCuZmI/AAAAAAAAAN8/KPCD-u-F65g/21.03.png" alt="image">

    <h6>  - Free for online stores with 1 manager. </h6><br>  In my opinion, the majority of online stores in Russia have no more than 1 manager resources to advise clients online, and such a free tariff plan is certainly convenient.  The rest of the tariff plans <a href="http://www.zopim.com/pricing">here</a> . <br><br><h6>  - Russian language for the widget on the site available. </h6><br>  It is determined automatically on the client side.  Some moments are certainly not convenient, for example, the time is only in the format am | pm, there is no 24 hour (promised to fix it in the next build), but, in general, it is satisfactory, it does not distract from communication. <br><br><h6>  - Keep up to date with planned updates and tech. </h6><br>  I am very pleased that you are kept up to date with all the events that, in one way or another, can affect the quality of service to our customers. <br><br><h6>  - The control panel in the form of a web interface. </h6><br>  On FLEX.  Very convenient, considering that I use both Windows and Linux.  I note that for almost a year of use, I found only one bug, which I reported and received thanks in the amount of ‚ÄúMany thanks‚Äù.  By the way, the bug was fixed in a few hours. <br><br>  And other buns: history of messages (with a good search), templates of answers, several managers (on paid tariffs), full-fledged statistics, the possibility of a ban, communication with IM protocols and some more pleasant trifles. <br><br><h4>  How Zopim helps us </h4><br>  We are engaged in underwear and knitwear, so most of our products have size and color.  Of course, we have a convenient table of sizes, but it is difficult for an unprepared person to grasp immediately, so many do not make a purchase precisely because they have not figured out the size or are not sure what this or that color will look like. <br><br>  The buyer is spoiled by us now, he doesn‚Äôt always write :) Therefore, the consultations of our manager at the right moments (information on which page the user is currently displayed on the right) bring a very tangible result. <br><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ihNsgqUr7as/S6UbCugqCHI/AAAAAAAAANo/IBWbZQyvjMQ/s640/screenshot_011.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, in recent months we have noted that the number of independent applications is increasing, and this is good.  Yes, and writing to a living person (manager) directly while browsing a site is much easier than filling out a contact form or adding an ICQ contact, which you may never need. <br><br><h4>  Some statistics </h4><br>  We were contacted 243 times, in 90% of cases about the goods (color, size, style), 10% - on delivery (mostly specified by time).  Once or 2 times they applied when they could not register (as a result, the girl did it all by itself). <br><br>  Statistics on the number of our calls to customers is not kept, but they are about 2 times less. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Zopim is a great solution for small online stores, where one manager sits on support.  Registration - 5 minutes, installation and configuration of the widget (JS) - 10 minutes.  Fast and free.  The interface manager is English, but simple as a stick.  It is difficult to get confused. <br>  The mechanism of addressing visitors will be an indispensable tool for stores, where the flow is greater and the subject is massive (technology for example). <br>  Of course, there are disadvantages, but I am sure that many people will like this service. <br><br><h4>  Zopim Information </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.zopim.com/">Official site</a> <br>  The guys themselves, apparently from Malaysia (judging by the contacts on the site), the server in the States is good, considering that we are outside the Moscow Ring Road, in the Urals. <br><br>  A small video allows you to understand the main features of the service: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1Cdz33-R3E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhht3_JpiV4ltyBxMq5Dp3HNfXQxhg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88091/</a></p>
