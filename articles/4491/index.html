  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Privacy died in the information age</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even the most influential politician and head of a major corporation cannot be sure that their private correspondence will not be made public.  This was clearly manifested now, when two scandals involving the leakage of personal data broke out in America at once. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Former Congressman Mark Foley and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard Patricia Dunn were not aware of the era in which they live.  All because of - insufficient technical literacy. <br><br>  Mark Fowley talked to a teen through an IM-pager.  He probably thought his text messages would evaporate in cyberspace.  But no.  In fact, they are preserved in the logs and after some time they became public.  The result - Mark Fowley was accused of pedophilia.  Personally, President Bush spoke about it on television.  Dear before Congressman Fowley was forced to leave the Congress in disgrace, and now has become the object of general ridicule. <br><br>  Patricia Dunn, when she ran Hewlett-Packard Corporation, organized a large-scale internal audit at her company.  Patricia found out that someone from the HP employees was ‚Äúdraining‚Äù important information into the press and decided to find out by all means who the snitch was.  To do this, Patricia, together with the company's legal adviser, organized a secret wiretap of their employees.  Patricia hired three private detectives who used someone else's passwords, broke into computer systems and studied private information not only from ordinary HP employees, but even from board members and newspaper reporters.

      <br>
      Over time, it all came to light.  The story of Patricia Dunn shows how easy it is to manipulate someone else's private information in the information age.  The firm she hired specialized in computer espionage.  Now the detectives and Patricia herself faces three years in prison, but thousands of hackers do the same thing every day and go unpunished.  There is nothing difficult.  In addition to moral obstacles, there are practically no obstacles in front of an attacker. <br><br>  Printouts of other people's calls, computer passwords, private email and IM correspondence - getting this information for a professional is not difficult.  Mark Fowley was the victim of some such investigation. <br><br>  Even the most influential politician or businessman becomes completely defenseless against the leakage of private data as soon as he picks up a mobile phone or comes to a computer.  And without this, modern life is impossible.  Technologies have penetrated almost everywhere, and it is impossible not to use them. <br><br>  In fact, now the era of <a href="http://blog.eweek.com/blogs/knowitall/archive/2006/10/05/13635.aspx">technological transparency</a> .  Everyone knows everything about everyone.  Probably, this is best understood (felt) by teenagers who openly open their souls on the Internet, in their diaries, whether on <a href="http://myspace.com/">MySpace</a> or on <a href="http://blogs.mail.ru/">‚ÄúBlog@Mail.Ru‚Äù</a> .  This is a new generation of people. <br><br>  Perhaps today's children know about privacy online much more than Patricia Dunn or Mark Foley.  Children know more than leading businessmen and politicians who run major corporations and entire states.  Isn't that weird? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4491/</a></p>
