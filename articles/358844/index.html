  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create a department from scratch: tools for HR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the autumn of 2016 in Plarium Krasnodar there was a need to form two new departments: 3D Animation and Data Science.  It was necessary to find employees in a short time, since the company was in dire need of professionals from these areas.  HR-managers of the studio not only successfully completed the task, but also received IT HR AWARDS awards for the methods applied.  In this article we will share some secrets of recruitment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/ja/w6/_ijaw6uiv5f1lqewikac03mqbmo.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Hunt for a unicorn </h2><br>  In the task itself there were several important features.  The directions of 3D Animation and Data Science in our country are still developing, therefore, specialists from these areas can be counted on fingers.

      Data Science is basically a new science (you can understand what the experts in this field are doing by reading one of our past <a href="https://habr.com/company/plarium/blog/345310/">articles</a> ).  In Russia there are only a few universities, graduates of which can approach this position. <br><br>  There are no directions of training in 3D-animation at all in universities - only courses and a number of schools.  Professionals with a similar specialization work in studios that create animation for movies and cartoons, but the gaming industry has its own characteristics that differ from cinematographic.  In addition, the visual style in which the candidate works was important to us. <br><br>  In addition, these areas for our company were new, and, before recruiting ordinary employees, we set a goal: to find a leader who is able to form and lead a team.  We needed a highly qualified person who was eager to challenge his managerial skills.  Therefore, we considered applicants literally from across the country, and this created an additional obstacle for them - the need to move to Krasnodar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jr/jz/zh/jrjzzhxgxvol1f9h8aaq052jwri.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Professionals and where they live </h2><br>  Here is our arsenal, which is suitable for the selection of personnel in any field. <br><br><h3>  Getting Started </h3><br>  <i>Tool: Reputation</i> <br><br>  This is not to say that we started the search from scratch.  All because we were helped by a good reputation of the company and trust in its recruiters personally.  Having such resources, you can always turn to the professional community for recommendations. <br><br><h3>  We study the market </h3><br>  <i>Tool: Professionalism</i> <br><br>  It is necessary to understand the characteristics of the labor market and the specifics of the direction.  We have collected information about where students study, work and what potential employees are interested in.  Based on these data and recommendations of professional communities, we have compiled a search map of candidates. <br><br><h3>  We establish the first contact </h3><br>  <i>Tool: individual approach</i> <br><br>  After people with suitable portfolios and resumes are found, it is time to get in touch with them.  Despite the development of HR-technology, nothing appeared more effective than direct contact with the candidate.  It should be understood: if you make a mass mailing, inserting a new name in the beginning of the letter, then the addressees of such letters will at best think that you do not have time for them.  Also, before writing, it is advisable to get acquainted with the information about the specialist, at least on a page in the professional network.  Then it is necessary to show the portfolio of a potential employee to the head of the direction in order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the applicant.  It will be useful to learn about the hobbies of a person: if he is a lover of mountains or the sea, the invitation to the Krasnodar office will seem especially attractive to him. <br><br><h3>  We are making connections </h3><br>  <i>Tool: honesty</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Trying to be interested in a job, you do not need to overplay the company: this will either cause distrust or create false expectations - in both cases, the person will be disappointed.  On the contrary, achieve from the candidate an understanding of the peculiarities of the life of the office, his duties and future residence.  The more complete the picture you draw to him, the higher the likelihood that he will stay with you for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/sk/ln/pksklnzflwnuazvgs8630mat3wu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Testing the candidate </h3><br>  <i>Tool: informing</i> <br><br>  When composing a test task for a candidate, be sure to include the tasks that he will need to perform as part of his daily work.  So you more accurately determine whether you are suitable for each other.  Tell us more about the tasks, especially if you are looking for a manager - most often people go to executive positions for interesting experiences.  If a potential employee for some reason did not fit the position, try to give a detailed feedback.  A person must understand what skills he needs to pull up in order to rely on such a vacancy.  This approach creates a good reputation for the company and allows you to organize the basis for future interaction. <br><br><h3>  We are negotiating </h3><br>  <i>Tool: Diplomacy</i> <br><br>  Sometimes, to attract a valuable specialist, do not be afraid to resort to non-standard solutions.  This may be an individual schedule, special working conditions or other benefits.  In this situation, you need to find a compromise between the applicant and the business.  HR-manager should be able to balance the interests of the parties.  The better the conditions are chosen, the higher the likelihood of cooperation. <br><br>  The methods described have helped us form 3D Animation and Data Science departments for 2 and 4 months, respectively.  This, of course, does not end the work of the HR manager.  All non-resident people need help with moving and finding housing, as well as introduce them to the team.  But this is a completely different article ... We hope our experience will be useful to you and will allow you to attract the best specialists in the shortest possible time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358844/</a></p>
