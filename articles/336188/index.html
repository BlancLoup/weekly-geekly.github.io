      We offer not just the opportunity to get free training - after the end of the course, successful participants will have a real chance to get a job in the company and become part of the Veeam Research &amp; Development team. <br><br>  And now we‚Äôll answer the main question: what can beginner developers be interested in learning at Veeam Academy? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  About Veeam Software </h3><br>  Today, few Russian IT companies can boast a worldwide recognition of their own boxed products. <br><br>  As a pioneer in data availability, Veeam is one of them.  Starting as a startup from St. Petersburg 11 years ago, Veeam Software has become the world leader in backup and recovery.  We create products that help a datacenter of any scale to save information even in the event of a catastrophic system failure. <br><br>  <i>There could be one of the stories about how Veeam products helped prevent the loss of strategic data of a world-renowned corporation, but of course we will not do this.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Just list some companies that trust the safety of their data centers to our products:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/ru/success-stories/veeam-kaspersky-success-story.html">Kaspersky Lab</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/ru/success-stories/mtc-success-story.html">Mts</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/ru/success-stories/veeam-vtb24-success-story.html">VTB 24</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/success-stories/volvo-dealers-cruise-to-high-availability-with-simac-and-veeam.html">Volvo</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/success-stories/kingston-chooses-veeam-to-safeguard-virtualized-tier-1-applications.html">Kingston Technologies</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/success-stories/sega-europe-ltd-wins-control-of-vm-backup-and-management-with-veeam.html">Sega</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.veeam.com/success-stories/trend-micro-deploys-veeam-across-three-continents-for-always-on-business.html">Trend micro</a></i> <br><br>  <b>In short:</b> Over the 11 years of Veeam's existence, we have ‚Äúpumped out karma‚Äù in the development of boxed data backup software.  Now we are ready to share knowledge with those who are interested in programming. <br><br><h3>  For whom the course </h3><br>  <b>In short:</b> The course is aimed at young professionals with basic knowledge of C #. <br><br>  Many young professionals are familiar with the situation: companies do not consider candidates without development experience, but this experience can be obtained only by finding a job and having worked in real projects.  To get out of the "vicious circle" we have to settle down on the principle of "where will they take", and not "where it is interesting." <br><br>  And if it is not yet clear what is interesting?  In this case, you should try a little bit of everything.  We suggest gaining experience in team development of a project using modern Microsoft technologies (these are Entity Framework, WCF, WPF, etc.). <br><br>  As they say, the appetite comes with eating.  Acquainted with various techniques, you can decide what you like more.  In addition, after training, all developments remain in the listener's personal portfolio (which is extremely useful in finding employment). <br>  In our course, we focus mainly on the development of practical skills of developing industrial software by students, and also pay attention to teamwork. <br><br><h3>  Program and format of classes </h3><br>  <b>In short:</b> For 2 months of teamwork on the principles of Agile, participants will develop their own project using modern programming technologies.  Full-time classes, 3 times a week in the evening.  Training is free for all participants. <br><br>  We will build the entire course around the development of a pilot project. <br>  The pilot project does not imply further use of the turnkey solution in Veeam products.  Therefore, his topic is chosen by the course participants collectively at the beginning of the course.  This could be, for example, a social network, a media server, a version control system or something else. <br><br>  Course duration is two months.  Classes will be held weekly (3 times a week) for 4 hours in the evening at one of the Veeam offices in St. Petersburg, near the Ploshchad Lenina metro station.  The group will train no more than 15 people.  The course is free for all participants. <br><br>  Classes are held in the form of lectures and practical work.  The course instructor - Dmitry Shalymov, Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, MCSD, has more than 10 years experience in software development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/97c/ad0/441/97cad04417b94e2caa0971348eb6a2b7.png"><br>  <i>Dmitry Shalymov, leading the course.</i> <br><br>  What awaits listeners Veeam Academy: <br><br>  - obtaining practical skills of programming and industrial development of boxed software products, <br>  - the development of modern programming technologies, the study of trends in the language C # (C # 7 and. Net Framework 4.7), <br>  - the practice of writing fault-tolerant program code, <br>  - study of the development of multi-tier architecture of high-load distributed software systems, <br>  - mentoring guest development experts from the Veeam team, <br>  - obtaining skills in accordance with the methodology of Agile, <br>  - personal effectiveness training, dedicated to the development of Soft Skills, <br>  - Certificate of completion for all course participants. <br><br>  Among other things, we are ready to consider graduates of the Academy as candidates for Veeam Software vacancies. <br><br><h3>  Pleasant trifles </h3><br>  For students of the course, we have prepared everything for comfortable learning: a comfortable class, coffee-tea-sweets in unlimited quantities and other joys that accompany the effective comprehension of knowledge. <br><br><h3>  How to sign up </h3><br>  1) Without delaying the debt, register on the Academy website by filling out a form <a href="https://go.veeam.com/academy">via the link</a> . <br>  2) Shortly after registration, a link to the test task will be e-mailed to you.  You can go through it online until August 31. <br>  3) Test results will be announced to each participant after August 31. <br><br>  Each registrant will have only one attempt to get tested, limited only by the time frame: until August 31.  Those who for some reason do not have time to take the test will be able to participate in the next set of participants in the Veeam Academy. <br><br>  If you have any questions, you can ask them in the comments to this post or send an e-mail to: academy@veeam.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336188/</a></p>
