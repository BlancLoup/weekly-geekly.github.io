  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VKfest with Habrahabra taste</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as the season of the White Nights in St. Petersburg ends, one of the most unusual and so familiar festivals will burst into the city, perhaps.  Imagine that you were transported inside your VKontakte page - and now the audio recordings are playing live, friends clap at the shoulder, and the communities are inviting themselves to visit.  And all this on the shore of the Gulf of Finland.  To do this, you do not need any augmented reality glasses or teleports - the usual transport will cope with the task: rollers, bicycle, tram, bus, train, plane.  In general, all that July 16 and 17 will take you to the park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg to the second in the history festival ‚Äú <a href="https://vk.com/fest">VK Fest</a> ‚Äù.  But there is already augmented reality, and music ... everything, everything in order. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/tm/blog/278162/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5da/f64/31d/5daf6431d17d40b4b816d7c2d24f7654.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The whole festival site is divided into segments - mini-areas of interest: music, games, innovations, food, sports, drive, extreme, art, charity and much more.  Thus, 50,000 guests will be able to share their interests or take a risk and leave to master something completely new.  It will be like a huge living mockup of the social network VKontakte - and here you also need to be ready for unexpected meetings, new invitations to groups and friend requests. <br><br>  Speaking of friends.  Considering that many from Habr and Hiktaim will be at the festival, we cannot but invite guests to our Habrashater, where we invite all visitors.  The list of activities under the tent is still settling down, but already some companies are already known with whom we will share the roof.

The device consists of a module for processing signals from the muscles, sensors of brain and heart activity, and a pulse sensor.  Feel how much you can do about it?  Neuro-controlled toys (and we in childhood dreamed of a radio-controlled ...), smart fitness trackers, health monitoring applications ... We are sure that you will have new ideas for testing the designer when you can <s>control the world by</s> using human neural signals non-profit sphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0b/dbe/f38/d0bdbef38200f957f497dd5f79fd8b1a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ab/c8f/90b/6abc8f90b5f86e3ee94f47033b0b330a.png" align="left">  Remember film cameras?  First they were put off the scholarships on film, then each frame from the ‚ÄúI and the object‚Äù series was carefully filmed (well, without yourself, it‚Äôs a pity!) And carried to print, and then they waited for the coveted envelope with the inscription, how many were printed, and how many were defective.  Did you think at that moment that after a certain number of revolutions around the sun, you could just as easily print your small copy?  And no, you don't need to sit down or put your face in the scanner - the guys from <a href="http://bein3d.ru/">Bein3D</a> will take pictures and make accurate 3D models of all the guests of the Habrasatra.  The operation is harmless and pleasant, similar to skating on the gymnastic circle.  These models can then be printed from a color composite gypsum polymer and enjoy yourself, a loved one, or donate yourself, a loved one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/200/0bf/a93/2000bfa931981d1aa8433d32c7980f22.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d69/d10/b2f/d69d10b2fdacd482dbcb36fcec00d585.png" align="left">  In general, 3D printing will literally reign in our cozy house.  <a href="http://www.printfuture.ru/">The guys from 3DRep will</a> bring several FDM printers of the system (Fused deposition modeling) - these are printers for modeling by layer-by-layer welding, one of the most common technologies for producing three-dimensional prototypes.  Also in the arsenal will be a 3D scanner, several 3D pens and even industrial designs of products (if everything works out, then from metal).  In general, if you have long looked at the 3D-pens and could not be determined, it is self-indulgence or work, come and try.  By the way, you can safely take with you girls and children - there will be a lesson for everyone, it won't be boring. <br><br>  And there will be many other acquaintances nearby, it‚Äôs just that everyone didn‚Äôt fit under one tent.  For example, we can not fail to note our neighbors in the marquee - the ITMO Institute, or rather, one of their projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acd/0c3/65c/acd0c365cb9a922c067b001c0c4e8320.jpg" align="left">  For years, YouTube remained a loss-making project, and only in 2014 it reached the break-even point.  Despite the lack of beautiful numbers of profits, this indicates a tremendous step that made video hosting.  And all thanks to the fantastic popularity of video content among the audience.  Indeed, now the video can be found for every taste and color.  But humanity is always small and it has come up with new things, one of which is the trend recording of panoramic (360¬∫) video today.  It is used with might and main for recording concerts, excursions and even when creating the Star Wars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Df-7qq8n2iqw">trailer</a> .  "Spherical" video immerses the viewer in the center of events and allows you to view the action from all angles.  For example, a very telling example: a rock band concert.  How do you want during a cool solo at the same time to look at the guitarist, his amazing bust and enjoy the reaction of the hall, which rages on the same wavelength.  And repeat, repeat this feeling over and over again, squandering it in front of your eyes. <br><br>  Technologies have already made a fix in this direction of our life and decided a dilemma.  How exactly they did it, you can ask and see <a href="http://video360production.com/">Video 360</a> .  These guys know everything and a little more about multi-camera assemblies, panoramic video, shooting and editing full review videos.  Dizzy stuff! <br><br>  Video that can be twisted-twirl: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9evg1z4r2OM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxEhSRIg1zRdqYI5jaxLI1kVUR8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What else?  In the tent there will be <s>holograms of</s> several employees of Habrahabr - they can be <s>touched</s> to feed, drink lemonade, torture with questions on the case and without, ask about blogs, hubs and technologies.  And there will be ottomans with invites! <br><br>  How to find us?  You will recognize us by puffs with invites.  Okay, kidding - it will be easier to find on the map (prove that you are not a robot - find the red check mark): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62f/723/bb0/62f723bb08758b4d3690e7f0ba3113ca.jpg"><br><br>  We wait! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395743/</a></p>
