  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why don't girls play video games?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I wanted to write something clever, but then I decided to skimp on it, so let's talk about this - why do girls not play computer games?  No, some, of course, can give a strong handicap in any shooter.  But most often it is not.  The girl selflessly and with anticipation choosing another shooter in the store, or even an RPG, or even some kind of game is a rare spectacle.  Why? <br>  Someone even told me that there was such a report on the GDC - why girls do not play.  They said the report was strange, and some feminist-minded, with the main message - the girls do not play because the games are made by stupid men.  Well, this is from eyewitnesses, I myself can‚Äôt say if the report was bad or good, I didn‚Äôt attend. <br>  And yet it was thought, and by the way, why not play?  So I began to lay everything out on the shelves, and such a picture appeared. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>The first stroke is Captain Evidence.</b>  Yes, at the first sketch, Captain Obvious came to the rescue, who recalled that 90% of boys play war games in childhood, and girls play mothers or barbies.  Thanks to this fact, subtly noticed by the Captain, we can approximately represent the range of interests of those and others.  I also believe, at the heart of the popularity of Sims among women, it is precisely this observation of Captain Obvious.  The Sims are not aggressive, social and pro relationships.  By the way, here is another memory.  In the senior grades in literature, we were given the task to learn the Pasternak's ‚ÄúCandle Burned‚Äù or Vysotsky's ‚ÄúThe Hunt for Wolves‚Äù by choice.  Interestingly, the preferences were distributed strictly on gender.  All the girls recited "and two shoes fell with a thud on the floor, and wax tears from a lamp on the dress dripped ...", and the young men, all as one told about "gray predators - mothers and puppies ..." Which is symbolic. <br><br>  <b>The second stroke - Achievement.</b>  Every person has a sense of accomplishment, like - I did it!  Or did!  Here I am cool!  How are we doing here with Mae and Jo?  Upon reflection, I realized that the achievements that will increase the self-esteem of any man will not always please the woman who achieved the same.  For example, strength, speed and agility are very important for a man.  Shamefully, I never pull up on a fizre, or trudge at the end of a cross-country race, continually stopping from dyspnea torturing you and pulling up my sweat pants.  Imagine a guy shying away from a volleyball ball, or indecisively standing in the middle of a basketball field, not knowing who to give a pass to, or wandering around the football field behind the ball and players, as if taking a direct part in all this.  Horror, this is a sucker, right?  At the same time, not a single girl will be complexes, if she plays terribly volleyball, basketball or football, cannot overcome a cross or a hundred-meter mark, or does not know how to swim a crawl.  And without all these skills, she can feel like a queen.  And my mother had a golden TRP badge, so what?  This I somehow accidentally learned.  In many games, the player's pride bears the way he is clever and strong, he figured out with such a boss!  Or passed a mission!  Somehow they even told me that girls do not like to play shooters, let's say in counter, because they do not really know how, and that is why they are bored.  In fact, a little differently - they do not understand why they should be able to.  I think that any newcomer, hanging seven or ten years ago in computer clubs, once dreamed of breaking everyone, literally dreaming about this great day of his celebration.  The girls do not understand why they even tear someone.  Well, I learn to quickly press the buttons, aim, I hope Vasya Pupkin‚Äôs ass, so what?  Demonstration of their strength and dexterity brings much less satisfaction to women, it makes sense to fight, only when you get something for it.  Something besides proving your strength.  I think girls in general do not particularly sympathize with their hero in a shooter, if he loses chels or dies at the hands of a zombie, doesn‚Äôt have any special emotions at all - well, oh, it just so happened.

      <br>
      I remember as a child, back in the times of Sinclair and Atari ... perhaps I will not go into those times, but then I had a favorite game about sunflower.  I do not remember the name.  Its essence was that it was necessary to protect the sunflower from all sorts of pests.  GG is some kind of a robot, a weapon is all kinds of sprayers to plop on insects before they get to the sunflower.  As the game progressed, the sunflower grew, and with each level the number of people willing to devour it increased.  If the player did not have time to deal with pests - alas and ah: the sunflower was devoured without a trace.  For me, the death of a sunflower was a tragic moment.  And how happy I was if the sunflower was able to grow and it blossomed to the merry music!  I think for women in this regard, it is much more important to protect their fortress than to burn the enemy's fortress.  The need to protect something can play the role of a good emotional trigger.  A wonderful garden burned by dragons or a castle, beautiful unicorns killed by monsters, or something in this spirit will not leave a woman indifferent.  To protect and protect - very female targit.  A woman does not understand why to fight, just to hang on someone, but she will do anything to protect what is dear to her.  I think this feature of female perception could be used to create the game. <br><br>  <b>The third stroke - GG.</b>  We all understand that a player associates himself with the main character.  It is unlikely that a woman will associate herself with a sweaty muscular uncle, albeit very very cool.  Here the best option GG - a woman, charismatic and sexy.  Someone ala Lara Croft is not a bad option, but in principle, I suppose, GG can be anyone: blonde secretary, goth, vampire, princess, parkour, like Faith from Mirrose Age, in a word, anyone - there is a fantasy of developers where to roam.  The main thing - HS should be feminine and attractive.  Someone ‚Äúsoft and fluffy‚Äù, some kind of cute and funny animal, may well claim to be the main character of the game. <br><br>  <b>The fourth stroke is war.</b>  In essence, at the heart of any game is opposition.  We have already found out that women are more motivated if they see that they have something to protect besides the life of GG.  Moreover, ‚Äúdefending‚Äù has more power than ‚Äúsaving.‚Äù  Target ala save the princess or some civilian, peculiar to many games popular among the male population, can not roll.  Women will be more emotionally involved if they have to protect something of their own, a piece of their world - a magical garden, a castle, a fortress, beautiful animals.  Therefore, the enemy will be the one who encroaches on this world.  But are women's strategies for fighting enemies different from men's?  I guess, yes.  Usually, a player tries to defeat a boss by demonstrating his strength, speed, dexterity, using available weapons, sometimes using the environment, preparing some traps for the boss that can weaken him.  In life, women rarely resort to open confrontation.  They have two main strategies against enemies: the first is to turn the enemy into a friend, the second is to make friends with someone who can defeat her enemy.  Obviously, both strategies of hanging lyuley left and right, like Bruce Lee or Van Damme, do not mean.  Women are social.  In life they achieve their goal not with the help of ‚Äúcome, see, win‚Äù, but rather through diplomacy.  Or like in that old joke that only women can be friends against someone.  Therefore, returning to the topic of achievements, it is much more pleasant for her to draw a strong enemy into her camp than to triumph to smash his head off.  The victory over the boss is for a man a demonstration of his strength, even if virtual, if he empathizes with the hero, it does not matter.  Woman victory over the boss with the help of force will not bring much joy - women do not win by force.  For her, it is much more important to confirm the effectiveness of her social skills, ability to communicate, build relationships, to be insightful. <br><br>  <b>Fifth stroke is a weapon.</b>  Having received a more powerful gun at some stage, the majority of the male audience is enraptured.  Some of the players even admit that they are even ready to go through the old game with another weapon.  A new weapon will give many new opportunities: the missions are the same, but they can be passed differently.  Few women share this opinion.  Most likely, they will not be interested in solving the same problem in another way.  And again, returning to the question of achievements, let us recall that for a female audience the result is more important - to protect, save, get a bonus at the end, rather than the process of getting adrenaline from an intense struggle, with a demonstration of its reaction, dexterity, speed.  In the confrontation, men pay great attention to the tactics of warfare, while women also take second place in military tactics, giving way to social ones, namely, searching for allies, creating coalitions, and intrigues.  Social and psychological opposition is more interesting for them than the military.  This should be considered when choosing a weapon for the women's game.  A good move - pets.  The Chinese and Japanese are popular games for little girls with all sorts of nyashny Pikachu.  As for an adult audience, a fire-breathing dragon in the colors of clouds or sunset, a mystical werewolf with burning eyes, a tiger, or any other epic zyavr will delight any young lady.  After all, there are a few pleasant moments combined here - getting a strong ally and protector, as well as additional room for imagination - women love beautiful fluffy pictures, seasoned with mystery and mysticism.  You can provide a pet is not the default, and in the "wild" form, in need of restraint and taming.  If the beast can be subdued, she will be pleased by the fact that she invented how to get such a luxurious syvr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/272/b10/e39272b102528dc1e0a13832fa8def87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another point - women are more likely to be closer to nature than technology.  Perhaps a crossbow, a magic potion, magical abilities and something like that, they will appreciate more than a wide selection of modern firearms. <br><br>  <b>The sixth stroke is a picture.</b>  Many women who have been fascinated by games have fallen in love with them because of the picture.  Here take a look at Vito from Mafia II. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tev6tVVyc3Y&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhge0QIE8URd466IYXYVxclHEh9bkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  How good?  For me, so any girl's dream.  And what a beautiful temple, and Christmas, and the music ... Only now, shooting back from everyone, fighting prison authorities, plumping and hanging around the bardels is not very female targit.  Well, the girls, as the target audience, when creating the game, obviously, were not planned.  Therefore, it is more interesting for us to look at the beautiful picture from the side.  We will reconsider all trailers with handsome Vito, rather than sit down for the game. <br>  My girlfriend reviewed many of Alice's clips from AmericanMcGee, the one where they declare that madness returns.  Beautiful game, you will not say anything, and my girlfriend is practically Alice‚Äôs fan - she really likes the visual style of the game.  But will it go further than many revised clips, interviews with developers, uploaded pictures and wallpapers?  Will she play?  The most attractive for the girl in this game is the original visual style.  The gameplay is in question.  And the question arose because of the already stated above - the absence of significant achievements for the female audience.  If my friend liked the picture so much that in order to get a better look at all the locations, she is ready to play the game - it means she will play all the same.  Mafia we had in Italian, and the video gameplay from Alice in English.  I hope this does not confuse anyone.  If, however, it is not clear, do not worry - here, in principle, the main thing is the video itself, and not comments.  And if you are well aware that for American McGee and Alice, you can skip it altogether. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5HOfZsbW0k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgjELBfjiA24q-OoAFp5ZqTljcIpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>The seventh stroke is digging deeper.</b>  Most women say they feel sorry for the game, they are no longer children.  The difficulty of creating games for the audience of Jo is that such games must withstand stiff competition from the outside world.  Women are less likely to go into the virtual world to escape.  Most often, it is difficult for them to switch and relax until they solve all their immediate problems.  Women are impressed by sociality, they are much faster involved in social networks, often play casual games, online strategies, MMO RPGs.  Online, in contrast to the single, gives rise in the woman‚Äôs eyes to some kind of illusion of greater importance of the game, because now this game can be brought out of its own world, share impressions, interact with others, go to meet online gamers in the end.  Psychologists say there are fears that all people experience to one degree or another.  These include the fear of death and the fear of loneliness.  According to statistics, the fear of death, at some subconscious level, manifests itself more in men.  It is connected with the desire to achieve something special, something to be remembered, to leave a trace, to follow the discovery, to become someone, such as a great scientist, innovator, or just an influential person.  Fear of loneliness often manifests itself in women.  It is a fear not to create your family, to be abandoned, not to take a worthy place in society, to become an unsociable hermit or zadroty, as a special case - a crazy gamer.  Therefore, multiplayer games that create the illusion of somewhat greater social activity are appealing to women. <br><br>  <b>The eighth stroke - the best friends of the girls - are diamonds.</b>  As already mentioned, it is more pleasant for women to contemplate the trophies and treasures created by their own efforts, rather than defeated enemies.  You can make a bet on this in the game, when, with the successful fulfillment of the mission, the GG will receive something - magic artifacts, jewels, castles, lands.  In Mafia 2, our handsome Vito had the opportunity to occasionally buy costumes, while the fashion and style of the 50s was reflected quite brightly.  In the game, focused on the female audience, the emphasis on fashion can be enhanced even more, to expand the possibilities of shopping and changing outfits.  Women will like the opportunity to change the image of GG.  And if something will also depend on the change of the image, for example, the attitude of others to it, is generally gorgeous. <br><br>  <b>DISCLAIMER.</b>  Everything written above is a generalized, statistical characteristic of the perception of games by men and women.  I am well aware that there are girls who are fond of sports, who love speed and drive, and sometimes she herself is not averse to taking a look at Formula 1 or get out with friends to play tennis.  I do not play MMO RPGs and kazualki, and there is still a lot that can distinguish, for example, me and any other person from generalized stereotypes.  I understand this, so please do not spit saliva into me with exclamations: ‚ÄúBut I am not like that!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúNot like that!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The ninth stroke is a genre or everything is complicated.</b>  If we sum up, it turns out that to create a game that could be focused on a female audience, you must take into account the advice of Captain Obvious and it is trivial to shift the emphasis from military to social.  Trite, but not so simple.  Not just performed.  Speaking of social, I find it difficult to determine the genre for such a game.  I don‚Äôt really want to see some kind of painful RPG or step-by-step strategy, or even a fable.  Although, again, it all depends on the performance.  I want something adventure with elements of the quest and RPG, colorful, fast and more social than usual.  The most difficult thing here will be precisely this balance between genres, and here, most likely, there is no instruction how to achieve it.  In 2010, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit became such an amazingly balanced project.  Impressive graphics, well-chosen soundtracks.  The player has a wide choice of tracks, cars and missions, but at the same time the game is not overloaded with possibilities and does not lose its dynamics, as it sometimes happens.  It is especially surprising that there is no deterrenting beginners difficulty in the game, but at the same time it remains very interesting for experienced riders. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FPfltYeXss%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9r40tf2jeHbfHMgzkoQEFNcFGJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdoes not have that sociality, the importance of which for the female audience I emphasize all the time, but there are two other factors - graphics and a good balance of complexity.  Perhaps in some cases this might already be enough. <br><br>  Once in a conversation about which games would have liked a female audience, they demanded that I clearly name the genre.  This is extremely difficult to do, because you can add what the girls would like (in this case, everything that I have already described above) in almost every genre, from a three-dimensional shooter to an RPG, quest or platform game. <br><br>  So, more sociality, less tactics.  All sorts of puzzles based on the laws of physics - in the furnace.  A platformer with puzzles will draw only for office employees, who really need to kill time, but they cannot sneak away on a smoke break or just chat.  Yes, only in the case when a person simply has no choice but to play. <br><br>  Decisive for winning a game that targets a female audience should be a social choice, not speed, strength, or accuracy of strikes.  It is important to maintain the dynamics of the game. <br><br>  Many games combine elements of several genres.  At the same time, games of the same genre can differ significantly, depending on the performance, or, say, control.  Therefore, speaking of the genre, it would be wrong to say: ‚ÄúAah, social?  Without firing?  Well, this is a quest!  Beautiful and magical?  Everything is clear - fable! ‚ÄùIn order to gain popularity among female audience, you will have to mix genres. <br><br>  <b>Examples</b>  And for a snack, examples of games in which there is a piece of something attractive for a female audience: <br><br>  - <b>Lara Croft.</b>  GG is a sexy and charismatic woman. <br><br>  <b>- The Path and all sorts of things from Tale of Tales.</b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In all of them there is a mystic, a mystery, sociality and the need to observe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the forums where players shared their impressions of The Path, the fair sex made up the majority. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ghost Busters (2009)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Beautiful picture, detailed, sometimes witty dialogues of characters, funny Lizun, not complicated, but rather dynamic gameplay.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNf7gh9Tt2c&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSB0IGyUlXn5iSAKYWtEbSb6esoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Mirror's Edge</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, the GG is an attractive woman, a beautiful picture, a lot of dynamics, but not so much aggression. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The only thing is, since most girls do not have much of the gaming experience, the minus was difficult management.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2N1TJP1cxmo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-XVJtIbd4kCnZRIEI9XaOfwx_Gw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- A Vampyre Story. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chic quest, amazing artistic performance, GG -
