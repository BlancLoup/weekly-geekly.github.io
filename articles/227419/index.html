    </li><li>  <b>Five ways to increase your productivity with distributed commands.</b> <br>  <i>Timofey Evgrashin (iklum Consulting).</i> <br>  To date, globalization has made distributed teams a daily practice.  Often it is not a matter of economy, but an urgent need. <br>  At the same time, we often hear complaints about the inefficiency of teams sitting in different offices, and that they say only in teams sitting at the same round table is possible ‚Äútrue‚Äù Agile. <br>  Using my ten-year experience of working with distributed teams, I highlighted 5 main ideas for improving team productivity. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Requirements Management in Agile: how it happens in the real world.</b> <br>  <i>Prynich Alyona (Co-founder &amp; trainer @ E5, IC Agile certified professional).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Roman Sakharov (Lead Business Analyst &amp; Resource manager @ EPAM Systems, Co-founder &amp; trainer @ E5, Certified Scrum Master, Trainer).</i> <br>  The Agile manifest states: ‚ÄúA working product is more important than comprehensive documentation.‚Äù  Everyone understands this point in his own way: someone reduces the requirements for 1-2 lines, then getting the fruit of the programmers, someone, on the contrary, seeks to describe everything in detail, spending time for it, during which the product may no longer be relevant on the market .  How to find a balance, the golden mean, which will help your project to get the best balance: quality documentation vs time and resources spent? <br>  How to manage requirements on Agile projects, what are the pitfalls and how best to get around them.  Typical templates User Story, Product Vision, touch on the topic Story Mapping.  Living examples from practice. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The ideal team: utopia or reality.</b> <br>  <i>Anna Stetsenko (creator and perpetuum mobile of Agile-Oriented, GetThingsDone-Obsessed and Freelance-Advanced Indigo IT staffing agency).</i> <br>  - Is it possible to create a dream team that does not need micromanagement, control and motivate? <br>  - Is it possible to go beyond office slavery, to go to work, when you want, to travel a lot, at the same time be successful and achieve results <br>  Lovers of work in the office from 9:00 to 18:00 and rest 24 days a year, the report is not recommended. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Motivation - a look from IT.</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Demura (head of the Odessa office of the company DataArt).</i> <br>  What is motivation?  Where does it come from?  Can it be controlled or influenced by it?  A bit of theory, a few observations, and a few life stories about what an average project manager can do in order to positively influence his team. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Management team development in the face of complete uncertainty.</b> <br>  <i>Maksym Klymyshyn (CTO at Zakaz.ua (GVMachines Inc.)).</i> <br><br></li><li>  <b>Hidden team reserves.</b> <br>  <i>Mikhail Popchuk (Ciklum Consulting).</i> <br>  There are situations when you are lucky with the selection of guys in the team, lucky with the customer and put the perfect process.  What else is needed?  And the team does not show the result. <br>  In turn, the team assembled from mediocre guys with a newcomer, team lead, overfulfills the plan twice! <br>  How to achieve synergy in the team, motivate colleagues and surprise the customer using the example of a real team in the Scrum process. <br><br></li><li>  <b>How not to fail and grow in the first 3 years.</b>  <b>Experience of development of the company of regional level.</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Suslov (Head of ADS group).</i> <br>  The realities of the formation and development of companies at the regional level.  Experience in the field of micro-team management, development in the conditions of tough HR competition.  Perspectives. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Persuasion ... or how to make customers obedient.</b> <br>  <i>Anastasia Berestovaya (Project Manager at MobiDev).</i> <br>  Persuasion is one of the most important skills that a Project Manager should possess. <br>  The most important stage of the negotiation process is preparation.  The main aspects of the negotiation process: <br>  - how to form a negotiation strategy; <br>  - how to build your speech to convince the client - the tool ‚ÄúStructure of persuasive speech‚Äù; <br>  - how to negotiate. </li></ul><br><br>  Be always up to date with the latest news, take part in promotions, win prizes from organizers and partners, and also share your impressions and wishes on the conference pages on social networks: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WebCamp">Facabook</a> , <a href="https://vk.com/webcamp">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/webcampodessa">Twitter</a> .
