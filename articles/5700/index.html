  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money on the Internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The speech in this post is not about how to make money directly.  This is a good half of the posts on startups.  And how people are looking for ways to make money and enrichment. <br>  Once, for the sake of interest, I studied the demand for “free money” in the statistics of Yandex and Rambler.  Pulp fiction alone statistics, it should be noted, very fun. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What are actually looking for: </h3><br>  <b>Evolution of "how to make money":</b> <br>  <b>"to earn money"</b> <br>  <b>“Make money online”</b> <br>  <b>“Make millions”</b> - appetites grow fast <br>  <b>“Earn by the site”</b> - and also with the mouse and keyboard <br>  <b>“Make money fast”</b> <br>  <b>"Earn a lot"</b> - even more than a million? <br>  <b>"I want to earn"</b> <br>  <b>"Easy to earn"</b> <br><br>  Actually no surprises - money is needed quickly, a lot and preferably with a minimum of effort.  The most interesting thing is that those who wanted to make money this way, most often including looking for money on the Internet, on the net, or wanted to invest money in stocks. <br>  Let's go further :) <br>  With earnings in the Internet there is not enough interesting, in general, the same thing (for example, “how to earn a large amount on the Internet in one hour”), most often they want to either make money on sex or simply get unlimited Internet, sometimes they are looking for how to download earnings on the Internet (apparently very useful program). <br><br>  With free money fun enough.  People simply, including ask, "give money."  Interestingly, what have these 900 freeloaders found there?  We are checking.  Yeah, the money is given to everyone - universities, scientists and the poor, but not the poor freeloader.  15 out of 900 went further and scored "give me money".  Significant clarification :).  Completely desperate with such requests, they spit on everything and are simply looking for a "kholyava" (I was also surprised, apparently this is a special kind of freebie), but there is little to find except for "porn ivy", but about this another time ...

      Well, and the most delicious thing in the end.  Salvage.  You just need to read, and without tears it is impossible to read. <br><br>  <b>loot evil</b> <br>  <b>loot wins</b> <br>  <b>loot wins evil</b> <br>  <b>cut the dough</b> <br>  <b>loot wins evil</b> <br>  <b>Download the loot</b> - right on the internet you download and there are also bare aunts. <br>  <b>I want dough</b> - honestly <br>  <b>button loot</b> - I would not have refused such a button, you probably press it, but it gets into the account <br>  <b>Where the fuck</b> is - this man will soon run out of patience <br>  <b>responds with a loot</b> - that’s what an insurance company would write <br>  <b>a lot of dough</b> <br>  <b>chop up loot</b> <br>  <b>where to get the dough</b> <br>  <b>where the loot tries</b> - return grandmother, bitch !!!  :) <br><br>  in bound went <br>  <b>lava</b> <br>  <b>come on lava</b> <br><br>  With the loot in Yandex, everything is clear, but what about Rambler?  With Rambler, we laughed at the whole office through tears.  The workflow just got up. <br><br>  <b>"How to cut the loot"</b> <br>  <b>"One would sacrifice for the loot"</b> - chtoli kidney? <br>  <b>"Loot and e * la"</b> - here the money has already decided to spend <br>  <b>"Loot happened"</b> - happened right out of a monkey 5,000 years ago <br>  <b>“Where is the loot tomorrow nah”</b> - return debts !!! <br>  <b>"Get a loot for free"</b> <br>  <b>"Freebie"</b> <br>  <b>“Loot is distributed right now”</b> - I'm already running, I'll take an empty bag, no, two <br>  <b>"Where to hang the loot"</b> - here, another easy way to money <br>  <b>“Loot booze women”</b> - trump query, just looking for “loot” and “women” <br>  <b>“Salvage triumphs over evil”</b> - this is apparently a person who found how “salvage triumphs over evil” <br>  <b>"Women and loot sex without a condom"</b> - I do not even know what it is about <br>  <b>"Where the fuck is fucking"</b> - this one came from Yandex.  he is one <br>  <b>“Where the fuck</b> is going to <b>happen tomorrow”</b> - we really need money, “give me money” <br>  <b>“The day it’s got for the loot”</b> - so, forgive it, it’s when the money is lost, and they don’t get free then :) <br>  <b>"And I will throw you to the loot"</b> - and left my grandmother, and left my grandfather <br><br>  Hopefully, the topic of research into search queries will seem interesting to others.  Offer your “funny requests” and new topics for analysis :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5700/</a></p>
