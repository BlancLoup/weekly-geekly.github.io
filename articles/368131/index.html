And all they had was: the Great Wall of China, and paper, and hieroglyphs, and scientists, and a compass and gunpowder, and even rockets.  And they themselves, literally, were worn on their hands ‚Äî in palanquins ‚Äî no horse riding or chariots, like the Egyptian pharaohs.  No martial arts.  To raise the sword or nunchaku what - this is no, no!  Moreover, they were even dressed by servants.  They fanned them with vials - from servants and flies - also servants.

      One problem: sick often!  Lived up to 30-40 years - this is the maximum!  Some, altogether - a little over twenty passed.  Until now, the Internet has been publishing all sorts of secretly copied ‚Äúhealing books‚Äù of these emperors.  By the way, it was around them, under the emperors, that the first masseurs and the massage itself appeared (it is also called ‚Äúlazy gymnastics‚Äù).  It can be seen, the clever doctor did not dare: he did not advise the emperor to go in for physical culture.  Then with this it was strictly: if that - immediately on the count.  Or they began to feed with one meat - they practiced such a punishment ... <br><br>  Therefore, physical culture had to be invented not in those times (2700 BC), but at the end of the 18th century.  The choice of history fell on the inventor of the ‚ÄúSwedish wall‚Äù - Per Henrik Link.  It so happened that Link fell ill (with something like rheumatism), but he didn‚Äôt otlezhivat, and engaged in fencing.  Moreover, he also began to teach others fencing.  Then he felt better.  Link managed to compare everything correctly and began to heal with movement and even to teach medical gymnastics.  In 1813, in Stockholm, they even created the Royal Institute, where they trained gymnastics instructors, and Link led this institute. <br><br>  - Such is the tale.  Here and the fairy tale is over, and who listened ... <br>  - Not enough!  Like, like, but not enough!  Tell me more! <br><br>  - Fine, fine.  So what am I talking about?  Oh yes - in the movie "Autumn Marathon" deliciously so the actor Yevgeny Leonov said: "We sit well."  Indeed, we love this occupation - even at home, even at work ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The website of the American Heart Association reports [1] that since 1950 the number of ‚Äúsedentary‚Äù types of work activity has increased by 83% (now it is 43% of all jobs in the United States).  That in 1960 about half of the US workforce was physically active, and now this work employs less than 20% of the total working population.  The rest of the country, of course, "catch up" ... <br><br>  Even New Yorkers living in a ‚Äúcity that never sleeps‚Äù sit very much.  New York is one of the most "pedestrian" cities in the country.  It provides many opportunities for physical activity.  New Yorkers themselves are more likely to regularly spend time training than the average American.  But even they are sitting much more than is considered acceptable. <br><br>  According to a recent study [2], published by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average New Yorker spends sitting more than seven hours a day.  On average, in New York spend sitting: <br><ul><li>  people with higher incomes - 8.2 hours; </li><li>  people with low incomes - 6.3 hours; </li><li>  whites - 7.8 hours; </li><li>  African Americans - 7.4 hours; </li><li>  Hispanics - 5.4 hours; </li><li>  Asian Americans - 7.9 hours; </li><li>  people older than 65 - 9 o'clock. </li></ul><br>  At the same time, the World Health Organization's newsletter N ¬∞ 385, released in January 2015, reports [3] that this is harmful, and insufficient physical activity is one of the ten leading risk factors for death in the world and one of the main risk factors for the development of noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes (in Russia, NCDs are responsible for 75% of all deaths). <br><br>  According to a study by the American College of Cardiology [22], a sedentary lifestyle is clearly associated with increased calcification of the coronary arteries.  This increases the risk of coronary heart disease, which is the most common type of heart disease and the leading cause of death.  Analyzing the scans of the heart of more than 2000 adults living in Dallas, the researchers found that every hour spent sitting, is associated with a marked increase in calcification of the coronary arteries. <br><br>  In June 2015, the MedicalXpress website announced the completion of a Kansas State University study [4].  In this study, physicians came to the conclusion that the frequency of physical activity is more important for maintaining health, and not its intensity. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen people sit for a long period of time, their bodies stop producing an enzyme called‚Äú lipoprotein lipase, ‚Äùwhich helps break down fat and use it as an energy source,‚Äù said Sara Rosencrantz, an associate professor at the university's nutrition department, at a briefing.  ‚ÄúWe know that sitting in a sitting position for long periods of time physiologically decreases insulin sensitivity and increases fat accumulation.  These two facts are very much connected with the risk of chronic diseases in the long term. ‚Äù <br><br>  Emily Miley, associate professor of kinesiology and director of the research laboratory of physical activity at the same university, explained: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to sedentary work, frequent breaks are what really matter.  People need to move more during the day. ‚Äù  She recommends installing a screensaver on your computer, reminding you to get up and move.  She also suggests: <br><ul><li>  send documents to a remote printer; </li><li>  going to the toilet to another floor; </li><li>  visit the office staff personally - instead of sending him email; </li><li>  Park your car away from the working office. </li></ul><br>  The Canadian Cancer Society has specified the reasons that increase the health risks of a sedentary lifestyle [5]: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA growing body of evidence confirms the link between a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of cancer.  Sitting for a long period of time can increase the risk of cancer even in people who exercise regularly. <br><br>  If you exercise for 30 minutes or more a day, but spend most of the day sitting mostly, you may have an increased risk of developing cancer.  The longer a person sits, the higher the risk.  Studies show that sitting for long periods of time unambiguously affects certain functions of the body: <br><ul><li>  the level of androgens in men and the level of estrogens in women increase, which is associated with ‚Äúhormone types‚Äù of cancer (prostate cancer and breast cancer); </li><li>  blood sugar levels increase, insulin levels and insulin resistance increase.  Cancer cells use glucose for reproduction, and an increase in blood sugar can stimulate their growth; </li><li>  Vitamin D levels are reduced, which may increase the risk of other types of cancer. </li></ul><br>  A sedentary lifestyle is also associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and uterine cancer (endometrium). " </blockquote><br><br>  However, we spend most of the day at work, where we have to sit, and for quite some time.  Researchers at the University of Iowa believe that the best way to teach people to move at work is to change the environment of workers by installing foot training equipment under each desk.  In their latest study [6], they installed compact bicycle simulators under the tables for employees of one of the Iowa City companies.  Their study lasted 4 months.  Three times a week, physicians sent e-mails to their wards with recommendations and reminders about the use of simulators.  Researchers connected monitors to the pedals of the simulators and monitored the time of their use.  On average, this time was 50 minutes a day.  At the end of the study, 70% of the participants decided to keep the simulators for themselves.  The results, according to medical reviews, are also good. <br><br>  Hammacher-Schlemmer [7] believes that their solution to the problem is better.  It is an office desk with an elliptical trainer.  According to the company, this design allows you to burn about 4,000 calories per work week, although the advertisement does not say a word about how much time and effort you need to spend on it. <br><br>  The table can be used, including standing.  The price of the table is (total!) $ 8000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/b52/fea/96bb52fea7964131b287241292c1ca28.jpg"><br><br>  There are other options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/610/9c1/e6b/6109c1e6b26140669b74f513893e2e2e.jpg"><br><br>  Researchers who received a grant from the Minnesota Center for Combating Obesity and the Mayo Foundation (located in New York's Mayo Clinic is one of the most advanced research and treatment centers in the United States) conducted a study of the effectiveness of computerized workplaces based on refined treadmills. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúExpected Effects‚Äù section of the research report [12] states: ‚ÄúWork ‚Äî typing, reading, telephone calls, and even thinking ‚Äî while walking are examples of multitasking.  Walking and work tasks can complement or compete with each other.  Walking is an obstacle to tasks that require constant posture and the use of hands for precise execution (for example, typing and using a computer mouse).  On the other hand, walking complements the implementation of complex cognitive tasks, because it reduces stress, increases the size of the hippocampus and improves memory, and also increases attentiveness and concentration on cognitive tasks.  Even before the start of the experiment, two-day testing of the results of performing various tasks on a computerized treadmill revealed that the mathematical results are not reduced, and the selective attention, processing and reading comprehension do not differ from those in a sitting position ... " <br><br>  The results of the study, conducted during the whole year on 46 volunteers in one of the commercial companies of Minnesota, showed that both the health indicators of volunteers and the qualitative and quantitative indicators of their work improved significantly.  Evaluation of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the work was carried out by researchers on the basis of data received weekly from the management of the company.  The level of job satisfaction of the volunteers themselves has also increased. <br><br>  Great!  After all, when typing or processing graphics can be a little and stand.  The problem is only in price and in the size of such a workplace.  Moreover, if in the United States - as reported by the authors of the study - employers are already ready for such changes, then in Russia this is not yet the case.  On the other hand, starting and stopping the treadmill when changing the type of work is an additional hassle.  Apparently, the option with a treadmill is still not for everyone ... <br><br>  But it seems to have found a good option.  More time spent standing up (not sitting) can, according to a study by the University of Queensland (Australia), published in the European Heart Journal in July 2015 [8], improve health outcomes. <br><br>  Dr. Genevieve Hili, a senior researcher at this university who led the study, said: ‚ÄúWe found that an additional two hours per day spent standing up resulted in a 2% decrease in the average blood sugar level, a 11% decrease in the average triglyceride (fat) in the blood, a 6% decrease in total cholesterol and an increase of 0.06 mmol / l of the average level of "good" cholesterol. <br><br>  A little earlier, in June 2015, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published [9] the first Guidebook in the history of Great Britain, designed to reduce the health risks of office workers.  It was developed by a group of international experts at the request of the Department of Public Health of England and the United Kingdom and contains similar recommendations: <br><ul><li>  2 hours of daily standing and light activity (easy walks) during the working day; </li><li>  work with the use of adjustable tables for sitting-standing. </li></ul><br>  I remembered: indeed, there was such a publication on geektimes.ru [17] about ‚Äútricky‚Äù tables for work.  However, a study by Curtin University (Australia) [11] showed that workers using such standing-sitting tables sit during the day for 78.5% of work time, while for workers at regular tables this figure was 83.8% ( the difference was slightly more than 5%). <br><br>  The lead author of this study, Professor Leon Straker, said he was very surprised by the result.  ‚ÄúI expected more difference,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú5% difference per day is not enough.  In addition, it turned out that people tend not to use the adjustability of such furniture.  We see that people who have an adjustable table tend to find a position that is comfortable and rarely change it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Maybe you need to work while standing?  Alas, it turned out and this is a miss!  In his doctoral dissertation, I.A.  Zolotukhin, head of the course of hospital surgery of RNRMU named after  I.N.Pirogov and the executive secretary of the Association of Phlebologists of Russia read: ‚ÄúIf half a century ago phlebologists were animatedly discussing the hereditary, endocrine, dyshormonal theories of varicose veins, now experts recognize the leading role of lifestyle changes.  Hypodynamia, standing or sitting for most of the day lead to an overload of the venous system, stagnation of the muscle-venous pump activity and, as a result, the development of pathological structural changes in the veins of the legs.  Another risk factor is hormonal contraceptive use. ‚Äù <br><br>  Indeed, in the same British "Guidelines" to reduce the risks of office workers, the need to "eliminate prolonged static standing, which is no less harmful than sitting." <br><br>  But is it possible that varicose veins are not as scary as what they say on the websites of the Canadian Cancer Society and the American Heart Association?  Clarify.  It turns out that varicose veins are not only a cosmetic problem [13].  Mortality from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) caused by chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the EU is 2.5 times higher than the total mortality from accidents, prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS.  The same level of problem occurs in the United States [14].  Moreover, if in 2005 more than 75% of the US population still knew nothing about varicose veins, DVT and PE, then in 2008 the government was forced to recognize this as ‚Äúthe main public health problem‚Äù [15].  According to the Center for Preventive Medicine of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (GNITS PM), blood system diseases are responsible for 55% of all deaths in the Russian Federation, and the situation itself is more complicated than in the EU. <br><br>  The presence of a direct connection of computer technology and problems with the veins of the legs was found back in 2003.  It was then that doctors introduced the term ‚Äúe-thrombosis‚Äù (‚Äúcomputer thrombosis‚Äù) [16].  In Russia, however, the term "computer varicose veins" is used for this.  Probably because very few people know about TGV-TELA, and the Ministry of Health (like the American CDC, by the way) does not want to frighten the population with "numbers."  However, a special resolution of the US Senate has provided an annual allocation of considerable sums to conduct the "Months of Protection from DVT-TELA".  At this time, the problem is being discussed even on the most popular TV shows.  In Russia, even the 1st World Thrombosis Day (held in October 2014 and dedicated to, specifically, THV-TELA) was almost like a secret gathering.  Only professionals were registered at the only event of the day (teleconference). <br><br>  - Well, you have fairy tales!  This is some kind of "horror", and not a bedtime story!  Everything, I start to use the computer only lying! <br>  - Take your time - listen further on what smart people say. <br><br>  I, too, felt that the only way out was to work lying down.  The load on the veins is reduced: the pressure in the veins at the level of the foot is only 5 mm Hg and that of the patient is 50-60 mm Hg (90 or more in the standing position).  Feel the difference?  But it turned out that "horseradish radish is not sweeter."  With varicose veins, perhaps this will give something.  Although it is doubtful.  After all, varicose veins are caused, first of all, by the degradation of the veins due to their poor nutrition and stagnation in them (toxic) of the decay products of the cells of our constantly renewed organism.  And even then, the action of high pressure. <br><br>  Blood clots in the veins also occur due to "venous stasis" or, in Russian, due to a decrease in blood flow velocity (the same stagnation of blood).  And it does not matter whether you are sitting or lying down - it does not insure against blood clots.  Moreover, the motor activity is not added.  Another "catch": work in the prone position dramatically increases the risk of spinal problems.  More precisely - with the cervical spine.  This is evidenced by the results obtained in the course of a study conducted by the University of Washington [18]. <br><br>  Under the guidance of Professor Kenneth Hansray, Head of the Department of Surgery at the New York Spinal Clinic, the researchers found that the load on the cervical vertebrae increases with increasing degree of head tilt: <br><ul><li>  tilting by 60 degrees increases the load by 24 kg; </li><li>  a 45 degree tilt increases the load by 22 kg; </li><li>  tilting by 30 degrees increases the load by 18 kg; </li><li>  an incline of 15 degrees increases the load by 12kg. </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúThe loss of the natural curvature of the cervical spine leads to an increase in the load on the neck,‚Äù they report.  ‚ÄúThese loads can lead to premature wear, tearing, degeneration and, possibly, operations.‚Äù Similar posture and risks are consistent with the current way of using tablet computers and laptops. <br><br>  Researchers concluded: ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs almost impossible to avoid using the technologies that cause these problems, people should make every effort to look at their smartphones and tablets in the neutral position of the spine and avoid many hours of daily inclination with their heads bowed in laptops‚Äù . <br><br>  The results of the study link poor working posture with a number of health problems, including back pain, weight gain, constipation, heartburn and migraines.  Experts say that sitting with a ‚Äústraight neck‚Äù allows blood and oxygen to flow freely throughout the body, and promotes better digestion.  It also contributes to the production of endorphin and the reduction of the stress hormone cortisol. <br><br>  Researchers say that 80% of all headaches are associated with tension in the muscles of the neck and are aggravated by poor posture.  Up to 40% of people suffer from a headache at least once a week, and 67% - about once a month.  These types of headaches usually last from 30 minutes to two days. <br><br>  - So what?  Break the computer and go to the wipers? <br>  - Why in the janitors? <br><br>  Remember, at the beginning of my story, I mentioned leg simulators.  This is the same ‚Äúphysical activity‚Äù plus the exception of ‚Äúvenous stasis‚Äù (blood stagnation).  Do you know the beloved "heart of the academic" - Leo Antonovich Bokeria?  So, he is the chief specialist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation in this area and in 2013 approved the ‚ÄúRussian clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic venous diseases‚Äù developed by a group of 77 Russian and foreign experts of the Association of Phlebologists of Russia [19].  This document clearly states that with a long stay in a sitting position, for prevention and rehabilitation it is necessary to use a leg trainer located directly under the office table.  In fairness, it should be noted that this ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù was first invented at the Medical Institute of the Federal Aviation Administration of the USA. <br><br>  One day, a person must make up his mind and begin to make a conscious effort to stay healthy.  This is called ‚Äúpersonal hygiene‚Äù (for example, once people have not brushed their teeth - now this problem is, in general, solved).  But, one day to think about health and start moving is half the battle and even less.  The question is how not to break down and not to leave everything halfway, or even at the very beginning.  Hence the sales boom of various fitness trackers.  With them, however, zaminochka small: in order for them to start working, you need to get up and start moving.  Not every employer (and even co-workers) will like it if you interrupt your work a couple of times per hour for 3-4 minute exercise or walking.  In addition, fitness trackers require frequent recharging and regular synchronization with the computer.  That is, they themselves require a "piece of your life."  Geektime.ru even reported [21] that fitness gadgets take root poorly.  More than half of those who bought them no longer use them.  Every third throws the gadget in less than six months.  In this sense, a personal trainer under the desk is probably better. <br><br>  Exercise machines today - a dime a dozen - choose any.  True, not everyone can be put under the desktop (knees may not fit).  But there is a special (very compact), it is designed specifically for this use.  Another one of his plus - the simulator is combined with a tracker activity of the legs in a sitting position (I do not know the analogs).  Synchronization with the computer does not require a set of batteries is enough for almost a year.  Fine. <br><br>  Do you remember computerized treadmills?  There, even before the beginning of their research, physicians discuss the problem of multitasking.  Multitasking is really a serious problem (it was also discussed at geektimes.ru [20]).  The effectiveness of prophylaxis "rests" on how organically it will be possible to "fit" it in everyday work.  And here in full force helps the tracker simulator.  He "assumes" the organization of prophylaxis, excluding the emergence of another task, which the user would have to "solve" if he used the usual sports simulator.  In my opinion, this is an acceptable solution.  By the way, one of the luminaries of Russian phlebology, Professor B.N.
