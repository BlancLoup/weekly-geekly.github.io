Immediately I recall Zakharov Baron Munchhausen performed by Oleg Yankovsky, who said that all nonsense is done with this expression on his face. <br><br>  This time, ‚ÄúVesti‚Äù distinguished themselves by posting a <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos%3Fvid%3D353055">video</a> with the title ‚ÄúAn advanced alternative to Skype appeared in the Russian Federation‚Äù.  One would like to take a felt-tip pen and add it right on the screen - ‚Äúbackward Skype‚Äù.  Directly pride takes - another triumph of domestic technology. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Journalists admire the professionalism from the very first phrase: ‚ÄúRussia has developed a more advanced version of Skype.‚Äù  Skype is, for a moment, a brand and a new version can only be developed by its owner.  But in the head of the Vesti journalists, horses, people, and video conferencing mixed up in a bunch, so for them any kind of communication on the Internet is Skype.  As children are small. <br><br>  Actually, they are before our bright eyes the whole two alternatives presented to Skype.  <a href="http://trueconf.ru/">The first</a> is a handful of ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù equipment, the main control tool of which is a cheap-looking touchscreen tablet.  Supports the system right up to 16 full participants of the conference, another two and a half hundreds can peek.  One set of equipment for this ‚Äúvideo call‚Äù costs more than 3 thousand US dollars.  Pathetic pennies, ugh. <br><br>  The main advantage of this system, journalists called the almost complete lack of delays.  This is achieved by tracking changes in the ‚Äúwidth‚Äù of the available channel and adjusting the signal quality to the available connection speed.  For reference, Skype has always been able to do this and is still using it perfectly. <br><br>  But let's see how this function works in this beautiful domestic system.  Roll off the roller at 1:32.  Voice-overs ask the head in the monitor: ‚ÄúDo you hear me well?‚Äù.  Silence ... Silence ... After three seconds, the head finally responds: "Yes."  Three seconds delay guys!  Well, let it be two.  This is the speed!  Skype smokes to the side, giggling nervously. <br><br>  Of course, I do not exclude that the head in the monitor simply does not think well and it took her entire three seconds to formulate the answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  Then it is obvious that on the other side of the screen it is necessary to plant a more clever head.  But you and I understand that everything is much simpler and two or three seconds is the usual communication delay.  Apparently for the Russian system, this is really extremely small.  Hmm ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/715/e6d/6fe/715e6d6fe5fd78e1d8628fdbb65d04f8.jpg" align="right" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.stel.ru/videoconference/prod_vc/stel/">The second</a> "alternative", presented in the video, generally dropped me under the table.  This is a system for field video calling.  With convenient carrying handle.  Such a weighty briefcase, which, according to the bearded deputy director of the developer, can be not only a video terminal, but also a full-fledged computer.  Congratulations guys - you come up with a laptop! <br><br>  Probably that was the way laptops looked in the 80s of the last century.  Take a look at the thickness of the device.  At first, I thought that there was a real kinescope hiding inside.  But after looking, I decided that it was rather a system unit.  Full-size system unit attached to a laptop.  Pay attention to the elegant twisted cord, stretched from the device to the folding keyboard;  on comfortable hefty keys. <br><br>  And now attention.  Drumroll.  This suitcase is worth <b>400 thousand rubles</b> .  This is more than 14 thousand dollars, according to Google.  A curtain.  I am sure that you can even think of how to organize field communication and a field computer for much less money, which will be more powerful and convenient than this Russian Orthodox development in basillion times. <br><br>  Journalists "Vesti" could call the video somehow differently.  For example, ‚ÄúCuriosities of the IT industry‚Äù or ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt take it to Skolkovo‚Äù.  Then there would be no complaints about them.  But the guys turned their report into classic shovel "news from the fields", seriously talking about these mossy and useless Russian "innovations" and presenting them as advanced achievements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126164/</a></p>
