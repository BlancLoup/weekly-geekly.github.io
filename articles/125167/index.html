  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 reasons why failure is the key to success</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking for information on self-development I found an interesting article with an unusual title.  I read and thought, why not share with habrovchanami colleagues, perhaps the information will interest them.  So, my free translation, let's go. <br><br>  If you are like most people, then most likely do not like failure.  You see a collapse in them, proof that your plan was not successful or your ideas are not good enough.  But the truth is that failure happens to everyone.  One of the things that distinguishes successful people is the correct understanding of the whole force of failure.  To succeed, you must learn from mistakes and missteps all along the way, rather than surrender and despair. <br><br>  Pay attention to this information, especially if you are in a position where your opponent‚Äôs failure, and in each defeat you will find a new opportunity.  Here are three reasons why failure is the key to success. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Failed - so tried </h4><br>  The best way to measure your progress in any field is to count the number of failures that you had.  If you have not had failures, most likely you didn‚Äôt try very hard.  Failure is a blacksmith hammer forging the sword of your success.  If you really want to succeed in something, you have to fail at least a couple of times. <br><br>  If you look at all the great men and women in history, you will notice that they had one thing in common.  They failed, and suffered it often.  Remember Thomas Edison.  How many times has he been wrong when choosing a filament material for his bulb?  There are different assumptions, but they are all within the ‚Äúdamn lot‚Äù.  Henry Ford was closely acquainted with failures.  So closely that a quote is attributed to him: ‚Äúfailure is an opportunity to start anew and act more rationally.‚Äù <br><br>  Obviously, failure provides an opportunity for growth, and does not lead to defeat. <br><br><h4>  Use failures as a tool </h4><br>  Just as all the greats had something in common, many are unable to use failures as a tool.  When you take failures to heart, you suppress yourself, you lose your strength.  Success is the study of the causes of failures and how you will compensate for them. <br><br>  Try to answer the following questions: <br><ul><li>  What caused the failure? </li><li>  What part of the blame lies with me? </li><li>  How can I use my influence to turn failure into success? </li><li>  What stages should I go through to start over? </li><li>  What can I do every day to make sure that the new attempt will be more reasonable? </li></ul><br>  Take a sheet of paper and go through this list.  Be as open and honest with yourself as possible.  Analyze your answers and do it - do not hesitate in any way.  Remember, failure is an opportunity, not a burden.  Be grateful for the opportunity to grow. <br><br><h4>  Failures temper character </h4><br>  If you look at the events that precede significant victories, you will surely find that failure is the biggest motivator.  Just as the Colorado River has created the Grand Canyon over many millions of years, success can also come in small pieces that are part of any winning strategy.  On the other hand, to expect year after year that something will happen is not effective when you can act right now. <br><br>  So what makes you constantly check yourself and learn from mistakes?  Your character. <br><br>  Success usually comes to those who are ready for it.  Creating some values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom day to day requires certainty, a goal, and, of course, the presence of such an important feature as character.  Failure brings up character much better than any statements or fleeting goals.  While every successful action will propel you forward a little, failure will harden your personality like nothing else.  This is the difference between a natural lake that was formed over thousands of years, and a lake created by human hands in less than a year. <br><br>  Success requires willpower, quick wit, certainty and endurance.  But more than all of this, it requires failure.  Use this opportunity to rethink your attitude towards success. <br><br>  PS If this topic is interesting, I can translate a few more articles that I liked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125167/</a></p>
