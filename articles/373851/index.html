Now, it seems, finally everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/06/59ce06cb64e11770179190.jpeg"><br><br>  What was with Withitngs and what will not be from Nokia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Geektimes is not a place for commemoration, and Withings seems to be not the first brand that was bought by another major brand, but its fate is still unusual.  Yes, and we loved Withings, perhaps more than anything else: probably the only brand that did not rush from side to side, staying in the MHealth niche, offering products for health monitoring from 2008 to 2017. 9 years.

      Now, despite the fact that the domain is still in issue: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/07/59ce07257ed68746038009.png"><br><br>  Redirects are already set up and a concise greeting message is issued ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/07/59ce0725b1e5e584991393.png"><br><br>  Buying Nokia came out delicate: if it is fluently compared with other high-profile acquisitions, then questions arise: where is Runtastic?  And where is the Pebble?  Where is the Vector?  Well, where are the products like Adidas Combo or Adidas Libra? <br><br>  And Nokia Steel, for example, is still there. <br><br>  <b>What will continue</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs impossible to blame Nokia for all troubles.  Some products somehow quietly left the market before May 31, 2016, when the deal officially closed.  Over the year, the store restructured, it took companies some time to ‚Äúre-stick logos‚Äù and restart Withings Health Mate called Nokia Health Mate. <br><br>  <b>Now the <a href="https://health.nokia.com/ru/en/store">official Nokia store</a> sells</b> : <br><br>  <b>Thermo</b> is a Withings thermometer that was introduced at CES2016.  The infrared model is equipped with 16 sensors that allows you to instantly and accurately determine body temperature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce054d39f75291242880.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-home.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dhome"><b>Nokia Home</b></a> (ex Withings Home) - a smart camera for the home with the functions of the environmental tracker and air quality monitoring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce056848e54689883061.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Two</b> blood pressure <b>monitors</b> Nokia Wireless and Compact Wireless.  Both models have FDA approval.  For the first time, one of the Withings tonometers was introduced in 2011, and in 2014 it was upgraded to a wireless version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce059724902865382646.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia smart scales</b> : this is also the former Withings Body Scale.  Now there are three models that differ in some functions.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/nokia-body.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dbody">Nokia Body</a> - weight and body mass index for the whole family with Wi-fi connectivity.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-body.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dbody">Nokia Body +</a> allows you to track and indicators such as the level of fat, the mineral composition of bones, the level of muscle mass, etc., as weights, analyzers.  And <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-body-cardio.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dbody">Nokia Body Cardio</a> adds a heart rate monitor to the functions of the previous model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce05bdcc171852622664.png"><br><br>  <b>Nokia Go</b> (Withings Go) is one of the strangest products with Withings, which for some reason has been preserved under the Nokia brand.  A few words about him can be <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/287678/">read here</a> .  Physical activity on the E-ink display with narrow personalization options.  Positioned as an accessory for young people, however, to put it mildly, did not take off.  Of the benefits - protection from water and 8 months of autonomy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce05d97c9f5145327790.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia Steel</b> (Withings Steel) is a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-activite-steel.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dsteel">hybrid model of</a> fitness watches, which once, like <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/291419/">Runtastic Moment</a> , can be said to have laid the foundation for a whole niche of smart hybrids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/06/59ce062865eb6297904291.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia Health Mate</b> - all data collected from Nokia gadgets is now saved in this renamed application with the ability to sync with Apple Health. <br><br>  <b>What's missing</b> <br><br>  Nokia‚Äôs product line for the Withings has been a bit woozy, and some useful things have disappeared from the range. <br><br>  The official store is no longer: <br><br>  Children's scales <b><a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-smart-kid-scale-umnye-detskie-vesy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dkids">Smart Kid Scale WS-40</a></b> .  Despite the fact that product <a href="https://support.health.nokia.com/hc/en-us/categories/200118127-Smart-Kid-Scale">support</a> continues, it is impossible (or completely) to buy them under a new brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/06/59ce065678950692368364.jpeg"><br><br>  The scales were comfortable and could ‚Äúfold out‚Äù into two devices: a special cradle was provided for the babies, which, when the child was growing up, was easily removed.  The measurement step was equal to 10 grams, which made it possible to track changes in the child‚Äôs weight quite accurately, and the synchronization was over Wi-fi.  Scales were first announced in 2012 at CES. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-aura-smart-sistema-dlja-sna-umnyj-budil-nik.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Daura">Aura has</a></b> disappeared.  Sleep tracker and smart alarm clock, which consisted of two parts: a remote sensor and a special lining under the sheet, which determined with much greater accuracy relative to the trackers when the user is in a fast sleep phase for comfortable waking up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/06/59ce0678aaf7b282075208.jpeg"><br><br>  Another baby gadget did not appear in the official store - video baby <b><a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/videomonitor-dlja-rebenka-pod-iphone-ipad-smart-baby-monitor.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dbabymonitor">Smart Baby Monitor</a></b> , which <a href="https://support.health.nokia.com/hc/en-us/categories/200118087-Smart-Baby-Monitor">continues</a> to <a href="https://support.health.nokia.com/hc/en-us/categories/200118087-Smart-Baby-Monitor">be</a> supported on the official Nokia website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/05/59ce0542bda12163701781.png"><br><br>  Folding design, camera, multiple microphones broadcast on a smartphone.  Stylish and elegant, but now unavailable. <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-aktivnosti-withings-pulse-o2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dpulse02"><b>Pulse 02</b></a> is a strange tracker with a heart rate monitor, which disappeared imperceptibly, initially ‚Äúunder the pretext‚Äù of an updated version of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-smart-activity-tracker-datchik-aktivnosti-dlja-iphone-ipad.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwithings%26utm_campaign%3Dpulse02">Pulse Smart</a> , and then completely, moreover, it is unlikely because of Nokia.  It was not sold cheerfully, and the removable bracelet just blocked its main function - the heart rate monitor, which made the measurement process very inconvenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/06/59ce06bdcb736570035312.jpeg"><br><br>  How the story will develop further - it is difficult to make a forecast: in any case, even now it is not clear whether the process of gluing logos has ended and whether the assortment has been finally determined.  Maybe soon we will see again the entire line of gadgets Withings under a new name in the updated store. <br><br>  And, nevertheless, Withings experience in the market of smart devices I want to say thank you and good bye.  This brand has taught us a lot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373851/</a></p>
