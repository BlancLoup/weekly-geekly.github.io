  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use multichannel support system in retail. Case Desk Client</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Messengers and social networks are not just platforms for communication of millions of users.  They are firmly occupied by sellers of goods and services of all kinds and sizes - from small startups to global corporations.  And this is no accident.  61% of companies that have focused on sales in social media, noted a positive trend in profits. * And for small businesses, social networks are often the main platform on the Internet, where this business is represented.  Creating a store page on Facebook or VK requires less investment than developing and maintaining a full-fledged site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8d2/62d/6d4/8d262d6d4e62463883e2f3567f475857.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When a client base grows in business and the flow of orders is constantly increasing, it is necessary to communicate with more and more people.  Hence the need to automate and streamline business processes.  For this there are different tools and techniques.  In this article we will consider an atypical case: the use of multi-channel helpdesk service in the flower shop ‚ÄúAwesome Flowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã(the name is changed).  <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_8%26utm_content%3D1">Deskun</a> service <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_8%26utm_content%3D1">has</a> become the main tool for automation. <br><br><h3>  Customer problem </h3><br>  Flower shop "Awesome Flowers" specializes in the creation of wedding and festive bouquets, and also conducts workshops on floristics.  All sales and communication with customers occur mainly through the Internet.  The store owners are three friends (let's call them Anna, Maria, Tatiana), they also perform all the functions: <br><br><ul><li>  purchase of flowers and accessories </li><li>  work with delivery service </li><li>  maintenance of boo.  accounting </li><li>  bouquet arrangement </li><li>  photo making </li><li>  posting on social networks </li><li>  promotion of company services </li><li>  communication with potential buyers </li><li>  order processing </li><li>  communication with buyers after the sale </li><li>  participation in events </li><li>  master classes </li></ul><br>  Communication with counterparties takes place via e-mail.  Communication with customers occurs through the store pages on social networks VKontakte and Facebook, as well as through WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram.  Despite the relatively small turnover and volume of orders, many individuals are involved in the process.

    <h3>  Deskun implementation </h3><br>  In order to streamline communication with all counterparties, it was decided to use a special service.  The main requirements were a simple interface, the ability to customize without the involvement of IT specialists and low price.  CRM systems and multichannel helpdesk services were considered as tools.  As a result, the choice was made in favor of Deskun, since the solution makes it possible to connect all the used communication channels, including WhatsApp, and automate many business processes.  The decisive factor was the affordable price of the service - only $ 18.91 per month for access for 3 employees and full system functionality with 3 connected mailboxes, 2 groups on social networks and 3 messengers. <br><br>  The following channels were created in Deskun: <br><br><ol><li>  <i>Customers</i>  Existing and potential customers. </li><li>  <i>Accounting</i> .  Accountant outsourcing. </li><li>  <i>Purchase</i>  Providers of flowers, decorations, delivery service. </li><li>  <i>Events</i>  Organizers, PR-managers of events, partners. </li><li>  <i>Plans and ideas</i> .  Development strategy. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9f1/bdd/93e/9f1bdd93e9d44613af2a7ba877ab4a78.png"><br><br><h3>  Processes and automation </h3><br>  <b>Customers</b>  Channel "Chat and messengers."  This is the main channel for communication with real and potential customers in the chat format.  All girls are agents in this channel.  A separate WhatsApp number was purchased for integration with Deskun, since  It can work only on one device.  A public Viber account was also registered and connected, a Telegram bot was created.  Here, girls process new orders, answer questions about the prices of bouquets and master classes, discuss delivery options and other issues.  The main functions used in this channel are sending and receiving files and pictures, sound notifications about new dialogs, internal notes.  Thanks to the opportunity to receive not only messages, but also comments on the walls of Facebook and Vkontakte groups, girls do not miss a single message.  Photos of ready-made compositions, price lists, presentations are sent to customers.  Message templates have been created for this channel: welcome and pricing information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/52e/225/cf3/52e225cf369a451089ba9baf2d5d57c0.png"><br><br>  <b>Accounting.</b>  Channel "Email Support".  Responsible for this channel is Tatiana.  For solving accounting issues, Tatiana uses a specially created email address for this.  The most frequently used functions are message templates and deferred sending of letters. <br><br>  <b>Purchase.</b>  Channel "Email Support".  All correspondence with current and potential suppliers is conducted here, prices and volumes of deliveries are discussed.  Requests for an external delivery service are also created immediately.  Maria‚Äôs work email address is tied to this channel, and she is the only agent, as she is fully responsible for this direction.  The main options for working with this channel are setting the priority of the ticket and tracking the reading of letters.  The latter function is especially important when communicating with the delivery service, as it allows you to track the missed requests on time.  She also created message templates for her work: asking for the price of flowers and plants;  request prices for accessories for compositions and materials for master classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/972/540/476/9725404763064384b191658d41a670af.png"><br><br>  <b>Activity.</b>  Channel "Email Support".  A common mailbox of the Awesome Flowers store is connected to this channel.  Agents are all girls, responsible - Anna.  There is a correspondence with the organizers and other participants in wedding exhibitions and events on floristics.  All new tickets are assigned to Anna by default, but the other girls also see the correspondence and can respond.  The main options used are the response on behalf of the general mailbox, notes inside the ticket, snooze (reminders).  The latter function is used most often: in a large flow of tasks and applications there is always the risk of missing an event. <br><br>  <b>Plans and ideas.</b>  Channel "Task Management".  In this channel are created tickets with plans for the next month.  At the general meeting of the girls discuss these plans, and then fix them in the form of tickets.  To manage tasks, many options of the ticket system are used: the ability to assign a responsible person, checklists of tasks, deadlines, priorities, statuses.  Sometimes interesting and useful ideas arise not only at the planning meeting, but also during correspondence with clients.  Then a ticket is created directly from the chat messages in the corresponding channel. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Using the service of multi-channel customer support in the retail business is not the most typical scenario.  However, as a result of the implementation of <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_8%26utm_content%3D2">Deskun</a> and the competent setting up of the service, the owners were able to optimize the work with all incoming calls.  Application processing time decreased by 62%, due to the fact that now all requests began to come in a "single window" format.  The result of the optimization process was an increase in gross profit by 38%. <br><br>  * (Feedback Systems, 2015) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337012/</a></p>
