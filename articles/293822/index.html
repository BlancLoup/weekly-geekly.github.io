  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monetization indie games - continue experiments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost half a year has passed since the launch of our debut mobile game on ( <a href="http://bit.ly/h90s-apple">iOS</a> ) and ( <a href="http://bit.ly/h90s-android">Android</a> ), in which we made a bold but naive attempt to change the established approach to monetization.  You can read more about the original experiment ( <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/anvilgames/blog/11294/">here</a> ), and about the results for the first month - ( <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/anvilgames/blog/14408/">here</a> ). <br><br>  If in short - the experiment failed, I was once again disappointed in people, and in subsequent updates we came to the banal scheme ‚Äúpayments + advertising‚Äù.  But it was possible to find such a balance between free content, premium content and unobtrusive advertising, which allowed not to disappoint the players (the average score on Android is 4.75 with ~ 280.000 installations!) And pay back the development (about 150.000 rubles). <br><br>  <i>Advertising is worth mentioning at once separately - in our case, this is exclusively ‚Äúrewarded / incentive video ads‚Äù.</i>  <i>At the end of the article I will tell you what values ‚Äã‚Äãof eCPM can be expected at ~ 10,000 impressions per day in Russia from such platforms as UnityAds, Vungle, AdColony and Applovin.</i>

In fact, everything is a little more complicated, but I do not want to repeat. <br><br>  It did not work.  There were payments, but very rarely and little.  At the same time, the audience liked the game, the number of installations grew and not trying to earn more would be foolish. <br><br><h3>  Monetization at the moment </h3><br>  Since mid-July, such changes have occurred: <br>  - in-game currency free of charge is not issued anywhere <br>  - greatly reduced the number of prompts, outstanding after passing the level <br>  - there are 4 premium levels (and 17 regular, free), each of them can be opened only for $ 1 or 100 coins <br>  - expanded store assortment <br>  - an opportunity to receive coins for watching a video - at the end of each level or at any time in the bank <br>  - Bank prices are halved <br>  - only 3 payments from 5 were left in the bank ($ 1, <s>$ 2</s> , $ 3, <s>$ 5</s> , $ 9) <br><br>  What did it do?  Payments have become more vigorous, but not to say that the situation has changed dramatically - there are 3 times more paying players (due to tightening the screws?), But the average check decreased one and a half times (due to lower prices?), Eventually the average income Since the player has increased by 1.5-2 times (interestingly, the same steps led to the same changes in relative metrics on both iOS and Android).  Still, in absolute values, the indicators are far from the values, the short ones can be considered successful.  But video advertising has shown itself very well - in terms of one player, it brings 3-4 times more money and at the same time nobody complains about it! <br><br><h3>  Graphs, metrics, income </h3><br>  And now what everyone wants to see in such articles, but not always get - live numbers and graphics! <br>  Everything described below is relevant for the game in the category "Quizzes" in the "Russia" region for 2015: <br><br>  <b>In-game payments (for 5 months):</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  iOS </th><th></th><th>  Android </th><th></th></tr><tr><th></th><th>  Before the update </th><th>  After update </th><th>  Before the update </th><th>  After update </th></tr><tr><th>  ARPU (income from the player) </th><td>  $ 0.006 </td><td>  $ 0.009 </td><td>  $ 0.002 </td><td>  $ 0.004 </td></tr><tr><th>  Percentage of people paying </th><td>  0.2% </td><td>  0.6% </td><td>  0.1% </td><td>  0.3% </td></tr><tr><th>  Average check </th><td>  $ 2.52 </td><td>  $ 1.55 </td><td>  $ 1.82 </td><td>  $ 1.29 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of players </td><td>  75.900 </td><td>  17,100 </td><td>  178.500 </td><td>  79.500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Income (excluding commissions) </td><td>  $ 466 </td><td>  $ 150 </td><td>  $ 364 </td><td>  $ 348 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Advertising (for the last month):</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  _____iOS_____ </th><th>  ____Android____ </th></tr><tr><th>  Medium eCPM </th><td>  $ 6.42 </td><td>  $ 2.87 </td></tr><tr><th>  ARPU (income from the player) </th><td>  $ 0.023 </td><td>  $ 0.012 </td></tr><tr><th>  Views per player </th><td>  3.62 </td><td>  4.24 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of players </td><td>  13.000 </td><td>  52.900 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of ad impressions </td><td>  47.000 </td><td>  220.100 </td></tr><tr><td>  Income (excluding commissions) </td><td>  $ 302 </td><td>  $ 632 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Monthly iOS Promotional Metrics:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/853/c45/93e/853c4593e4fa488f85971716e2e1cd6e.png"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Schedule eCPM for platforms on iOS</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce4/78d/82e/ce478d82e78d4129943054995e1d481c.png"></div><br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Number of impressions by platform on iOS</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a38/099/673/a380996738964c8c80682224a35940bc.png"></div><br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">eCPM by country on iOS</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd7/19e/df2/cd719edf2d564ef594e8e52c62821a1d.png"></div><br></div></div><br>  <b>Promotional metrics on Android for the month:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/e35/ccf/5bde35ccf80d4ccaa57f5d3ee87c7c98.png"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">ECPM Chart by Android Platform</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47c/51f/10b/47c51f10b2934e2fa0ac60ffed57ce06.png"></div><br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Number of impressions by platform on Android</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec9/a7c/892/ec9a7c8927b24ba38dc05033a8f55e17.png"></div><br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">eCPM by country on Android</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61c/036/b66/61c036b665234a0dba6d826527920fa5.png"></div><br></div></div><br>  There are also metrics that can be viewed not at all advertising sites: <br><ul><li>  UnityAds: Fill rate - 98% </li><li>  AppLovin: CTR - 4.6% </li><li>  AdColony: Fill rate - 100%, Use rate - 11% </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Future plans? </h3><br>  - Release the paid version of the game <br>  - Port it on Windows Phone <br><br>  I can tell you later whether it was advisable to launch the paid version and whether there is life on the WinPhone Store.  Would it be interesting to anyone? <br><br><h3>  Epilogue </h3><br>  I will summarize some intermediate results, although they rely on experience from just one specific game, so they do not pretend to objectivity: <br>  - players are not willing to pay for what they can get for free (thanks, captain) <br>  - when I asked to pay ‚Äúhow much you don‚Äôt feel sorry‚Äù, there were often negative reviews in the key ‚Äúhow dare you ask for money for the game!‚Äù, After tightening the screws and introducing premium content, such complaints about payments and monetization almost completely disappeared <br>  - rewarded video shows itself perfectly - decent eCPM and no negative from users;  Moreover, the players themselves advised to add advertising with a reward, so they understand this model and accept <br>  - do not be afraid to experiment and monetize your work, the main thing is not to go too far, adequately assess the strengths and weaknesses of the game and understand your players <br><br>  Yes, from the bygone altruism and enthusiasm, there is not a trace left, I came to the standard scheme ‚Äúpayments + advertising‚Äù, but the devil is in the details, as is known.  Firstly, I like the way monetization is now implemented - it is understandable, fair, does not cause rejection of players and earns ‚Äúminimally adequate money‚Äù, let's call it that.  And secondly, at least I tried to follow the ‚Äúnaive path‚Äù and no one would allow me to conduct such experiments on a serious third-party project.  I am glad that I myself went this way and am happy to share my experience with you. <br><br>  And in the end, we develop games not for the sake of money, but to make the players a little happier! .. And the best reward for us are warm reviews from grateful players: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/dfa/9c8/a65dfa9c894044eab51a2cfecf3c8d35.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293822/</a></p>
