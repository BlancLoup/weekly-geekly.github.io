The people conducting the tests are called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.  Much attention is paid to special equipment (recording the user's face, tracking pupil movement), as if testing can only be done in laboratories.  It is not surprising that the price tags for such services are measured in tens and hundreds of thousands.  I already feel like stones, rakes and torches of usability professionals fly into me, but if you are not Amazon, you don‚Äôt need such expenses, despite the justification of high prices through ROI calculations ( <a href="http://www.usabilityfirst.com/about-usability/usability-roi/case-studies/">here</a> , <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/roi-first-study.html">here</a> or just <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dusability%2Broi">Google</a> ).  Almost the same effect can be obtained with a much smaller budget.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How to organize effective usability testing. </h4><br>  Already Comrade Stephen Krug in his book ‚ÄúDo not make me think‚Äù began to promote budget usability tests.  ‚ÄúAt first, such testing was very expensive.  This required a special laboratory with an observation room and a mirror glass and at least two video cameras ... In order to obtain statistically reliable results, it was necessary to involve many test subjects in such testing.  It was a whole science.  The cost of one such test ranged from 20 to 50 thousand dollars. ".  Instead, Circle simply suggests inviting any users and watching how they use the product.  "Take anyone and guess about your entire audience by it ... The usual fee for one-hour testing varies between $ 50 for" average "users and a few hundred dollars for specialists, for example, cardiologists ... Do not forget that even if testing lasts no more than 30 minutes, people usually have to spend about an hour on the road. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Crowdsourcing usability testing </h4><br>  Since the writing of the book, progress has not stood still, and now the same can actually be organized through crowdsourcing usability testing.  The approach that we use on <a href="http://usertest.ru/">usertest.ru</a> is really simple and consists of the following. <ul><li>  A client who wants to conduct usability testing describes the tasks and scenario of behavior. </li><li>  The task is sent to all active user testers. </li><li>  The user who takes the job, executes instructions written by the client.  At the same time there is a recording (screencast) of what is happening on the screen of the tester and his oral comments. </li><li>  The client has the opportunity to ask any questions to the user. </li></ul>  In essence, this process is no different from what is conducted in specially equipped laboratories for usability testing.  Yes, you will not be able to track eye movement and project attention zones onto your interface.  But you will still find those main problem areas that are responsible for 95% of lost profits. <br><br>  Many teams in order to reduce initial costs postpone usability testing at a later stage of the project, when it becomes more or less clear whether the project will take off or not.  In reality, the saving effect on testing is the greater, the earlier it was carried out (more details <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/fast-methods.html">on Nielsen</a> ).  I hope that the ability to carry out budget usability tests will allow more projects to test usability in the early stages.  And this, in turn, will save a lot of human nerves and time. <br><br>  PS By the way, anyone can become a tester here.  To do this, just perform a <a href="http://usertest.ru/becomeatester">trial work</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129114/</a></p>
