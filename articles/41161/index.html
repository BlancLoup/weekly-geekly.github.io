We'll talk about Work &amp; Travel next time.  By the way, these tips will also be useful to anyone who studies in England, Germany, Australia, and so on. <br><br>  <b>Work at the university</b> <br><br>  Almost always, every student can legally work within the university, without any permission.  This is a plus compared to European countries.  The university is usually not greedy, and gives anyone the opportunity to work 20 hours a week.  The standard student rate is approximately $ 7 / hour.  Total not more than $ 560 per month.

      The most common method of work - in the corps of colleges, libraries and dormitories - to sit at the computer and answer questions, keep an eye on the order, or help someone on office matters.  To get to these not dusty jobs, you need to apply in advance.  After all, there are plenty of people willing to sit and stupidly clicking on their favorite sites for 20 hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the first year I did not work because I did not know where to look for this work and where to apply.  And documents are submitted to the administration of various buildings and faculties.  The university‚Äôs CareerCenter center, which helps arrange students during and after school, will also help.  Applications must be sent in advance. <br><br>  I was lucky.  A year and a half ago, I settled in as a ‚Äúwebmaster‚Äù in one organization at the university. I was immediately offered a bid three times the minimum student one, and I agreed.  Six months later, I opened a company in the name of one American woman, and on this (my) company, I hung up the support of the site so that the money would drop, and I could do something else. <br><br>  <b>Work in a dormitory</b> <br><br>  This type of work is very attractive, as it covers all expenses for food and accommodation in the United States, while studying.  It remains only to pay for school. <br><br>  The fact is that every university has a hostel.  On each floor of the dormitories, RA (Residence Assistant) is appointed - responsible for the floor, who keeps order, helps students, organizes events, and so on.  But the downside is that you have to constantly go to all sorts of activities for RA, babysit with students and the most unpleasant thing for me is to regularly knock on everyone and everyone who does something wrong.  Probably why I did not go there :) <br><br>  Applications are accepted six months before work. <br><br>  <b>Work as waiters</b> <br><br>  My flatmate regularly slams away from $ 6 / hour, in a pizzeria, from 11 am to 12 pm without days off, and very much pleased.  The downside is that there are a lot of others who want to, so you need to work well and without fail.  It seems that no one has glowed yet, but if someone hits you, they can send you home. <br><br>  <b>Work in companies</b> <br><br>  International students must obtain permission from the immigration service to work outside the university 20 hours a week during their studies and 40 hours during the holidays.  To do this, you need to learn a year / six months, collect various documents and declare that you are experiencing ‚Äúeconomic hardship‚Äù - that is, economic difficulties.  I have friends who have received permission without any problems.  Write what happened there, a crisis, hostilities or loss of work of parents - the reason for which you receive less money from your parents.  Waiting for 2 months.  If you get permission - then hip-hip-hurray!  Next, send a resume to different local companies and wait for a call. <br><br>  Different skills such as programming, design, accounting or financial knowledge are welcome.  Sit and answer calls, so their American women enough.  So, if you still can not do anything, or do not have special knowledge, except how to be a manager, then it's time to learn.  Right now. <br><br>  <b>Freelancers</b> <br><br>  My favorite item, because you can work as much as you want, with a bet you want.  Each has its own specialization, but I will give you a couple of examples, and you yourself will think how this can be applied to yourself. <br><br>  I learned this cool trick a couple of months ago from my African friend.  The fact is that he taught private French lessons.  When I asked where he found them, he replied that I tried to write to the student newspaper and <a href="http://craigslist.org/">CraigsList</a> - a free message board. <br><br>  I wrote in CraigsList, and now I teach web design, blogging and even Russian every week!  Bill, if you read this post, say hello :) <br><br>  I note that the hourly rate of such private lessons is much higher than the standard student rate. <br><br>  Trading weed, writing diploma to order, working as a stripper at the club, starting a guy and living with his money is also an option, but the author of this blog does not approve and does not recommend these methods of work. <br><br>  I hope I did not forget anything, if you ask questions in the comments - I can write the second part. <br><br>  On the possibilities of working in the US for techies I will dial later, although judging by the fact that we now have a crisis, I think no one is waiting for you here: D </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41161/</a></p>
