      The price for a set is determined by you and it can be any, starting with $ 0.01.  However, some games are only available if you pay above the average amount.  In addition, the money received is distributed as follows: a part goes to the developers, a part is donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Child's Play organizations and another part goes to the Humble Bundle team.  And here you can also indicate to whom and how much to pay.  You can pay using PayPal, Google Wallet, Amazon Payments.  Starting with this release, Bitcoin is also accepted for payment. <br><br>  The toys are cross-platform and ported to all popular operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux.  For Linux, the native version often comes out for the first time. <br><br>  As I said, games do not contain any DRM, do not require any activation, you can download installers as many times as you like.  You can even upload via torrent.  Those who paid at least $ 1, also receive a key to activate the game on Steam.  The latest bundles can also be activated in the Ubuntu Software Center.  In addition to the toys themselves, soundtracks are often included. <br><br>  Shares are quite popular, and sometimes they come across not only indie, but also more serious projects, for example, in the last seventh issue one could get Br√ºtal Legend.  But first, let's see what we have prepared in this issue. <br><br><h4>  Basic set </h4><br>  Frankly, I did not play in the whole game, so I will describe the part briefly enough.  First, consider the games that are available with the purchase of a set for any amount.  And I will start with the one that I liked the most. <br><br><h5>  Little inferno </h5><br>  The game from the creators of World of Goo.  In short, the essence of the game: we have a stove and we burn in it :) You can buy anything, burn several items at once and make all sorts of combos, etc.  Graphics, physics, music and even the plot are attached. <br>  I like it.  Perhaps because I remembered how in childhood I set fire to everything that was possible :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xY1Xt_LMvhE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfC5thZA2Rbv3dhv1dKsu00JEPUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Dear esther </h5><br>  This game interested me in the first place, thanks to the graphics and soundtrack.  Originally started as a mod for Half-Life 2, it grew into a full-fledged game.  Opinions about her vary greatly.  Some even argue that this is not a game at all :) But here everyone decides for himself. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSj9mqaXhBs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiH_HlhmTbIOQ3h25uRQPID9XyKyA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Thomas Was Alone </h5><br>  The game with a minimalist, but with a good design and storyline. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5qS7MT7Uj0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQTbd-543EkqF56r5NQVdNQUWUMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Capsized </h5><br>  2-D platformer, in which our character, dressed in a spacesuit gets on a planet inhabited by very unfriendly creatures. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYPPEZ9czus%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqFy-8dPI29c5ZP0E7utYMZBBGPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Awesomenauts </h5><br>  2-D toy in the style of DotA (MOBA) in a cartoon style.

The first two games were originally, the rest added today.  For those who bought the set before, the added ones will be available regardless of the amount paid. <br><br><h5>  Hotline miami </h5><br>  Fast 2-D shooter, top view.  They kill us with one shot, so I would not call a casual game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5C5QPmUHw2Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPczXKFUqL6sbDyWrSmW6GtOBBCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Proteus </h5><br>  In this game we explore the island.

I recommend to watch the video, it is definitely epic :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZTDv_68QZo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCE1QLVIjj3ySDjv0V2ZkIRXtGjg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  English Country Tune </h5><br>  Puzzle.  More than 100 levels located in 17 worlds. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3nQ2JhH8Hoo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhidyAkREPvzj2E3bm7BrM77D7nHkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Oil rush </h5><br>  Well, the most, in my opinion, I left the tasty last. <br><br>  Many people interested in games for Linux have probably heard about Unigine from Tomsk, which developed the cross-platform engine of the same name and the popular Heaven benchmark based on it.  And on their engine, they made the game Oil Rush. <br><br>  The game is the RTS, in which we fight for the remnants of the most important resource - oil.  The action takes place exclusively in the sea, because  battles have already led to the fact that the water level has risen and the land no longer remains. <br><br>  Since the game is based on the Unigine engine, the order is complete with graphics.  I decided to insert a gameplay video instead of a trailer, since there the graphics are newer.  At the same time the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game process will be more complete. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nie4ystLTkY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiudrjdl41sWfQZcZ_XbKfNwGw5ag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This game has long wanted to see but it was expensive for me to buy it.  So this game was for me an unexpected pleasant bonus.  Moreover, in addition to the game itself and the soundtrack, the Tower Defense Map Pack is also provided. <br><br><h4>  Brief summary </h4><br>  This set of toys, in my opinion, came out very worthy.  Already for the sake of one Oil Rush worth taking. <br><br>  PS: The promotion will last another week. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182174/</a></p>
