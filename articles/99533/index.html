  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first office of the developer: in which city?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First business is like first love.  And the first office is like the first kiss.  And every, well, or almost every novice businessman wants a good office for himself: at least, comfortable, and often pontovy :) And of course, I really want him to be as close as possible to home: ‚Äúwell, now I will not stand in traffic jams! <br>  But, unfortunately, a small business is like a small child.  He must be looked after, he must be fed, and there can be no talk of any ‚ÄúPonts‚Äù in the early stages.  We are important performance, payback and flexibility in making decisions :) Therefore, no matter how much I want the office closer to home, after a brief analysis, I came to the conclusion that the office in Moscow is neither efficient nor flexible, and in terms of payback would have to try. <br>  Therefore, below I will give the results of the analysis on the cost of opening an office in 10 cities of Russia.  The results will be summarized on a specific case: a software firm consisting of 5 developers. <br><br>  Under the cut - hypotheses, numbers and diagrams. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is important: </h4><br>  1. Unfortunately, I am not a McKinsey, so all the results may have a significant error, because  The analysis was carried out on the basis of a not very large sample.  Nevertheless, these results reflect the general trend and can be a significant help in making decisions. <br>  2. Perhaps there are some other parameters that significantly affect the place of opening of the company and which I did not take into account.  Share it!  Expand the results of the analysis. <br>  3. The analysis was carried out "for myself."  But, having decided to share useful information, I painted everything in the form of beautiful (hopefully :)) diagrams.  Therefore, some items are relevant only for Muscovites.

      So, directly analysis.  During the brainstorm ‚Äúwhat is important when opening an office?‚Äù I highlighted the following points: <br>  1) <b>The cost of renting an office</b> .  This item significantly affects the total costs of a start-up company, although it does not bring profit by itself. <br>  2) <b>Ability to find competent developers</b> .  In the absence of infrastructure (technical universities) or with high competition (many developers), this item can be problematic. <br>  3) <b>The average salary of a programmer</b> .  This item of expenditure - a pledge of profit, so you can not save on developers in any case.  But, there are cities where the average s / n is significantly lower than Moscow. <br>  4) <b>Comfort</b> : flights, infrastructure. <br>  Below is more detailed on each item. <br><br><h4>  Office rent. </h4><br>  The range of prices for office rent looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5b/614/cea/f5b614cea942ac781cc8bf91fa24731c.png" alt="image"><br>  The cost of the office is calculated on the basis of 25 square meters.  m, and the cost of the "square" - from the expense of class B. In this case, most likely, the costs will be higher: repairs, utility bills and other "little things" that totally cause irreparable damage to your personal economy.  However, the overall trend is unlikely to change.  Similarly, the situation with the size of the office: in any city, the cost of renting a "square" decreases with an increase in the number of these same squares. <br>  What is important besides cost is the possibility of renting small offices.  Cities in which there are significant problems with small offices (do not believe bulletin boards and extensions, call and check): Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk.  Cities where it is easy to find a small office: Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Kazan, Ufa, Rostov-on-Don. <br><br><h4>  Ability to find competent developers </h4><br>  The first thing that affects the presence of developers in the city - the presence of relevant universities.  Below - statistics in accordance with ucheba.ru. <br>  <b>UPD: In accordance with the reviews of urban residents, a lot of universities are missing:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/262/b69/c72/262b69c7268df25214f913de4339a2fe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For comparison (there is no diagram in order not to spoil the scale): Moscow - 22 and 62, Peter - 5 and 19. <br>  The second thing that can show us the possibility of hiring employees is the ratio of vacancies and resumes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/678/12f/8ac/67812f8acf8f46dd03ecdd914509440a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  How to read this diagram: in Volgograd, there are 4.5 CVs per vacancy, while in Saratov the number of CVs and vacancies is approximately the same (I would like to note that Voronezh and Saratov have one of the most ‚Äúunfavorable‚Äù ratios - while cities, IT education is not developed). <br><br><h4>  average salary </h4><br>  Measure the average salary is similar to measuring the average temperature in the hospital, taking into account the morgue.  It is easy to calculate to find competent specialists for this amount is not worth it.  In general, I am a supporter of overpaying to literate people, and it does not matter who we are talking about: about experienced specialists or promising beginners.  But, to compare costs, you can rely on this information. <br>  The calculation was made on the basis of average salaries in vacancies on hh.ru and superjob.ru: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/706/c30/639/706c30639580086dabbb4d5ff55566ba.png" alt="image"><br>  At the same time, it should be noted that in some cities the number of vacancies on the selected sites is catastrophically small, therefore, the correctness of the results is in doubt: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/503/92e/2b8/50392e2b8994788baf79d2df2e954025.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Comfort </h4><br>  What is important in terms of comfort? <br>  The duration of the flight, because  the work is not done completely remotely, but I don‚Äôt want to spend half my life on the plane as the main character of the film ‚ÄúI would fly to the sky‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a66/542/f71/a66542f71b36387377dbbc2ee0d96e09.png" alt="image"><br>  The number of inhabitants is also some indirect indicator of the level of comfort: the larger the city, the more developed the infrastructure: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e32/b5c/1bd/e32b5c1bd53b7f4996b3377604decf4d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Case: count the cost</b> </h4><br>  So, it's time to calculate the cost.  In no case should not regard this cost as an approximate cost of opening an office!  These are relative values ‚Äã‚Äãthat can help determine the choice - but they certainly will not help to estimate the required costs. <br>  How to calculate: the monthly cost of renting an office + salary for 5 programmers + the cost of 2 air tickets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79f/86f/b2b/79f86fb2b017846e286feebcbe5015fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Findings: <br>  1. Often, an office in Moscow or St. Petersburg is a sign of laziness, because the cost difference is colossal. <br>  2. Cost is an important, but not the only indicator when choosing a city to open an office. <br>  3. All calculations are approximate, superficial, and the like :-) They can be oriented, but cannot be accepted with a 100% guarantee. <br>  4. Personally, I cut off various cities for cost, absence of universities, duration of the flight, a ‚Äúdisadvantageous‚Äù ratio of vacancies and resumes, etc.  I think it is obvious to you which cities remained on the short list.  Most likely, from the TOP-3 I will choose by personal sympathy ;-) <br><br>  Good luck to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99533/</a></p>
