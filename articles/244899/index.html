      In his book, The Strategy of Life, Clayton Christensen talks about his own theory of the ‚Äútasks to be completed.‚Äù  According to this theory, when a consumer (like me or you) buys a product, he does it to perform a specific task or job. <br><br>  The theory says that the seller must present his product in such a way that the consumer can clearly see the ability of the product to perform the necessary task;  then the product will directly meet the needs of the consumer and will be sold even more successfully.  As an example, Christensen cites a fast-food company that sells milkshakes. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe company began with a segmentation of its market both by product (milkshakes) and by demographic features of the consumer (in the seller‚Äôs view of a typical buyer of milkshakes).</i>  <i>Then the marketing department turned to people who hit the target segment on demographic grounds with a request to list the characteristics of an ideal milkshake (thick, liquid, with slices, smooth, fruity, chocolate, and so on).</i>  <i>Future customers gave as honest and accurate answers as they could, and the company responded accordingly.</i>  <i>But alas, sales of the milkshake did not grow. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5f/019/3e2/f5f0193e2e8647cdbaa1992c6562255e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Instead of trying to make the milkshake even tastier, the team of Christensen advised the company to position the product according to the task that it should perform: to make travel more enjoyable.  Milk shake began to crowd out other foods due to its ability to preserve fresh taste for a long time (therefore, it is very convenient to buy it with you on the road).  Sales have increased dramatically after the company introduced the ‚Äúmorning cocktail, which became even thicker (in order to be better preserved during long trips) and tastier (thanks to fruit pieces).‚Äù  When they presented their product in accordance with the task that it had to perform, sales simply took off.  If you are trying to increase sales of your product, make sure that it is in demand in the market, so as not to try to popularize what is <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/7-idej-dlja-zapuska-svoego-dela-o-kotoryh-luchshe-zabyt/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D03-12">no longer relevant</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b64/19b/aa3/b6419baa3f004818afd99c93d2a70c3b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Dutch Boy is an example of another company that has made changes in the positioning of its product in accordance with the task that it must perform. <br><br>  <b>How theory works in practice</b> <br><br>  I firmly believe that a person can benefit from the fact that he will question various aspects of his life.  After I learned about the existence of the above theory more than a year ago, it made me think about a number of aspects of my life, as well as the tasks that they carry out for me.  Ultimately, I think that you yourself should determine which aspects of your life you should think about (and also the decision about whether you should even think about something should belong only to you). <br><br>  Here are some of the reasoning that helped me change some aspects of my life;  I hope they help you too! <br><br>  <b>What kind of task do you need social media for?</b> <br><br>  Only if you are well aware of the task for which you need social media, you will be able to understand whether the actual use of these services coincides with your intentions.  For example, do you use Facebook to stay in touch with your relatives and friends, and eventually you end up looking at photos of attractive girls that you hardly knew for at least an hour or two? <br><br>  That was one of the main reasons why I deleted my Facebook account;  I discovered the following: it is highly doubtful that I use it to perform useful tasks.  Recently, I started a new Facebook account in order to stay in touch with volunteers and vacationers in a camp for children and adolescents affected by cancer.  Now I use Facebook exclusively for this purpose, and kindly reject friendly requests from friends who have nothing to do with this activity. <br><br>  Similarly, I use my Twitter account primarily to maintain and develop new connections around the world with those who are interested in Buddhism and meditation.  Although some of my friends (from real life) follow me on this service (I'm not sure that I understand why some of them do it, because Buddhism and meditation are not in their area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest), I consciously try not to change the subject of my messages. in order to meet their expectations.  After all, I use Twitter to perform other tasks. <br><br>  <b>What are you using your phone for?</b> <br><br>  I use my iPhone to perform a wide range of tasks.  This (in no particular order) is a text messaging and e-mail tool, a video game device, a scheduler, a calendar, the ability to access Twitter and Facebook, a photo / video camera, an MP3 / audiobook player, and also a budget tool. <br><br>  Realizing that I use the phone to perform a wide range of tasks, I chose a better tariff plan and bought a new phone, offsetting the costs with a less expensive tariff plan for the Internet.  After all, I use the phone for a very wide range of tasks, so why not improve this tool? <br><br>  About the next experiment, when Chris used his smartphone just an hour a day, read <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-urokov-kotorye-ya-izvlek-posle-togo-kak-stal-ispolzovat-smartfon-60-minut-v-den/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D03-12">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Why do you need a girlfriend / boyfriend?</b> <br><br>  This question may seem a bit strange: shouldn't you love your soul mate?  Should it be treated as a means to an end? <br><br>  Yes, of course, we all know the right answers, but there is another reason why my friend is in my life.  I know that I do not need it in order to pay rent for an apartment;  she is, first of all, my love.  Understanding this fact allows me to focus on the really important things, and not on those that are not important for our relationship.  Understanding this fact also indicates to me what I should spend my time and attention when it comes to our relationship. <br><br>  Conversely, realizing why she needs me, I discovered that we can develop our relationship even deeper.  Why do you need the second half?  And the family?  And brothers and sisters?  And why do they need you? <br><br>  <b>Why do you go to work?</b> <br><br>  No, the world will not explode if you answer this question.  Do you work only to pay bills?  To help people?  In order to change some situation? <br><br>  Analyzing the tasks and the reasons for which you go to work, you will have to abstract a little to see how it fits into the overall picture of your life.  If you need it in order to receive a salary, then does this job cope with its task?  If you build a career to help people or to change something in the world, does it cope with its task?  Or maybe it is worth finding another job in order for it to start coping with its tasks even better? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244899/</a></p>
