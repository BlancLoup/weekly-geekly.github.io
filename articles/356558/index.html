This email service is one of the most secure in the world.  For example, all information is encrypted on the client side, and all servers of the service are located in Switzerland. <br><br>  In this country it is very difficult, if not impossible, to gain access to private information.  In general, the service can surpass the recently closed Lavabit, which was used by Edward Snowden, which was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/223649/">also written</a> on Habr√©.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  For authorization user uses two-factor authentication, with two passwords.  One password is used to log into your own account, as well as to get your own data in encrypted form.  The second password gives access to the encryption key, with which all information is presented in a readable form.  At the same time, the second password cannot be restored - the support service will not help if the password is lost. <br><br>  There is also the possibility of sending messages that are destroyed after a certain time (although, as far as you can understand, here the recipient must also work with the same service to provide such functionality). <br><br>  So, after opening the service and distributing information about it, the developers received a huge number of people who want to receive the box.  The influx of users was so great that the developers had to close the registration, which was previously open to everyone, and enter invites.  After seeing the popularity of the service, the developers decided to launch a campaign to raise funds for the purchase of additional equipment. <br><br>  One of Habr's users made a contribution, and received an already ready account, about which there is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227575/">corresponding article</a> . <br><br>  So, starting today, users who previously requested an invite began to receive invitations to register their mailbox.  I received such an invite and I, however, immediately received the first bug - when I try to go through the link, the system displays the message ‚ÄúInvalid invite token‚Äù.  A message to the developers about this glitch has already been sent, so we are waiting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/ac4/a29/ec2ac4a292234be6b824af028bc25110.jpg"><br><br>  Nevertheless, I am glad that the service continues to work and develop.  I would like to hope that the registration will soon be open for everyone.  Perhaps this will be done after the service leaves the beta stage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356558/</a></p>
