It all came down to this dialogue: <br><br>  - What are you doing? <br>  - Yes, here ... I shake ... Now I‚Äôm downloading and going to bed ... <br>  - Well, what are you shaking ??

      I remember a deep misunderstanding of what I shake.  How can she explain that it didn‚Äôt matter what to swing, the main thing was to swing something! <br><br>  Useful effect: Mom realized that the computer can work for days, and not light up a blue flame. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The second stage is the introduction to the computer.  It happened through games.  She had two favorite games - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Man">Bomber Man</a> and, of course, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines">Lines</a> . <br><br>  Useful effect: Mom learned to handle the keyboard and mouse perfectly! <br><br>  Then, my work became connected with telecom, and the free and stolen Internet, changed the legal one, which somehow was always in the house.  My mom loves cooking.  Once she heard a recipe on TV, she forgot to write it down and asked me to find it on the net.  I found.  This was the beginning of the beginning.  Further, on all the holidays, she said proudly - ‚ÄúHere, try this salad, it's from the Internet!‚Äù.  That was 10 years ago.  Salad scattered with a bang. <br><br>  Besides cooking, my mother loves the holidays.  Well, you understand - toasts for neighbors, congratulatory speeches, what to celebrate the new year, etc.  Then came the cottage, repair issues, etc.  As a result, I was tired of looking for her information, and I showed her how to work with Opera.  These were the distant 1998-1999 years. <br><br>  As a result, my mom is an Internet addict - she hangs on websites about summer residences and culinary forums until 3 at night.  He orders goods via Internet shops, watches the weather and girlfriends flights.  Rides on a party of flower forums.  The phrase ‚ÄúThis salad from the Internet‚Äù doesn‚Äôt turn everyone around like that, because in the parent‚Äôs house from the Internet almost everything that has appeared lately.  At the same time, that I have an ordinary mother of our country - she hardly sends SMS and can not always find a way out of the deep menus of the TV decoder. <br><br>  Useful effect: she can find everything herself.  I think it is not necessary to explain how this is important in 57 years.  Before, I had to explain something, advise something ... now she will give me a head start on many issues!  For example, my friend, consulted with her, which mixer is better to buy.  I consulted on icq.  By the way, we almost always communicate with her on icq.  Very comfortably. <br><br>  Recently at her home, the Internet did not work.  Two days.  It was a very hard time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46001/</a></p>
