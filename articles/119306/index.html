  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We create and remember a long password in a short period of time.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  I want this Sunday evening to add a chain of articles on creating passwords.  I will not talk about passwords for various sites or services, much more recently, I worry about the master password, long and reliable, so that at least 20 characters.  In this case, as it is not willing to bother with remembering and inventing.  I also strongly disapprove of using part of the password as a hint of what it is used for, I do not like using the template and so on, which reduces security.  Interested only in random.  Such a password is usually created one for a long time, and for someone for a lifetime.  Many had to do the inventing of such things, and many faced two problems: <br><br>  Problem number 1 - come up with. <br>  Usually, when you need to come up with something urgently, often the mind-breaker turns off sharply and the fantasy declares a strike.  And in the case when you need to come up with a secure password, some, including myself, can sit for hours and as a result come to nothing.  As a result, generators come to the rescue, which lead us to the second problem. <br><br>  Problem number 2 - Remember. <br>  Suppose we used the generator and saw the option "JnFayt4j6LfUBLNqsNw7LhuTby".  It is good if the first word that comes to mind is not abusive.  Remember this password can only be a wig, which can take a lot of time, and forgetting such a password during long-term non-use is not difficult.

      In this article, I will propose a method for creating and easily remembering such passwords.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Task: <br>  1. Create a password of decent length. <br>  2. Remember your password. <br>  Conditions: <br>  Keep within 15 minutes (try to meet). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Decision: <br>  1. First of all, let's figure out how long the password is needed.  Usually we are not limited in narrow frames and the number of characters can be quite large.  Have you decided on the length?  Well, we start the generator, because we need the help of the Great Random. <br>  Suppose we decided to stop at a length of 25 characters.  We specify the necessary conditions in the generator - upper and lower case letters, numbers.  Spaces and specials  I do not touch the signs so as not to complicate the article.  If you wish, you can then experiment yourself.  The result should be something like: <br>  M56ZpEiRGVBdCjwR96cdF7SMY <br>  TF25xfBQYCEBifsu8jqYT4izo <br>  torhJFBusKzdPosURgr966xhP <br>  pjwPXKEcHSbdjKdS3fcebfFPC <br>  xb6ghWhmodomaUkH8ZS5Kfec4 <br>  fwRN33FST7VGfR2oGdu7xvG9T <br>  qRKZSZQyUMZUkUqYsck7jfnXz <br>  EHFtPexypPPFthpTCyLGFSFZt <br>  V2cyqYKqUbzqnLE4QMQmRK5hN <br>  All these actions can be laid without straining in 1 minute (unless the generator is loaded for a long time) <br><br>  2. Open the notebook, copy what happened (results 10-15).  Now we need to divide them into blocks of 5 characters to get something like the following: <br>  M56Zp EiRGV BdCjw R96cd F7SMY <br>  TF25x fBQYC EBifs u8jqY T4izo <br>  torhJ FBusK zdPos URgr9 66xhP <br>  pjwPX KECHS bdjKd S3fce bfFPC <br>  xb6gh Whmod omaUk H8ZS5 Kfec4 <br>  fwRN3 3FST7 VGfR2 oGdu7 xvG9T <br>  qRKZS ZQyUM ZUkUq Ysck7 jfnXz <br>  EHFtP exypP PFthp TCyLG FSFZt <br>  V2cyq YKqUb zqnLE 4QMQm RK5hN <br>  Now let's go over each block and write out the ones that are most easily remembered.  I chose the following for myself: <br>  R96cd EBifs T4izo FBusK URgr9 KECHS Whmod omaUk H8ZS5 3FST7 oGdu7 EHFtP 4QMQm <br>  I chose based on readability or associations. <br>  omaUk - ‚ÄúOmauk‚Äù, ‚ÄúOma yu Kay‚Äù is easily remembered by ear <br>  Whmod - the wh mod association <br>  EBifs - no comments <br>  H8ZS5 - just did not seem difficult to memorize <br>  As a result, we spent another 5 minutes (2 to copy and split and 3 to write out the blocks we liked) <br><br>  3. Again we look at what we have written out and decide on which blocks we will stop.  For 25 characters, we need 5 blocks.  With the final choice, we can only avoid a situation in which only blocks without numbers can be left when screening.  I most liked the Whmod H8ZS5 EBifs 3FST7 4QMQm blocks.  It remains the last stage - remember it. <br>  Plus 2 more minutes. <br><br>  4. I‚Äôm pretty sure that while you‚Äôve done the previous steps, you‚Äôve already remembered a couple or three blocks (albeit unregistered so far).  Now it is worth considering in what order to arrange the blocks.  I chose Whmod EBifs 4QMQm 3FST7 H8ZS5 because I was able to pronounce it right off the bat.  Now open another notebook or take a piece of paper and a pen and try to visually recall and write all the blocks case sensitive.  In the previous steps we spent 8 minutes.  I think for the remaining 7 it‚Äôs quite possible to learn a new password, and even write it once 20 for practice. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  We have received a password that satisfies the conditions of the problem, and is also easy and secure.  In part, it remained randomly, since in fact we only swapped parts of the generator result.  Brutefors is tortured to pick up such a password, and our paranoia will be calm until we ourselves give her a reason to worry.  Using this method you can easily remember and much longer password.  The end result depends only on your memory and perseverance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119306/</a></p>
