I am afraid not to have time to find out.  Find out what I never knew before, but I really want to.  It scares me terribly that every day lists with books, articles and other educational and educational content scheduled for perusal are growing like a snowball.  Someone will say: "and you make a little smaller and you will be in time."  But no, this is not procrastination.  With this crappy business, we have already <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18850/">met</a> and know the enemy perfectly in the face.  In this case, he is not a hindrance to us at all.  I just do not have time.  And if all day was 50 hours, not 24, I would not have time too. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  This is all very strange, but in the period of informational ‚Äúoverdose,‚Äù I will experience ‚Äú <i>informational starvation</i> .‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <i>Pocket</i> crashes from links, there are hundreds of notes with useful information in <i>Evernote</i> , and it‚Äôs generally scary to go into the folder ‚Äúread later‚Äù in <i>Bookmate</i> . <br><br>  All these lists and lists are rather strange.  They do not contain everything that, in the opinion of society, the state, and, of course, the educational system, a person should know.  I'm not deeply interested in, at least for now, new discoveries in nuclear physics, chemistry or mathematics.  As long as other people live by the pattern and try to show those around them their knowledge of string theory, I only study what interests me and not someone from the environment. <br><br>  This reassessment of the necessary knowledge is not yet welcomed by society, because with my knowledge I don‚Äôt make impressions of a well-read young man, but, let's say, I have never been useful in my life knowledge in physics and chemistry.  Well, that's fair.  What really helped me and helps every day?  Call it " <i>business skills and not much communication</i> ."  That's where the mechanism really is.  And why did nobody teach me this at school or at university? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2f/c94/29e/f2fc9429ee264b38b33ed36c03a96f3a.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps this phobia (or not a phobia?) Has developed on the wave of my thoughts that self-education will save this country and the world as a whole.  And I save and educate myself at the same time.  But right now, when I go to bed, I am afraid that I may not have time to find out ‚Äúwhy and when the last elephant of the Romanov family was shot‚Äù or something about ‚Äúthe first flight of the‚Äú new Amsterdam ‚Äùliner. <br><br>  I tried not to fill lists with new notes, books, etc., without sorting out past unreads, but this also does not work.  After all, if all this is not preserved, then, according to the spirit of fate, it will become difficult to find all this, and it will simply be forgotten. <br><br><h3>  <b>So what is it?</b> </h3><br>  And what is it with me?  Any new phobia?  A phobia of the 21st century?  But after all, if you think about it, then during a phobia a person is afraid of something and starts to avoid this something.  Just get round.  But I do not go around?  I meet and meet this information with wide open arms. <br><br>  Phobia can be defeated.  And how to beat it?  I understand perfectly, and I don‚Äôt set a goal to learn anything and everything, but I think it‚Äôs unforgivable to miss something important. <br><br>  It seems to me that this, let's call it a phobia, is inherent in IT workers.  So what to do?  Who faced and how to deal with it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294088/</a></p>
