  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Algorithms for the struggle of Ukrainian IT specialists with VAT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ukrainian IT specialists tried to make happy several times with tax breaks: VAT exemption in 2011, sudden, without a declaration of war, VAT refund in the middle of the same year, income tax benefits from 2012, and a muddy procedure for obtaining these benefits. <br><br>  The desire of the authorities to organize and lead the IT industry is understandable: the export of programs alone reached <b>$ 1.4 billion</b> in 2012.  And all this goodies are dispersed in tens of thousands of single core programmers.  That pay the budget at best 5% of income.  Even if they are de facto employees in an IT enterprise. <br><br>  But since programmers, by virtue of their profession, know how to use a calculator and are rather loose, then until 2013 they were relatively calm in the tricks of lawmaking.

      But from January 1, 2013, a number of IT enterprises had a hard time.  They were driven into zutsvang: <br>  - according to section XX of the Tax Code, software supplies have been exempted from VAT; <br>  - letter of tax number 6239/10 / 06-408 dated 02.10.12 ‚Äúclarified‚Äù that this benefit is valid only for registered subjects of the software industry; <br>  - it is almost impossible to register as a subject of the software industry. <br>  In short, even if you pay VAT on the sale of programs, even if you don‚Äôt pay, you cannot avoid serious problems. <br><br>  <b>DO YOU THINK THEY DON'T KNOB OUT?</b>  <b>AND HOW!</b> <br><br>  Having studied the experience of suppliers of mass software of Ukraine, we were delighted with their ingenuity: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Option 1. Almost strictly according to the law.</b> <br>  Firm - supplier of accounting software. <br>  The initial delivery of the program sells without VAT, on the basis of the Tax Code. <br>  Maintenance considers it purely information-technological (well, no matter how the delivery of new software comes in), and therefore with VAT. <br>  Customers lose nothing. <br>  The supplier himself acquires major efforts with a separate account of operations with VAT and excluding VAT, but to the developer of accounting programs and cards in his hands. <br><br>  <b>Option 2. Change the organizational form.</b> <br>  The firm is a developer of a voluntary-compulsory tax reporting program. <br>  The developer simply registered a new non-paying VAT firm and now provides all services without VAT. <br>  For a number of old customers, this leads to an increase in the cost of maintenance by 20%, but where will they go. <br><br>  <b>Option 3. Royalty.</b> <br>  Firm - the supplier of legal systems. <br>  The delivery of systems and their support are treated as royalties (payment for the use of the author's work).  Royalties have always not been subject to VAT, whether it be a rhyme, a painting or a program, therefore such a move forever insures against ‚Äúpokrashchen‚Äù.  The truth will have to pretend that the legal system is a pure program, without a database.  After all, the database does not apply VAT benefits. <br>  For old VAT-paying customers, this again leads to a 20% increase in the cost of maintenance, but you can somehow agree on a piece. <br><br>  <b>Option 4. Eternal action.</b> <br>  The firm is another supplier of legal systems. <br>  Supply systems installed at 0 UAH.  with a minimum period of payment support for six months.  Therefore, 0 UAH.  even with VAT, even without VAT - all the same 0 UAH. <br>  Maintenance is considered to be purely information-technological, and therefore with VAT. <br>  Customers lose nothing. <br><br>  As for the <b>ipLex</b> project, it was originally created by the non-payer of VAT, therefore both we and our clients stayed away from this problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165879/</a></p>
