  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How airlines make life easier for passengers using SMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is hard to imagine a world without air travel, without them neither a successful business, nor a good rest is possible.  But for many people, air travel is an event, even if you have to fly several times a year.  Like any mass phenomenon, flights overgrown with difficulties that cause passengers inconvenience.  Flight delays, tangled airport terminals, lost luggage ... Fortunately, many of these problems can be solved with the help of modern technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/2f6/a47/b212f6a47df249c0b6a66dc475019e9b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most major airlines have their own applications for smartphones, however, frankly, many of them are useless and need one or two times.  For many tasks, an ordinary SMS with a length of up to 160 characters is sufficient.  Why SMS?  SMS is not just a fast and reliable way to communicate.  They are convenient for travelers who are deprived of Internet roaming in other countries and cannot use the application.  There are other moments and places in the world when one cannot rely on the Internet.  And then the good old SMS comes to the rescue. <br><br>  We have compiled a list of basic tasks that can be solved using SMS.  Most of them were implemented in <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru">Infobip</a> for our clients.

    <h3>  Departure Reminder </h3><br>  Sending such a message the day before departure will allow passengers not only not to be mistaken with the date and time, but will also be an incentive to check once again whether they have undergone all the necessary procedures, such as checking in online or buying additional amenities on board.  Given that 95% of text messages are read within five minutes, this method is ideal for reminding you of really important information. <br><br><h3>  Instructions before departure </h3><br>  What you should take to the airport, what is the weather at your destination and what clothes you need to capture - all this information that many travelers will thank you for.  Not everyone has time to check whether the rains started where they fly, or whether they need sunglasses. <br><br><h3>  Flight Delay Information </h3><br>  Aviation is an extremely unpredictable phenomenon, and the punctuality of flight depends on many different factors.  If the weather at the airport of departure is not flying, and the flight is delayed for at least several hours - it is worth notifying the passenger in advance so that he can devote this time to something more useful and interesting than waiting at the airport. <br><br><h3>  Information on transplants </h3><br>  Not all passengers fly direct flights.  Often it is necessary to use docks, and when transferring at large airports it is easy to get lost.  The message sent in advance with the number of the terminal and the gate will help the passenger not to get lost, but to arrive in time for boarding for the next flight. <br><br><h3>  Baggage Information </h3><br>  At huge airport hubs, planes land every few minutes, and they all bring hundreds of passengers with bags and suitcases.  It is not surprising that sometimes in order to get luggage you have to run a whole marathon before you find exactly the merry-go-round on which your bag runs.  To facilitate the task of searching for baggage for a traveler who is tired after the flight, you can send him a message in advance with the number of the baggage carousel and its location. <br><br><h3>  Arrival Airport Information </h3><br>  Where is the metro station, where it is better to take a taxi, or how to find a car rental desk - all this knowledge will help the arriving passenger quickly navigate and move on.  Of course, for small airports such information may be irrelevant, but for huge hubs, between terminals of which are often kilometers away, it is incredibly valuable.  Save your customers time, and they will thank you. <br><br><h3>  Return flight </h3><br>  The day before the return flight, remind passengers how they can get to the airport and what procedures they have to go through.  It does not need a lot of information, just a brief reminder. <br><br><h3>  Bonus: Feedback </h3><br>  Ask the passenger to evaluate your service and ask them to leave a response about the flight.  The collected information will help you to become better by finding weaknesses in your work and increasing its effectiveness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51c/5e3/a8b/51c5e3a8b9054d75b3f551986754bc7a.jpg"><br><br>  The modern world is a world of tremendous speeds.  The days of multi-day travel and many hours of waiting are a thing of the past, and we cannot do without modern communications.  Passengers want to feel your concern for them, and to understand that they will be helped in any situation.  If you take care of them, they will definitely come back again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326374/</a></p>
