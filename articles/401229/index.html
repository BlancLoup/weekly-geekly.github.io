      Our office is decorated creatively and pleases with combinations of colors and materials - this is an inspiring and creative environment in which it is comfortable to communicate and work.  While I am taking a tour, everyone is sitting in their workplaces - they are probably coming up with something new.  Well, until we interfere with my friends, we go further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/833/cee/9a4/833cee9a4b63524e93b439b803f5f68c.jpg"><br><br>  As befits a LEGO office - we have designers everywhere! <br><br>  For example, in negotiation is never boring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b60/a55/92f/b60a5592ffc18f02c1a84fc5eb19990f.jpg"><br><br>  We contribute to the development of education and we strive to enable students to develop their cognitive skills from childhood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ea/632/e21/1ea632e21118d9a8500d4aea2137c23d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe8/f04/bab/fe8f04baba9d87a595ea70bffd969b89.jpg"><br><br>  Go ahead.  In the office of colleagues from LEGO meets almost a meter and a half. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2b/e3e/3ac/a2be3e3acec408f5d21dd4d751945d2d.jpg"></div><br>  Outside the window on the balcony, the dog froze.  Yes, it's cold, you can't argue with her. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/581/cb5/283/581cb528306697dd9dd55190a6781f47.jpg"><br><br>  And in the reception of colleagues from LEGO, which every year a silent visitor has been sitting - he, unlike a dog, is always warm and cozy, and sometimes fun - he always wants to sit next to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e04/834/532/e04834532dd2291de07ac30958f48ce3.jpg"><br><br>  For those who come back from dinner at the wrong time, it is late, it works too carelessly ... well, you understand, we don‚Äôt have such people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f38/089/45b/f3808945b10318045b5164d1bcafd18d.jpg"><br><br>  Many people think that such sculptures are collected by employees of LEGO offices in their free time, but in reality everything is more complicated and simpler at the same time.  All sculptures are designed by a special studio in the Czech Republic, they really consist of exactly the same LEGO elements as any other designer.  The only difference is that inside is a metal frame that helps maintain balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b0/1ac/1ad/6b01ac1adddde3344ed0511039039a51.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac1/246/2be/ac12462be72f94e636900c27c1948bec.png"><br><br>  For example, this sculpture ‚ÄúDeer with a Cub‚Äù consists of 84,442 LEGO parts, each of which is additionally glued.  The design and assembly of this masterpiece took 540 hours (more than 22 days of continuous work). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ba/073/8bc/2ba0738bcbd16ae982c7e22629a0e492.png"><br><br>  Unlike the traditional LEGO series, with which children and young people mostly play, our LEGO Education series, as the name implies, is aimed at learning, even if in a playful way.  Our kits are designed for use in kindergartens, schools, centers of additional education for children and specialized robotics studios. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24c/605/bfe/24c605bfe85b27651ea29fee942134c1.png"><br><br>  The potential of the sets is almost limitless, as is the list of disciplines where they apply. <br>  Studying the law of the world?  No problems!  With the experimental stand (of course, built on the LEGO Education platform), you can not only conduct an experiment, but also check if old Newton was mistaken in his calculations - the program will calculate the acceleration due to free fall or provide all the initial data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/753/a63/d96/753a63d96a41edacaba43eeb0eefab4a.jpg"><br><br>  For lovers of biology, we have a whole elephant in store!  By default, out of the box, he can walk, move his trunk and make funny sounds, but with due diligence he can even be taught to solve sudoku;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/812/65f/b95/81265fb9503a24e0955c9ef477759e76.jpg"><br><br>  GIF: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ef/4ca/739/2ef4ca739fcbec277c3ff35805ea1b6b.gif"><br><br>  Fans of programming will appreciate the robot sorter - he himself determines the color of the cube and puts it in a separate pile. <br><br>  GIF: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d72/c01/4c5/d72c014c5a35b26645a7f4ca428d02bc.gif"><br><br>  Of course, these models from EV3 and I myself are just the tip of the iceberg, and you can collect almost anything from a set.  The flight of students' engineering and fantasy is not limited. <br>  Let me introduce you to colleagues. <br><br>  Director of LEGO Education in Russia and the CIS Olga Lombas.  For the past 15 years, Olga has been working at LEGO Russia in various positions, having gone all the way to the head of the regional department.  Olga sincerely believes that LEGO is the greatest invention of mankind.  In her opinion, children gain invaluable experience of playing and learning, under the guidance of a teacher, working with LEGO Education sets.  In the game, the child receives invaluable life experience of joint activities, emotional communication, creation, which contributes to the development and development of a harmonious personality of the child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b32/26b/698/b3226b6981f25d5ddd2cf5494feefbab.jpg"><br><br>  Yuri Virich - he is engaged in the entire marketing policy of the company, its promotion, conducts master classes.  If you opened a robotics school anywhere in Russia and collaborated with LEGO, then you most likely communicated with Yuri. <br><br>  By the way, Yury is holding an unusual trophy in the photo - with this LEGO-Oscar, the Russian LEGO Education team was awarded for the idea and the holding of the children's contest ‚ÄúWorld painting in LEGO style‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/615/5f3/31b/6155f331b675a26a6e7c893c053228b5.jpg"><br><br>  The results of the competition amazed even the well-worn ‚ÄúLegomans‚Äù - the works of the participants turned out to be so non-trivial and creative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f1/f86/c11/0f1f86c11e167580d5531c9b9b999d6a.jpg"><br><br>  Katya Gudkova is a LEGO Academy certified trainer, she spends more than 50% of her working time on business trips where she brings bright and kind things to the world of regional robotics.  Kate graduated from Moscow State University.  N.E.  Bauman specialty "Applied mechanics."  Do you know many such girls? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/b63/f31/ef5b63f31635aaf53d09f5e76bdaf061.jpg"><br><br>  In our team, Katya is a real lighter that never gets tired and never dies; she will find a common language even with a robot like me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/962/062/ed4/962062ed4a6951b1b536f7597db4cdf5.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, another link of the LEGO Education team is Andrey Lopukhin.  He recently joined our team, and is responsible for the most important part of the work with the interaction with key clients of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a02/138/4ce/a021384cee6f14e991cc79db034b0336.jpg"><br><br>  I closely watched how the friendship of Geektimes and LEGO began.  And it‚Äôs very cool that we have found each other, because who else can find a common language (and not only programming), if not to the robot and the Hiktaim people.  And I would be happy to make friends and meet DYI lovers and leaders of the robotics circles.  Tell us about yourself in the comments, do you use LEGO and what are they, my brothers: gyro-battles, gyro-dinosaurs and the rest?  Waiting for photos, videos, stories and just discharged without communication! <br><br>  And if you missed, here are the highlights of our friendship: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/282180/">The first acquaintance</a> .  We talked about modern children and the challenges of the professions. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/315740/">Discussed issues of</a> vocational guidance for children. <br></li><li>  Solved the problem of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/283244/">how a child to become an engineer</a> . <br></li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/284130/">Arguing about physicists and lyricists</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/284858/">Discussed pressing issues about LEGO.</a> <br></li></ul><br>  And this is just the beginning! <br><br>  And my name is to work.  Bye everyone! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fa/f71/818/6faf71818629e1e3828789dc83f4e13d.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401229/</a></p>
