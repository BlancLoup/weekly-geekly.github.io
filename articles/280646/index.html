      The interface of the final program is simple: <br><ol><li>  the user enters a message in Russian; </li><li>  The program produces an acrotext.  (This is the text, the first letters of each word which you can collect the original message). </li></ol><br><br>  For example, the query " <b>Hi Habr</b> !"  The program wrote the text: "To solve this, <b>and to</b> add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem is <b>well</b> worth it."  The program does not place punctuation marks yet - this is done by the user at his own discretion. <br><br>  Certainly far from naitive Russian, but for a just4fun project written on my knee in a couple of evenings, I think will fit ... <br><br>  The algorithm is trained in <s>countless</s> novels by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%25D1%258F">Darya Dontsova</a> .

That's it! <br><br>  Poetry has left us many similar examples.  To whom this topic is interesting, then we advise you to read the articles of <b>Ivan Chudasov</b> <br>  " <a href="http://rifma.com.ru/Chudasov.htm">From acrostic to acroconstruction</a> " and " <a href="http://rifma.com.ru/Chudasov-2.htm">From acrostic to acrodesign (continued)</a> ".  In my opinion, these are the best articles on this topic: on the one hand, accessible to the general public, on the other hand - not vulgar. <br><br>  The question arises, how to create such texts? <br><br>  In fact, there are three classes of methods. <br><ol><li>  <b>Create text yourself.</b>  This is exactly what the poets did by johann Heidenberg Trithemius. </li><li>  <b>Create text programmatically.</b>  For example the algorithm <b>DANTSOVA</b> </li><li>  <b>Combine the software method and the creativity of the operator</b> .  In my opinion this is the most interesting thing you can think of.  The program creates a certain number of variants of various words, then a person selects the most semantically appropriate word from the list, then the program creates another word ... And so on, until you get a single whole text </li></ol><br><br><h1>  Principles of the algorithm DANTSOVA </h1><br><br>  Who is too lazy to read the mat.part can go directly to the chapter <b>"Sources &amp; Examples"</b> . <br>  For the rest I tell. <br><br>  There are many different theories, as a set of letters, spaces and punctuation turn into meaningful text.  To create a really good algorithm, you need to devote your whole life to this task, as I think. <br><br>  I was wondering if there are any extremely simple ideas that could be implemented in a simple and uncomplicated program.  The goal of the <b>DANTSOVA</b> algorithm <b>is to</b> show that the task of artificially constructing acrotexts is not an impossible task. <br><br>  The <b>DANTSOVA</b> algorithm <b>is</b> based on several very clear ideas. <br>  Of course by adding more rules in the generation of the text you can get a better result, <br>  however, in <b>DANTSOVA</b> we will limit ourselves to only four points - ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Thought 1. The word depends on the past word. </h2><br><br>  After the word " <i>tasty</i> " to see the word " <i>milk</i> " is quite expected. <br>  But after the word " <i>tasty</i> " you can hardly see the word " <i>synchrophasotron</i> ". <br>  First, synchrophasotrons do not eat;  secondly, the words are not coordinated: the <i>‚Äúsynchrophasotron‚Äù is</i> masculine, and the word ‚Äú <i>tasty</i> ‚Äù is average. <br><br>  Of course, the word depends not only on the previous, but also on the previous one, etc. <br>  However, I did not take this into account because of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">curse of dimension</a> . <br><br>  Thus, you need to take a lot of text and look at pairs: ‚Äúthe word is the next word‚Äù. <br>  After it is necessary to create a structure of the form: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  word </td><td>  next word </td><td>  weight </td></tr><tr><td>  word </td><td>  next word </td><td>  weight </td></tr><tr><td>  ... </td><td>  ... </td><td>  ... </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  weight is set simply - how many times after the " <i>word</i> " was the " <i>next word</i> "? <br>  For example Daria Dontsova (see the file <b>dantsova.d0.plf</b> <a href="https://github.com/PavelMSTU/DANTSOVA/tree/master/platform_build">in the source</a> ) <br>  for her rich career after the word " <i>armed</i> " she used the word " <i>bouquet</i> " three times! <br>  And after the word " <i>seduce</i> " the word " <i>sexterrorist</i> " occurs only once. <br><br>  This label will be called the <b>platform</b> . <br><br>  It is obvious that different <i>platforms</i> are built on different <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2581_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">text boxes</a> . <br><br><h2>  Thought 2. The platform must be built on the corpus of texts of one author </h2><br><br>  The essence of this idea is that the text should be ‚Äúof the same type‚Äù. <br>  The corps consisting of an article about Valeriy Kharlamov, the Falkland War and the work of Richard Bach is not suitable for us ... <br>  These are completely different types of texts. <br><br>  Also, the texts of various authors have such a thing, which philologists call <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">idiolect</a> . <br>  Speaking Russian is a personal dialect.  Those.  the method of speaking and writing is peculiar to you. <br><br>  Those.  purely by experience, I found that the <i>body of the text of</i> one author should be taken. <br>  Otherwise, it turns out a perfect crap, no different from the random. <br><br><h2>  Thought 3. The larger the body the better </h2><br><br>  This is an obvious thought.  Therefore, the author, who should be taken should be very prolific (not from a qualitative, but from a quantitative point of view). <br><br>  For example, Peter Ershov does not fit, as he wrote only one fairy tale: The Humpbacked Horse. <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">The tale about Fedot Strelets</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Leonid Filatov</a> is also not an option. <br><br><h2>  Thought 4. The more primitive the quality of the text, the better </h2><br><br>  The richer and more interesting the author, the more varied his speech. <br>  We do not need such authors. <br>  For example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Joseph Aleksandrovich Brodsky</a> wrote more poems than Pushkin. <br>  But the platform on the body of Brodsky‚Äôs poetry does not work out very ... <br><br><h2>  Total. </h2><br><br>  So, we need an author with a primitive speech, who wrote many, many meaningful texts of one subject. <br>  What is the most primitive in speech?  That's right: detective novels for girls from fifty and the transfer of "Let them yell" with Andrei Malakhov.  Since the subtitles "Let them yell," I did not find, I limited myself to detective novels. <br><br>  So <a href="http://www.dontsova.ru/">Daria Dontsova</a> turned out to be the method of exclusion by this prolific author (by the way, her real name is Agripina Arkadyevna)! <br><br>  Now it remains to make a very simple generation algorithm. <br>  After each word, you should choose a word starting with the desired letter <b><u>and</u></b> with the maximum weight. <br>  That's the whole algorithm. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Boring nuance</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> The algorithm has a parameter <b>with</b> . <br>  This is a <i>custom</i> system <i>parameter</i> . <br>  It shows the desired number of words in the sentence. <br><br>  The algorithm puts a dot after the word <b>A</b> and writes the next letter <b>X</b> , regardless of <b>A,</b> in two cases: <br><ol><li>  when there is no word <b>B</b> starting at <b>X</b> with more weight. </li><li>  when sentence length is greater than <b>c</b> </li></ol><br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Boring nuance number 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There is a case when after the words <b>A1</b> and <b>A2</b> it is impossible to pick up the words <b>A3</b> ... It simply does not exist. <br>  In this case, we either terminate the sentence (parameter <b>c</b> ), or go back a step, <br>  Replace <b>A2</b> with some <b>A2 *</b> , the weight of which is in second place, and after <b>A2 *</b> we look for <b>A3</b> . <br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Sources &amp; Examples </h1><br><br>  A few examples. <br>  It is clear that this is far from practical application, but it is not at all random! .. <br>  Certain semantics slips ... <br><table><caption>  Algorithm DANTSOVA in action </caption><tbody><tr><th>  message </th><th>  acroconstruction </th></tr><tr><td>  Glory to the fatherland of our free brotherly nations century union </td><td>  Now it's better, but aside, I find it very difficult to go through it with you.

<br><br>  And very easy! <br>  First, you can choose not the first letter, but an arbitrary, deterministically determined key. <br>  Secondly, it is possible for each letter (or word, or sequence of words) to associate a certain sequence of bits. <br>  This can be done using <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/272935/">hash steganography</a> . <br><br>  In short - there are many different ideas for the realization of the most perverted and cunning steganographic fantasies! <br><br>  And it will be security, but not clearly, like the <b>DANTSOVA</b> algorithm. <br><br><h1>  FAQ </h1><br>  <i>Foreseeing three questions, proactively answer them</i> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why is the algorithm called dAntsova, and not dOntsova?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There are several points of view on such a heartbreaking question. <br>  Some say that it was done on purpose, they say if Agripina Arkadyevna (simply Daria) is trying to sue, <s>which she has already done with rutracker,</s> the author will declare that it is not named after her, because the surname is different. <br>  But there is another point of view, according to which changing the letter O to A is a special steganographic transfer of the secret message. <br>  However, skeptics say that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pavelmstu/" class="user_link">PavelMSTU</a> just needs to sleep more and work less, then there will be no problems with spelling. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why do we sprinkle in the first letter, because this is not security?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The purpose of the topic and the algorithm itself is not in security, but in <b>clarity</b> . <br>  The author wanted to show that by writing three * .py files on my lap and accumulating a large amount of the text of one author, one can achieve a certain result. <br>  And without any deep learning and dozens of person-years of any research institute ... <br>  Of course, for practical use, you should come up with an intermediate encoding, as described in the article. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">PavelMSTU, why did you not take into account the cases, gender, number?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">And anyway, where is it &lt;s&gt; t &lt;/ s&gt; ron nets and dip  r√∂rning?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  While the goal was to make the most simple design.  This is the next step. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Your question is not in the FAQ?</b>  <b>- ask it in the comments!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280646/</a></p>
