After the demonstration, he put his arm around us and said: ‚ÄúNonsense is all.  Computer can not be personal.  Personal can be cottage, car, pension.  Do you know what a computer is?  This is 100-200 sq.m.  premises, 30 service personnel 20 kW of consumption and of course 30 liters of alcohol every month to wipe the contacts! ‚ÄùAnd it was absolutely right!  That is why personal computers have played a significant role in the sobering up of society ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/f0c/642/b9df0c64256e49fda13271ecdfaeb031.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dd/c7d/6aa/7ddc7d6aa440435baa81c5f1f36724c5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Lada you are my, Lada</b> <br><br>  Agafonov Konstantin Vasilyevich.  Director of Lianozovo Electromechanical Plant (LEMP, Moscow).  Year in 1985-86, my colleagues and I came to the factory and brought with us a prototype of the Mikrosh computer.  In the director's office, they connected to his TV, demonstrated the possibilities, discussed.  Here, the chief engineer who was present at the meeting, quietly whispers in Agafonov‚Äôs ear - they say they have only 3-4 programs for this computer.  Agafonov thought for only a second and suddenly asked the chief engineer: ‚ÄúDoes the people buy Lada?‚Äù.  He replies: "Of course, the line is huge."  Agafonov: ‚ÄúAnd at least one asked for a purchase - Is there gasoline?  So personal computers will be bought. ‚Äù  In 1987, the first batch of Mikrosh appeared in the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/753/0a0/2be/7530a02be4d4407f8c89337be2a53344.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/218/f83/1a7/218f831a72e74139a0a15a0ec9af7659.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/959/b14/517/959b1451744141f5aaee29fcb522535b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Art and big science</b> <br><br>  In 1984 (or 85?), An exhibition was held in the government building, something like ‚ÄúYoung scientists to the national economy‚Äù.  We showed the personal computer of our development (prototype Radio-86RK).  One day I was on duty at the stand.  I turned away from the hall and, using a samopisny graphic editor, drew on the screen, with an amazing resolution of 128x64 pixels, all sorts of nonsense.  I drew a certain face ... Something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26b/a45/252/26ba4525217646538bccab07c99c9c9f.jpg"><br><br>  I hear movement behind me, wheezing, shuffling my feet.  I turn around - a whole delegation headed by the president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da4/9ff/5b8/da49ff5b8240453c885345afa41f1b85.jpg"><br><br>  He says: ‚ÄúDid you draw me?  Looks like. "  I, of course, make excuses, they say an accident.  Accompanying look at me with squinting ... Alexandrov says: "And what is this thing about you?".  I explain that this is a PC.  He says: "What can you use at home?"  I confirm.  The next day, the rector of our institute with Zelenko G.V.  brought him home a copy. <br><br>  <b>Boomerang sometimes returns</b> <br><br>  In 1981, managed to put on the Micro-80 operating system SR / M.  Unknown ways (the Internet was not there) came to us toy Ladder.  Stones are falling, but you need to run up the stairs to the finish line (everything is drawn with ASCII characters).  Passing all the levels began to make their own.  Recently stumbled upon Ladder, rewritten in Java.  I was very surprised to find my levels (initials SNP) in him, which I kind of did only for my own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07c/706/472/07c7064720e44904a65cb9db05a71022.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Child cruelty</b> <br><br>  Once, a long time ago, did a character generator for the Micro-80.  In the ASCII code table, the first 32 characters are not displayable - command codes.  I used them for small drawings - for example, an airplane.  2 young people came to work with us, while students were still, (Yura Ozerov and Dima Gorshkov).  They tortured me for a long time, what kind of character in 1 picture?  He confessed - my initials - "Cn."  Immediately, Dima and Yura wrote a program in which small planes mercilessly bombed poor "Sp". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97a/a20/6cf/97aa206cfb84444697da6661be6ddf32.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bc/f25/abf/9bcf25abfc56487894916758fb27da59.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Microprocessors and life</b> <br><br>  The bell rings in the apartment.  I open the door.  Immediately in the doorway, an impressive suitcase looks through.  Behind the suitcase is its owner, an intelligent-looking man.  I look at him in amazement and wait for clarification.  The first phrase - "I divorced my wife."  His words, a suitcase, made me mentally continue - ‚ÄúI will live with you!‚Äù.  But then followed the explanation, which put everything in its place.  He explained that the wife does not allow him to see the child unless he provides the child with a computer. <br>  The man, in my opinion, accomplished the feat.  Being a man far from these questions, a biologist by education, read the description of PK86, got the accessories, soldered.  It all worked!  But problems with recording and reading from a tape recorder. <br>  And now a suitcase opens - there is a RK, a tape recorder, a compact TV.  We settled down with me.  RK is working, the tape recorder is brand new, it reproduces everything, even to Pugachev ... After making sure that RK is all right, I suggested that he should take this ‚ÄúElectronics‚Äù apart, honestly warning that he would lose the guarantee. <br>  Disassembled.  At least one posting for solitude was soldered to the line-out connector inside the tape recorder.  Soldered, order.  For the first time it helped.  She, the ex-wife, thought that she had set a completely impossible task for him - it was not there!  Then he called me, said that the "old woman" now demands something completely insane ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392923/</a></p>
