  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to run Service Desk out of the box?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ITIL <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itarena/blog/223581/">[1]</a> is a library of books in which various ‚Äúgood‚Äù IT Service Management practices are described in detail and comprehensively.  The ITIL books have different authors, the processes and recommendations described in them have not been coordinated with each other, so the favorite thesis of ITIL specialists - ITIL cannot be implemented, only adapted.  The logical conclusion of this is that the ITSM solution cannot be obtained from the box. <br><br>  Before you start the Service Desk and get the first tickets, you first have to get an ITIL certificate, undergo training on the selected ITSM product, invite consultants, spend several months and several million rubles on a project.  There are, of course, free solutions that you can customize yourself, but in the process of tuning you will have to break your head pretty badly.  Not the best approach, especially for a small IT service with a limited budget and resources. <br><br>  The initial thesis about the need to adapt is in itself correct.  Of course, it will take several years to detect and automate several dozen processes described in ITIL.  However, if the company did not encounter ITIL and ITSM at all, then it simply doesn‚Äôt have much of these processes or any need for them.

      In reality, where do all start the introduction of Service Desk?  With incident management or if it is easier to place tickets.  Frankly, not the most difficult process - the application arrived opened the ticket.  Completed the request - closed the ticket.  At this stage of automation, it is not necessary to delve into the theoretical complexities and features of the system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b0/83d/54b/9b083d54bbe3b39f02a00bf159d8f196.jpg"><br><br>  In ITSM 365 we chose this path.  <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/">ITSM 365</a> is a cloud-based Service Desk solution for companies of any level.  In the cloud, you do not need to install a solution, so after a few minutes after registration you can already create the first ticket. <br><br>  In ITSM 365, we offer boxed pre-tuning, which generally takes into account the ITIL requirements described in the best practices.  As a result, in a few minutes the solution may begin to use, both those who are already familiar with ITIL, at least at the level of basic processes, and those who do not know how it all works and how it should work. <br><br>  Naturally, these presets are not a dogma, and they are not hardcoded into the system so strictly as to follow them.  However, thanks to them, on the second day of work, you can get results that can be described in terms of the ITSM approach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a7/1ae/ec6/0a71aeec657469ac1e98199d9cf118b4.png"><br><br>  <strong>When does the task of automating IT service arise?</strong> <br><br>  When a typical company thinks about IT service automation.  For 1-5 IT staff, the Service Desk system is generally not needed.  In such a team, the manager can always personally monitor the work of the employee, in extreme cases, use e-mail.  For accounting and reporting is enough plates in Excel.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIT automation is not understood by the business leadership of such companies.  In the IT budget of such a company, there is little money and the management does not see any reason to pay even 5,000 rubles a month. <br><br>  As the IT team grows, the complexity of employee interaction increases, as well as the size of the company that has to be serviced.  As a result, when in a team of 20-25 IT people and more, then it becomes difficult to do without Service Desk solutions, and with certain requirements on the part of management, it is impossible.  Here you can select individual employees for the ITSM project.  Most traditional ITSMs on the market rely on such IT services. <br><br>  Becoming participants in several events and actively communicating with colleagues from the IT departments of different companies, we heard from time to time that there is no ready and expensive solution for companies with IT teams of 10-25 people in the market.  It remained to use foreign solutions, to which there were many complaints: from the complexity of setting up to incorrect localization and small possibilities.  In companies with such a scale, the IT departments of user requests are already becoming quite numerous; roles in a team are also most often distributed by specialization, but the organization of the IT service remains at about the same level as a small company.  The company still doesn‚Äôt have much money in the budget for automation, but the business is already beginning to express dissatisfaction with the quality of service, demand compliance with deadlines and KPI compliance.  This is where ITSM 365 is suitable - IT can quickly and without allocating a large budget get the effect of automation, take as many processes as it needs at this stage and at the same time there will be a good basis for further growth. <br><br>  The solution can scale to service large companies with thousands of users.  And the solution can be scaled as the company grows, without the cost of migration.  As a result, ITSM 365 is a product that you can start using in a few minutes and use it for many years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cb/fe1/bbc/5cbfe1bbcf2ee8e8e92a0cfa99419b23.jpg"><br>  <strong>Where is the "adaptation" of</strong> <strong>ITIL</strong> <strong>?</strong> <br><br>  When you start to implement the Service Desk from scratch, regardless of the chosen platform, you will get to complex processes in a few months or even in a few years.  In <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/">ITSM 365</a> you can start the first tickets within a few minutes after registration. <br><br>  If you really want to use the system, then you will need to ‚Äúadapt‚Äù the solution to your company: <br><ul><li>  Fill the organizational structure. </li><li>  Lead users - the names and surnames of employees of different companies will definitely be different. </li><li>  Transfer rights to users. </li><li>  Start a service. </li><li>  Configure SLA rules.  We offer our own template corresponding to the ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù, but, for example, not all companies will be able to close an incident of 30 minutes. </li></ul><br>  These are the first steps that allow you to understand the basic principles of ITSM, why it is needed and whether your company needs it.  In our experience, the first two weeks are spent trying to manage incident management in practice, testing the operation of alerts, integrating with a list of users on an LDAP server and other data sources, etc. <br><br>  Naturally, the deeper the company penetrates the ITSM approach, the more likely it is that it will require customization and adjustment of the system to the specific requirements of the business.  All this is in <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/">ITSM 365</a> on Standard and Enterprise tariffs. <br><br>  However, starting an acquaintance with ITSM and learning to work in this approach is much nicer in a system that itself suggests what to do and already offers answers that are in line with best practices and are suitable for a large number of companies.  As a result, the launch of the ITSM solution passes: <br><ul><li>  As simple as possible and convenient, without long hours of proceedings in the features of solution customization that are insignificant at this stage. </li><li>  The logic of filling all the data is initially sewn into the system. </li><li>  Without the involvement of a specialist in the system or ITIL.  If necessary, you can master the whole theory later. </li></ul><br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itarena/blog/223581/">[1] The</a> registered trademark of the UK Office of Government Commerce (OGC). <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223581/</a></p>
