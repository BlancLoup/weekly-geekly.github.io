      It seems to me that almost all freelancers have come across such situations, over more than 3 years of experience in my freelancing life, I have also had such cases.  And I got into such plugs and as a performer, and as a customer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Breaking deadlines.</b> <br>  Breaking deadlines can be for several reasons, this is also an incorrect estimate of deadlines, laziness, a broken computer, and third parties (subcontractors). <br><br>  Most of the freelancers with whom I spoke, usually in such situations, first feed breakfast and then hide at all (do not pick up the phone, do not respond to letters), or justify with the phrases ‚ÄúI got sick‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am in the hospital‚Äù, ‚Äúbroke computer ‚Äùand so on.  I will not hide it, I just once, at the beginning of my freelancing life, also resorted to this scenario.  But I immediately found this way dead-end and dishonest, in relation to the buyer of my services.  Yes, and such games - firstly, they beat their reputation very strongly, and secondly, your wallet will be empty. <br><br>  <b>How to behave in such a situation?</b> <br>  a) Always pick up the phone and not hide from the client or in any circumstances.  Yes, the client may be unhappy, it will affect your nerve endings, but you deserve it.  And it needs to be understood. <br><br>  b) Do not feed breakfast, and say the actual period for which you finish the work, it will allow the client to build at least some plans.  And do not forget that your customer may also be a performer in front of third parties and he also needs to carry the answer to the client. <br><br>  c) punish yourself.  If the client is very dissatisfied, then do not just make excuses and invent excuses.  And offer him the option to finish the work with a small discount and in new skroki (and try to keep within them).  Firstly, this will encourage you in the future not to bring to such a situation, secondly, you will most likely maintain normal relations with the client and in the future, he will return to you. <br><br>  <b>Inability to complete an order.</b> <br>  Here, as a rule, there are two options, or any circumstances (for example, a real illness), do not allow to fulfill the order, or you could not start to fulfill the order (this is not understandable to mine, if you do not take laziness into account), there are such cases that you how they cannot start doing this work (although you sit down and do other orders with pleasure), the project simply does not go, so to speak, an allergy to this order.  (I had a couple of such projects, out of more than a hundred completed). <br><br>  In these cases, freelancers (at least with whom I spoke), as a rule, begin again to feed breakfast and hide.  Although they are well aware that they will never fulfill this project. <br><br>  What better way to do in this case? <br><br>  a) Hire a subcontractor.  This is a very simple move, but why few people resort to it.  Hire your friend, colleague, find another artist who will do the work for you.  Yes, you will not earn money on it, but you have taken up the order - carry it out by any means.  This will firstly help to maintain a relationship with your customer, and secondly, you save a lot of nerve and preserve your reputation. <br><br>  b) If there is still no one to transfer the work, and you know that you definitely do not complete the order.  Then call the customer, tell him directly about it and return all the money he paid you for this order.  This will save your nerves and you, and your client will be able to transfer the order to others and not waste time searching for a contact with you and will not lose money, remember that the work that your customer has entrusted to you may be an important step in his business, without which he can not move on. <br><br>  PS It would seem that simple and obvious things have been written, but for some reason many, many freelancers do not understand this and behave inappropriately.  Stick to these simple ideas, and you will notice how your nerve cells begin to recover, and your wallet will only get fat ;-) <br><br>  PSS I will be glad in the comments to hear your experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48818/</a></p>
