  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I'll get there</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - Yes, honey, I love you too. <br>  Fingers automatically press a hotkey to send a message.  I rub tired eyes in which an unknown evil wizard poured sand.  For almost a day without sleep, you need to allocate yourself 4 hours.  This is my cycle.  Five, six, seven o'clock is suicide for me, I will get up tired, dissatisfied, and therefore ineffective.  The next figure is eight, but that‚Äôs too much.  So only 4 hours of sleep. <br>  The progress bar, twitching, as if in convulsions, crawled to the right border, ran into it and disappeared. <br>  I usually climb into the message log.  Deviations, like, no.  Four layers of encryption, for how many ... for somewhere thirty characters.  It will be necessary before the end of the week to finish the script analyzer, and then manually browse ... nonsense. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And who needs me, to be honest?  Who are interested in my baby talkers with a girl, pictures from a graphic hub, which I collect manically on hard, or comments on another article? <br>  No one.  Only me. <br>  Fingers switch windows, folding communication channels. <br>  Here, people live, do not bother.  They discuss buffoons, who, for some reason, are called stars, on social networks, share their secrets.  Who is sleeping with whom, who bought or sold for how much, where to grease, and even more interesting.  An ordinary life like this, with glossy screens, smooth skin, a fake smile, with its own little schizophrenic-like filth and meanness. <br>  They live and do not hide anything.  Because they do not want anything, I guess.  Or can not? <br>  I get up from my chair, take a couple of steps, and sit down on the bed.  Undress lazy, although it would be necessary.  To wash too, it will help to have a better rest.  But we must go to the shower.  We must pull off clothes.  It is necessary to include water.  Well, that bed dismantled. <br>  No, you can't do this anymore, you need to rest.  Here only I will add the project and I will drop a week. <br>  I watch the screens slow down the brightness.  The colon of the clock flashes in the black rectangle of the minimalist interface.  Just below the frozen alarm time. <br>  And most of all I need is coming out? <br>  It turns out yes, it is necessary.  Although my secrets are as simple as the rest of the world's population. <br>  Eyes close themselves, blocking the most informational channel.  I listen to the noise of the big city outside the window.  Hundreds of tires rustle along the still warm summer asphalt, warm dry air rises, a light breeze passes through the trees in the park like a comb. <br>  If at such a moment a little bit turn on the fantasy, then the world changes.  And instead of ground vehicles outside the window, I hear airborne aircraft.  On antigrav so most pleasant.  A little in the distance, in perspective, glowing snow-white towers of research complexes rise.  Somewhere, instead of a plane taking off, a beautiful interplanetary cruiser rises in the sky, taking thousands of people to other star systems. <br>  Here it is, my world.  Reasonable, kind, bright.  Free, sincere, clean.  Long awaited. <br>  I wonder how many people dream about the same?  How is Black Coffee?  Is it only for me alone that the Milky Way burns in the night?  After all, there must be someone ... <br>  I want to be there, but, for some reason, I wake up each time in reality, which is increasingly slipping into a stinking cyberpunk, where the ball is ruled by money, where you need to encrypt your messages, not because you are a criminal, but only to I did not read someone third.  And not to sell to someone fourth.  Where it is necessary to hide, to be able to exchange information, which suddenly becomes forbidden, even if it is contrary to common sense. <br>  Here, in general, very much contrary to common sense. <br>  I‚Äôm standing up, I‚Äôll add a module that will enable my users to share information without fear that someone will read it.  Without backdoors, without saving, without logs.  Without the ability to decipher.  Otherwise - it is impossible. <br>  I want to be free.  I want <i>my</i> bright future.  Cyberpunk let it remain in the books. <br>  All sleep. <br>  I'll get there.  Until <i>my</i> future.  I do not know how yet.  But be sure to go. </div>
