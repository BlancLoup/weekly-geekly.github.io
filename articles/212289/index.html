  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile applications in which users earn</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Disclaimer </h4><br>  In the mobile industry, there are a sufficient number of applications in which users can earn real money by performing certain actions.  In this post I talked about all the examples of such applications known to me, and if I missed some attention, write in the comments, I will try to gather information on them to add to the post. <br><br><h4>  ReadMe carefully, not as usual </h4><br>  Objectives of this post: <br><ul><li>  overview of this category of applications (mobile motivators, apps for earning money on a smartphone - as you wish); </li><li>  identification of industries and applications in which they are most successful. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After reading this post: <br><ul><li>  Developers (mobile applications in this category) will be able to explore the experience of their colleagues in order to develop useful applications based on business models that are effective for both advertisers and end users. </li><li>  End users will be able to draw conclusions about which applications deserve their trust and participation in which projects will be able to bring them a guaranteed income with the least time and effort. </li></ul><br>  If you know how to improve my post - write in the comments. <br><br><h4>  Limited offer </h4><br>  Remember that the earning potential for end users is usually used by application developers as a temporary measure of the promotion of the applications themselves and / or the brands involved in it. <br>  Locket became popular due to the fact that users showed advertisements on a closed (black) screen, paying for it 1 cent.  In an hour, you could earn no more than 3 cents, i.e.  per day - no more than 72 cents.  Locket also encouraged the luring of other users, paying $ 1 for each new connoisseur of Malevich‚Äôs creativity; of course, there were no invitations limits.  Approximately in half a year (I can be mistaken) this shop was closed, then a quote from the application page in Google Play: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúLocket no longer pays to swipe ads.  We're focused on your personalized content.  Please read our blog for more information. ‚Äù </blockquote>

    <h4>  Mobile applications for quick money on a smartphone on the example of ‚ÄúTapporo (Make Money)‚Äù </h4><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAfter paying more than $ 500,000 on the Web - we go Mobile!‚Äù </blockquote>  - this phrase begins the description of the application on Google Play.  The list of partners inspires confidence: Google, Amazon, PayPal, Facebook, Minecraft, Hulu and others.  Here you need not just to watch ads, the task may be to install a specific game with adding feedback to its page in the store, or maybe watching a video on YouTube.  For inviting a friend, you can earn up to $ 0.6. <br>  There are many other applications that repeat the essence of the 2 previous ones: you get paid for viewing advertising, installing an application, writing comments, etc.  Below is a simple table with a rating and the number of installations; it does not make sense to describe each separately. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Mobile app </td><td>  Google Play rating <br>  (with rating less than 4 did not add) </td><td>  Number of installations <br>  (from more popular to less) </td></tr><tr><td>  AppTrailers </td><td>  4.0 </td><td>  1,000,000 - 5,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  CheckPoints </td><td>  4.2 </td><td>  500,000 - 1,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Appnana </td><td>  4.2 </td><td>  500,000 - 1,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  WHAFF Rewards </td><td>  4.5 </td><td>  100,000 - 500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Get Paid to Play! </td><td>  4.4 </td><td>  100,000 - 500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Appli Priv√©e </td><td>  4.2 </td><td>  100,000 - 500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  AppRedeem </td><td>  4.1 </td><td>  100,000 - 500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Mintcoins </td><td>  4.4 </td><td>  50,000 - 100,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Earn money </td><td>  4.3 </td><td>  50,000 - 100,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Funny Quotes Free </td><td>  4.2 </td><td>  50,000 - 100,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  How To Make Money: Fast Ways! </td><td>  4.5 </td><td>  10,000 - 50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  CashPirate </td><td>  4.4 </td><td>  10,000 - 50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cash Reward </td><td>  4.2 </td><td>  10,000 - 50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Octopus </td><td>  4.0 </td><td>  10,000 - 50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  AppTools Market </td><td>  4.4 </td><td>  1,000 - 5,000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Separately, I will talk about AppCent, the so-called mobile motivation service.  The main way to make money is the installation of mobile applications, for which the user receives from 11 rubles (for installation) to 150 rubles (for more complex actions).  Payments are made within an hour immediately after the assignment.  Tasks can be received both in SMS and in letters to the specified e-mail.  To my surprise, I did not find their mobile application either in the App Store or on Google Play (therefore, it is not in the table), I fully admit that it is a matter of time and development of this service. <br><br>  The following mobile applications are also focused on receiving cash rewards from installations, ratings and other user actions (they did not appear in the table above for the reasons given below): <br><ul><li>  FreeMyApps (rating 3.9 on Google Play with a setting range of 1,000,000 - 5,000,000. The number of installations is more than worthy, but the rating does not reach the lower limit of 4 points); </li><li>  AppRating (I did not find the application in either Google Play or the App Store. There is a website where you can download the application for registration. The screenshots of the application are publicly available, but I‚Äôm not found an open link to the application. For these reasons, it's hard to make an objective conclusion about the number of downloads and the average rating for listing in the table. If I am wrong and the application is on Google Play - correct, tell me the correct name, or send a link to the PM). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for those who like to go shopping on the example of ‚ÄúMover‚Äù </h4><br>  Choose a bargain from a nearby store, arrive at a point of sale, scan a QR code, get points, convert them to WebMoney, PayPal, or put them on your phone.  The number of points obtained is affected, for example, by the fullness of the user profile.  Friends invitations are also accrued for you and friends.  The application is free, but so far it works only in Moscow. <br>  For residents of the United States there are similar applications, for example, CheckPoints and Shopkick. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for mystery shoppers and freelance agents on the example of ‚ÄúMillionAgents‚Äù </h4><br>  An application for those who would like to work as a freelancer in a large company.  You are given tasks for the performance of which, you get real money, which can be withdrawn with the help of: QIWI, Yandex.Money, WebMoney, or put into the account of a mobile phone.  Variants of tasks: find a specific product in the store, indicate its price and take a few photos;  collect basic information (address, hours of operation, etc.) about the stores closest to you;  check the quality of the promoters;  conduct a survey or survey.  There are also contests and opinion polls, participation in which promises various dividends. <br><br>  There are other similar applications: <br><ul><li>  for residents of the Russian Federation - TopMission. </li><li>  for residents of France - TopChr√©tien. </li><li>  for US residents - Gigwalk, Common Cents Deals, Best Deals, Field Agent, Easy Shift. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for photographers on the example of ‚ÄúClashot‚Äù </h4><br>  Fans of taking pictures of everything that they see on a smartphone will be appreciated by an application that allows you to make money on your photos.  All that is loaded into Clashot gets on the site of the same name, where the best shots are selected.  Then they are moved to the Editorial section of the Photobank Depositphotos, where they can be bought for money.  Of course, this is not the main purpose of the mobile application, and the chance to be in the sample is not that great, but if you visit many amazing places and you have your own style, the probability of being noticed increases at times. <br>  If you are interested in this way of earning, see also - Scoopshot, Foap. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for marketing research respondents on the example of ‚ÄúGoogle Opinion Rewards‚Äù </h4><br>  Google offers all US residents to pass a public opinion poll for money that will be transferred to a user account on Google Play.  Before this, of course, you will have to tell a little about yourself in the questionnaire, as well as pass a test survey.  In addition, you will need an account in Google Wallet.  A limited number of surveys are issued per week, and the money earned can be spent on the purchase of apps on Google Play. <br><br><h4>  Mobile apps for sports enthusiasts on the example of ‚ÄúESPN Streak For The Cash‚Äù </h4><br>  One of the largest sports cable channels in the world offers its viewers to earn money on forecasts, annually playing out a prize fund of $ 1.2 million among users of this mobile application. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for fans of news stories on the example of ‚ÄúLifeNews‚Äù </h4><br>  An application for those who dreamed of being a journalist, but never became one.  For the video claiming exclusive scandalous portal is ready to pay money to your mobile.  For an improperly parked car of a public service employee you can get 100 rubles - one of the screenshots of the application on Google Play suggests, and, for example, you could earn 6,000 rubles for the footage of Snowden in Sheremetyevo.  Judging by the download statistics in Russia, from 10 to 50 thousand stringers are already working. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications for bank customers on the example of ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù </h4><br>  Alfa-Bank spoke in favor of the active lifestyle of its customers.  Each account holder was able to transfer money to a special savings account ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù with additional interest per annum.  Everyone chooses the price of one meter: from 1 to 50 kopecks.  If you pass 5 km a day, then for 10 kopecks / meter you will transfer 500 rubles per annum at 6% per annum, so that the money in your main account does not run out earlier than your activity. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  In my previous post on Habr√© ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/211534/">Mobile Applications of the Future</a> ), I tried to predict the trends of the mobile industry in the near future. <br>  In it, I already wrote that applications will go beyond the limits of online, which will lead to a change in the usual consumption pattern. <br>  Collecting materials for this post, I realized that in the case of applications in which the user can earn real money, I did not write about the future, but about the present. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212289/</a></p>
