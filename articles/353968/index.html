      ServiceNow and Ponemon Institute <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/analyst-research/ponemon-state-of-vulnerability-response.pdf">conducted an</a> online survey among 3 thousand cyber security experts.  They represented companies with a staff of over a thousand people located in 9 countries: Australia, Germany, France, Japan, New Zealand, England, USA, Singapore and the Netherlands.  The purpose of the study is to find out which processes in companies most affect security. <br><br>  Survey results showed that 48% of companies have been subjected to cyber attacks in the last 2 years.  At the same time, 57% of respondents stated that the attack was due to the vulnerability, which they discovered, but did not have time to close (although the patch was already available). <br><br>  To more quickly respond to emerging threats, companies hire new employees: 64% of organizations <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/analyst-research/ponemon-state-of-vulnerability-response.pdf">plan to</a> expand the staff of the information security department in the coming year.  However, the company ServiceNow noted that this will not lead to increased security until the vulnerability mechanisms are modified. <br><br><h2>  Why state expansion does not solve the problem </h2><br>  In ServiceNow, this problem is called patching paradox or ‚Äúsecurity paradox‚Äù.  Hiring information security specialists will not solve all difficulties, since in 61% of cases, information security departments coordinate the installation of all patches manually.  On average, teams <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/04/05/survey-hiring-more-talent-alone-wont-solve-securitys-woes/">spend</a> 321 hours per week on patching (which is approximately equal to the weekly work of eight full-time specialists).  In this case, the closure of one vulnerability takes about 12 days. <br><br>  In this case, staff expansion may further complicate coordination and interaction among staff.  Now 55% of specialists already spend more time on the distribution of tasks within a team than on eliminating security threats.  One company from the Fortune 100 even <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/04/05/survey-hiring-more-talent-alone-wont-solve-securitys-woes/">hires</a> special workers, whose only duty is to manage spreadsheet documents with information about vulnerabilities: how to close it, which department is responsible, etc. <br><br>  At the same time, organizations that are trying to hire new employees are faced with another problem - the lack of information security specialists.  According <a href="http://blog.indeed.com/2017/01/17/cybersecurity-skills-gap-report/">to the</a> site for job search Indeed, demand exceeds supply by several times. <br><br>  For example, in the USA, for every 10 vacancies in the field of cyber security, there are 6.67 views (in Germany this figure is 3.50; in England - 3.16).  This means that at least one third of vacancies are not viewed by anyone.  According to <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/04/05/survey-hiring-more-talent-alone-wont-solve-securitys-woes/">forecasts of the</a> audit organization ISACA, by 2019, 2 million cybersecurity positions will be empty. <br><br>  And the situation <a href="http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/03/21/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap/">will</a> only <a href="http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/03/21/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap/">worsen</a> : by 2021, the number of vacancies will reach 3.5 million. The main reason for the lack of personnel in this area, Cybersecurity Ventures founder Steve Morgan <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/24/chronic_shortage_qualified_cybersecurity_bods/">calls the</a> lack of appropriate personnel training. <br><br>  This problem is trying to solve.  <a href="http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/03/21/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap/">For example</a> , IBM employs workers without a four-year specialized education.  In addition, various companies are trying to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-try-to-retrain-the-workers-theyre-displacing/">retrain</a> employees, promote cybersecurity among <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/demand-for-cybersecurity-talent-soars-study-finds/">students</a> and the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-former-tsa-and-nsa-executive-reveals-how-to-break-into-the-cybersecurity-field/">female</a> half of IT staff, <a href="http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/03/21/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap/">urging</a> businesses to invest in information security. <br><br>  However, so far all these measures are <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/24/chronic_shortage_qualified_cybersecurity_bods/">not</a> working <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/24/chronic_shortage_qualified_cybersecurity_bods/">well enough</a> to close the ‚Äúgap‚Äù between vacancies and specialists who are ready to take them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/qg/mv/cjqgmvots2wgavjrlvfbvwjznom.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/emeryway/3036822914/">Emery Way</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  How to resolve the security paradox </h2><br>  To solve the problem of lack of personnel and increase security, ServiceNow proposes to review the methods of ensuring protection.  Sean Convery, vice president of ServiceNow, <a href="https://advancedmanufacturing.org/servicenow-research-uncovers-securitys-patching-paradox/">notes</a> that most cyber attacks are due to the inability of companies to close all vulnerabilities on time. <br><br>  Hackers gain in speed: at Barkly, a company engaged in the development of cyber defense, they <a href="https://blog.barkly.com/data-breach-speed-stats">calculated</a> that it takes an average of two minutes to launch a phishing campaign, and it takes 256 days to detect a hack.  The ServiceNow report also <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/analyst-research/ponemon-state-of-vulnerability-response.pdf">mentions</a> that attackers are getting faster: according to 53% of respondents, the time between the release of a patch and the modified attack, bypassing it, has decreased by 29% over the past 2 years. <br><br>  As noted above, most cyber attacks on company infrastructure (57%) could have been prevented, since a patch covering the vulnerability had already been released (recall the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2018/04/16/to-patch-or-not-to-patch-surprisingly-that-is-the-question">case of</a> Equifax).  Some companies updated the software manually and did not have time on time, while others (37%) did not scan IT systems for vulnerabilities regularly (for example, they forgot to scan the infrastructure again after applying the patch). <br><br>  In order to help organizations resolve incidents and vulnerabilities faster, ServiceNow <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/analyst-research/ponemon-state-of-vulnerability-response.pdf">makes the</a> following recommendations: <br><br><ol><li>  First you need to evaluate how the company implements the process of detecting vulnerabilities and eliminating them.  And identify problem areas, such as lack of coordination between departments or the inability to monitor the life cycle of a vulnerability.  A step-by-step algorithm for building a security risk assessment system is <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3027570/security/taking-the-vulnerability-management-program-from-good-to-great.html">offered</a> by CSO‚Äôs leading security specialist, George Viegas. </li><li>  You should not solve only major problems of information security.  And although this advice looks pretty obvious, as <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vulnerability-management/six-strategies-for-reducing-vulnerability-risk/">noted</a> by Trip Wire, a company that develops cybersecurity tools, many organizations have neglected it.  Patching only ‚Äúlast minute vulnerabilities‚Äù, the company leaves many other, less noticeable possibilities for penetration into the system for attackers. </li><li>  It will not be superfluous to combine the work of IT and information security departments (for example, using <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-guild/blog/349378/">Security Operations</a> solution).  This will help to prioritize patching.  For example, the security department of the Freedom Security Alliance was <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-freedom-security-alliance-security-operations.pdf">able</a> to speed up the vulnerability detection time by 40% due to close interaction with the client's IT department. </li><li>  You should pay attention to how exactly IB incidents are resolved at the enterprise, and then automate routine tasks (incident routing or tracking their status).  This advice was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D101%26v%3DVB45QBwFSgc">used by</a> the Australian company AMP, which allowed them to speed up the process of installing patches by 60%. </li></ol><br><hr><br>  PS Materials from the First Corporate IaaS Blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/oblachnaya-it-infrastruktura-v-realizacii-mezhdunarodnyx-proektov/">Cloud IT infrastructure: Features of international projects</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/blog/fabrika-setevoj-bezopasnosti-ot-fortinet/">Fortinet Network Security Factory: Features and Specifications</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/bezopasnost/chto-otnositsya-k-personalnym-dannym-s-tochki-zreniya-rossijskogo-regulyatora-personalnye-dannye-v-oblake-chast-1/">What refers to personal data from the point of view of the Russian regulator</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS Additional reading from our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/353686/">"Closer to 5G": VMware helps telecom operators deploy new generation networks</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/353610/">The dispute about the ‚Äúright to oblivion‚Äù: whether to consider the work of search engines as journalism?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/353124/">UL 3223: New Data Center Certification Standard introduced</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353968/</a></p>
