Experience is shared by Alexey Leontyev - the head of the group of optimizers Kokoc.com (Kokoc Group). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/759/546/973/7595469732d2350a7bc0d935d6b8851d.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Who promoted: the client who applied for the service SEO, decided to seize the market of heating equipment.  The client did not have a site, so they started from scratch.

      <b>Step 1. Exploration</b> <br><br>  To begin with, it was necessary to analyze the top 10 search results sites by thematic queries: <br>  General ("engineering plumbing", "heating equipment"); <br>  Detailed ("metal radiators", "heating radiators", "buy heating boilers"). <br>  Competitors' sites were considered according to the following criteria: <br><br>  <b>1. General structure:</b> catalog, quantity of goods, availability of tags and prices.  Do not be surprised, for the industrial segment websites the absence of price is a common story.  The bill for each product goes to hundreds of thousands, and this figure can scare potential customers, so prices do not always indicate. <br>  <b>2. Menu:</b> structure, depth, nesting level of pages, the number of clicks to go from the main page to the product and category card.  For example, for a particular radiator, the path can be 3-4 clicks, and for a category it should not exceed 1 click. <br>  <b>3. Page addresses:</b> structure, use of CNC, length, occurrence of keywords.  In some topics the addresses are short - for example, site.ru/otoplenie;  in others, they are long, with the use of the word ‚Äúcatalog‚Äù: site.ru/katalog/dom/otoplenie. <br><br>  There is no universal recipe for creating addresses, but it is important that they contain commercial patterns: a catalog, a basket and service pages.  So the search engines will be able to recognize the page as commercial and rank it by request with the keyword "buy." <br><br>  As a result, we saw that the sites that are in the top of the Yandex search results for the queries we are interested in have in common, and we needed this knowledge when building the structure of our site.  But more on that later. <br><br>  <b>Step 2. Armament</b> <br><br>  Based on the analysis of the tops, a semantic core was compiled - a list of queries on which the site will be promoted.  Here it is better to use long-invented tools, and not to waste time collecting key words manually.  (We use Just Magic.) <br><br>  How we worked with Just Magic: first of all, we collected query markers (for example: ‚Äúwater heaters‚Äù, ‚Äúboilers‚Äù, ‚Äútowel warmers‚Äù, ‚Äúradiators‚Äù) and indicated them in the Excel file along with the planned landing pages for easy sorting of results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/753/50f/a53/75350fa53cd0d103d1b2e4bbd559607c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, we started collecting the semantic core (section "Services", tab "Markers").  They indicated the name of the task, chose a database and mode of operation, noted the binding threshold and attached a file with markers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/2c9/2d8/ff02c92d8564ad0d90d0a9bf5fe90103.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The service sent us an e-mail with reference to the results - a compiled semantic core with the groups and pages mentioned earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0f/e3d/b21/c0fe3db21934739bfa02b302d7888bfa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here it is important to filter out unnecessary queries and check the actual search demand in wordstat.yandex.ru by the exact entry (‚Äú! Words! Query‚Äù). <br><br>  We did this using our own frequency collection service and obtained a ready-made core based on the markers that were submitted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1c/6ad/dea/b1c6addea0c7c32e619d2c1b828d7ed6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We also collect hints in Just Magic using the Hints Parser service. <br><br>  The program automatically expanded the mask of basic requests ("radiators", "heaters", "heaters") with the words "prices", "buy", "cost", "in Moscow".  It turned out the core, which "cleaned" by hand and, of course, agreed with the client. <br><br>  Then they distributed it among the pages, previously divided into groups: <br><ul><li>  Bimetallic radiators; </li><li>  Bimetallic radiators to buy; </li><li>  Bimetallic radiators prices; </li><li>  Bimetallic radiators in Moscow; </li><li>  Bimetallic radiators cost; </li><li>  Bimetallic radiators are inexpensive. </li></ul><br>  <b>Step 3. The deployment of troops.</b>  <b>Choice of firing positions</b> <br><br>  Based on the collected semantic core and clustering by groups, the structure of the future site was formed.  It turned out several options for the user to the product: <br><ul><li>  Boilers ‚Üí Gas boilers ‚Üí Wall-mounted gas boilers ‚Üí Wall-mounted gas double-circuit boilers ‚Üí Wall-mounted gas double-circuit boilers Baxi. </li><li>  Boilers ‚Üí Wall mounted boilers ‚Üí Wall mounted double boiler ‚Üí Wall mounted double boiler Baxi. </li><li>  Boilers ‚Üí Double Boilers ‚Üí Double Boilers Baxi. </li><li>  Boilers ‚Üí Gas boilers ‚Üí Gas boilers Baxi. </li><li>  Boilers ‚Üí Boilers Baxi. </li></ul><br>  It was important to consider that all categories and subcategories should be available in one click from the menu, except for the division into brands and filtering by parameters.  And the addresses of the pages, regardless of nesting, are formed according to the principle: site.ru/catalog/category. <br><br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  site.ru/catalog/kotly/ </li><li>  site.ru/catalog/kotly-gazovye/ </li><li>  site.ru/catalog/kotly-gazovye-dvuhkonturnye/ </li></ul><br>  So you can exclude the traditional addresses for this subject long addresses. <br><br>  <b>Step 4. Control actions.</b> <br><br>  Based on the previous steps, we gave recommendations on the development of the site and the customer took everything into account. <br><br>  Now it's time to check it for errors.  Traditionally started with searching for duplicate pages and content.  Someone uses for this various online services or search "Yandex", we have our own tool Diplicate Finder. <br><br>  Naturally, the site can not be perfect, and the service found the same content - but before removing it, it was necessary to figure out what kind of duplicates.  In our case, the same text appeared on different pages of the catalog.  We recommended that we replace it with the client, while retaining the pages themselves. <br><br>  We also checked the site for duplicate meta tags and created a generation rule for them with variables based on the parameters of the current category or item card. <br><br>  <i>The rule is the following: Buy [Product Name] at a price [cost] in the online store.</i> <br><br>  One of the generated meta tags looked like this: ‚ÄúBuy a gas wall combined boiler Wolf CGG-1K-24 with a closed chamber at a price of 65,000 rubles in the online store.‚Äù <br><br>  A check for the 404th error was made through Sape: in the personal account, in the ‚ÄúTechnical audit‚Äù tab, they indicated the site and the search engine for which it was optimized.  The process takes place automatically and takes several hours depending on the size of the site and the workload of the service.  Sape finds pages from which there are links to non-existent addresses or files that have a 404 server response. Some of the links were corrected, and some were deleted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4aa/2cd/8a0/4aa2cd8a0cc9e3121d6d20556a1e08e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When optimizing a site, it is important to hide technical pages from search engines - for example, the entrance to the admin area, search results and personal account data. <br><br>  Remember how several years ago on the Internet sms-correspondence of Megafon clients surfaced?  The company blamed Yandex for this, but in fact it was a mistake by the optimizers who did not close the pages from search engine robots in the robots.txt file.  We rechecked the pages that were open and closed to the search engine, everything was in order.  By the way, such checks should be carried out after each update of the resource. <br><br>  <b>Step 5. First victories</b> <br><br>  A month after indexation, the site became visible in the search for low-frequency queries, for example: ‚Äúbuy a radiator‚Äù, ‚Äúbuy bimetallic radiators‚Äù, ‚Äúchimneys for boilers‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c14/fc4/77e/c14fc477e556fab0e1e8db1e8bf54970.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Traffic dynamics after site optimization for two months. <br><br>  <b>Step 6. Help Allies</b> <br><br>  It's time to connect external links.  Today, Yandex is punishing purchase links, but did not pay close attention to them a few years ago.  We took advantage of the Sape exchange, selecting thematic, near-thematic and donor media with unique content and a small number of outbound links. <br><br>  Of course, buying them in thousands is not worth it, so we purchased links in small quantities to the most marginal for the client categories and the most frequent in terms of search demand.  At the same time they attracted their own grid of sites from which they placed links to a client resource. <br><br>  As a result, after 1.5 months, the site reached the top 10 search results of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù at the requests of ‚Äúwarm floor‚Äù, ‚Äúradiator‚Äù, ‚Äúradiator‚Äù, ‚Äútowel warmer‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Step 7. Expansion</b> <br><br>  When new categories were added to the customer‚Äôs product range, it was necessary to expand the site structure.  For example, the analysis of the top 10 search results for ‚Äúfan heaters‚Äù, ‚Äúbuy a fan heater‚Äù, ‚Äúprice fan heaters‚Äù made it possible to expand the semantic core for new pages - you are already familiar with the process in steps 1 and 2. <br><br>  In parallel with this, the site was regularly checked for possible errors according to the scheme described in Step 4. <br><br>  <b>Step 8. Win</b> <br><br>  For a year and a half, the site reached the top of the Yandex issue by high-frequency, mid-frequency and low-frequency inquiries, such as: ‚Äúradiators‚Äù, ‚Äúball valves‚Äù, ‚Äúradiators‚Äù, ‚Äúelectric accumulators‚Äù. <br><br>  The main result was obtained due to the competent construction of the structure and content of the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac6/b42/404/ac6b42404c0b24df7baa615ed6575e65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the high positions in the issue, the resource is visited by more than 80,000 users per month. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/216/124485/">Cossa</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303088/</a></p>
