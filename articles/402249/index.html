Until now, somewhere in the pile of old electronics, there is a 128-megabyte model working from one finger-type battery.  Therefore, after becoming acquainted with the history of the brand, Astell &amp; Kern showed increased attention to products with a stylized letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/286884/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/147/9eb/488/1479eb488569a558c535154cab1bc860.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Astell &amp; Kern doesn‚Äôt name budget audio players, but, according to the manufacturer‚Äôs own assurances, the <b><a href="http://astellnkern.ru/cat/AK70_Black">AK70</a></b> is the best in terms of sound in the category up to 500 euros.  Yes, 43 thousand (the price of the player in the Moscow retail at the time of writing the review) is considerable money, but compared to two hundred "skew" for the flagship model is not so much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d0/bfc/2c7/1d0bfc2c7d566be5fcacbc24fa4b6943.jpg">

      The player is delivered in a small box of black cardboard with a stylized brand logo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa9/711/a01/fa9711a0178ee59074e4eaeafffb5595.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01b/496/ffa/01b496ffa311dfbd7f60cebad02377c9.jpg"><br><br>  The package is austere: meter USB cable, brief instructions and nothing more. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5d/b97/9e1/f5db979e1c5e54dd33acbc569bf72791.jpg"><br>  AK70 looks solid: an abundance of right angles and strict forms, the combination of glass and blackened aluminum ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/737/010/4a2/7370104a22a6d6de85b01bf2287ab06d.jpg"><br><br>  There is a bright option, where aluminum parts are not subjected to blackout and dull shimmer with "native" silver color. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbf/56a/e1b/fbf56ae1bfd4ed8cee04af49af25412a.jpg"><br>  But solid black looks still better. <br><br>  Visual representativeness is clearly visible in the photographs, and it contributes to the shape of the body - almost the right rectangular bar.  The front and back sides are taken away by thick glass, which even in the cramped conditions of the pocket next to metal objects is in no hurry to scratch.  This is great - screen protectors will look bad on the AK70. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8c/4e7/1e1/b8c4e71e1e20f5a91c44db27fba1aa48.jpg"><br><br>  Due to its modest dimensions, the player fits perfectly in the hand, but the corners of the case stick into the palm unpleasantly.  Over time, the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù grip is worked out - at the ends or glass edges, and the designers' craving for right angles no longer seems like a bad idea.  The weight in the AK70 is slightly more than 130 grams, and a considerable part of it falls on a 2200 mAh battery.  The battery lasts for 7-9 hours of sound, depending on the volume, the activity of the wireless interfaces, the type of files being played and the headphones connected.  It is better to allocate at least 5 hours for a full charge, since the first 60% of the capacity of the battery accumulates for a long 3.5 hours, and in case of undercharging it consumes the accumulated amount in just 3 hours.  During operation, the body heats up slightly (to about 38 degrees). <br><br>  The AK70 has few relief controls - four buttons and a volume control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/960/76b/2d896076b8387f57960ea8ab3833b488.jpg"><br><br>  It is incomparable: it is easy to turn from any position, the level increases and decreases very smoothly.  The corrugated surface prevents slippage, and the stepping mechanism prevents accidental rotation from contact with clothing parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f40/e64/c6f/f40e64c6fb2f96111226a84cf75de720.jpg"><br><br>  There are three connectors: one 3.5 mm headphone jack (it's a linear output, select through the settings menu), 2.5 mm balanced output jack and microUSB at the bottom end for connecting to a PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a85/d06/abf/a85d06abf63c4a6feb55aa94792db456.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10d/c2a/070/10dc2a070b1664883d464c42d10a1368.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the main function of the last connector - battery charging and data transfer - it can be used to output sound to an external amplifier or use the <a href="http://astellnkern.ru/cat/AK70_Black">AK70</a> as a digital-to-analog converter.  When you connect via USB branded device AK CD-Ripper, you can merge music from disks into the player's memory;  supported automatic recording of metadata.  Another application - AK Connect - allows you to play audio stream from the network with the MQS media server installed (included).  The quality of the playback can be up to 192 kHz / 24 bits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da1/f1f/29f/da1f1f29f05053f0d68114c6ec82bb8f.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/759/dd2/0b4/759dd20b40a3e2b3c097b556adc0efc4.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  The case also has a slot for microSD memory cards, which can be supplemented with built-in 64 gigabytes of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94f/ce5/366/94fce536648ef84208551b5991ef2354.jpg"><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3be/e3a/672/3bee3a672233b06b59424945c8ed44c8.jpg"></div><br>  All buttons are focused on the left side - Play / Pause and forward / back.  The rest of the operations are performed with a finger on the touch screen with a diagonal of 3.3 ‚Ä≥, as well as with the touch ‚Äúhome‚Äù button below it.  The display deserves only positive reviews: bright and clear colors regardless of the angle of view, powerful backlight (five divisions out of ten are enough for a clear, cloudless day).  To see the designation of the touch button is much more difficult (dark gray dot on a black background), but its location is remembered quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c9/2fe/445/2c92fe445cea7e0f449e3914040e7a10.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbb/ff9/b35/cbbff9b35533106df502524ec1e59c68.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  The software component worked out for glory.  A well-disguised Android interface is simple and concise to use: large main menu buttons, clear volume display, easy navigation through the audio library. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b74/d22/1e2/b74d221e205600ef4f4286a5aeeff3a0.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1c/1aa/b7d/e1c1aab7dceb6a284c8e4adeaf3ced33.jpg" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a0/cb1/f1d/5a0cb1f1defc08635f10ff1d14fa4997.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/756/c08/246/756c082461110198b6d9643690f65455.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  There is no separation by media, the memory is scanned at each launch and displays the tracks in a single list.  Naturally, if you wish, you can sort the files by genre, artist, album, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c7/1b2/675/5c71b2675e1ddbfba6a314dd886a126d.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f6/6a8/eb7/5f66a8eb7dbac93a780307f6eb2df7ae.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/126/37e/bd4/12637ebd4ad6e4ea8ef8a9fbd94b41a8.jpg" width="250"><br><br>  Almost all player settings are collected in one menu, familiar to many smartphone users: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/609/a4b/a4c/609a4ba4c87ead2d010ae90dca63bb50.jpg"></div><br>  There are wireless networks in AK70: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa5/5bb/5a1/aa55bb5a1be992157a4d5febf822e2df.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34d/01f/19c/34d01f19c8aec058f936689732829dbd.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Wi-Fi is used to update the firmware (passes quickly and without questions) and buy music in online stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b4/6e5/db3/8b46e5db39511b9e8fd32e1b77dcddf6.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/933/32f/6dd/93332f6dd496fc031b75131885fdec0a.jpg" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b6/ad3/10b/8b6ad310b07295ed30ea3b08a62a6273.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a46/fe2/4fb/a46fe24fbf59372243609660f620a7e7.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  It is unlikely that on the territory of the Russian Federation this way of replenishing the audio library will be highly demanded, but the fact of its presence pleases.  Bluetooth is installed to communicate with the smartphone, which notifies the owner immersed in the music world of an incoming call. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that using the player as a headset will not work, although the support of all the protocols required for this is announced by the manufacturer.  Theoretically, the decision is dubious, but almost correct - after hearing, you can skip an important call, and connect a simple headset instead of high-quality headphones ... Unreasonable. <br><br>  The AK70 plays cleanly and clearly, which is especially well felt on full-size headphones (MDR-7506), which allow the player to open up fully.  Inserts (they are also ‚Äúchannel‚Äù, they are also ‚Äúgags‚Äù), depending on the quality of performance, play a little worse or slightly better, but even do not hold out to medium full-sized ones.  However, branded liners sent by the kit to the player proved to be good, it is a pleasure to listen to industrial and rock on the road.  Jazz, classics and other difficult music should be left for home to hear excellent detail of the sound picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/942/9bd/867/9429bd8677c4a338a24bb022028ed8b7.jpg"><br>  <i>To test the player used including headphones of the same brand - the fifth, the youngest model in the Siren lineup.</i>  <i>They are called <a href="http://astellnkern.ru/cat/Michelle">AK Michelle</a> .</i> <br><br>  Electronic music is also good, especially if you choose the right track list, but more often on AK70 it plays ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù, with no pronounced accents (as a rule, for lack of the latter).  I liked the player's ability to cope equally well with different types of headphones without having to adjust in the equalizer and other settings, as well as resetting the volume when tapping the jack to a comfortable level (and not an average value by numbers, which is audibly recognized as ‚Äúvery quiet for a crowded place‚Äù ). <br><br>  There is no exact information about the AK70 filling, we only know that the DAC is the CS4398 from Cirrus Logic.  But how easily he copes with different types of headphones and the supply of undistorted loudness allows us to conclude that a well-developed analog path. <br><br>  Astell &amp; Kern AK70 is an excellent model for audiophiles and music lovers: great sound quality is combined with a solid appearance and a thoughtful interface.  Impractical at first glance, the angular body is convenient in everyday use, the glossy surface is not scratched, and the volume control is beyond praise.  Do not forget about the versatility of the model: the AK70 can be not only a player, but also an external DAC, and also transmit a USB signal to the amplifier.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth make it possible to access online music stores and connect wireless headphones.  In fact, the AK70 is not a player, but a real pocket audio combine for a relatively low price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef0/006/ab9/ef0006ab9b3ec6600a93378bafb151db.jpg"><br><br><blockquote><h3>  Technical characteristics of <a href="http://astellnkern.ru/cat/AK70_Black">Astell &amp; Kern AK70</a> </h3><br>  <b>Body Material:</b> Aluminum <br>  <b>Color:</b> black <br>  <b>Display:</b> 3.3 "WVGA (480 x 800) AMOLED touch <br>  <b>Supported audio formats:</b> WAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE (Normal, High, Fast), AAC, ALAC, AIFF, DFF, DSF <br>  <b>Sampling rate:</b> 8 - 192 kHz (8/16/24 bits per sample) <br>  <b>Output level (no load):</b> <br>  2,3 Vrms (unbalanced and balanced output) <br>  <b>DAC:</b> Cirrus Logic CS4398 <br>  <b>Decoding:</b> 24 bit / 192 kHz bit decoding support <br>  <b>Input:</b> Micro-USB type B (for charging and data transfer - PC and Mac) / connection mode: MTP (Media Device) <br>  <b>Outputs:</b> headphones (jack 3.5 mm), balanced (jack 2.5 mm, TRRS) <br>  <b>Internal Memory:</b> 64 GB <br>  <b>Memory</b> card <b>:</b> microSD up to 128 GB (FAT32) <br>  <b>Wireless networks:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n (2.4 GHz), Bluetooth 4.0 (A2DP, AVRCP, aptX) <br>  <b>Bluetooth:</b> version 4.0 (A2DP, AVRCP, aptX) <br>  <b>Food:</b> lithium-polymer battery 2200 mAh (3.7 V) <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 60 x 97 x 13 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 132 g <br><br><h3>  Sound parameters </h3><br>  <b>Frequency response:</b> 20 Hz - 20 kHz (¬± 0.075 dB), unbalanced and balanced output <br>  <b>Unbalanced:</b> ¬± 0.56 dB (10 Hz - 70 kHz) <br>  <b>Balanced:</b> ¬± 0.55 dB (10 Hz - 70 kHz) <br>  <b>S / N ratio:</b> Unbalanced: 116 dB / kHz; Balanced: 116 dB / kHz <br>  <b>Crosstalk:</b> Unbalanced: 130 dB / kHz, Balanced: 130 dB / kHz <br>  <b>OIG + N:</b> Unbalanced 0.0008% @ 1 kHz, balanced 0.0007% @ 1 kHz, balanced 0.0006% 800Hz 10kHz 4: 1 <br>  <b>Output impedance:</b> Balanced output (2.5 mm) 1 ohm, headphones (3.5 mm) 2 ohm </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402249/</a></p>
