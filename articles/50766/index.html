There are so many impressions that I wrote up 12 sheets of notebook in small print with my notes.  Below I will sort out these notes, systematize them and they will be suitable for reading.  I will not post the verbatim records of the reports themselves, they will be posted on the network in 2-3 days, and you will read them there.  Only <a href="http://absolvo.ru/">my</a> impressions :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I came to focus on the report ‚ÄúLayout in IntelliJIDEA‚Äù from Vadim Makishvili.  As he himself correctly noted, he did not push through us to the editor, but simply shared his development experience, and how to make this development more convenient, faster and more qualitative. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118671/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27f/d3a/ecf/27fd3aecfbab3d2bbd4c1835470e11d6.jpg" width="500" height="335" title="Saturday work" alt=""></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118671/">"Saturday"</a> on <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Yandex.

      And there is nothing special to tell here, you just need to download the Idea, look and maybe change to it.  It is multiplatform.  Here I will add this post, and be sure to download, poyuzayu.  It seems to me that listening to the experience of Vadim is worth it. <br><br>  The only thing is that this program is not intended for developing HTML + CSS at all, but for JAVA.  But nevertheless she does a wonderful job of her duties. <br><br>  Next, Fedor Golubev briefly, and very austerely, spoke about the ‚ÄúYandex.Maps API.‚Äù  In principle, everything that was told during the report is all in the documentation.  Informative, but here I will not linger. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118673/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42d/654/ccf/42d654ccf0df90c9cf2e0a42bf04bdd6.jpg" width="500" height="335" title="Saturday work" alt=""></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118673/">"Saturday"</a> on <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Yandex. Photos</a> <br><br>  But for myself I came to the conclusion that in the new work (yes, yes - I found a job), in some places I implement the functionality on the basis of Ya. Cards. <br><br>  But then the most interesting thing went, "The CSS Framework do it yourself" from Vitaly Kharisov. <br><br>  Vitaly's speech began with the fact that he went to the layout of the presentation, which was played on the wall.  As a result, the entire hall was given a short master class on the operational debug of the layout, everything was broadcast on the screen and commented by the developers.  After fixing all the problems, Vitaly broke the applause.  By the way, not the last time. <br><br>  By the way, I noted that Vitali in profile is similar to Chandler, from the TV series "Friends", when he walked with glasses.  All the time while Vitaly was in my field of vision, this impression did not leave me. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/tarja2/view/137305/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d24/5aa/cd5/d245aacd5b65d4cafd035c55f2f9dc4f.jpg" width="333" height="500"></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/tarja2/view/137305/">Look at Yandex. Photos</a> <br><br>  From Vitaly's speech I took out some interesting ideas.  I will not blindly repeat what we were told about, but to make changes to what I have now is necessary, I really understood it today.  It should be noted that I had such thoughts before Ya.Subbotnik, but it was on him that I understood - it must be done.  Regarding the optimization of CSS development, and of course layout. <br><br>  Vitaly got applause for the second time, when he simply and with a smile admitted why he was using tables.  The answer is quite obvious, the layers do not give the dynamics that Yandex needs. <br><br>  I also liked the quote, unfortunately I literally do not remember, ‚ÄúBad expressions, but written by good people is still bad.‚Äù  If someone remembers the quote itself - please write in the comments. <br><br>  A lot of swearing went to the developers of IE, well, to the "nedobrauzeru.  It is quite obvious that the representative of Microsoft did not come, otherwise he would have blushed like a cancer, throughout Vitaly‚Äôs speech. <br><br>  A curious png-fix method was proposed, naturally for IE6, called g-png.  I suggest to familiarize with it without fail.  I repeat, in 2-3 days all reports will be posted. <br><br>  During the report, I learned that developers regularly send bug fixes to browser development teams.  I asked the question, after the report, they say there is some sense from the bug reports?  The answer blew up the entire Yandex kitchen with laughter, saying that the bug reports are sent solely for personal satisfaction.  Although I was in place of the browser development teams would listen to the monsters experts on the web. <br><br>  Precisely because reports are sent, a valid code is written, which is quite obvious.  However, the very reason for validation is clearly not the case :) <br><br>  Then, after the report, I accidentally heard that Vitaly was worried that his report was boring and uninteresting.  Vitali, if you read these lines, then know that everything was just fine.  However, I already told you that. <br><br>  Then came a report from Vadim Makeev ‚ÄúWith a knife against a locomotive.  Optimization and cutting graphics for professional layout. "  For me, the report was interesting only from the point of view - ‚Äúto listen, maybe I know what's new.‚Äù  I did not find out a lot of new things, but I found out for myself a couple of nice buns  I will use in work. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118676/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/4d2/3bb/857/4d23bb85720698f32228619b6209e5f0.jpg" width="500" height="335" title="Saturday work" alt=""></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/basvasilich/view/118676/">"Saturday"</a> on <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Yandex. Photos</a> <br><br>  As Vadim correctly noted, earlier websites were being made up, now they are drawing - in general, this is normal for the evolution of the Web, but it‚Äôs still a bit difficult. <br><br>  What was not very pleasant in the report, all hotkeys that were indicated were indicated for Mac, which is a little uncomfortable for me.  But it is not fatal. <br><br>  Begun's representative set up PhotoShop along with Vadim.  By the way, just below I will write whom I saw, if not by name.  But by company. <br><br>  I really didn‚Äôt like the guy who, in fact, with his stupid question, forced Vadim to explain what CSS sprites are.  It is unpleasant that time was taken away, because the schedule is very tight, and everything was arranged by the minute.  Someone could not ask, perhaps an interesting question.  And it was about the fact that you can implement rounding corners using sprites.  The elementary thing. <br><br>  Next was the turn of Natalia Makishvili with the report "Layout for mobile devices."  Of interesting, Natasha already has 30 mobile phones to check the layout.  We, ordinary designers, are still well settled, and competent layout for mobile phones is incredibly complex.  Under the PDA is much easier. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/tarja2/view/137315/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8c/c28/e19/c8cc28e19935dc2a082a1be74865dc24.jpg" width="500" height="333"></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/tarja2/view/137315/">Look at Yandex. Photos</a> <br><br>  Although Nokia's browsers are incredibly upset, because they do not support access keys, and attention, anchors!  Although this and that worked perfectly even on the Siemens M55.  For me it is strange. <br><br>  It is a pity that there is no statistics on browsers that support DTD2.0 from the organization WAPPHORUM. <br>  I forgot to say that in St. Petersburg, designers of mobile page versions have more than 50 phone models. <br><br>  Then there was a report by Evgenia Firsova entitled ‚ÄúThe process of deployment of the layout - simply, quickly, safely,‚Äù I, however, missed the first 10 minutes from the report, because at that moment I spoke with Natasha Makishvili in the smoking room.  But I understood the meaning, but I didn‚Äôt understand what I read later, when the report will be posted.  And I recommend you, this is an invaluable experience that few of us will get in their companies.  At least in the near future, I definitely will not get this experience.  Most likely, fortunately. <br><br>  From impressions, it was unpleasant to hear that the report gave me the impression that Yevgeny did not quite understand that under Windows there are analogs of simlink.  Well, that's not the point. <br><br>  There were few questions for Eugenia, because the topic is complicated, everyone was tired, there was little time and, in general, we would still listen to it for about two hours.  But a small number of questions was compensated for by deafening applause.  They were broken by all the speakers, by the way, do not think anything like that.  Only grateful listeners gathered. <br><br>  Enough about the program, a little about the little things, without which the impression would not have been so rosy. <br><br>  Of the food was exclusively pastries, but the most diverse.  I am tightly hooked on homemade pizza, I personally bear thanks to everyone who cooked it - insanely tasty, I destroyed it an insane amount. <br><br>  Timur, the head of the testers department (how does that sound right?) Even threatened a couple of times that he would not let anyone out until all the pastries were eaten, but by the end of it there were just tons left, on several tables. <br><br>  But the sugar got some unsweetened, although putting it in my cup, I was not shy in the number of cubes. <br><br>  In the smoking room, i.e.  on the summer, open veranda, it was incredibly cold, but sweet tea and pastries quickly warmed everyone who went out to get some fresh air.  Towards evening, the Yandex employees began to go out with us, because the door had passed on the ‚Äúdark‚Äù mode, and without an employee's card, it was impossible to get into the building. <br><br>  Since there is wi-fi in the Yandex kitchen, pictures from the event and tweets appeared extremely quickly.  Only here I did not see sockets. <br><br>  Representatives of Runner, Google, Opera, SUP, several banks, Akronis (Lesch, salute!) Were noticed on Saturday. <br><br>  I want to thank Yandex, and its employees, for organizing, interesting reports and the desire to do something interesting and useful.  Thank you, and keep up the good work. <br><br>  They will continue to threaten that in 2009 they will hold three more events in the same way, but with a different theme. <br><br>  Surely I forgot a lot, but shared my main impressions.  About a hundred participants who were registered did not attend the event - you lost a lot, ladies and gentlemen, very much! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50766/</a></p>
