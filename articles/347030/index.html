You can develop an ingenious strategy, purchase super-equipment (if you have a factory), or think over the design of the sales area (if you are a store owner).  But without effective frames, these tricks will not help. <br><br>  How to find valuable employees, how to evaluate a candidate, how to carry out staff selection?  We will talk about this in our article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What problem does the employer face? </h2><br>  ‚ÄúWhere to look?‚Äù Is the eternal misfortune of entrepreneurs.  They know how to manage a company, define its goals, build a strategy.  But they are lost if the candidate is sitting in front of them.  What to ask him?  Check diplomas, evaluate appearance (in a tie or not?), Ask questions on the summary: "Is it true that you created a sales department from scratch?"

      Same thing with the hiring manager.  He knows the Labor Code, the features of a market economy, the concept of personnel management ... But how to understand the main thing: can the applicant benefit?  And is he the one he pretends to be? <br><br>  Here is the story of a familiar manager: <br><br>  Ivan, the owner of the interior cabin, fired two sellers.  One had a three-year experience in a shopping center, the second was shining at the interview and answered ‚Äúlike a book‚Äù.  But in two weeks they sold almost nothing.  ‚ÄúAnd you believed them?‚Äù We asked Ivan.  He spread his hands: ‚ÄúAt the interview, everything was fine.  So I thought ... " <br><br>  This is the eternal problem of employers.  They do not know what to focus on in the selection of personnel.  Therefore, they choose representative people with diplomas and solid work experience.  Unreliable criteria, but better such than none at all. <br><br>  In our experience, only four criteria deserve attention.  It is enough to remember them and make four - only four!  - step. <br><br><h2>  Step one.  Evaluate the productivity of the applicant </h2><br>  Imagine a car that consists of many parts and screws.  A machine is a company, the screws and gears are workers.  Each screw has its own task.  When some part is working halfway, the mechanism stops.  If we talk about business, it develops more slowly and eventually gives way to competitors. <br><br>  To avoid this, each employee must complete the task at 100%.  Do not just do 10% of the work and explain "why it did not work."  A valuable worker brings things to the end and achieves what is expected of him.  The system administrator ensures uninterrupted operation of equipment.  The cleaning lady cleanly removes the reception.  The secretary sends faxes on time and clearly answers phone calls. <br><br>  We call such people productive.  They know how to work on the result and achieve it.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if they have a degree, how old they are and what their seniority is.  Ingvar Kamprad did not study at the university, but he created IKEA.  Copywriter Lilian Eichler helped sell 2,000,000 outdated books on etiquette in 1919.  She was only 18 years old. <br><br>  The best proof of productivity is the results achieved by the candidate.  Not necessarily in the work - many guys just graduated from high school and have not worked yet.  Talk with them about life, school, sports ... Find out: is there anything they are proud of?  What did they achieve in the previous company (at the institute, in circles and sections)?  And be sure to inquire about those who worked before. <br><br><h2>  Step two.  Learn about the personal qualities of the candidate </h2><br>  Often we say: "At work, we work, leave your personal home."  But in life it does not happen.  We can fight with a bad mood, forget about problems for a while.  But to leave your character at home is unreal.  If an employee is absent or vulnerable, this will affect his work.  "Turn off" it can not.  At best, you can only direct the energy in the right direction. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, when hiring you need to make sure:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  whether the candidate will take root in your company; </li><li>  will it be difficult for him to cope with his duties; </li><li>  how to manage it and whether to take it at all. </li></ul><br>  There are at least two ways to do this.  You can inquire about the candidate.  It is unlikely that the ex-head will hide the truth from a fellow entrepreneur.  And you can test the candidate for personal qualities.  Testing systems are different, for example, MBTI or EXEC-U-TEST Personality.  Each employer can choose a test that suits him and his company personally. <br><br><h2>  Step three.  Determine candidate motivation </h2><br>  Did the candidate respond to the vacancy?  Do not think that he is passionate about the company's mission.  People have different motives.  Someone is betting on a high salary, someone is looking to learn from the new boss.  And someone just wants to "sit out" the crisis in a warm place and go further. <br>  What happens if you hire a disinterested person?  This will tell Boris, head of delivery.  The new manager gave him some grief.  First sent the courier to the wrong address.  Then he sent in the mail one parcel instead of another.  Boris was perplexed: what about a newcomer?  Is he stupid, inconsiderate, ineffective?  We talked with the employee and made sure: he was indifferent to his work.  Therefore, it was so often wrong.  Who cares what happens? <br><br>  Another thing is when an employee is inspired.  Then he can conquer any peak. <br><br>  Here are some tips for motivation testing: <br><br><ul><li>  Listen to what the candidate says.  If he is interested only in salary, he will work only for her.  If he is silent and ‚Äúhe agrees to everything,‚Äù he simply ‚Äúwants to wait out.‚Äù  And if he asks, ‚ÄúWhat are my responsibilities?  What will I do? ‚Äù- he is yours. </li><li>  Tell the candidate about the company's mission.  Tell us how you make your clients life calm, easy and joyful.  Tell someone who will benefit your startup and how it will serve the community.  If the candidate lights up, you will work. </li><li>  You can ask "in the forehead": "Why did you choose us?" The applicant is not always waiting for such a question, so he can let it slip. </li></ul><br><h2>  Step Four.  Check the candidate's knowledge </h2><br>  We already know: diplomas, certificates and certificates are only documents.  You can study at the best law school, learn the right and not draw up a single contract.  Or get right and never get behind the wheel. <br><br>  A competent candidate is one who uses knowledge in practice.  This may be the chef who grew up in the kitchen.  Or a designer who was taught by a senior colleague "without titles and regalia."  Want to recognize such a person - give him a test task.  Let him draw a picture, repair a computer, or write out a recipe.  Or at least he will describe how he will act in a difficult situation (‚ÄúDescribe how you will settle a difficult client‚Äù).  This is the only way to know the right person. <br><br>  <b>What you need to remember:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  There are 4 factors to evaluate a candidate. </li><li>  The most important is productivity (ability to work for the result).  Her proof is that the results are past. </li><li>  The nature of the candidate also affects his work.  To find out about him, make inquiries or test the applicant. </li><li>  A good candidate not only can, but also wants to work.  The best option is the one who is interested in the company's mission. </li><li>  The last factor is the knowledge of the applicant.  To test them, use the test task. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347030/</a></p>
