So that you can spend only a few minutes, we spend a lot of time.  Let me give you tips, speed up your work on the Internet and maybe some of you will start earning more by working less. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Believe in passion and use it.</b>  Yes!  This is a truly burning feeling, forcing us to work more productively when we do what we love.  For example, I am writing this post and pouring out my thoughts with emotions, transferring my mood to you.  If I begin to pay for it, I will earn an order of magnitude more than those who print mechanically, without asking a spark in the text. <br><br>  I started writing texts a long time ago, without really knowing the letter (you shouldn't be clever, not everyone was diligently taught).  Over time, I began to notice the superiority in typing speed, as well as the absence of " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA">tetanus</a> ", when you need to find a synonym or phrase for text.  I loved typing, so I write a lot and not always for money.

      <b>2. Do not spray.</b>  In modern society, you need to do several things at once, to have several professions at once, but this is a dispersion of efforts.  Sometimes try to say no, than to spend a lot of time is unprofitable for yourself. <br><br>  From practice, I know that the client‚Äôs problem " <i>but still make this chip,</i> " and your " <i>daaaaaa ...</i> " in return, can cost you a sleepless night and the gift of a lost next day.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8_%25C2%25AB%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25C2%25BB">Always saying "yes"</a> is not the prerogative of professionals. <br><br>  <b>3. Concentrate on work, removing unnecessary bookmarks.</b>  I will put forward one hypothesis, which came to mind while writing the text, and you decide how real it is. <br><br><blockquote>  Not deliberately left a bookmark in VK ruined more careers and working hours than the family, neighbors and mood swings of the author. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>4. Raise the stakes.</b>  I worked for 5 cents ... Yes, comrades.  He did not collect bottles, did not hand out leaflets, but wrote texts.  Now the vision has fallen, the work is very high quality and interesting.  So let's appreciate your work.  Good work is expensive, you need to sell it accordingly.  Do not forget that customers pay and are willing to pay large sums. <br><br>  <b>5. Organize work to stream.</b>  There are tasks that require routine action.  For example, I write articles.  For them, I need keywords.  I go to Adwords, Wordstat and other services.  There is no need to repeat it again after each article, so I make a sketch of the ‚Äúskeletons‚Äù for the texts, especially when the vision gets tired, and then I write.  This organization of routine in the flow helped save a lot of time, because  I can always answer the customer that in the queue, without inventing or in haste, without plowing <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">PS</a> . <br><br>  <b>6. Organization of work around the workplace.</b>  We all move away from the laptop (computer) in real life.  In it, we must clearly organize the workflow, otherwise the waste of time will be enormous.  Not to mention the loss of concentration.  Remove pets from the room, write tasks on a piece of paper to at least sometimes break away from the monitor and protect your eyesight. <br><br>  <b>7. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">Outsourcing</a> .</b>  It is a myth that only <b>I am a</b> professional (in the sense of you).  Transfer some functions to others by speeding up your workflow.  I once ordered the creation of a large Internet site, which I filled with content, made a semantic core, and so on.  But there was no time for a unique design, so I went to the freelance market and ordered design services.  Voila, the money for urgency is more than paid for by attracting a specialist. <br><br>  <b>8. Consider your biorhythms.</b>  If you work easily in the morning, work in the morning.  Can't you get up in the morning, but can you work like a robot at night?  Work at night!  Take into account the features of your body, then the efficiency will be maximum. <br><br>  <b>9. Market monitoring is the right decision.</b>  I once tried to find the top author on the content exchange on the Internet.  Just took his nickname and "hammered" on YouTube.  I caught sight of his channel with the disclosure of many unfamiliar to me chips on writing articles and selling them.  But it would seem, why it was done initially?  Sometimes you need to do strange searches in order to get something useful. <br><br>  Watch themed videos of leading companies, read the megamozg, just find the appropriate topic in the "news" section on google.  Be in trend, then work will be in fashion, and wallet for the weather.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285882/</a></p>
