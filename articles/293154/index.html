  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the conversion of an online store using email marketing?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any online store wants to sell as many products as possible on its website and this is normal.  It would seem that even online stores can come up with in order to return their visitor with the money and make him the best offer?  In this article I will tell you about one experiment that could increase sales of an online store several times.  It's about email marketing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Beginning of the mental process and creative imagination </h2><br>  One day, sitting at the workplace, I was visited by a very important question: how to make it so that each person could follow the prices of the online store?  So much so that in the season of promotions and sales people are not lost, but they immediately go in and buy exactly the goods they need? <br>  After this thought began to develop in my head, my brain washes so actively loaded with this task that after a couple of experiments I had an idea! <br><br><h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvoluntary publicity of price changes </h2><br>  People on the Internet often share their personal data on the Internet.  Most often: email and name.  The rest is already a big question and only under great motivation for a profitable offer. <br>  And here I had an idea about the notification of price changes via email.  Now many people are reading and thinking that I am the CEP and have not invented anything new.  But read to the end and have patience :) <br><br><h2>  Implementation </h2><br><h3>  Attracting customer gaze </h3><br>  It all started with the collection of email addresses of our customers.  I created a simple form with 1 field and 1 button (minimalism is our everything), but first you need to attract a client ... Therefore, I invented a UTP (a unique selling proposition). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb6/1aa/662/bb61aa662f484266819186121509d02d.png" alt="I want to be the first to know about the price reduction"><br>  After the visitor becomes interested, he will click on the link and see the form. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/77b/e7f/06f77be7f22744c0a50b1b6998ad6393.png" alt="Enter your email">

    <h3>  Sales against SPAM </h3><br>  In Russia, email marketing is associated with spam and therefore you need to invent something really useful and unique.  I am against SPAM!  In the end, I figured out how to implement personalized email sales. <br><br><h3>  Typesetting letters </h3><br>  For a simple experiment, no design layout is enough.  Therefore, it was decided not to spend time on the experiment. <br>  Also, another motivational moment was invented and implemented, which caught the attention of the client - ‚Äúsaving‚Äù.  For the experiment, the price of the product was reduced by 4 rubles. <br>  This is the result of this layout: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/910/a2a/bee/910a2abee0424a7bb4768ebb13d33fa4.png" alt="Discount letter"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b20/f45/6e7/b20f456e792f46cc8174865e2c5441fe.png" alt="Discount letter"><br>  Then it was done that just speeds up the buying process at least 3 times!  The client enters his phone number and when you click on the ‚ÄúBuy in 1 click!‚Äù Button, the client enters the company's website and the order is automatically processed! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/4f2/b1c/30d4f2b1c7a94558bb0d3f5eed0d8071.png" alt="image"><br>  Looking at the picture, you must now realize what has been done ... I will not reveal all the secrets.  Just gave you food for thought. <br><br><h3>  The results of the works </h3><br>  Google Analytics shows the statistics of the page that processes the order. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1c/92b/54b/b1c92b54b62346da90988822b224b31f.png" alt="Result of email marketing"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62f/067/0a7/62f0670a719547768ee3e34ec4dd1f89.png" alt="Statistics"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  This work is specifically shown as an experiment, and you already think about its benefits :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293154/</a></p>
