      Running over from the bush, to the bush, hiding behind the foliage, the companions finally lurked near the improvised outpost. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to think about,‚Äù Jobs said through a pair of binoculars. ‚ÄúWe have to go around the back.‚Äù <br><br>  - And maybe right away?  - Tried to argue the "debutant" MacWorld'a. <br><br>  - Not.  On a pine "bald" sits.  A bespectacled "grazes" the gate.  Just like in the movies about the war.  - With a little light in his eyes, excitedly spoke "Stevie." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Phil understood that today there would be not just a rematch, but the punishment of "unbelievers."  I remembered the past year and offensive phrases Steve Ballmer (CEO of Microsoft).  "They say the iPhone is the most expensive phone, and it is unlikely that it has a future."  He squeezed the handle of the machine. <br><br>  It was a "trifling" - to wave over the mountain, and there - through the swamps.  One thing is scary - the Commander may be unwell, but in this case Phil always had a reserve: clean dry socks, a cure for all illnesses ‚Äî the Soviet Starlet (the best warming ointment in the world) and a thermos of hot raspberry tea. <br><br>  At the intersection, they noticed two silhouettes that ran across the path.  "Surely we are gone," a thought flashed through both of them.  But without a fight, they obviously would not have given.  With a shout of ‚Äúiphone‚Äù, they rushed to the meeting.  Running closer, they saw in ‚Äústrangers‚Äù representatives of the company ‚ÄúHTC‚Äù - Peter Chou and Sher Wong. <br><br>  - Apple'ovtsy, what are you doing here?  Said the one below. <br><br>  Phil Schiller understood that he had to distinguish between the founder and the chairman of HTC by the nature of his activities, but under the circumstances it didn‚Äôt matter. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe, as always,‚Äù Jobs continued looking at his companion, ‚Äúbehind Gates and his retinue.‚Äù <br><br>  - And we are looking for Palm'ovtsev.  Didn't you see Ed Colligan?  - asked all the same "short." <br><br>  - Rumors go, they say, the model released, which will surpass the iPhone.  We do not believe in this, but the fact that it will surpass our Diamond is not in doubt.  I want to make corrections, so to speak ... - said the second. <br><br>  Phil Schiller just wanted to say that they were the first to come, but Jobs interrupted him, pointing to the slope with his hand, he whispered: ‚ÄúKeep southeast, they hid in a big cave‚Äù. <br><br>  Thanking, the "Oriental people" rushed in the direction that Steve showed. <br><br>  - But we did not see anyone!  - trying to convince the "boss", said Schiller. <br><br>  - You did not see it, but last year I woke a bear there when I was hunting: I barely took my legs away.  Let them run too - these Asians are painfully arrogant, - his comrade responded, quickening his pace. <br><br>  Rounding the next stone ridge, they hit the destination.  In front of them were the unsuspecting Ballmer and Gates.  Jobs identified the victims with a gesture of a "seasoned" commando.  Phil got Gates.  Slowly walking up so as not to frighten away the "victim", he did not notice the dry branch, which with a special crash "was distributed" in the air.  Gates, moment turned and shouted - ‚ÄúAmbush!‚Äù And immediately began to go down the rope (which he had prepared ‚Äújust in case‚Äù).  And no matter how Phil aimed, he never had time to give Gates a ‚Äúgift‚Äù. <br><br>  Steve Ballmer was less fortunate: while he turned around, he managed to get two ‚Äúprojectiles‚Äù in the back and one in the leg, which resulted in a fall on the foliage. <br><br>  - All, all do not shoot - shouted the gene.  Director of the "windows" - "I‚Äôm no longer able to paint your own paintball to the bathhouse," taking one breath, continued, "No, to simply throw away the black PR on each other, arrange massacres, damn them." <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut there is an agreement, an agreement,‚Äù Jobs calmly said. <br><br>  The following morning, in an interview with the Financial Times, Steve Ballmer admitted that the iPhone has become more popular, not only due to the fact that it fell in price almost twice (US), as well as the number of Internet requests made from the iPhone - they exceed The number of requests made from devices running Windows Mobile and BlackBerry combined.  At the same time, the world total reaches 10%.  Also, Steve Ballmer noted that Microsoft for some unknown reasons, for some time, freezes the planned release of the Zune Phone. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49239/</a></p>
