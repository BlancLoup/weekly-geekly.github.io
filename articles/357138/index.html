This project was initiated by the autonomous non-profit organization (ANO) "MSK-IX".  To work on the backup, a separate structure has been created - the Indata Network Technologies Development Fund (Indata FRST).  At the first stage, 70 million rubles will be invested in the fund, the investments are provided by the ANO MSK-IX.

      The new organization will be engaged in "macroscopic research of the Internet."  Foundation staff will analyze the passage of traffic on the Network, as well as monitor the interaction of autonomous systems.  The final result of the project should be a unified system that combines the IP address database of the Dutch RIPE NCC registry (this organization distributes IP addresses between telecom operators, including Russian ones) and the route information database of the Internet.  There are five such registries in the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Foundation will develop a system for visualizing traffic on the Web to identify problems in routing.  It is also planned to create a number of web-tools for domestic specialists.  Tools will provide the exchange of information about the status of the Network in real-time mode. <br><br>  As for the ‚Äúbackup copy‚Äù of Runet, this idea is not new - its domestic officials suggested in 2014. Then a number of departments were concerned about the possible disconnection of Runet from the Global Network.  In order to ensure the safe operation of the Russian part of the Internet, in 2015 the Ministry of Communications <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/17/06/2016/57613a4b9a794724f3e07644">prepared a bill</a> to create a ‚Äústate information system to ensure the integrity, sustainability and safety of the Russian part of the Internet.‚Äù  The authors of this project believe that the state system should be a copy of the world system, including the database of IP addresses, traffic routing to the Network and the DNS system (which links IP addresses with the letter names of the sites).  The bill of the Ministry of Communications exists in several versions.  None has yet been submitted for public comment.  Nevertheless, the Ministry of Communications promised to make the Runet <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275752/">fully autonomous</a> by 2020.  According to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, now the Russian traffic partially passes through external exchange points, which makes it impossible to guarantee the failure-free operation of the Runet. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Alexey Platonov, the head of the non-profit organization ‚ÄúMSK-IX‚Äù, states that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a system in MSK-IX appeared a year ago, and it was not connected with the draft law of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  ‚ÄúA scattered copy of the RIPE NCC has existed, for example, in ROSNIIROS since 2004, but there is currently no unified IP-address registry system in Russia,‚Äù says Platonov.  Now the controlling stake of TSFST MSK-IX belongs to Rostelecom. <br><br><h3>  What will the creation of such a system? </h3><br>  According to Alexander Stepanov, executive director of the ‚ÄúIndat‚Äù FRST, the new system will allow optimizing routing.  With its help, it will also be possible to more effectively fight DDoS attacks.  Now operators independently define traffic routing policies, companies do not share such information with each other.  However, routing information is noted by operators in the Internet Routing Registry database.  Using the base, the operators are checked against the routing tables, creating their own policies.  If the entire base, or at least part of it, is destroyed, then the entire Global Network will fail. <br><br>  According to Oleg Demidov, PIR Center consultant, a small market of services is now being formed that are related to the measurement and monitoring of the work of the Internet infrastructure.  This work is needed both by the operators themselves and by Internet companies and regulators.  "Backup Runet", according to Demidov - a commercial product MSK-IX, which is planned to market. <br><br>  One cannot speak about the independence of the system being created, in the opinion of one of the Big Four operators.  The fact is that control over the company that owns the traffic exchange point belongs to Rostelecom.  Market participants believe that the project of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media will be implemented on the basis of the Indat system, despite the current independence of these two projects. <br><br>  Representatives of MSK-IX claim that the background will be independent of Rostelecom, and the organization will be uncontrolled by the state operator.  Representatives of Rostelecom also reported that the state-owned company does not affect the work of the Indat fund. <br><br>  Experts point out that the system created by the foundation will be incomplete.  The fact is that now only 15% of the total inter-operator Internet traffic in Russia passes through MSK-IX.  Only small and medium-sized companies work with MSK-IX, large ones exchange traffic directly.  The big players, according to experts, will not install the equipment of the fund, which is associated with Rostelecom.  If, however, problems with traffic routing still occur, a large company will be able to identify such a problem on its own. <br><br>  As for protection against DDoS attacks, some large companies have their own protection system.  MegaFon, for example, has a protection system against such attacks with a capacity of 80 Gb / s, which ‚Äúguarantees customers a reflection of the most powerful attacks,‚Äù said company spokeswoman Julia Dorokhina. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357138/</a></p>
