I use the word ‚Äúgot it out,‚Äù since it was this very saying that was able to reach the deepestly hidden remnants of conscience and shards of truth and common sense hidden in my soul.  And now, all these remnants and fragments in unison claim that a person cannot simply take and call himself a psychologist or a doctor when he pleases, without appropriate education and skills, because we don‚Äôt have rap here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/21e/6cf/b98/21e6cfb98b37452f18892de7aeea29c4.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This text was originally conceived as a small training manual to help all today's specialists in the field of information technology.  Indeed, if people within the framework of an entire profession are eager to call themselves psychologists, then let's find those standard requirements that they must comply with.  Thus, the <a href="http://xn--n1abc.xn--p1ai/rpo/documentation/ethics.php">‚ÄúEthical Code of Psychologist‚Äù</a> existing in Russia puts forward several key concepts that are basic for every true psychologist, among which are: respect, competence, responsibility and honesty.  It is on these four pillars that we will try to make a portrait of a modern psychologist from usability with you.

      To begin with, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3">let us turn to Wikipedia</a> in search of starting information about what a real legal psychologist is, and not just a person who has asked friends for a few times to poke his interactive prototype a couple of times in his life. <br><br>  Psychologist (ancient Greek œàœÖœáŒÆ - soul; ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ - knowledge) is a specialist who studies the manifestations, methods and forms of organization of mental phenomena of a person in various areas of human activity in order to solve research and applied problems, as well as to psychological assistance, support and maintenance. <br>  The psychologist, as a rule, has a completed higher psychological education or has undergone retraining on the basis of higher education in the specialty "Psychology". <br><br>  Well, let us assume that any and every member of our professional community on the UX Club on Facebook is really armed with the necessary diploma and certificate of such retraining.  But besides paper, we also need knowledge, so we turn to their list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e60/bdf/3c4/e60bdf3c4551131a498fe19ae6a2f189.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, there is still the most ordinary <a href="http://www.nieup.ru/files/doc/20150427-231610.pdf">State educational standard</a> , the study of which we are with you now and will go deeper.  It turns out that everyone who calls himself a psychologist is simply obliged to have the following knowledge (I choose the most delicious and incremental): <br><br>  <b>Culturology:</b> Methods of cultural studies.  Basic concepts of cultural studies: culture, civilization, cultural morphology, cultural functions, cultural subject, cultural genesis, cultural dynamics, language and cultural symbols, cultural codes, intercultural communications, cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms, cultural traditions, cultural worldview, social cultural institutions, cultural self-identity, cultural modernization.  Typology of cultures.  Ethnic and national, elite and mass culture.  Eastern and Western types of cultures.  Specific and "middle" cultures.  Local cultures.  Inculturation and socialization. <br><br>  <b>Pedagogy:</b> Education as a sociocultural phenomenon and the pedagogical process.  Educational system of Russia.  Purposes, content, structure of continuing education, unity of education and self-education.  Pedagogical process.  Educational, educational and developmental function of learning.  Education in the pedagogical process. <br><br>  <b>Speech culture</b> <i>(do not laugh, there is such a thing)</i> : Genre differentiation and selection of language means in a journalistic style.  Features of oral public speech.  The main types of arguments.  Speech preparation: topic selection, speech purpose, material search, beginning, deployment, and speech termination.  The main methods of material search and types of auxiliary materials.  Verbalization of public speaking.  Comprehensibility, informative and expressiveness of public speech.  Speaking in the system of functional varieties of the Russian literary language.  Conversation conditions, role <br>  extra language factors.  The main directions of improving the skills of literate writing and speaking. <br><br>  <b>Sociology</b> (in UX without it, really, there is no step to take): Social groups and communities.  Types of communities.  Community and personality.  Small groups and teams.  Social organization.  Social movements.  Social inequality, stratification and social mobility.  The concept of social status.  Social interaction and social relations.  Public <br>  opinion as an institution of civil society. Culture as a factor of social change.  The interaction of the economy, social relations and culture.  Personality as a social type.  Social control and deviation.  Personality as an active subject.  Social change.  Social revolutions and reforms.  The concept of social progress.  Formation of the world system. <br><br>  <b>Philosophy</b> <i>(well, well, we are talking about a real multi-faceted usability expert, and not just a taxi driver who advises everyone and how to make websites, and how to lead the country)</i> : Teaching about being.  Monistic and pluralistic concepts of being, self-organization of being.  The concepts of material and ideal.  Movement and development, dialectics.  Determinism and indeterminism.  Dynamic and statistical patterns.  Scientific, philosophical and religious pictures of the world.  The meaning of human existence.  Violence and non-violence.  Freedom and responsibility.  Morality, justice, right.  Ideas about the perfect man in different cultures.  Aesthetic values ‚Äã‚Äãand their role in human life.  Religious values ‚Äã‚Äãand freedom of conscience.  Consciousness and cognition.  Consciousness, self-awareness and personality.  Cognition, creativity, practice.  Faith and knowledge.  Understanding and explanation.  Rational and irrational in cognitive activity.  The problem of truth.  Reality, thinking, logic and language.  Scientific and unscientific knowledge.  Criteria of science.  The structure of scientific knowledge, its methods and forms.  The growth of scientific knowledge.  Scientific revolutions and changes of types of rationality.  Interaction of civilizations and scenarios of the future. <br><br>  <b>Economy</b> <i>(that's right, the designer must also be able to earn money for the Customer)</i> : The principle of maximizing profits.  Offer a completely competitive firm and industry.  The effectiveness of competitive markets.  Market power.  Monopoly.  Monopolistic competition.  Oligopoly <br><br>  <b>Anthropology:</b> The problem of the origin of man;  individual human development and the constitution;  population and ethnic anthropology;  human ecology. <br><br>  <b>Anatomy and physiology</b> <i>(typical user)</i> : The microstructure of the nervous tissue;  ontogeny of the central nervous system;  the structure of the central nervous system;  pathways of the central nervous system and cranial nerves;  autonomic nervous system.  The contribution of neuroscience to the understanding of mental activity;  physiological patterns of embryonic and postnatal development of the brain;  fundamental processes - excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system;  physiology and neurochemistry of neurons;  somatic and autonomic nervous systems;  physiology of pain, the role of tachykinins and opiate receptors;  physiology of the autonomic nervous system;  organization of the bulbar respiratory center;  brain response to hypoxia and asphyxia, sudden breathing syndrome (the <i>spirit captured from the cool design on the site</i> );  the integration of autonomic, neuroendocrine and central regulation in the implementation of behavior based on basic biological motivations;  neural structures, sexual differentiation of the brain;  thermoregulation reflexes;  functions of the limbic system of the brain.  Basic concepts of the physiology of higher nervous activity;  mechanisms of associative learning, memory and individual differences, needs, motivation and emotions;  neural mechanisms for processing information in sensory systems. <br><br>  So far, nothing complicated, go ahead: <br><br>  <b>Psychogenetics:</b> Methods of psychogenetics and their resolution;  results of studies of hereditary and environmental determinants in the variability of psychological and psycho-physiological signs in individual development and some forms of diontogenesis;  place of psychogenetics in the system of psychological knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Psychodiagnostics</b> <i>(in fact - the same usual usability testing, only without giggling and strictly scientifically)</i> : projective, drawing techniques;  psychosemantic methods;  Conducting and interpreting 8-10 universal methodologies for the study of personality and intelligence: for example, the Minnesota Questionnaire (MMPI);  Cattell questionnaire (16 PF), Self-Attitude Relationship Research Method (MIS), Subjective Control Level (CSC), drawing techniques (RNZH, human figure), projective techniques (TAT, Rorschach test), intelligence tests (Wexler test);  principles of building a complex psychological portrait of a person;  psychodiagnostic tasks and acquisition of psychodiagnostic batteries.  Ethics, deontology and legal foundations of psychodiagnostics;  methods of psychological diagnosis. <br><br>  Developmental <b>Psychology</b> <i>(my favorite)</i> : The problem of the determinants of the child‚Äôs mental development;  the problem of the ratio of learning and development;  the problem of age and age periodization of mental development;  developmental crises;  infancy, early age, preschool age, younger school age;  psychological characteristics of adolescence and adolescence;  psychology of mature ages;  aging and old age;  personal development in conditions of deprivation and special conditions. <br><br>  Too many quotes already, huh?  But there are still exactly the same requirements for knowledge and skills in the areas of Pedagogical and Clinical Psychology, Labor Psychology and Psychophysiology, and even Special Psychology (well, this is about diontogenesis, you remember).  But I propose to set all these disciplines to special requirements already for the senor from UX, for the junior it will be quite enough to describe in detail the above skills of knowledge in order to fully call themselves a psychologist and an expert in user behavior.  Well, the portfolio at Dribble, as without it, the salaries of 200 thousand rubles because the road is not lying. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTzwjbMWLwg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxbKcHDHJuCZo1d7kwRYEGn55Sfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, I propose to use this article precisely as a checklist or even a questionnaire to test usability experts for compliance with the stated skills or as a test task to test real knowledge while recruiting a specialist for the next UX job.  Well so as not to accidentally hire an illustrator instead of a true connoisseur of man. <br><br>  The same will be true for another favorite usability self-name: ‚ÄúUser Advocates‚Äù.  I propose to find the official requirements for a lawyer practicing in Russia on their own and place them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296140/</a></p>
