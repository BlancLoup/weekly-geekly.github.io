  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computex 2012, or Ultrashow in Taiwan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today in the capital of Taiwan, the exhibition Computex has started.  "Getting Started" in this case is not the turn of speech, but the most appropriate description of what is happening.  The element of the show on Computex is relatively small, and became more or less noticeable only in recent years.  And initially it is a purely business exhibition where manufacturers of the most diverse IT products show their achievements and immediately offer to buy them. <br><br>  The presence of Intel on Computex is always felt, but this year it is stronger than ever.  No, seriously, the main innovations presented yesterday, on a zero day, are based on third-generation Core processors (also known as Ivy Bridge) and Intel Atom.  In this post there will be a lot of photos from different stands of the main Taiwanese IT exhibition, but believe me, this is only a very small and carefully selected part of the products that use Intel solutions.  Well, admire? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bd/d22/da6/4bdd22da68a84a492be2a95bca43202a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Acer, it seems, did not show any new product without a touch screen, and it does not matter that it is - an ultrabook, tablet computer or candy bar.  For some reason, Acer do not like to use even numbers in the names of their top products: the first ultrabook was called Aspire S3, the second Aspire S5, and the third ... yes, that's right, Aspire S7.  True, this time the name is one, and the ultrabook is two - with a diagonal of 11.6 and 13 inches (I wonder where they peeped at this idea? :)).

The ultrabook angle is as much as 180 degrees, and many will like it.  The battery life promises an impressive - up to 9 hours in the smaller ultrabook and up to 12 hours in the 13-inch.  True, we can be sure of the truthfulness of the promises only in the fall, when Windows 8 is released: all the capabilities of the touch screens will be revealed only under it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a98/c51/898/a98c518980668ede31cebfef0f66f97d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>New ultrabooks in the hands of the head of Acer Jay-T. Wan and a high-ranking employee of Microsoft with an impossible to remember last name</i> <br><br>  The Acer Iconia W700 tablet computer looks little different from today's counterparts, but inside it has a full-fledged third-generation Intel Core, and on board a full set of modern interfaces - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt and MicroHDMI (WiFi and Bluetooth would probably not even be ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/861/190/b4a/861190b4a88a32d6e8085020b3cd8676.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a99/788/491/a99788491cca31c03a61c338d6221ccd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>By the way, in this photo the girl is not only on the left, but also on the right.</i>  <i>Yes, yes, with mohawk.</i> <br><br>  The screen is 11.6 inches, also FullHD.  Battery life up to 8 hours.  Yes, I also do not really believe that this is possible, and in the fall it will certainly be necessary to check how long-lived the W700 will be.  By the way, the inside of the cooler, though small and quiet, is.  Only devices on the Intel Atom can do without it, and soon we will get to them. <br><br>  The loudest announcement of Asus was the Taichi transformer notebook.  Outwardly, it looks quite normal, until it is discovered that the lid is also ... a screen.  They, it turns out, two - both sensory, with a diagonal of 11.6 or 13 inches (they agreed, or what?) And a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  As planned by the company, two people will be able to use this combine simultaneously.  For example, mother sits and works, and the child is located opposite and watches cartoons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fed/5a6/c59/fed5a6c596c538ef5a1efb18bd047023.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Taichi for the first time demonstrates the head of Asus, Johnny Shi himself</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/8ad/9f6/19c8ad9f661f12ac5f73b4c8235fac32.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Hero of the day near</i> <br><br>  How much such a model is applicable in practice, we will know before the end of the year.  And everything works, as usual, on a third-generation Core running Windows 8. Asus will have both new touchscreen ultrabooks and tablet PCs that connect to the keyboard and turn into a full-fledged computer.  All of them will come to us together with the new Microsoft operating system, which the head of Acer publicly called the most important event in the computer industry since the days of Windows 95. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/eb7/f27/ab1eb7f272af45c2e72511ad7d66153a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5e/2a3/b68/f5e2a3b6880d8f00efb1b302be577076.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the morning, I visited another Asus presentation, where they showed, without exaggeration, luxurious products for gamers (Asus can not take it away) using the latest Intel solutions (of course, we are not talking about headsets, external graphics accelerators and audio cards).  Again, convinced that if you give a piece of iron in the hands of the right girl, look at both of them becomes a pleasure to triple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4b/5a3/07a/c4b5a307a2d376b85ecab35bccd8fa7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After admiring both those and others, I went to the main pavilion of Computex.  All roads there inevitably lead to the Intel stand, because it is a) hefty and b) located right in the center of the main, fourth floor.  Immediately the stand with smartphones on the Intel Atom catches your eye.  If we met the Lenovo device at CES, then I could not see the Lava Xolo X900 alive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55b/d1b/112/55bd1b112202ba55a90ef75db6fc4d8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is intended for the Indian market, but does not look a bit budget.  Normal such a smartphone, nice to pick up.  If you do not officially get to our edges, you will have to buy on eBay.  By the way, I wonder if they will make the fourth version of Android for it?  Yet 2.3 by now is undignified. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5eb/e24/879/5ebe24879f87f3c1481ab703c1cbdbbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08e/d5b/2cd/08ed5b2cd5d9bd100a1398815006efb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The owner of the stand gave me some races to play - with smoke from under the wheels, fragments of glass flying apart in different directions upon impact and other special effects.  On the screen of the smartphone, of course, everything looks great.  But he was connected via HDMI to a TV with a non-weak diagonal, and even on it, the picture was decent.  Honestly, I never connected my smartphones with TVs in my life, although the HDMI interface appeared on some models a year and a half ago.  But for the sake of these games you can try.  Here are just a decent TV buy, but then I have it just hanging in the kitchen and quite small :) <br><br>  The main characters of the stand of Intel and the exhibition in general are ultrabooks and tablet PCs.  It is impossible not to notice the "ultrabook tree", which arrived in Taipei from Las Vegas, only the "fruits" on it have been significantly updated since CES.  Even seemingly well-known models (for example, Acer Aspire S3) have received a new filling, and now they are working not only faster, but also, and even more important, longer.  Well, as for the new products, they have grown up in a diagonal (up to 15 inches), got support for USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt without exception, and it seems they have learned to differ from each other.  No, of course, the generic similarity remains, however, I seem to distinguish the LG Asus ultrabook from even five meters away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/d6a/b83/367d6ab8392727d27572ed32323a257f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdc/ba3/d87/bdcba3d87b6c6384860c57b0efba6893.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc4/fd1/31b/cc4fd131b17880a02dfb13445215d057.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/191/920/f341919202d0e0f9443f7dc7a78b969a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ab/e28/50b/0abe2850b29f640984f4a743f61e8846.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b10/30e/7d9/b1030e7d90b3c787e4d7225e529fc805.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54f/03f/587/54f03f587b8a2b7873c1bc54412724bc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This stand demonstrates the ability to run 3D video in FullHD on an ultrabook and display on a large screen.</i>  <i>Indeed, it looked, not without pleasure, like a man snowboarding</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93c/92d/17b/93c92d17b6679620427c8b325b040f23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here on the built-in graphics without hesitation one famous game is spinning.</i>  <i>I played a little bit.</i>  <i>Well, it didn't work out very well ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73d/75d/d8e/73d75dd8ed554fd8e51476f1ab804375.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>I wanted this red one.</i> <br><br>  By the way, now ultrabooks have their own branded sticker of a standard look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/013/d7d/e77/013d7de776d209e3cff86d40652846a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And, since it hit the shot, I can't help but praise some models for a good sound.  Everything ends with the era of mid-frequency beeper.  HP uses Beats technology in its top models, Asus collaborates with Bang &amp; Olufsen.  And this is good. <br><br>  More on Computex show a lot of devices that support the interface Thunderbolt.  There were many assumptions about its usefulness in the presence of USB 3.0, but it went, the Thunderbolt went to the people.  Of course, the most widely used variety of NAS - from very simple to corporate. <br>  But as far as I understand, this is only the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/e98/c24/052e98c24f18050e5364f4bd21b4bfc1.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c42/8da/83d/c428da83dfd2a9c31b4119bc875806b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As we remember, the power of Thunderbolt is in its versatility, and you can connect both the drive and the monitor.  How do you, for example, have such an Asus motherboard?  Well, the truth is a work of art, and it is even a shame that you will mainly watch it only when building a computer.  And on Thunderbolt you can connect up to six devices at the same time ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/651/9ee/f04/6519eef04221664e016e8952450c0644.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the new netbook, Computex Kings 2008 and 2009, this year just a little bit.  But they turned out ... unbanal.  For example, how do you get such a blue baby from Samsung? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/aeb/c33/69caebc33176d15f2915a6699b87e21e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can drop it on a hard surface from a height of 70 centimeters, pour a glass of water onto it, and even the cat's claws can withstand the screen surface if your pussy decides to play Fruit Ninja.  Add to this the latest version of the Intel Atom platform, 10 hours of use from a standard battery, start in 2 seconds, the HDMI port, and think about whether it‚Äôs too early to bury this type of computer?  After all, for children nothing better has yet been invented (except for a good book and patient parents, of course). <br><br>  At the Microsoft booth, I looked at two more interesting laptops.  The first, ultraprotected, made by Panasonic and, probably, will be useful to the avid travelers.  With the Toughbook CF-19, you can, without exaggeration, hammer nails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/aea/9a0/26faea9a0f70882fef39418519ee0741.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Toshiba mobile computer, of course, is not so brutal, but it has a very interesting 14-inch aspect ratio.  This is not the usual 16: 9, and all 21: 9.  I remember that Acer produced a smartphone with the same ‚Äúlong‚Äù screen, but it was adjusted and completed for a very long time, and when the Iconia Smart appeared on the shelves, the iron part turned out to be slightly outdated.  In general, "did not go."  In the case of a laptop, troubles from a non-standard screen resolution can arise only in not very carefully written games, and otherwise, there seems to be no disharmony.  Well, watching a movie on such a machine is a pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/8e4/f43/2848e4f430d96f6d94e51b74c3e938e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to all the characteristics, the Toshiba Satellite U845W resembles an ultrabook, and its filling is quite serious.  And even the memory is not the usual 4 gigabytes, but all 6. <br><br>  In conclusion, the first post with Computex - about a single tablet.  It is called Lenovo ThinkPad and in the fall should appear on the shelves.  It looks restrained and solid, as befits the representatives of this sub-brand.  Thin - just like an iPhone 4s.  Windows 8 works perfectly smoothly on it, as if inside is not a dual-core Atom, but something more serious.  And no propellers inside! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c7/759/0b4/5c77590b4f4fbbd7ea46da2efe24c294.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94e/899/dd6/94e899dd65f21641d784e1f536e0a271.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Heat is released so little that they are not required.  And I remembered here a fragment from the biography of Steve Jobs on the development of the iPad.  There, after all, it was originally planned to use Atom, but it was precisely the need for a cooler that the untimely IT wizard did not like.  That did not grow together.  But how now - will grow together? <br><br>  So for now.  We have 4 hours here, and tomorrow from early morning again at the exhibition.  If you believe the first impression, this Computex - the most interesting in my memory.  Well, that did not forget to take a spare battery for the camera: one for the whole day is categorically not enough. <br><br>  PS Not sure that next to this girl there are any solutions based on Intel products.  But good, eh?  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9f/b71/ff0/c9fb71ff0be2f1f97797e537a44217bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A few more informal photos with Computex I posted <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/news/neformalnye-zarisovki-s-nulevogo-dnya-computex-2012_1923.html">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145279/</a></p>
