      Record players have repeatedly met in the stylish interiors of "cool" heroes who appreciate the details and are willing to pay for them.  In the working pavilion of “genius, millionaire, playboy and philanthropist” Tony Stark, along with combat suits, <a href="">you can see a</a> classic player.  The forums even <a href="http://theartofsound.net/forum/showthread.php%3F25992-So-what-were-the-turntables-Tony-Stark-(Ironman)-used">argue</a> which model was preferred by the “iron man”.  This part of the film fits into the stylish setting of a superhero's home. <br><br>  Vinyl will not go out of fashion even in the distant future, according to the scenario “Start track: Retribution”.  Captain Kirk is another brutal movie hero with good taste.  In his room there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1mevnn/james_kirks_vinyl_and_hi_fi_setup_from_star_trek/">retro turntable</a> with a tube amplifier, on which the Beach Boys disc is played in one of the scenes.  This element softens the image of the "tough hero", brings nostalgic notes to the scene - and makes us feel connected with a distant future, in which not everything is alien to the modern viewer. <br><br><h2>  Player as an attribute of a music lover or musician </h2><br>  Music lovers preferred vinyl <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/arts/music-lovers-are-voting-for-vinyl.html">20 years ago</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10772929/Music-fans-opting-for-CDs-vinyl-and-cassettes-over-MP3s-even-if-they-never-actually-play-them.html">continue to do it</a> today.  Therefore, directors use records when they want to reveal a deeper image of a character who is passionate about music. <br><br>  Vinyl occasionally appears in Woody Allen films, but in “Something Else,” he has a special role.  The main characters choose plates in the store and discuss the merits of vinyl over dinner.  “CDs kill real sound,” concludes Amanda.  Here the records are the link between two music lovers and ideological fans of vinyl. <br><br>  The main character of the film “Who is there?” Is the architect Evan.  He has a stylish home that reflects not only the artistic but also musical tastes of the hero - there is a place for a vinyl player, and for some time he becomes an important component of the plot.  In one of the scenes, Evan <a href="https://youtu.be/hK2Em4D7fhU">includes</a> music for the player for his guest, and then he himself stands "at the turntables." <br><br>  In the musical “La La Land” the room of the main character - a promising jazz pianist - is modestly furnished.  But for musical instruments and accessories the place was found.  Next to the piano is a classic turntable.  <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/gallery/image.php%3Fmode%3Dlarge%26image_id%3D41201">This</a> whole <a href="https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/gallery/image.php%3Fmode%3Dlarge%26image_id%3D41201">frame</a> is based on associations - a piano, a turntable, even a desk lamp - they all seemed to have moved straight into the room of the main character from the “jazz era”.  And the neighborhood of the player with a musical instrument shows that for Sebastian (unlike the character Keanu Reeves from “Who is there?”) Listening to music is not only fun, but also work. <br><br><h2>  Vinyl as an “independent hero” </h2><br>  In some films, the plates play an even more significant role.  With the help of bright covers and stylish players, directors and cameramen manage to convey certain ideas that are important to the film as a whole. <br><br>  For example, in the recently released film “Hearts Beating Loudly”, production director Eric Lin (Eric Lin) <a href="https://filmmakermagazine.com/104270-i-wanted-the-film-to-have-the-tactile-feel-of-the-vinyl-sound-dp-eric-lin-on-hearts-beat-loud/">wanted to convey the</a> “tactile sensation” of vinyl.  To do this, selected special light sources and lenses.  One of the main characters has a record shop - the director’s vision of a “warm tube” atmosphere is also embodied in the interior of the room. <br><br>  According to the plot of the film “Cloud Atlas”, the symphony of the same name is published in limited edition on vinyl.  This is reportedly with the knowledge of an employee of the record store.  This technique allows us to emphasize the value and uniqueness of the composition, which unites fate, history and the passage of time in the film.  Some viewers even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1rmrq3/the_cloud_atlas_sextet/">began to look for</a> records in real life.  By the way, they were really released. <br><br>  Records often appear in Quentin Tarantino films.  They serve as a backdrop for various scenes, set the mood, give food for thought about the character of a particular hero.  The director himself collects vinyl, and the stylish music on the retro media fits perfectly into the atmosphere of his tapes.  In the film “Proof of Death”, a piece of Tarantino’s personal collection was captured - the disc was <a href="https://www.ifc.com/2014/09/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-death-proof">played by</a> his own jukebox. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/_y/xw/gg_yxww60o3lfymy8q_719bnj_o.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/352672">Pxhere</a> PD Photos</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Emotional episode </h2><br>  Cinema music also serves as a tool that <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5551.html">sets the viewer</a> to certain expectations.  For example, in one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR_yogtJ59cg">scenes of</a> "Constantine" the main character replenishes his arsenal, and on the player in the background plays the classic composition "Take Five", setting the scene a little relaxed, measured tone.  So the viewer understands that there is nothing surprising in the deadly weapon against the demons from the underworld for Konstantin himself - it is quite a “common thing”. <br><br>  Sometimes the creators of paintings use music to set the viewer to empathize with the hero.  For example, in one of the most emotional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DO7mv9QJSEuE">scenes of the</a> film “The Hunter” a woman who lost her husband suddenly hears the song “I'm on Fire” for herself.  The desperate heroine wakes up for the first time during the entire film, believing that her husband has returned home.  In fact, the player turned on by itself due to a generator failure. <br><br><h2>  Plates as a weapon </h2><br>  This way of showing vinyl in movies is hardly common, but it has been used in several films. <br><br>  The "Mechanics" showed, perhaps, the most deadly audio system in the history of cinema.  Arthur Bishop, the character of Jason Statham, urged his protégé not to touch his <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/proigryvatel_vinila/pro-ject/pro-ject_rpm_9-2_evolution.html">Pro-Ject RPM 9.2</a> player with his hands.  However, this did not prevent him from later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1f7874ZUJpA">using the</a> device as a detonator and blowing the whole house with him. <br><br>  The heroes of "Zombie by the name of Shawn" are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOQDMj2sZtNM">shot by</a> records from the living dead.  It is noteworthy that even in such an extreme situation, they selectively approach the music collection and do not launch their favorite albums into zombies. <br><br>  <i><b>Of course, we have described far from all the examples of the appearance of vinyl and the ways it is used by directors in cinema.</b></i>  <i><b>Therefore, it will be interesting to know which "vinyl scenes" from the films you remember.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>What else to read on the subject - materials from our " <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/vinyl-academy-pro-ject/">Academy of Vinyl</a> ":</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5697.html">My first vinyl player: review of 5 optimal systems</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5646.html">10 releases of 2018 on vinyl, which you should definitely listen to</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQWGZp6cg66M">Vinyl to the cinema: through the eyes of a film director</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5663.html">10 hits of all times and nations on vinyl</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8YS1uOJ8vQU">My first vinyl player - where to start?</a> </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374517/</a></p>
