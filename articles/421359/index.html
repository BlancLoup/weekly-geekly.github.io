Taxonomy IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l_/ei/cx/l_eicxsgr4mgcnzwfuk532fgzm4.png"><br></p><br><p>  For the following story, it is very important that I have been playing games since childhood.  In the 11th grade, the school could hardly retell the ore deposits of the Novosibirsk Region, but could easily draw a map of the Valley of Mines on Khorinis (Gothic 1) from memory.  In the fall of 2012, he left the position of the Jimist timlid to cut a <a href="http://playtox.ru/">mobile MMO RPG</a> as a PHP junior. </p><br><p>  Why am I all this? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Recently, I went to the website of the Techtrain festival to read, why go there.  <a href="https://techtrain.ru/participant/">The page looked</a> like the picture above. </p><br><p>  With trembling hands, immediately drinking a bottle of health, I proceeded to digest the information.  Something in this <em>‚Äúreason to go‚Äù</em> typology is subtly familiar. </p><br><p>  Oh yeah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types">Bartle's psycho</a> !  Let me remind you that about 30 years ago, a professor at the University of Essex, Richard Alan Bartl, came up with how to divide players into several psycho-types, and on the basis of this, he started one of the first multiplayer games, MUD (Multi-User Dungeon). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/df9/752/4c4df9752ebf4e7485af61d2bf5fb584.png"><br><p>  Detailed article about it is easy to <a href="https://habr.com/company/mailru/blog/263839/">find on Habr√©</a> or <a href="https://dtf.ru/flood/18123-psihologicheskie-tipy-igrokov-v-mmo">DTF</a> .  This is such a dupe that you should not stop at this. </p><br><p>  At its core, psycho-types are a very rigid system, resulting from the intersection of two axes of coordinates, and therefore not even providing extensions.  It is clear that the real world is cruel, and in modern MMO players segmentation is much thinner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bd/da1/bdb/3bdda1bdba7decb95e5363e01e05635e.png"><br><br></p><br><p>  Let's look at the original causes as they look through the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">PTSD of</a> anyone who has gone through endless network wars. </p><br><h1 id="issledovateli">  Researchers </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ok/kr/jo/okkrjouvof0w-kwb_6ikb-k0df4.gif"><br></p><br><p>  If you read Habr and get to this post, it is highly likely that you are a researcher. </p><br><p>  Researchers are those who like to study the world (in games - the virtual world and the game universe) and try to understand everything.  Not only in what is needed for victory, but <em>in everything</em> . </p><br><p>  It is because of you, my dear ones, that the program of conferences has to be reconciled for months and forced the speakers to lick the reports even in the most difficult places.  There will definitely be a person who will look at all the reports in general and try to understand everything said and drawn on the slides. </p><br><p>  In February 2017, there was a lecture at the Graduate School of Business Informatics, in which data slipped that researchers are the least monetized audience. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/jb/9w/vqjb9wa3zgxsajgy1mn_ys0kc-i.png"><br></p><br><p>  IMHO, the previous article <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/420643/">‚ÄúAlmost everything is the same, only 10 times cheaper‚Äù,</a> Alexey wrote just for researchers.  The fact is that researchers have a problem - all this costs both money and time.  Researchers are not greedy, but they are physically unable to go to all relevant conferences in the world.  The reduced cost allows not to choose between the <a href="https://chaosconstructions.ru/">ChaosConstructions</a> (which was last week) and Techtrain, but to go to both festivals at once, having gone to the budget. </p><br><p>  If you are a researcher, you will appreciate one more Techtrain chip: all the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/">speakers</a> and their <a href="https://techtrain.ru/">presentations</a> at other conferences could well be keyouts.  I will explain in a nutshell the difference between keyout and a regular report.  Keynouts are opening and closing.  The opening ones are needed to set the spirit and meaning of the upcoming conference.  Closing ones are needed to sum up the experience gained.  Usually, the brightest and capacious reports are selected as keyouts, which then inevitably receive top marks from the participants.  In Techtrain, the <em>entire</em> program consists of such people and reports. </p><br><p>  This is a direct sense concentrate, as if trying to dry on a dry bag of Yupi. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/4fe/d9d/8804fed9dbc03abf05ecbe90d8f84eb9.jpg"><br></p><br><blockquote>  Heading "Useless Facts".  Yuppie stands for Young Urban Professional, a young urban professional.  Youth subculture whose representatives lead a conformist generally accepted way of life of a person of modern Western society.  Yuppi have a high-paying job, they prefer business style in clothes, they follow fashion, they visit fitness centers.  The main criterion for belonging to "yuppie" - success. </blockquote><p>  Of course, all reports do not go.  Reports 48, and only two days.  But there will be videos.  Records makes sense to watch. </p><br><h1 id="killery">  Killers </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d0/4r/mk/d04rmkrof1dcje3lggmg3mcjvgg.gif"><br></p><br><p>  Everyone has at least one friend who says without hesitation why he goes to festivals or conferences.  For example: <em>"I am going to find a better job</em> . <em>"</em>  Or, <em>"I'm going to find the best Python specialist</em> . <em>"</em>  Better than everyone else.  These are people who clearly know their interests, intend to achieve them at all costs and <em>love</em> to do it. </p><br><p>  In computer games, killers are the most monetized audience.  People with this psychotype are usually given various buns (premium accounts, for example), which allow you to achieve exactly what they want.  On the TT, of course, there is nothing like that.  <a href="https://techtrain.ru/registration/">Tickets</a> are only divided into categories Junior / Senior / Business (the first two differ in the age of the participant, the latter makes it possible to pay from the legal entity on the account).  All very honest. </p><br><p>  Fortunately, the rest of the infrastructure can help the killers.  For example, if you already decided to find a job, then there are only officially registered companies - 19 pieces for every taste, and yet there will be, and most importantly, all other visitors working in a pile of IT companies that can be called for dialogue and achieve the desired results.  Tools are there, then everything depends on your skill. </p><br><p>  Killers love competitions, tournaments and ratings.  This allows them to feel alive, visually see their superiority.  Do you know who else loves competition?  Companies that put up stands at the exhibition. </p><br><h2 id="chto-mozhno-delat-na-stende-kompanii">  What can you do at the company booth? </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/uk/cy/ogukcyxudmzjnjccahzjbwr--hc.gif"><br></p><br><p>  I will not list all companies at all, because their number is unimaginable.  I'll take the first two randomly. </p><br><h3 id="skb-kontur">  SKB Kontur </h3><br><p>  First day: </p><br><ol><li><p>  "Blind code."  All you have is a keyboard and keys.  Separately.  And, of course, the task that needs to be programmed.  Try to do it the fastest! </p><br></li><li><p>  "Decoder".  You need to show your knowledge in ciphers and find out which words are encrypted.  Complete several rounds and participate in the lottery! </p><br></li></ol><br><p>  On the second day: </p><br><ol><li>  "IT-crossword."  It's simple: this is a crossword puzzle, in which words from the IT world are made up.  For all the guessed words you can participate in the lottery. </li></ol><br><h3 id="krok">  CROC </h3><br><p>  At this booth, you can check your outlook and ingenuity in the IT quiz, compete for company prizes. </p><br><p>  You should upgrade yourself not only mentally, but also physically, by developing a sense of balance on a balance board. </p><br><p>  For fans of football, IT-technology and everything unusual at this booth will be a cyber attraction that has no analogues - Robofootball. </p><br><p>  But in general, this is a booth for networking.  Here you can learn about the latest projects and the atmosphere in the company from the experts of the company.  The team will even have a sociable robot, which you can ask 100 and 1 question about KROK, or charge your gadgets. </p><br><h1 id="socialschiki">  Social workers </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/qv/rl/xeqvrle-nseqp_npgodbigc8ace.gif"><br></p><br><p>  Social workers are those participants who consider the process of communication with other participants, speakers, company representatives, and so on, to be considered more important than watching reports or trying to win prizes on stands (solving coder tasks of mind-blowing complexity). </p><br><p>  These are people who go to events to see others and to show themselves.  If some competitions make sense, then competitions in popularity, they bring real pleasure.  How does Baruh Sadogursky like to joke, ‚Äúvanity and marketing‚Äù, putting vanity in the first place. </p><br><p>  Techtrain is a ‚Äúfestival‚Äù, not a ‚Äúconference‚Äù.  This is an important difference.  The reports here are really not the main thing.  There will be a lot of participants, a really huge crowd of people.  There will be communities ( <a href="https://techtrain.ru/participant/technology/">22 officially registered</a> ).  The site is now announced a list of 19 companies. </p><br><p>  Social workers are usually the most active members of communities.  They do not need to be taught what to do, so, dear guests, let's raise the height! </p><br><h1 id="kareristy">  Careerists </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/yh/ix/o5yhixaueuyipffveafipmvxq8k.gif"><br></p><br><p> Who are careerists in games - it is clear, these are the comrades who have collected the maximum number of achivok, who have bought all the most legendary skins, who have given up the most rare and expensive resources. </p><br><p>  For conferences, everything is more complicated, because in the real world it is much harder to collect achivki.  It takes more time, you need to walk more with your feet, spend more money.  Weak to walk in general to all relevant conferences in Moscow during the year?  But the corresponding reward. </p><br><p>  As part of the Techtrain, there is a lot of entertainment where you can get interesting nishtyaki. </p><br><p>  Let's take a look at the dungeon map and try to squeeze everything out of it: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/lh/2n/gqlh2nvnko-1fgftknkwwndvkgo.png"><br></p><br><p>  <em>List of quests</em> : </p><br><ul><li>  Try to visit the report in each of the four rooms.  They are different! </li><li>  Task: approach each stand of communities and companies.  Drag off some nishtyaki from them if they distribute them. </li><li>  Task [difficult]: talk a few minutes with key speakers and take a selfie. </li><li>  Be sure to eat.  Food can be photographed and put in instagram. </li></ul><br><p>  Idea: you can perform tasks collectively.  That is, if you came to Tehtrain in the company of friends or with colleagues, you can walk on the stands together.  Or vice versa - separately, and then compare the results. </p><br><h1 id="ozarenie">  Insight </h1><br><p>  Every author of an article using pop pseudoscientific classifications tries to add something of his own to them.  Especially zaboristoe and especially wild. </p><br><p>  I propose to introduce another axis through which an additional level of meaning will stand out: the level of understanding of the development.  A kind of techish chauvinism, if you want.  And what, I have the right to IT-festival something! </p><br><p>  The fact is that the more a person understands some technologies, the more distant depths of meaning open to him. </p><br><p>  Poetically, this can be represented as the game mechanics of <a href="http://ru.bloodborne.wikia.com/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Insight (Insight)</a> in Bloodborne.  This is the level of inhuman knowledge of the hero, and the characteristic responsible for the ability to perceive the game world, and the second currency of the game. </p><br><p>  With a sufficiently large Illumination, the game world begins to look a little different.  For example, in the game there are a lot of ‚ÄúAmigdal‚Äù (although these are, rather, projections of the Great bearing the name of Amigdal), they become visible after the rising of the red moon (after killing Rum or receiving 40 insights) - in Yaa'rgul and in the Cathedral District. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J93ikwFFuws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  In Bloodborne, one point of insight can be obtained by spending Madman's Knowledge.  It looks like a skull with the following description: </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j5/et/wr/j5etwr2gfci7gnr-sbsaseqdb_a.png">  ‚ÄúThe skull of a madman whom the wisdom of the Great has touched. </p><br><p>  Use to get Illumination. </p><br><p>  Touching secret wisdom is a blessing, even if it is fraught with madness.  It allows us to serve the highest goal in the name of descendants. ‚Äù <br><br clear="all"></p><br><p>  On Techtrain enlightenment points are obtained by listening to reports.  All kinds of roofing hardcore.  And what did you think got into a fairy tale?  At events JUG.ru Group without hardcore anywhere! </p><br><p>  I will give a few examples. </p><br><h2 id="mashinnoe-obuchenie">  Machine learning </h2><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l-/bt/fl/l-btflesmj_opn90jcqaffq_les.png">  Gradient boosting is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms.  This algorithm helps to solve regression, classification and ranking problems on heterogeneous data.  Using gradient boosting in Yandex, they select the most relevant documents for answering search queries, rank musical compositions, predict the weather, and solve many other problems. </p><br><p>  CatBoost is a library of gradient boosting, written in Yandex and laid out in open access.  The report will explain what a gradient boosting is, how it is used, how CatBoost differs from other libraries, how to train models on big data with the help of it, and how to work with different types of data - numerical and categorical. </p><br><p>  All this <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/nzbwrjnxoqwiio8wmuqww/">will tell Vasily Ershov</a> from Yandex. </p><br><p>  If you don‚Äôt understand anything about machine learning, it all looks like Knowledge of a Madman and definitely gives you 1 point of Insight. </p><br><p>  This does not end there.
