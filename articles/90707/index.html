    <h6>  Prehistory </h6><br>  Once upon a time I came across an interesting <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/EvilDog/z-rox">Z-Rox</a> flash game on the Internet. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is simple to ugliness, but at the same time surprisingly good. <br>  This is a kind of one-dimensional puzzle, an unknown character is scanned from top to bottom and all you see is a thin horizontal strip that constantly changes its width.  By the way, this also explains the name of the game, consonant with the well-known word Xerox. <br>  These dashed dashes need to guess what kind of character. <br>  Hopefully explained is available, although it's easier to just try it yourself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/067/55b/df2/06755bdf268e28e9196d916819fe37f3.png"><br><br>  The game is English-speaking, contains 100 levels, but this is not the point, this is only a preface. <br><br><h6>  Now to the point </h6><br>  I have a hobby - programming for the iPhone, or rather the iPhone OS. <br>  A lot of ideas, free time is zero, I want to try everything, I want to do everything.  Of course, it‚Äôs not enough to bring to mind very little, it‚Äôs not possible to stay with one project for a long time, it becomes boring and it‚Äôs harder to motivate yourself. <br>  Therefore, I am particularly attracted to ideas that are very interesting and, at first glance, simple to implement. <br><br>  That's why my eyes lit up when I stumbled upon this toy once again.  I realized that there is practically nothing to implement. <br>  One png with a transparent strip in the middle, followed by a UILabel with letters of the alphabet, numbers and Unicode characters from top to bottom.  The alphabet is large, unicode too, 100 levels will be typed at once. <br><br>  One confused, ugly somehow. <br>  The idea is wonderful, but I did not come up with it, and I did not want to steal stupidly. <br>  But my hands itch! <br>  In the end I decided to write to the developer of the original game and asked him head on: ‚Äúwhat if I borrow an idea?‚Äù.  Well, no, of course not so in the forehead and not in such words, but he asked. <br>  He answered quickly.  In short, he told me thanks for respecting the work of others and added that he himself is working on a toy port for iPhone and other platforms. <br><br>  Well, no luck, my hands itch no longer ... for a couple of days. <br>  After all, literally at the same time, a colleague at work suggested instead of scanning with a strip to drive a sector in a circle, as on a radar. <br>  At first I didn‚Äôt undertake the implementation, then it seemed that the original idea with the strip was the most original and any attempts to move away from it already made the game not so interesting. <br>  But I decided to try. <br><br>  Several weeks of coding in the evenings, running through focus groups ‚Äúcolleague‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, inept picking photoshop to give the program at least some appearance, 3 versions wrapped back by Apple (using copyrighted pictures) and in the final the game gets upstairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c72/0eb/d50/c720ebd50830e8e745fe43a4cf65f720.png"><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id355479154%3Fmt%3D8">Link to the game in the AppStore</a> <br><br>  I'm still sure that everything in the application is very simple. <br>  However, some people get stuck at 2nd level, and one only man managed to get stuck on the first one and write about it in his review. <br><br><h6>  Some facts </h6><br><ul><li>  The game is completely free, contains built-in iAd advertising, rather unobtrusive. </li><li>  To work, you need a firmware device not younger than version 4.0. </li><li>  The game is localized into 2 languages: English and Russian, and this is not just a translation, but in many ways a different set of levels.  In addition to the used alphabet, only in the Russian version one can meet some cartoon characters and Internet memes that are not familiar to the western man in the street. </li><li>  On the radar can be not only ASCII or UNICODE characters, but also arbitrary images. </li><li>  OpenFeint is supported, namely their Leaderboards and Achivki. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  Thank you so much for comments and advice on firmware support 3.1. <br>  Indeed, setting the Target Platform, Weak linking for iAd and conditional coding using NSClassFromString solved the problem. <br><br>  Special thanks for the feedback in the AppStore indicating the flaw in multitasking support. <br><br>  Just collected and sent for review a version that: <br><ol><li>  Works on firmware since 3.1 </li><li>  Competently supports multitasking (progress is saved and animation restarts) </li><li>  Gives much more than before OpenFeint points for achivki </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90707/</a></p>
