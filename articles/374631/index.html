Something went wrong there.  And the matter is not in some functional or iron characteristics, but in the presentation itself. <br><br>  Her motto was ‚ÄúMore Bigger.‚Äù  When you hear it, you feel the cold of an impersonal march of progress.  There is something completely artificial in this sensation, something like touching a cold gland. <br>  We do not expect new technologies from Apple.  We expect to receive human warmth, the opportunity to make our lives more conscious and fruitful. <br><br>  <b>Let's go through those parts of the presentation that seemed weak and see how Steve could shake off the dust.</b>

    <h4>  Feeling anxious </h4><br>  The presentation begins with an analogue of something like a Prezi with small patches of text. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245890/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/4dc/cc3/d9d4dccc3b7a4cc1807e7f18e2c8bb09.jpg" width="500"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/a68/6fb/1a2a686fb7bf49cf8c21b6ec812fbef1.jpg" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c32/b60/411/c32b6041168145ec9a327c279c255e77.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  <i>While everyone else is chasing new products, you appreciate only those that really benefit.</i> <br><br>  Everyone already had an understanding of this Apple concept, and too much underlining the fact that the main thing was the benefit, not the speed of the product, looked like a defensive gesture from the company. <br><br>  Even if we are talking about companies, we treat with respect only those who demonstrate confidence and not a feeling of anxiety.  Under Jobs, Apple would never have come up with such weak slogans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/9d9/d61/b2f9d9d614c043b5a5c7db43a8ecfdc8.png" width="500"><br><h4>  iPhone 6 </h4><br>  There must be only one obvious, instinctive reason to buy an iPhone 6. The enlarged screen is a weak suggestion for one of the company's flagship products.  It is simply a derivative of existing products on the market, which does not allow to demonstrate differences from competitors. <br><br>  And the fact that this statement contradicts Steve's original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe iPhone (‚ÄúNobody will buy just a big phone‚Äù), suppresses the image of the novelty and confuses the audience. <br><br>  The trouble is that the fate of the iPhone 6 depends on improvements that seem secondary: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù in all respects - this slogan covers improvements under the hood, left without detailed coverage. </li><li>  Apple Pay is a payment system based on NFC technology. </li><li>  IOS 8 features related to user health. </li><li>  Improved camera. </li></ul><br>  <b>Instead of the usual:</b> <br><br>  Apple: We have the perfect product making X. <br>  You: Oh my God, I have to buy it. <br><br>  <b>We got the following:</b> <br><br>  Apple: We have a product that makes X, Y, Z, and more A and B. <br>  You: It seems that X would be useful to me, but A and B also look good. <br><br>  This happens because product developers want to play it safe.  There is a possibility that X alone may not be enough.  The obvious solution to the problem is to add new characteristics until something for everyone appears. <br><br>  Thanks to Steve Jobs, this fear has disappeared.  There was an invulnerable, almost sacred assurance that he had something that you would definitely love.  We had a clear reason why we would go to the Apple store after the presentation and buy this phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/338/dec/6db/338dec6dbf1745edb9f62d3edc62481d.png" width="500"><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch </h4><br>  This watch is confusing.  They have too many variations.  And this is a very gross mistake of the company. <br><br>  Instead of a simple and perfect product, we got a random selection of features and options to choose from.  Apple Watch was supposed to be the very one that people would call the ‚ÄúDivine Clock‚Äù and associate with the second coming. <br><br>  It is easy to fall in love with the <b>very product</b> .  The iPod was the same.  The iPhone was there.  Apple Watch was presented in sixty variations. <br><br>  It's really hard to make everyone want something the same.  When asked to think about Apple Watch, people can not articulate for themselves their clear image.  Can you imagine a 2007 iPhone with 6 different designs that meet consumer requirements? <br><br>  If you come up with the same design, the only canonical image of the clock will be formed.  One great gadget.  If in this case someone mentioned Apple Watch, you would immediately have a clear image in your head. <br><br>  It‚Äôs like a search for your future husband or wife among sixty people.  Sixty different personalities, hobbies and oddities that need to be understood.  Sixty different people with whom you can build relationships, and all this is complicated by the fear that you will choose the wrong one. <br><br>  <b>You would be much more pleased to meet a single person.</b>  <b>The one you would know about - he is the best.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/53a/c8b/10653ac8bf7945898df53fb4e44357c4.png" width="500"><br><br>  Most of all, I was afraid that this presentation would cast a shadow over the entire industry of ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù.  The creators of Apple Watch needed to answer only one main question: What are they for? <br><br>  The presentation began immediately with an introductory video, the main theme of which was: "Apple Watch - beautiful and personal." <br><br>  All that was left for you was to sit and think: ‚ÄúYes, they are great, but why should they?‚Äù  Instead of a message about ‚Äúthis cool new gadget,‚Äù the description should have read as follows: <b>‚ÄúThis is a clear interface that we lacked so much</b> . <b>‚Äù</b> <br><br>  It made the general impression that this is a gadget for techies.  Perhaps this development will return in the future (iPad, for example, also did not immediately come to its current appearance), but it definitely doesn‚Äôt compare with the launch of the iPhone. <br><br>  By presenting the watch as "The most personal device ever existed," Apple did not make it personal.  It's like love - you have to feel it, and not just talk about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/e2c/f4f/233e2cf4f53044698f3621ae0b23439e.png" width="200"><br>  <i>I don‚Äôt like the way Apple uses its traditional apple logo in the name of each product.</i>  <i>This makes Apple more vulnerable.</i>  <i>The very name ‚ÄúThe Apple‚Äù should stand out, shine in the rays of its comprehensive, innovative and legendary fame, and not flicker in the name of each product.</i> <br><br>  Here are the names of the revolutionary personal devices: iPod, iPhone, iPad.  So it would be right to call the iWatch watch after all. <br><br><h4>  Presentation by Steve Jobs </h4><br>  And now let's see how Steve Jobs introduced the new iPhone and the new wearable gadget, about which there were so many rumors. <br><br><blockquote>  Apple Special Event - Flint Center, 10 am, September 9, 2014, Cupertino, California. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ae/b0c/2d9/7aeb0c2d99e14bc09d37d0535021967f.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (The doors open and the crowd comes inside) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab9/422/614/ab94226144044c26a13153bd7fa0000e.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (The noise of many voices) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0c/503/955/d0c503955ec34d1caeed3010cdd11147.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (Loud cheers and applause are heard when Steve comes on stage) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7e/895/8b9/d7e8958b95c048e695f49e92e3069d18.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Steve Jobs: Hello everyone, thanks for coming.  (Loud applause) Nice to see you today.  I'm glad you're here.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  I have a few special things that I would like to share with you today.  (Steve smiles) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/791/e33/827791e337fc4644aba6b44dae87ec96.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: First, some information.  Yesterday we sold our 25 million iPen.  (Applause) <br><br>  500,000,000 records - half a billion records - appeared since we released this product. <br><br>  Half a billion original thoughts securely stored on iCloud. <br><br>  Half a billion new ideas that can change the world.  (Loud applause) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b64/923/bb7/b64923bb7ef54363aa40505c1e89032f.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: It's not easy being an engineer at Apple.  (Laughs) How can the best phone ever be made even better?  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  When we launched the iPhone back in 2007, we didn‚Äôt expect it to become so important today - that it would affect every side of our lives.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  7 years later, the iPhone is a window into our world.  In this window I see my wife and children.  I see my friends, I work and rest. <br><br>  If this window is so important, why not make it bigger?  (Steve shows his hands and begins to spread his fingers as if he is lengthening the iPhone) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffb/492/002/ffb4920025bd4baf97d29a0bced78e35.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (When they were very far from each other, he quickly closed them together and smiled) <br><br>  Jobs: But not too big!  (The audience giggles) After all, you still want it to fit in your hand and in your pocket. <br><br>  Our team of resourceful engineers identified the perfect size. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/854/8eb/271/8548eb271e2a490aa3a2187c3e7f692e.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (Steve shows his left hand) <br><br>  Jobs: It turns out that an average adult thumb length is 4.4 inches long.  If the screen is 4.5 inches tall, your thumb can easily touch 95% of the screen surface effortlessly. <br><br>  We like this number.  4.5 inches.  Our iPhone 5 currently has a length of 4 inches.  Let's see what this extra half inch can give us. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/406/487/395/4064873951d548bd905867abe5ed69a0.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: This half inch makes the screen 40% larger.  (Applause) 40% more space when watching movies.  40% more space for photos.  And most importantly, I still feel comfortable in his hand. <br><br>  Here at Apple, we don‚Äôt care what others say.  It is important for us to do everything right.  This may take several attempts, but we are achieving our goal.  This is the ideal screen size. <br><br>  Now I want to show you a new iPhone.  (Approving whisper) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b31/ab2/adb/b31ab2adba2a4219b4a664bf7bdfdc54.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (The crowd freezes) <br><br>  Jobs: Here it is - your new iPhone.  Look at him.  Great.  This is an iPhone that you love and it has grown. <br><br>  It is produced in a single size - in an ideal size. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/5d4/789/eca5d47892bf4b8fb92d203a2510132b.png" width="300"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: His lines are so smooth that even Ferrari owners will envy.  (Laugh) <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at it. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74f/776/044/74f7760440ac4a8d9a9127cec2a17fcb.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (Starts to play a scene from the Guardians of the galaxy) <br><br>  Jobs: Look at that.  Just take a look.  Incredible.  You will be surprised how you used to live without this extra half inch.  The colors look so vivid. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/916/ad2/33c/916ad233c4f645e6971cba20edc68d55.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (Steve smiles happily) <br><br>  Jobs: This is the coolest half of an inch you can find in this world.  Do you think this is the best moment?  Look at my thumb.  I can easily touch the edges of the screen without any problems. <br><br>  Let's look at the photo. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/946/fbc/fb6/946fbcfb6b8f45c0a0cb75e27bc31298.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: You won‚Äôt believe how much a half inch can change.  When I look through my photos, the details look incredibly clear. <br><br>  When I open a page in Safari, I do not need to strain my eyes.  It is a pleasure to ‚Äúflick‚Äù tabs and browse pages on the Internet. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68a/093/cb0/68a093cb052046f68ab29d84783f2eb0.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: This is a new iPhone.  (Applause) <br><br>  Our iPhones are the windows to our world, and the iPhone 6 is an ideal-sized window.  You can buy it today.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  You can go straight to the Apple store and buy one by tonight.  (Approving Hum) <br><br>  (Steve leaves the stage, but when he reaches the edge, he turns around) <br><br>  (The public is worried, as another slide appears on the screen) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c70/157/21a/c7015721ad56426cb590ab151c473dcc.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Ah, one more thing.  (Anxiety is mounting in the crowd) <br><br>  This scene has a special place in my heart.  Do you know that this is the scene on which I represented the Mac?  (Approving whisper) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31a/c47/6ad/31ac476ad6ba42b98bd1f7e9c2f35918.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Lord, look at this shock of hair.  (Laugh) <br><br>  15 years later, Apple was reborn in this iMac product at this place.  (Approving whisper) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/ec8/779/495ec8779abf4812b3be9e756a9b8478.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Each of our presentations on this scene defines the beginning of a new significant era for Apple. <br><br>  The fact that we are here today is not a coincidence.  (Favorite whisper) There is a reason we paid a little more and booked this place.  (Laugh) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eea/770/f90/eea770f905134be897cedaeb7044e0a8.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (Steve nearly cries) <br><br>  Jobs: Apple started as a personal computer company.  We gave you a Mac, iMac and the MacBook Pro.  We mastered this area and realized that we are capable of more.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  We realized that you can use our designs to create unsurpassed gadgets. <br><br>  Apple then became a company that developed personal devices.  We gave you an iPod, iPhone and iPad.  We mastered this area and realized that we are capable of more.  (Approving Hum) <br><br>  We realized that we can use our designs to give people experience incomparable experience. (Increase of approving hum) <br><br>  Today will be remembered by the fact that Apple will become a company that develops a personalized Universe.  (The audience‚Äôs buzz is already stunning) <br><br>  From today, Apple will bring its magic to other important parts of your life.  You can use our first-class design, for which you came, and in other areas of your life. <br><br>  We present three, three new products today to usher in the Apple Universe era.  (The crowd rumbles) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69a/2e3/b2f/69a2e3b2fe0e47619ae223abae21ee2d.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: We always thought it was silly to carry a phone and a wallet everywhere.  Why wear two items if you can only have one?  (Laugh) <br><br>  The goal of our first innovation from the Apple universe is to get rid of the wallet.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  We call it: Apple Pay.  This is how it looks. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/b8a/cb7/7b8b8acb771c41908a63446339c076b0.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Nowhere easier.  It works exactly as you think.  No instructions needed.  (Applause) <br><br>  You take a picture of your credit card, and it is stored in a safe place on your phone.  When you need to pay something, you bring it to the registrar and use your fingerprint to establish your identity. <br><br>  Boom.  Made by  (Applause) <br><br>  We will launch this product with these partners: </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccf/3de/b40/ccf3deb40adc4fc69a361d146d99d194.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Hundreds more will join us until 2015.  Submit it.  You can visit thousands of stores and pay with one touch. <br><br>  You can use the vacant pocket to carry something more important.  For example, a spare iPhone.  (Public giggles) <br><br>  Next, we noticed that the developers are already using the powerful iPhone sensors to track something very important for all of us.  Our health. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/3c6/be9/4603c6be9a274978aeec8ebbf0735db4.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Here at Apple, we decided that this initiative was of great importance, and dedicated our second product of the Universe to health.  (Applause) <br><br>  We call it Apple Health.  This is how it looks. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e52/d78/317/e52d78317e9942d494e94867f7569316.png" width="300"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Now your iPhone will track your ‚Äúburned‚Äù calories, your weight and your heart rate.  Cool, yeah?  (Applause) <br><br>  You can check your progress for the week, month, year.  You can watch how you become more and more healthy as you reach your goals. <br><br>  Developers, do not worry, we have not forgotten you.  Your applications will be able to contact Apple Health directly. <br><br>  This means that your favorite fitness apps (like Runkeeper) will be able to update your daily health profile. <br><br>  And most importantly, your data is securely stored on your iPhone.  No one except you has access to them.  (Applause) <br><br>  And all this is Apple Health. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/eb7/1cf/601eb71cf7c4499f833591bb489e42fd.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: We left the best for last.  (Steve smiles) Oh god, is there such a thing?  (Laugh) <br><br>  Ready for this?  (Someone in the crowd shouted "YES!" The audience laughed) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/99a/298/74b99a2989b64386bdcb3346e16b4cc0.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Once you want it, the iPhone turns your fingers into the most powerful tool in the universe. <br><br>  (Steve points at his fingers) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/20a/d7c/08920ad7c8d24f9f848a6b51974c2ac2.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: You can order something from another end of the world with one movement.  (Steve demonstrates screen scrolling gesture) <br><br>  With a touch, you can start watching videos with your loved ones who live in another country.  (Steve touches the screen) <br><br>  Shaking the phone you can listen to all the music in the world.  (Steve shakes the phone) <br><br>  Well, we are about to do it again.  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  We are going to make another part of your body just as powerful.  Your wrist.  (The approving noise increases) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/a44/976/e4ca4497679f4ffbaf923636bc97bb2d.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: What could be more natural look?  Look at your wrist right now.  Like this.  (Audience giggles) Look down and then up.  How much time does it take?  Half a second? <br><br>  This is the most natural gesture in the world.  Look at the wrist. <br><br>  Who is "rummaged" in the pockets?  People who are unorganized.  People who do not save time. <br><br>  I?  I don't have time for this.  (Laugh) <br><br>  With this new product, you don‚Äôt have to search for your device.  (Steve looks at his wrist) Exactly.  No more fuss.  Just look.  That's all. <br><br>  Do you understand this?  Do you understand?  (Approval increases) <br><br>  Today, Apple is re-creating the watch.  We call them: iWatch.  Here's what they look like: </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/85f/3e6/49485f3e68fa402d9733fc528e4a6e67.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  (The revival reaches its climax and the crowd goes crazy) <br><br>  Jobs: Parents say they have no pets.  (Loud laughter) I think this is the most wonderful product we have ever created.  Just look at them.  Beautiful.  Impeccable. <br><br>  They are available in a single design.  Stainless steel.  This is the thinnest watch you have ever seen. <br><br>  When people notice them by mile, they will ask about them.

They look even better on man. <br><br>  (Steve takes an iWatch out of his pocket and puts them on his wrist. The crowd sighs) <br><br>  When they are on your wrist, you can't take your eyes off them.  (Steve stares at his watch, the crowd laughs) <br><br>  Their weight is perfect, and this is an incredible feeling. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/85e/0e1/45a85e0e158e436a8dea8f3b2e852a5a.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: It is a pleasure to use them.  Those who tried to make smart watches before simply casually copied the interface of the iPhone.  (Laughter) But we did it differently. <br><br>  We invented the Digital Crown tool.  See this round button? <br><br>  (Steve points to the wheel) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/398/7d9/b9c3987d90574eb3b6cbbfcec6e05954.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: It snaps very nicely when you twist it.  You can use this wheel to scroll the screen on the clock. <br><br>  Your fingers no longer close the screen. Great, huh?  (Approving whisper) <br><br>  What happens if you click on it?  It turned out you went to the main screen.  (Loud hum) <br><br>  Now you know how to use iWatch. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba2/3f1/b36/ba23f1b365aa44818ee3ebf38f7eb990.png" width="300"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: Your first day with iWath will be unforgettable. <br><br>  Got a message?

Life will run a little faster when you don‚Äôt have to rummage through your pockets. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44e/0a5/dda/44e0a5dda92f42a894b84fde44b81248.png" width="500"><br><blockquote>  Jobs: iWatch comes with a special sensor that determines your heart rate.

Instead of sending her a message, what can I do?  I press this button twice and ... (Pulse echoes in the audience) <br><br>  You can't see it, but my watch vibrates to the beat of her pulse.
