      <strong><a href="http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2010/10/06/planning-with-pictures-using-ux-diagrams-to-organize-projects/">Planning with Pictures - Using UX Diagrams to Organize Projects</a></strong> <br>  Dan Brown, one of the best craftsmen to create good accompanying interface documents, talks about the sitemap templates that will make it even more useful part of the project documentation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://filmmakeriq.com/2010/10/500-storyboard-tutorials-resources/">500 Storyboard Tutorials &amp; Resources</a></strong> <br>  A huge collection of articles, guides, reference materials and templates for creating storyboards.  Although they are intended primarily for those who make movies, design takes much of this discipline and storyboards - one of the most useful documents at an early stage of work. <br><br>  <strong><a href="">Visualizations in Service Design</a></strong> <br>  Report on the study of the discipline of service design, in which Fabian Segelstr√∂m interviews specialists of the direction and describes a set of key documents that are the result of work on such projects.  <a href="http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:354845/FULLTEXT01">Direct link to PDF</a> (3.5 MB). <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://moobileframes.tumblr.com/">MOObileFrames</a></strong> <br>  A useful gallery of Hannah Milan wireframes examples created for mobile apps and websites.  The collection contains detailed screen diagrams, sketches, process diagrams and related documents. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxpin.com/">UXPin - Paper prototyping redesigned</a></strong> <br>  A great tool for paper design - a set of standard blocks and controls that can be glued to any surface.  The cost is $ 19.99. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.webalys.com/premium/design-vector-icons-library.html">750 royalty free vector icons for wireframes, application &amp; web design</a></strong> <br>  Scale collection of black and white vector icons that are great for use in wireframes. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://friendfeed.com/uxroom/0db440b7/sonyericsson-javaplatform-ui-templates">Sony Ericsson JavaPlatform UI Templates, Screenshots &amp; Guidelines</a></strong> <br>  A collection of templates, stencils and guidelines for the mobile OS MeeGo from Nokia and Intel.  She has just started to gather, but over time will grow into the same voluminous selection, as well as on other platforms - <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jvetrau/3876c515">http://friendfeed.com/jvetrau/3876c515</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.youeye.com/">YouEye - User Testing with Webcam Eye Tracking</a></strong> <br>  A pseudo-eye-tracking tool that allows you to perform similar research using a regular webcam.  It is not yet open to customers, but its competitor <a href="https://www.gazehawk.com/">GazeHawk is</a> already working. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxsurvey.wordpress.com/">UX Card Sort</a></strong> <br>  An interesting online tool that allows designers to better understand what kind of work they do better.  But an even more useful part of this project is a <a href="http://uxsurvey.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/uxiaixd-card-sort/">deck of 53 cards</a> , each of which represents one of the disciplines, methods, or design technician. <br><br><h3>  Patterns </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://thekruser.com/foursquare/alphabetical">Foursquare Badge List Sorted Alphabetically</a></strong> <br>  A complete collection of badges that are used in the FourSquare geo-location service.  It will be of great help to those who are working on the game mechanics that is currently popular in interfaces. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/web-and-mobile-forms-design-userfriendly-2010-workshop">Web and mobile forms design</a></strong> <br>  A useful presentation by Chui Chui Tan from CX Partners, which brings together good practices for designing forms for the desktop and mobile web. <br><br><h2>  Process </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2010/10/26/the-taxonomy-of-progress-further-thoughts-on/">The Taxonomy of Progress - ‚ÄúThoughts on Communicating‚Äú Doneness ‚Äù</a></strong> <br>  Great idea from James Meizer from Eight Shapes to mark the degree of wireframe development.  He offers a set of statuses and icons for them that can be used in their projects. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.andersramsay.com/2010/11/06/findings-from-the-state-of-agile-ux-survey">Findings from the State of Agile UX Survey</a></strong> <br>  Anders Ramsay published the results of a study of 150 interface specialists who spoke about the implementation of agile development practices in their teams.  The article tells about the general situation, trends, statistics and gives some bright statements of the respondents. <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/10/21/opinion/20101021_Oplunch.html">Lunch line redesign</a></strong> <br>  The story about the school canteen, the change in the layout of which allowed to influence the choices and tastes of students.  Although this case is not connected with interfaces in any way, it illustrates the influence of the structure of the system on the behavior of people using it. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://whichtestwon.com/">Which test won?</a></strong> <br>  A collection of A / B test results, which shows both the checked versions of the site page and suggests to guess which one showed the best results. <br><br><h2>  Theory </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/11/barriers-to-adoption-and-how-to-uncover-them.php">Barriers to Adoption and How to Uncover Them</a></strong> <br>  Demetrius Madrigal and Bryan McClain write about what can prevent users from purchasing and introducing the product into their operations.  The article identifies four such factors - the reported value, confidence, accessibility and trust. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/11/decision-architecture-helping-users-make-better-decisions.php">Decision Architecture - Helping Users Make Better Decisions</a></strong> <br>  A Colleen Roller article in which she describes the decision-making process by the user and gives tips on how you can influence him.

By the way, she recently published another article on this topic, assessing <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/11/fashionable-web-forms-traps-and-tips.php">trends in building forms and their assessment in terms of efficiency</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2010/11/05/eye-movement-patterns-in-web-design/">Eye Movement Patterns in Web Design</a></strong> <br>  Eric Rowell describes two eye movement methods that people use when working with interfaces.  These are ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù and ‚ÄúF-contour‚Äù, each of which is included for its own type of content. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/11/exposing-the-magic-of-design-a-practitioners-guide-to-the-methods-and-theory-of-synthesis.php">Exposing the Magic of Design - A Practitioner's Guide to the Methods and Theory of Synthesis</a></strong> <br>  Chapter from the upcoming book Jon Kolko "Exposing the Magic of Design: A Practical Guide to the Methods and Theory of Synthesis", which is devoted to design research and create products based on them. <br><br><h2>  Trends </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxstorytellers.blogspot.com/2009/01/ux-storytellers-connecting-dots.html">UX Storytellers - Connecting the Dots</a></strong> <br>  The authors of the blog UX Storytellers laid out in open access the book "UX Storytellers - Connecting the Dots" in explanation of their publications.
