      <b>Transitional age, reality, reality or reality?</b> <br><br>  When I thought how to start this short conversation about all the delights and quirks of adolescence, I had several topics that I wanted to talk about: educating people of interesting age (I consciously do not call them children, but adults, I think, not I will name), their speech, formats of communication, and finally, a subculture.  I will probably give up on the second topic, since I can say a lot about it, like a person who spends a lot of time on these-your-Internet. <br><br>  Often parents, and not only parents, complain that their children speak in a language completely incomprehensible to their parental mind.  There are literally fighters with various manifestations of the new speech.  And let's try to think and understand what is the cause of such linguistic ‚Äútrips‚Äù.  Tell me, dear Adult-who-reads-this-article, how long have you been on the Internet?  And I'm not talking about the part of the world wide web, which is news, business analyst and other pleasures of life of an average adult.  I'm talking about social networks, blogs (answer honestly, how many of your friends know what it is), messengers and other Internet products of modern times.  Come on, tell me something ... sorry, you look in Odnoklassniki?  Believe me, this does not change anything.  Even in Odnoklassniki you communicate with your peers, adults like you.  Now think about it, because next to you there is a whole world with its own laws, rules and language!  A world in which communication is a hundred times easier than you could ever imagine!  A world with the ability to share impressions, but, unfortunately, limited by the width of your home unlimited (well, someone as lucky) channel on the Internet, and pinned from above by some imperfection of modern technologies.  I now want to say that the younger generation lives in a world in which it is easy to share some thought and experience, but only in the form of a text.  And by and large they have to translate several channels of perception into the text at once.  Tell me, how can you ‚Äúsnort‚Äù or shrug in a text message ... And burst out laughing?  That's the same thing!  This is where ‚ÄúGee-gee‚Äù, ‚ÄúLol‚Äù, ‚ÄúLaughter‚Äù, ‚ÄúAfftar zhhot‚Äù come on, arena! ‚Äù  And why so, and not ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù or, for example, ‚Äúincredibly fascinating texts‚Äù?  So because these LOLs, LOL and others, if I may say so, ‚Äúneologisms‚Äù differ from the words of the commonly used language in that they are EMOTIONALLY COLORED!  Compare: ‚ÄúI will remember this phrase for the future‚Äù and ‚ÄúFitzatneg!‚Äù ... Where is more delight?  Yes, I completely forgot to mention one nuance.  It must be remembered that emotion is a passing thing, and that not everyone is given talent and the opportunity to fix one or another emotion and to describe it fully and literary.  Therefore, such a reaction, LOL. <br>  And, of course, do not forget about the eternal "problem of fathers and children."  People who are just embarking on the path of growing up are trying to bring something new into the world around them, something that was not before them.  And if they cannot bring it themselves, they are happy to support what is different from ordinary and boring refined everyday life in literature classes.  Finally, you know what I tell you?  A teenager will become an adult, and the one to whom a sense of beauty and love for the word have instilled in his growing up ... So, that teenager will go beyond the boundaries of Gee-gee and LOL-s, will step over them. <br><br>  Love your transition-age people, help them pass this age, and then you will see a person next to you who declares Pushkin when necessary, and Gy-gyknet ‚Äúin vain.‚Äù  An adult, whose language is not limited to Russian-literary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76747/</a></p>
