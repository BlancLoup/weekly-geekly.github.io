  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beeline Moby. Money - Be Careful</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  I wanted to share with you the sad experience of using the Beeline Mobi.Money service, maybe this will help you to avoid the awkward situation that I got when I was led to a wonderful advertisement on TV about how Beeline users can withdraw money from their mobile account to their bank cards . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8c/b4/8cb4e155c965adc6577b2696241c6915.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that it took me once again to withdraw money from WebMoney to a bank card.  I wanted, as always, to use my favorite proven exchanger, but on TV they twisted an advertisement from Beeline, how easy I can transfer my funds from the account to the card. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Comparing the commission, it became clear that through Mobi.Dengi there is a small savings, before the exchanger and I decided to try, transferring a little more than 3 thousand rubles to Beeline‚Äôs account and went to enter the card number. <br><br>  To my regret, the service could not transfer money to the card, which I directly informed about, for no reason, I tried to transfer money not to the card, but to a bank account, but the situation there. <br><br>  The call to the support service was quite fun - no one understood why I had such a problem, they advised to withdraw money not via the site, but via SMS or via a special phone number, or, as an option, to replenish the account for the Internet) and generally said ‚Äúmost likely your bank is blocking transfer". <br><br>  I tried via SMS, by phone, but in response they sent me all the same SMS, with the answer that you cannot withdraw money to my card.  The card was Visa Classic, VTB24 Bank.  Later it turned out that it is also impossible to withdraw SberBank to the card. <br><br>  Of course, I was wondering why my bank is so bad and something is blocking there, but its support service said that there were no transactions on my card today, otherwise they would be able to give an answer why they are blocking something.  There was nothing to block. <br><br>  The next call to support Beeline was not crowned with success, by the way, they themselves did not see any operations from me and promised to transfer everything to the technical service, which allegedly will try to solve everything during the day, but no one will inform me about the answer, say day again. <br><br>  I could not wait for a day and brought money through the strange campaign of UniStream, which is a separate ray for the fact that without specifying any passport data in the application, they give out money only on a passport - other identity cards do not work, and the operator was terribly rude, but I still got the money, but not on the card and not on the bill, as promised in advertising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93552/</a></p>
