      For reference: <br>  <a href="http://playble.ru/">Playble</a> is a real-time multimedia search engine that searches for torrents, movies online, and music on the largest Russian-language sites. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will reveal a small secret, who has a good idea with scaling, he will understand where I'm going. <br>  The Internet is full of resources, both pirated and legal, from where you can download interesting content.  Be it a movie, music, program, book or other information relevant to you.  And also each of us can no longer imagine life without search engines: Google, Yandex and others.  Here, as they say, for your taste and color: ‚ÄúThere will be everything!‚Äù.  What about combining the service from where they download (file sharing or tracker) with a search engine so that the search is conducted not in one resource, but in many?  Search engines give a large number of resources that are informative, but do not provide the ability to download, or forgive my French, these are links to ‚Äúporn‚Äù sites where you can download a movie you are interested in or soft by sending SMS to the number (blah blah blah ).  As for our favorite torrent trackers and file sharing services, then surely you, just like me, faced with the fact that rare information is not so easy to find.  You have to shovel three four torrent trackers in order to dig out exactly what you want today, in that capacity that is relevant to you.  Yes, and that was more seed! <br><br>  So, we have come to the conclusion that we simply need a niche search engine for content without slag, and the main thing is to carry out a search for as many quality resources as possible. <br><br>  What scale can this project expect if you translate it into a search for ‚Äúwhite‚Äù resources.  Where do people officially pay for watching movies online or reading books?  Where do people officially pay for soft or music? <br><br>  But do not be afraid dear Habrayuzer.  For us, with you, users, the service will remain as free and accessible as it is now. <br>  Well, for now you think about the fact that you need a multimedia content search engine like Playble in bookmarks ... <br><br>  I will talk about what has been done in recent months: <br><br><h1>  1. Multimedia </h1><br><img src="http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1691/new1j.png"><br>  What everyone has been waiting for has finally appeared!  Our service has moved to a new level.  From the usual search engine Playble has turned into a real multimedia discovery.  Now you do not need to spend a lot of time searching for music or movies, because all this has become available on Playble.  Before you watch a movie, you can first read its description, and listen to the music first. <br><img src="http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/9095/new3v.png"><br>  Using our service you get a huge advantage: <br>  - You get torrents for download; <br>  - You get links to watch this movie online; <br>  - You get the soundtrack from this movie. <br><br><h1>  2. Availability of enclosed materials </h1><br><img src="http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/9167/new2ey.png"><br>  Now you can download torrents from trackers with mandatory registration.  Ie, you do not need to have an account on the tracker.  Simply click on the green arrow next to the name of the distribution.  Agree, it is very convenient and saves a lot of time! <br><br><h1>  3. Autocomplete </h1><br><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/4364/new4x.png"><br>  Now it became easier for users of the service to enter a search query with auto-completion.  Keyboard arrow control is supported. <br><br><h1>  4. Categorization </h1><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/1091/new5z.png"><br>  All torrents are now neatly divided into the most popular categories.  Find the right torrent even easier.  Do you want to find a book?  Then just click on the appropriate tab. <br><br>  I am open to constructive criticism and your suggestions.  Perhaps someone will seem small that set of resources for which the search is carried out.  I am waiting for links to your favorite resources, will test and select the best.  Perhaps someone caught the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãscaling the project and is ready to speak.  Well, let's discuss. <br><br>  If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us: <a href="">support@playble.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : We added book search on Playble! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127765/</a></p>
