  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MeeGo Harmattan apps: Nokia N9, N950</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a myth that for MeeGo Harmattan and Nokia N9 there are few applications.  Here, it seems to me, the whole question is: how much is needed?  Personally, I think that all the talk about hundreds of thousands of applications for iOS or Android is a little marketing and nothing more.  Especially, in my opinion, it would be necessary for Android to be silent in a rag, because due to the variety of devices and resolutions of their displays, a good half of the applications on a particular smartphone or tablet open and work incorrectly.  However, iOS is now still sick with the same disease: at the moment most of the applications on iPhone5 open for the iPhone 4s display, that is, with black bars along the edges of the iPhone5 4-inch display.  I'm not talking about the fact that some of the applications on the iPad open in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù form. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, this is not the case, the fact is that all these hundreds of thousands of applications are completely unnecessary for a single consumer.  This single consumer takes advantage of the 50th, well, no more than a hundred applications.  So, to satisfy practically any needs of almost any user, there will be a couple of tens of thousands of applications.  I don‚Äôt know the exact statistics of applications for N9, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it turns out that this same pair of tens of thousands of applications in ovi.store for N9 and MeeGo Harmattan is there.  Whatever it was, and I have collected in this review those applications that I personally use.  Not all of them are from ovi.store, but by and large, what's the difference if they are somehow available to the user.

      <br>
      So, let's begin! <br><br><h4>  <b>Sophiecam</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aff/f47/9df/afff479dff19248015e96d4cb6172023.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/727/b49/5d5/727b495d5ece32daadd51fa90aaa6e68.png"><br><br>  In Nokia, Symbian and MeeGo smartphones do not have a full-fledged Instagram application, although they say it will appear for WP8.  However, programs that are similar in functionality, that is, allowing one touch to process a photo, are mass.  Personally, I use SophieCam because it does not have any web service, and you can post the processed photo on Facebook or Twitter.  With regards to filters, there are both bad and good ones, like on Instagram itself.  Photos can be used as already taken with the help of a normal camera (they will have to be cropped under the square), and you can use the camera of the SophieCam application itself.  The program creates your album in the photos of your Facebook account, however you can change the location of the captured photo during the sending process.  In general, a very good program.  True, paid.  It costs 35 rubles.  These are the photos I took with her. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa9/222/bee/fa9222bee51a7fbe2ae9b7509935ca35.png"><br><h4>  <u><b>QNeptunea</b></u> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91c/a66/d88/91ca66d88589dcbe63c97649b75e2895.png"><br><br>  Even somehow, the hand does not rise to call this application a twitter client.  This is more of a twitter combine, because I really haven‚Äôt met any of the operating systems for any of the clients for Twitter! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/548/3af/fb7/5483affb7133e64514c1bc9767b27ca8.png"><br><br>  In QNeptunea, you can not just view the Twi-tape, reply to messages, retweet them or open links in the browser.  You can upload the accompanying tweet photos to several resources integrated with Twitter, and translate messages from other languages ‚Äã‚Äãinto Russian, you can send them to other social networks or send by e-mail, you can skip messages to your accounts on getpocket.com and instapaper.com. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfe/09e/441/bfe09e441f4fe5328011a6c586c51d15.png"><br><br>  The settings of the program itself are also striking in their advancement.  You can change the font size in twi-tape, increase user avatars, assign certain color schemes and themes to display the program, choose its language, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2bb/5a6/fe5/2bb5a6fe5f54675b301a11495c9a870b.png"><br><br>  The program is paid and not cheap.  In ovi.store it costs 350 rubles.  But for those who actively use Twitter, it is definitely worth it!  The author of the application, - Japanese Tasuku Suzuki, - it will not be superfluous to know the names of the heroes! <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Nokia City Lens</b></u> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e26/1b9/cfc/e261b9cfc1a0ba57f22dc0babb0ed08e.png"><br><br>  Few people know that this city map service recently presented for Windows Phone is also available for MeeGo and Symbian.  There is no application in ovi.store, but you can download it from the <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/trials/nokia-city-lens/download_and_installation%3Fall%3D1">Nokia BetaLabs website</a> .  The application works quite correctly, and the degree of its convenience when navigating the terrain, when you need to find a specific institution or office of a company, is difficult to overestimate.  By the way, the companies themselves can put themselves on the map for display in Nokia City Lens, - so, I think, after the official release of the application on Lumia smartphones, this map service will become very popular.  And the owners of the N9 will not be deprived. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Blob</b></u> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b4/8c1/86c/0b48c186cf75ead2f5e696cba290ce4b.png"><br><br>  Blob is a client for posting to Blogger and Wordpress blog hosting sites.  The functionality is absolutely full.  You can embed in the post photos and video links.  There is an integration with Picasa.  All text formatting options are supported.  You can make tags, manage the time and date of publication.  You can save drafts and continue to work in them later.  Moreover, it is possible to work in this application offline at all. <br><br>  In a word, an absolutely indispensable application for bloggers, which is especially nice, is free and can be installed through a regular application store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/726/232/e15/726232e1512abcf17ecce9079c20ccdc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/041/9f5/0d9/0419f50d914e547c1aecaacf042cb50b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/448/20c/f64/44820cf6436095053a589cad20bcb343.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>Meedocs</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26d/4e4/663/26d4e466374aeff0175a25170e4d106d.png"><br><br>  Those who use Google‚Äôs online document service will surely love this app.  Thanks to him, you can at any time quickly and correctly find, read, send or download your online document.  If your <br>  materials are arranged in folders, then you can also open these folders, and even be able to create new ones, in which you suppose you need to download new text.  In addition, you can also create a document on your smartphone, and then upload it to Google documents.  It is also possible to share documents on Facebook or Twitter, or send a link to a particular document via email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a0/fff/6cb/3a0fff6cbe5995f04cf1d7485ccdfb37.png"><br><br>  In short, a fully-featured application that makes life easier for users of the popular and convenient Google service. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>gNewsReader</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9a/24f/257/f9a24f257331e334cf52e0919ab072ae.png"><br><br>  Application to another mega-popular service Googe, - RSS feed reader.  The application is advanced and easy to use.  Messages can be read both in the application itself, and open their full version in a browser window.  You can also copy the link to the message page for its further insertion anywhere else, you can shuffle the link on Facebook, Twitter, Getpocket, Instapaper, and perform all the supposed operations of GReader with the message: tag, set +, share in G +, etc. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb8/a0e/50e/fb8a0e50ecd765568ba4b14cf52fff2b.png"><br><br>  In short, a very convenient application for those who use the Google RSS subscription service and at the same time is lazy to transfer all subscriptions to a regular RSS reader pre-installed in MeeGo Harmattan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/b21/6ac/9fcb216ac81574db92258764309d9b33.png"><br><br>  The application is free, after closing Google Reader supports the Feedly protocol. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Fbreader</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89f/3cb/c85/89f3cbc85af25e9422ce65f9be3adf28.png"><br><br>  This reader of books in the FB2 format, I think, is known to all.  So, perhaps it was not worth writing about her.  Nevertheless, I decided to mention it in my review, because it is one of the applications I use most often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f98/157/899/f98157899cae6ac4e008b21ef9af6478.png"><br><br>  The application supports opening files from the phone‚Äôs memory, contains integration with electronic online libraries.  In the settings you can adjust the font size.  Naturally there is support for horizontal scanning, as well as night mode, when the text is displayed on a black background, which, by the way, saves battery power.  In a word, if you read books, then this is FBreader.  If the book you want to read is in a different reader format, then there are enough resources online that carry out a completely correct conversion from another format to FB2. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Recorder</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72b/a18/a0e/72ba18a0e9013909f0d3fef5c6e130da.png"><br><br>  A simple but quite functional voice recorder that allows you to record audio tracks, pause recording and continue it later in the same file.  All recordings are stored in a separate tab, where you can listen to them, delete them or share them in Dropbox, send them by mail or to another device via Bluetooth or NFC. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>File manager</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/002/1cc/745/0021cc745dcbb85921b9bbbf71af0e60.png"><br><br>  For MeeGo Harmattan, there are several file managers, but as a result I stopped at this.  In many ways, because its interface corresponds to the style that is gradually crystallized from third-party applications for N9.  But the rest, its functionality is consistent with the name.  The application allows you to perform all necessary operations with files, up to sending them to Dropbox, by mail via bluetooth or NFC.  There is support for two colors, black and white.  Naturally, supported and horizontal display mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cce/9c0/c6e/cce9c0c6e9337be9dac789ec721d6ef8.png"><br><br>  If your N9 is in developer mode, the application allows you to see the entire file system.  You can also customize and display hidden files.  If your device is in a ‚Äúboxed‚Äù version, then the file manager will display only that part of the file system, access to which you may need as an ordinary user. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Dropian</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b00/cd3/f68/b00cd3f6868c4253a9792b57ca384e1a.png"><br><br>  This application is a file manager for the Dropbox file storage.  The application allows you to upload and download files, supports displaying thumbnails of photos stored in your file storage.  Directly from the application, you can create folders on Dropbox.  In addition, there is a built-in text editor with which you can create text files that will immediately be saved to Dropbox.  Also, of course, the application allows you to receive links to files and folders located in the file storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/094/fef/77b/094fef77b37d074f378e233521c7ee7b.png"><br><br>  In short, a full-fledged application for the most popular, and probably the best file storage.  By the way, several clients are available for Dropbox on the N9, but through natural selection, I still chose this. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Skyfiles</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/093/5dd/864/0935dd864223996a40e5ae47ad6b5546.png"><br><br>  If we are talking about file managers, here‚Äôs another one - this time for the SkyDrive file storage.  All the same functionality, with the exception of a text editor.  There are free and paid versions, I recommend to choose the paid one, since the free version, among other things, does not save the login password, which is very unpleasant. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>TranslateAll</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eff/479/91c/eff47991c4b9320a3edbda304f174605.png"><br><br>  Translator based on Google Translate.  It only supports vertical display mode, which is not very convenient, but for some reason I haven‚Äôt changed it to another, although there are several similar translators in ovi.store. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>MeePaper</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/489/6ea/4c2/4896ea4c2256d24ae6359918d113346f.png"><br><br>  Getpocket service is becoming increasingly popular.  Its integration into QNeptunea, as well as the fact that I personally actively use it in Chrome, prompted me to install the application client of this service for MeeGo.  Everything is very simple and convenient here: you synchronize the application with the service and all those links and notes that you made, whether from a browser or from a QNeptunea twitter client, appear in it.  Links can be read, deleted, shared, opened in the browser or simply copied to the clipboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/625/f4d/6f6/625f4d6f6e2beaf62bbb166f9e94a6cb.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>PureLight</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ba/202/971/8ba2029712ec8697907b52651a18736f.png"><br><br>  This is the simplest flashlight, but I could not mention it, because I have never met a simpler and more universal solution.  In all other cases, you need to open the program, and only then turn on the flashlight.  Here the button of the flashlight is located right on your desktop, among the shortcuts of other programs.  And you just need to click on it and the flash will turn on in flashlight mode, and the shortcut will also shine, indicating that the flashlight is on.  You can turn off the flashlight only after 5 seconds after switching on.  This restriction is apparently due to the need to curb those who want to play with such a convenient button. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>VideoEditor</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/978/3bd/524/9783bd524cc04337d4aaf7621567c22b.png"><br><br>  This simple but functional video editor will allow you to merge several videos you shot on N9 into one file.  Each of the videos can be cut at the beginning and at the end (however, such functionality is also available in the Gallery interface).  The scroll bar is scaled by multi-touch gestures, so the installation process does not cause any trouble.  Expel mounted film can be with different resolutions, the maximum of which 720r.  This application does not contain any special transitions from roller to roller, so when connecting, the simplest gluing of one roller to another is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/616/d1e/04b/616d1e04bf935922effc6fd865f20446.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>Vimeo</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32a/315/f2a/32a315f2acf67e3959de4bef6259b098.png"><br><br>  By name, it is clear that this is a client of the video hosting of the same name, different from the omnipresent YouTube, which is more sophisticated and artistic video content.  The client, admittedly, is great, and supports almost all the functionality of video hosting.  A similar Android client, for example, is much leaner and weaker.  The client has its own built-in player, which is no worse than a video player built into MeeGo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfb/e64/431/dfbe64431d76fdf9d3f6a7959d6ecbb2.png"><br><br>  With this client, you can not only view your and other people's video content on Vimeo and comment on it, but also upload video files to a video hosting site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c0/07f/f1a/5c007ff1a4f876616240055dd3d2a770.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>cuteTube</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3e/dc9/74e/b3edc974ebd3f46711f775cbde9fe7f0.png"><br><br>  There are several YouTube customers for MeeGo, but cuteTube is clearly the best.  Firstly, because it supports the Notification Screen and new videos from your subscriptions appear on the Notification Screen, among other posts from social networks and RSS subscriptions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/720/f63/096/720f6309649701635e81ae3ab51dda65.png"><br><br>  Secondly, cuteTube refers to the new generation of applications for MeeGo, which includes all the same QNeptunea, for example, that is, it is not just an application, but a full-featured combine that includes functionality that can be useful to the user, but is not directly implemented even in browser version of a service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/861/4a9/1bd/8614a91bd844056ad9185d8b34b4f873.png"><br><br>  With this application you can fully monitor not only the videos on your YouTube-account, but also in your account on Dailymotion, as well as on Facebook and Twitter.  You can comment on videos, respond to other comments, download videos, share them on the social network, add to favorites, playlist for later viewing, etc. Also the application, like the browser version of Youtube, shows similar videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc7/1bd/2b5/bc71bd2b5dcef89ac656afaee002aa78.png"><br><br>  The program has advanced interface settings and functionality.  You can choose a color scheme, you can set the resolution settings of the downloaded file, search options, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/720/4f2/587/7204f2587558b9f513eea403f9b0664a.png"><br><br>  In short, an example to follow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1e/7af/dc6/e1e7afdc68a560db61070804ea2418be.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74c/998/66e/74c99866e81c39301a684ca7a962e146.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b8/802/eb1/3b8802eb17ea91237ea0fc6622abeb84.png"><br><br>  The program is not free, it costs 140 rubles.  But it is obviously worth it, if you use YouTube and generally like to watch network video. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Musikloud</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84e/343/129/84e3431295eac7552650a412086277c1.png"><br><br>  The client for the most popular music resource SoundCloud from the same manufacturer as the previous application.  Englishman Stuart Hovart - I think it will not be superfluous to remember this name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b9/e55/d1b/6b9e55d1b232930aefc242a686b37d11.png"><br><br>  The application is built on the same principle as cuteTube and provides absolutely full functionality of the SoundCloud service.  You can listen and download tracks, leave comments to them, view user profiles.  So, wandering from one user to another and listening to track by track, in this application you can spend a single hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/094/fea/427/094fea4270d4e3df1a3ea49e09706a4d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54d/d70/7b5/54dd707b50f62b8efa68330528c060a3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/747/2c4/c07/7472c4c0790960a03a1f7cca178d89ed.png"><br><br>  The application is paid.  It is worth 105 rubles. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>FM Radio</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/daa/d21/d7d/daad21d7dafb1e5dae9a5f940ec4d26b.png"><br><br>  Simple but functional radio.  6 radio stations you can save in memory and switch between them with one click.  Navigating the frequency scale is a simple scrolling. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Flickrup</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/078/0c0/4bc/0780c04bcb159354181c4a39b5f70359.png"><br><br>  The client is the most popular photo hosting on the Internet.  The application provides full functionality for navigating the resource.  You can view your friends' updates.  When you open a separate image in the interface, scaling is supported through multi-touch gestures.  Through the application, you can upload your own photos to the photo hosting site, although there is no need to do this through the interface of this application, since the Flickr protocol is sewn from the box in MeeGo, so you can upload photos to this photo resource directly from the Gallery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ea/218/922/3ea218922af4f95a1ff4363217005753.png"><br><br>  But here's the functionality of downloading images from Flickr in the FlickrUp application frankly pleases - you can choose the size and resolution of the downloaded image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b54/672/faa/b54672faaca19ff63391c4ee2f43ba39.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afd/24f/d51/afd24fd512470227c026d34e76a82ebe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d0/944/e55/3d0944e5587407861aa5c659e567f693.png"><br><br>  Naturally, the application also supports horizontal scanning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d7/3a4/176/4d73a4176fdfa9488089407a2f52d332.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>Shotmee</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc3/879/ab6/cc3879ab6aa630fba33cd3e52af44426.png"><br><br>  Beautiful in its simplicity application for taking screenshots.  You simply launch this application, transfer it to the background mode, and then tap on the body of the smartphone, when the display shows the interface from which you want to take a screenshot.  Files are saved with the extension .png and in the resolution of 480x854. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Wazapp</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/500/966/f13/500966f1395429152f1245bf28512481.png"><br><br>  Client application of whatsapp, popular in certain circles, messinger.  Honestly, I do not know what to add to this.  It seems that all the functionality is there, but personally I have not begun to use this client closely.  I don‚Äôt really understand why it is needed despite the fact that messengers are embedded in MeeGo according to G-talk, Facebook, Skype protocols.  If you install the Extraplagins account application, you will be able to correspond in the standard windows of MeeGo Messages using the icq, jabber, yahoo, vk and classmates protocols.  Why do I also need whatsapp? I don‚Äôt understand.  So I installed it more because of fashion and just to test it. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Bambuser</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7da/53a/485/7da53a485e9981f15f70ff945ade7182.png"><br><br>  Online video client service.  Through this application, you can shoot a video and broadcast it directly to your account on bambuser.com as you are shooting.  Further, with certain settings that need to be set up in your account, video broadcasting can automatically stream into your accounts in social networks.  Naturally, this online broadcasting is possible with a wi-fi or 3G internet connection.  If there is none, then the video recorded by you will wait for the connection in the program specially reserved for it.  In the settings of the application, you can also set the resolution of the video broadcast, which you think is optimal. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Mp3 cut</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34b/761/fd3/34b761fd32e3dd8df05dca981cb96200.png"><br><br>  Audio editor that allows you to cut out separate fragments from mp3 files and save them again in mp3 format.  In principle, a convenient program, when you suppose you need to cut a small excerpt from a dictaphone recording in order not to store a huge interview file on your smartphone. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Mixxmachine</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65e/b42/2dd/65eb422dd0ed62026436e73708e50634.png"><br><br>  Music sampler that allows you to write electronic music.  For me personally, as a person who does not like computer games, this is the best option for a toy.  Sometimes it is very pleasant to sit and poke in such a program making fancy rhythms and stringing musical phrases on them.  The program contains a good database of all kinds of sounds for the smartphone version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a01/820/c77/a01820c77d63ccd751e5bb1289bbb18e.png"><br><br>  The program also announced the ability to record the resulting track in an mp3 file, but this feature is not currently implemented.  It will be available in future versions of the program.  However, if it turned out really something masterpiece, then you can still record it, you just need to turn on the speaker louder, and in the background to put on the recorder. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Instago</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d4/1b8/347/9d41b83477a73bc3075bcfc36894d8f5.png"><br><br>  Unofficial Instagram client for MeeGo.  Its informality affects the functionality because the Instagram API is closed.  Nevertheless, in this application, you can view the tape of your friends, put likes, view your photos, as well as the most popular photos of the entire instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62a/346/09f/62a34609f8c3a1c61085db7b7b58c31e.png"><br><br>  In principle, it is an acceptable replacement for a popular service.  Although, it is hoped that over time, thanks to the appearance of an unofficial client, and maybe on its basis, an official one will appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/969/1ab/4a5/9691ab4a532637562efcb1b8a655a76c.png"><br><br><h4>  <u><b>Sharetus</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/131/7c2/660/1317c2660a9d2a011d53f695c5d4dbb8.png"><br><br>  Free and absolutely necessary application that expands the sharing functionality in MeeGo.  The application is installed in the system and appears only when you want to transfer a particular link, for example, on a social network, or send it by mail.  The application does not work in the case of sharing of photos, it works only with text, and with links, however, the fact that it can be used to send the entire browser page to transfer to the Google Translator is already pleasing.  Support for other resources that are not supported by the boxed version of MeeGo is also very enjoyable.  Separately, the application allows tagging messages and links sent. <br><br><h4>  <u><b>Titanim</b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/755/724/91b/75572491b0f4a6d572fc78b46897558f.png"><br><br>  Client for Vkontakte social network.  For MeeGo Harmattan, there are several Vkontakte clients, there is an official one, but TitanIM, having undergone natural selection, became the main thing for me.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are both paid and free versions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Paid it seems to support video viewing, and in free it is only available for listening to music. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest of the functionality: chats, walls, posting, comments, etc., is also available in the free version. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88b/820/b5d/88b820b5df5431f431075a15992346d2.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is also nice that the application supports the Notification screen and status updates of your friends appear on it, and from there they open directly in the TitanIM application.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a90/0ec/12d/a900ec12dc6db0a69817b5685daecd5e.png"><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet radio</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1db/321/2be/1db3212be29f73c1bc4b20485bfdb738.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Client for listening to Internet radio stations with a built-in equalizer, as well as with a database of radio stations, broken down by music genre. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also supported the ability to add to the list of radio stations. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da1/36b/27c/da136b27c1f97404cd416b61a535b719.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can add individual radio stations to your favorites list, as well as view those radio stations that you listened to recently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a word, nothing supernatural, but on the other hand, it is quite a high-quality client for those who like to listen to radio via wi-fi. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bda/2ec/43f/bda2ec43f1bf43cdc2eb1668e41bb96d.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, I still prefer to use the MusiKloud application for these purposes.</font></font><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Codecam</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54b/4dc/078/54b4dc0787af3d67967b426d9fb32bcb.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An application for reading all kinds of barcode and QR codes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is noteworthy that it is not necessary to make money on any buttons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You simply open the application and point to the code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The program itself recognizes it and scans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If necessary, you can turn on the flash in flashlight mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having scanned the code, the program suggests you to follow a coded link.</font></font><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shakelock</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cef/37f/fe7/cef37ffe7d26487f7e0a070c3f676498.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Convenient program that allows you to customize the lock screen of your smartphone by shaking it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In its concept is very consistent with the MeeGo besknopochnuyu interface. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personally, I use it with great pleasure.</font></font><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Call recorder</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbf/1e4/8dd/fbf1e48ddc261795598df8b4884413cb.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For some reason, it is considered that recording telephone conversations is sinful, if not dangerous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But on the other hand, perhaps it depends on who is talking about what. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me personally, a program that automatically records all conversations is a convenient way not to write down the address or not to ask again twenty times some exact information that you will have to use later. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is always possible to listen to the recording later.</font></font><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Notes exporter</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1a/458/769/f1a4587695fdb4e44998640749002bc9.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not so much a program as a plugin to the Notes application preinstalled in MeeGo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The plugin allows you to save notes in a text file and, accordingly, send them by mail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A very convenient and simple program, although, of course, I would like the standard application of notes to have such functionality, and even better, it would allow you to synchronize content through one of the cloud services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although when synchronization is very important to me, I prefer to use the above-described Dropian application.</font></font><br><br><h4> <u><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Emumaster</font></font></b></u> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/6dd/6f7/1f26dd6f7dd25e1dc6ea954ef2d17bd3.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although I wrote above that I do not like computer games, nevertheless, there was a period in my life when I loved them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now, at times, I will not refuse to play any toy of my youth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Emu-Master application is an emulator of several game consoles through which you can play relic and cult toys of past years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From this we should not conclude that there are no modern games for MeeGo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are, and, perhaps, I will get tired and do some review of them. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c47/c2b/fde/c47c2bfdece989e4262bf295f1fbc4ce.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps this time all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although there are more applications about which I would like to tell, but I will postpone for the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, as a bonus, I suggest those who wish to look at these and other applications in action:</font></font><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315"

frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS: <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, this whole review was born from </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153615/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">my previous topic.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">about the company Jolla and that in the second half of November, it is going to release the SDK of its new, based on MeeGo operating system Sailfish. One of the commentators of my previous topic rightly noted that Jolla has experts in the software part, but there are no experts in hardware, and the hardware means nothing less than the software part. An example of this is the same Nokia, whose Lumia 920 is naturally cooler than other WP8 flagships from other manufacturers. So with Jolla, the same story may turn out that they will make the operating system, and the N9 will still be a much more interesting device. And to release a new Nokia device on MeeGo, too, no one will interfere, and the base of applications (its own, native, very cool in functionality and with its own style) also already exists. However, apparently, in the hardware of Jolla will rely on Chinese manufacturers,and there (ZTE, Huawei) devices are quite capable of collecting. Although these companies do not have any exclusive technologies, so nothing but a high-quality build and a new open OS will not differ these devices. But maybe it is these products that are needed by the modern market, which is steeped in Android?</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153989/</a></p>
