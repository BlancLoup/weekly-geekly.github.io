  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much is now custom software development?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all!  This is my first blog post.  I develop (for the time being at the very beginning) my own firm in the field of custom development (software and websites) and I will describe this process in a blog. <br>  At the moment, the situation is as follows: we are slowly creating websites and software, but customers are only through friends.  Now I am completing the site of the company and in February I plan to launch advertising.  I described the background to everything in LJ (listed in the profile) - about registration, taxes, and much more. <br>  And now I will present the result of my own little research. <br><br>  In order to know in which price ranges competitors operate, I entered a ‚Äúsoftware development‚Äù request in Yandex and sent out a development task to all firms that were in the first two pages, asked to evaluate and name the technologies on which the development would be carried out . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The task was quite simple: to develop a simple payroll system for security company employees.  Wrote a simple likeness of TK and sent it.  The task itself can be downloaded <a href="" rel="nofollow">here</a> . <br>  The results were generally predictable, but there are moments that surprised. <br>  1. I sent out 23 letters.  Answers just 14!  Those.  roughly half did not respond at all.  Letters-chippers came from two companies - they say that there are no such addresses anymore. <br>  2. I sent letters on January 4th - it was interesting who works on holidays and who does not.  Workers turned 3 firms.  The rest answered on the 11th and later. <br>  3. Several answers were supposedly from firms, but there was a strong impression that they were either freelancers or some individual entrepreneurs working alone.  By the way, they had the lowest prices. <br>  4. Additionally, I recorded at what position in the search engines are firms in my search query.  After all, promotion (and advertising in Yandex. Direct) costs money, and it was interesting how this correlates with development prices.  I will not give a separate schedule, but in general, those who were higher asked for a higher price (although there were exceptions). <br>  5. Many of the companies actually did not offer the development of a desktop application, but in fact a website.  Those.  in a more complex project, they are likely to lay down their hands. <br>  6. The range of technologies used to solve the problem was quite extensive: PHP (+ Joomla), ASP.Net, .Net (desktop), Delphi, Java, Access.  There was no clear leader, although in general PHP and Delphi were met a little more often (here they are, freelancers or web studios).

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      And finally, the most interesting - prices! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0b/85d/68e/a0b85d68eef2c349876acd847a437d88.gif"><br>  For $ 1, I considered 30 rubles. <br>  I can not say that I was very pleased with these results.  Quite a few firms knock down the price.  For example, if you take a development cost of 50,000 rubles, you get something like the following alignment.  From 50,000 subtract 40% - this is what taxes will eat, remains 30.000.  Of these, about 15.000, in my estimation, you need to pay the programmer (if you work on the piece), there are 15.000.  If the project involved a manager (after all, someone needs to work with contracts, TZ, go to the customer), then his payment would be about the same amount.  Now I am doing this myself, but this does not change the essence of the matter.  The profit is very small, and it is quite risky. <br><br>  So I myself would estimate such a project at about 100,000 rubles - here you can already connect the tester, and generally make it more efficiently, and you would have enough for caviar :) It would probably be scary to ask for more - the client can go to those who is cheaper. <br><br>  However, I will soon start advertising and see what and how :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81480/</a></p>
