But of those who asked the question, it will be barely half to watch it. </p><br><p>  To understand why this is happening, you need to figure out - how do we watch the video from conferences, why is it even necessary? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Video is not only a show and a reason to discuss something together.  You can also consider it as one of the best types of documentation. </p><br><p>  As developers, we do not often think that there are several ways to write documentation.  At the dawn of the appearance of the Runet, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vlad.balin">Vlad Balin</a> <a href="http://gaperton.livejournal.com/60632.html">wrote</a> about this <a href="http://gaperton.livejournal.com/60632.html">well</a> . </p><br><p>  Documentation is of different types, at least: </p><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúTreaty‚Äù - when several people must equally understand something important; </li><li>  "Reference" - reference information, which is verified a lot and often.  It includes all sorts of international standards, dictionaries, and even POSIX type API descriptions;  this also includes JavaDoc and comments in the code; </li><li>  ‚ÄúLearning material‚Äù - reporting new knowledge in a structured and understandable way; </li></ul><br><p>  The report from the conference combines several roles at once.  Initially this is a kind of live performance, concentrated, useful information for learning. </p><br><p>  But if the report on Selenium is read by the creator of Selenium and states that in the future the project will develop in a certain way - this is a kind of agreement fixed on the video.  You can show this to your friends and say, ‚ÄúHa, look, we have a promise from <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/talks/2017/msk/4axfxghfmo0ke0oyyack6g/">Simon Stewart</a> himself that this will work like this.‚Äù  The lucky ones, who came to the conference live, can also promise this promise in a special discussion area. </p><br><p>  If the speaker fully and comprehensively describes some part of the system, then in the future it can be used as a reference book.  You will be able to access this video over and over again, think over, revise, use the data from it when writing code or when compiling your own documentation. </p><br><p>  Obviously, <strong>the report and its video have a certain life cycle</strong> .  The report has the maximum value at the start, when a person can quickly and easily absorb all this information and immediately put it into practice.  After the conference is over, it gradually turns from a textbook into a reference book.  While the video is in the closed access - this is a directory with special know-how, available only to conference visitors.  After opening in 3-4 months and posting on YouTube, it becomes public information, to which you can throw the link to friends, indicating the exact time of viewing.  Six months or a year after graduation, it starts to become obsolete, but the next conference picks up the baton.  Obsolescence is more about frameworks and specific technologies, but fundamental reports on computer science, building the development process and testing, and so on - they can continue to be used for several years for sure.  It turns out such a global circulation of reports in nature. </p><br><p>  The main problem of delivering information in the form of lectures and writing textbooks is that there <strong>are usually no people in an organization who can hold such a lecture</strong> .  Or they are, but busy with something else.  Or they are simply not as good as conference lecturers - few people can tell about Selenium better than <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/talks/2017/msk/4axfxghfmo0ke0oyyack6g/">Simon Stewart</a> - the living embodiment of Selenium on earth. </p><br><p>  <strong>That is why we don‚Äôt want to watch conference videos after 4 months, but to participate in this conference live.</strong>  This is a completely logical desire and way to use the proposed material to its fullest. </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, not everyone can fly through half the world live.  Not all let go of employers.  In the end, someone might not have enough budget. </p><br><p>  Sometimes it is much more useful to gather in front of a large plasma in the office and discuss the report with colleagues in full voice, not being afraid to interfere with someone, using the full power of the Russian language and Russian mat. </p><br><p>  And sometimes, you just want to sit at home in front of the big screen, without having to join a huge crowd of people and go somewhere.  Sleep well at home, not in a hotel - after all, the conference lasts a full two days. </p><br><p>  All these problems solves the online broadcast.  You can watch anything and anything.  Despite the fact that the conference brings the greatest benefit if you come there alive and participate in discussion zones, the online broadcast also has a lot of unique advantages. </p><br><h1 id="kak-podklyuchitsya-k-translyacii">  How to connect to the broadcast </h1><br><p>  Previously, we posted on Habr links to various playlists on YouTube and warned: ‚ÄúThis link is for the first day, this one is for the second, this one is for something else.‚Äù  You needed to save the link to this habrapost and then follow its updates. </p><br><p>  There is a way much easier.  Free broadcast can be viewed directly from our site, here on this link: </p><br><blockquote><a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/online-free/"></a>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/online-free/">https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/online-free/</a> </blockquote><p>  This link is the ultimate source of truth.  It is there that displays the latest, current program.  There is also a big orange link <a href="https://t.me/heisenbugconf">‚ÄúChat with participants and ask a question to the speaker‚Äù</a> , which leads to Telegram, participants can use it not only for paid, but also for open broadcast. </p><br><h1 id="changelog">  Changelog </h1><br><p>  The development of the conference is very similar to the development of a software platform.  Our languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are constantly competing with each other: for example, Java is chasing .NET by the syntax of the main language, and .NET is trying to catch up with Java by cross-platform.  As soon as a new idea appears, implementations of this idea begin to appear in all popular technologies. </p><br><p>  Creating conferences is very similar to the development of a software platform.  JUG.ru Group has its own platform, a list of basic features.  As soon as one of the conferences improves something, everyone else receives an update.  This year, including this fall, there have been many conferences, and many things have improved. </p><br><p>  Live streaming is exactly what we all want and expect to see from a good conference.  To improve the broadcast, it is often enough just to add more high-quality equipment and properly configure it.  Therefore, broadcast received for this autumn the maximum number of useful updates. </p><br><ul><li>  Improved sound quality.  Microphones stand correctly and work better, the acoustics of the hall are thought out, minor technical problems are solved; </li><li>  Video at 1440p - the extra space is used to simultaneously display the speaker and FullHD slides (or the laptop screen for live coding) on ‚Äã‚Äãone screen.  Very useful tech feature; </li><li>  Infrastructure for working with video moved to the cloud, which lowered the probability of equipment failures.  This is done in <a href="http://sbtg.ru/">SBTG.ru</a> , which help in recording the conference, and we are only reaping the fruits of their work; </li><li>  Our service infrastructure also moved to Amazon.  It used to be just Hetzner, but quality uninterrupted transmission is more important; </li><li>  In the intervals between presentations, when speakers and participants on the site are retired to the discussion zones, we show the online broadcast to the audience reports and interviews with speakers and sponsors.  This time the interview should be livelier; two presenters will lead them ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium">@phillennium</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir">@olegchir</a> - you can regularly see our posts on Habr√©); </li><li>  Many minor technical problems were solved, which most did not even notice, but they were there.  In general, the feeling of watching the broadcast should be better. </li></ul><br><h1 id="ogranicheniya">  Restrictions </h1><br><ul><li>  In the open broadcast, <strong>only the first hall</strong> is available, including keyouts.  You cannot watch what happens in other halls.  And there will be many interesting things.  Next time register and watch everything without restrictions. </li><li>  <strong>There will be no video recordings.</strong>  That is, they, of course, will, but only for conference participants who have left feedback.  And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months. </li><li>  An open broadcast is provided on the principle of <em>as is</em> : we are sure that everything will be fine, but if suddenly that - do not judge me!  The participants of the paid closed broadcast receive special support - they are buying exactly the service. </li></ul><br><h1 id="programma">  Program </h1><br><p>  The conference is held for two days.  The first day starts at 10.00, the second - at 10.30.  Each day ends with a final keyout (at 17.35 and 18.15 respectively).  The current program of the first hall can be seen <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/online-free/">on the broadcast page</a> . </p><br><h2 id="den-pervyy-8-dekabrya">  The first day.

This is due, among other things, to the fact that testing the ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù has always been considered the prerogative of programmers. </p><br><ul><li>  How to prevent programmers from writing the wrong code? </li><li>  How to embed crashes in the code so that it does not hurt painfully? </li><li>  Why would you need source code parsing and what can you get from it? </li><li>  Social code analysis and coverage - why and why? </li></ul><br><p>  In this report we will see the answers to these and other questions, with examples and a clear demonstration. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-f/it/b6/-fitb6sgmqqygckl1ut5as92rsq.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Nikita Makarov</strong> </p><br><p>  He worked in outsourcing and grocery companies.

Many people think that manual tests can be accelerated only by automation - but this is not quite true :) </p><br><p>  In this report, I would like to show simple tools that would allow you to spend less time and at the same time help to increase the test coverage.  Target audience: manual testers, as well as all those who at least sometimes need to analyze and do something with their hands. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/du/6q/j_/du6qj_2yylqanvdaoyk5ulbduba.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Julia Atlygina</strong> </p><br><p>  In testing over 9 years, the last of which spent in ALM Works, developing plugins for Atlassian JIRA and Confluence.

Much less often test directly the browser.  In the simple case, we connect Yandex.Metrica and / or Google Analytics, and go ahead.  But there is a nuance: in the corporate environment, sending data to NM / GA may not be available, and simply connecting NM / GA is not enough to collect the necessary amount of information about the application's performance. </p><br><p>  In the report we will look at how to measure the duration of operations in the browser.  Find out why the times obtained from Selenium show the weather, find out what the benefits of Selenium tests can be when measuring performance.  Let's look at boomerang.js and find out what moments to pay attention to when integrating such libraries into a project.  The report does not address the issues of optimizing the browser / server. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/3z/nj/qg3znjwjrzpw2wvahcmioknfxmm.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir Sitnikov</strong> </p><br><p>  For ten years, it has been working on the performance and scalability of NetCracker OS - the software used by telecom operators to automate network management processes and network equipment.

And it seems that there is no salvation from the omnipresent complexity that penetrates everything.  One aspect of this complexity is configuration.  On the one hand, the configuration greatly affects the stability and availability of the system, on the other - very little attention is paid to checking its correctness. </p><br><p>  The report will tell you how we test the configuration and how it was useful in our project.  This report will be useful to anyone who wants to learn a simple way to increase the stability and availability of the system in production. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9f/hi/e-/9fhie-tyb1c5w90ldu9qbzdreoa.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Andrey Satarin</strong> </p><br><p>  Engaged in testing distributed systems in Yandex.

Being a veteran of automated testing (for twenty years now, and this figure continues to grow!), Alan Paige has seen a lot of teams whose attempts to do automation at least once and for all turned out to be completely unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, he managed to take part in the few teams that did it all, and on this report he will share his wisdom and the patterns that really work (and also share a bunch of patterns that are worthless). </p><br><p>  Alan will show successful automation strategies, how to deal with flaky tests, guide the dangers of UI automation and give a number of other tips, based on many years of experience in test automation in a variety of large products.  You can be an advanced tester, or on the contrary, just start a career - in this report you will find tips for everyone, and such tips that can be put into practice almost instantly. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0y/bb/on/0ybbonw9cj-xbemeohxtnj4q5sg.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Alan Page</strong> </p><br><p>  Alan Page has been working as a software tester for about 25 years.

But there are teams where everyone lives in peace and harmony.  Apparently, something is wrong here?  I would like to talk about how testers see the developers themselves.  The report will be a fun classification.  In addition to the famous monkey tester, the fly tester, the Nazi tester, the panda tester and many other heroes will be presented. </p><br><p>  You can once again think about how you are seen from the side and, perhaps, make a difference for the better.  The report will also be useful to project managers and team leaders.  You will be able to quickly recognize those or other patterns of behavior testers and take measures to improve the level of teamwork.

Now the whole team is responsible for testing and product quality.  But few people imagine how these approaches work in practice, how testers interact with developers, what stages a task goes through on the way from requirements to reception by the customer, who does what at different stages. </p><br><p>  There are not so many teams where practicing the close work of a developer with a tester.  In some projects this approach is avoided for the sake of saving the developer‚Äôs time, on others for the sake of preserving the independence of the tester‚Äôs opinion.  Developers also do not always understand what the tester can actually help them with in practice.  However, this bundle can significantly improve the quality of the product and avoid many problems. </p><br><p>  In the report we will talk about the motivation of the developer‚Äôs pair work with the tester, specific practices and approaches at different stages of working on tasks, as well as the benefits that both parties can derive from such work. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/jw/so/jujwsorc3w6x7s2lv-gbvrezb_a.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Nikolay Alimenkov</strong> </p><br><p>  Practicing java techlide and Delivery Manager.
