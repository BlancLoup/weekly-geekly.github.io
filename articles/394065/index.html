  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Obtaining a registration number on the UAV: ‚Äã‚Äãdebriefing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>What is the status of unmanned drones in Russia at the moment?</b> <br>  Unlike the situation just a couple of years ago, drones are imported and sold on the territory of the Russian Federation completely legally.  You can acquire UAVs without any conditions.  But to run them, strictly speaking according to the letter of the law, is impossible. <br><br>  <b>What exactly is the problem?</b> <br>  The rules for obtaining registration numbers for drones in the Federal Air Navigation Agency and the Federal Security Service (yes, the security officials will also have to notify you of the presence of a drone), but ... are not officially approved by the Government of the Russian Federation.  On the day when the ‚Äúunmanned‚Äù amendments to the law on the registration of aircraft fully entered into force, a group of enthusiasts tried to register their cars.  The result - no one has achieved success. <br><br>  <b>So the current amendments to the air law are meaningless?</b> <br>  It is hardly worth arguing so harshly.  By themselves, these amendments are necessary and in any case necessary in the era of a slow but sure introduction of drones into everyday life.  But for now they are actually flesh without a skeleton.

      <b>It turns out, drones can not register and fly without any permissions?</b> <br>  It turns out that at the moment it is.  There is no punishment for this, as there is no regulatory framework for identifying offenders and bringing them to justice - drones fly low, radar doesn‚Äôt detect them, and police crews are very unlikely to chase every quadcopter seen during patrols.  And if they become - see above, it is impossible to punish the operator.  Hypothetically, a fine of 3,000-5,000 rubles for violating the rules for using airspace can be written out, but in practice it is unlikely (if you don‚Äôt fly over sensitive objects like prisons, territories of embassies, ministries, departments, military units, metro facilities (!), And even bridges and train stations).  However, for a flight over the airport, they can attract for other reasons (interference with the work of transport), and with very different consequences, so think seven times about where and how to exploit your drone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>When will the legislative base be normalized?</b> <br>  Unknown.  But now the Ministry of Transport has prepared new changes to the Air Code, according to which UAVs with a maximum take-off weight of up to 30 kg (or up to 5 kg, the information is different) will not be subject to mandatory certification and state registration.  How things will develop further, time will tell. <br><br>  <b>And what is the published procedure for registering a drone in Rosaviatsii?</b> <br>  The owner of the UAV must submit an application to the regional department of the Federal Air Navigation Agency (in any form, but it‚Äôs better not by hand, but on the printed form), which will include: factory name of the device, serial number, date and country of manufacture, name of the manufacturer, the purpose of the drone (in our case - civilian), as well as the take-off mass, the number of engines and their power.  You should also include your passport details, telephone numbers and TIN (in case you want to use the drone for commercial purposes. Someday).  Then, in theory, within 10 working days the device is entered into a single register of aircraft, and the owner receives a protected certificate and special identification marks on his hands, which should be applied to the drone.  Then the same data is provided to the FSB.  Everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394065/</a></p>
