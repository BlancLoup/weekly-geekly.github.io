  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marketing in IT. Part 3. Triple sale: first, last, never again.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Triple selling is very easy to achieve and extremely difficult to avoid.  Triple selling is usually caused by inadequate positioning and poor targeting.  But the main reason for the triple sale is the isolation of marketing from sellers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Marketing, in itself, does not represent any value for the organization.  Sellers will be able to sell without marketers, advertising companies and PR-shares.  The task of marketing, at a minimum, is not to interfere with the sales process, but as a norm, to promote it.  To reach the norm can only be one way - to become a seller friend, mentor and comrade. <br><hr><br>  No need to launch stocks without preparation and without knowing the opinions of sellers.  In the end, it is the sellers who will communicate with the client, and if the stock is not liked by the sellers, they will begin to sabotage it.  Even worse, if marketing achieved its goal with the help of the action, i.e.  attracted new customers, and sellers do not know how to act within this campaign. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>An action was launched to promote quite complex technical devices.</em>  <em>The essence of the action was the following - buy device A with device B and get a discount X-dollars.</em>  <em>First, the sellers were not informed (or rather, they were not initially thought out) what a discount is being given to the current purchase or the next one.</em>  <em>Secondly, the action was focused on the corporate segment, most of the payments had to occur by bank transfer, but it was not envisaged how to issue this entire share in accounting.</em>  <em>Thirdly, the technical support service, which simply did not have enough resources to service the increased number of applications, was not warned.</em>  <em>All this has led to a huge number of triple sales and even to the loss of existing customers.</em> </blockquote><br>  You must accompany the customer after purchase.  The seller, who lives on a percentage of sales, is a creature who imagines himself very busy, and from that it is short-sighted.  He has no time to do things that will increase sales in the future.  The main thing that a marketer should do after making a deal is to ask the client to write a review, while the client is still in a state of euphoria from purchasing a new toy;  and at the moment when the euphoria subsides, and defects and ‚Äúundocumented properties‚Äù will start to come out - to talk, send support service and help the client to return to normal. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>After introducing the pilot of a large enough and hoping for replicable software project, the client did not expect to use the product after the appearance of the first bugs.</em>  <em>Although the support worked out and much was fixed, customer satisfaction dropped to the level of absolute zero, the success story did not work out.</em>  <em>If at the time of the appearance of problems, someone was near the client and was engaged in psychological help (which tech support is not able to do in principle), the client would hardly go to a direct competitor.</em> </blockquote><br>  It is imperative to find out your strengths and weaknesses.  Sellers only speculate why they made a deal.  Certainly only clients know.  Because the task of marketers is to constantly find out from customers why they made a purchase in your company or preferred you to a competitor.  This will give you the opportunity to more clearly identify your market position and more clearly position your products.
