  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does Russia need aircraft carriers? - 2. What is an aircraft carrier</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And now slowly about what an aircraft carrier. <br>  This structure is two and a half (or even three) football fields (the field is usually 110 m) and is higher than an 11-storey building. <br>  This structure should move.  At a minimum speed of 40 km / h. <br>  American aircraft carriers are traveling at a speed of 33 knots.  Those.  33 x 1,852 = about 70 km / h. <br>  On the aircraft carrier should be warm, electricity, water.  People have to live there, sleep, eat, bathe.  To be treated (appendicitis, teeth, lungs, etc.), too. <br>  This "multi-storey house" has a weapon: <br>  - Cruise missiles (8 meters long each). <br>  - Several anti-aircraft complexes with a bunch of missiles in the cellars. <br>  - Two guns of universal caliber with a lot of shells in the cellars. <br>  - Four batteries MZA.  Each battery consists of 2 guns.  The gun has 6 rotating barrels of 30 mm caliber each.  The gun's rate of fire is more than 4 thousand rounds per minute.  A short press on the trigger (foot) and 20-25 rounds flew away.  The battery is controlled by a radar.  And at the top stands the fighter (fire manager) behind the sighting column.  When he sees a rocket diving into a ship, he takes control over himself and lands on the rocket in bursts. <br>  <i>In the movie "Predator" a machine gunner is shown with a machine gun whose barrels rotate.</i>  <i>This is Hollywood.</i>  <i>Such machine guns can stand (and stand) only stationary.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>no one will be able to hold them in their hands and the ammunition is spat out in tech.</i>  <i>a few seconds.</i> <br>  So that you can see where to shoot the aircraft carrier has the means of lighting the situation: <br>  - <u>Air</u> (two radar with a large antenna at the top).  The station sees within the line of sight, so it is placed as high as possible.  The distance calculation is simple - 4.12 x square root (inside the target height in the square + antenna height in the square; heights are driven in in meters, and the range is in km).  Those.  a target at a height of 15 meters is detected somewhere at a distance of 37 km. <br>  Comrade, engineer of the air situation group, Igor U., carried out repair work at the VChB (high-frequency unit) of the MR-600 radar.  It is in the VCHB that the radar power is formed and transmitted to the antenna of the antenna mirror.  Megawatts! <br>  As a few thousand volts jumped through the sensor, my leg was pierced right through. <br>  And this is subject to security measures: work with the equipment with one hand, a rubber mat under your feet, etc.! <br>  " <b>I know, Igor, why you remained alive. You would have two young children and it would be very unfair for your god to take your soul to yourself</b> ." <br>  - <u>Surface.</u>  This is a common navigation radar operating in the 3-cm range.  Usually their two sets. <br>  Antennas are located either on the sides (left, right) or in the bow and stern.  To provide a 360 degree view.  Sailors are so accustomed to them that without the NRLS they can not do anything - either go out to sea or stand in the middle of the bay. <br>  - <u>Underwater.</u>  This is a hydroacoustic complex.  It has two modes of operation: ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and ‚Äúecho‚Äù.  ‚ÄúNoise‚Äù is when one simply listens to the aquatic environment and that‚Äôs all.  ‚ÄúEcho‚Äù is when a reflected signal is received.  Because  the sound travels at low speed (1500 m / s), the radiation goes in all directions and the receiver "turns" in all directions.  Surface ships usually work on radiation, and the boats are silent so as not to unmask themselves. <br>  Antennas GAK are located in the nasal bulba or under the bottom.  There are towed antennas.  They have only large ships.  Their main advantage is that it can be lowered into the depth, under the layer of "jump".  ‚ÄúJump‚Äù is a phenomenon when the temperature in the sea decreases with increasing depth, then increases.  A separation boundary is created from which the impulse sent from the surface is reflected from the ‚Äújump‚Äù to the top.  Submariners like to go below the jump layer, and put the antenna above the layer. <br>  - There is also a processing system for the information from all the systems - a CICS (combat information management system). <br>  I list in order to make it clear how complicated everything is.  Everything weighs dozens, or even hundreds, tons.  Requires power supply, cold, ventilation, maintenance. <br><br>  And then there are people.  With apartments and without.  With family life.  They are sick.  Sick family members.  Women give birth.  They give birth to wives, lovers, acquaintances. <br>  One gives birth, and several people mark, thinking that from him.  :)))) <br>  More people go on vacation.  Receive a real, food and monetary allowance. <br>  <b>This is a thousand people!</b> <br><br>  <b>On the "Kiev" people picked up seriously.</b>  <b>"Kiev" beat all imaginable and not imaginable records.</b>  <b>He was the firstborn in his class.</b>  <b>The only ship awarded the Order of the Red Banner in peacetime.</b>  <b>He was - Red Banner.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Takr constantly went on long voyages, carried out firing.</b>  <b>He won the prizes of the Commander in Chief and the Ministry of Defense.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>For all the time there were two plane crashes, but not a single pilot was killed.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>A lot of officers from the cruiser went on promotion.</b>  <b>They knew about each of us directly in Moscow, because</b>  <b>coming with various checks and commissions, they, of course, could not pass by.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The officers on the cruiser were unusual.</b>  <b>These were not people.</b>  <b>These were legends.</b>  <b>You can write a book about each of them and in the ‚ÄúLife of Wonderful People‚Äù series it will take a worthy place.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>As for me, I was just lucky.</b>

      We, young lieutenants, walked and ached, that we don‚Äôt like one thing, the other, the third.  A Komsomol member who was older once said: <b>‚ÄúWhat are you whining about?</b>  <b>You have an excellent officer corps.</b>  <b>And everything else is nonsense. ‚Äù</b> <b><br></b>  <b>‚ÄúAnd what are bad officer teams?‚Äù</b> I asked a naive question. <br>  He grinned and said nothing. <br>  When I had to later serve in a <u>very bad officer team</u> , I constantly remembered this incident. <br><br>  Continuation <a href="http://cayman.habrahabr.ru/blog/42238/">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42237/</a></p>
