Everything was very raw at first, but gradually we are improving: we moved to a permanent address, the forum and chat work stably, good people helped with graphics, the interface is being worked on, and of course the concept is being improved every day.  Below is a video on YouTube, which reveals the basic concepts of the game, which are unlikely to change already, but a number of points were not included in the video, for example, the screen of battles between knights - there still need to work. <br><br>  <a href="http://cyberrise.eu/"><b>You can play here</b></a> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uC0VNgwWcy4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhfirWZ_HZ0fC-A8OaxzMlF3Zp7_Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      <b>Attention bots ...</b> <br>  And also, what is important to say at the very beginning.  If you look at my articles on Habr√©, you will find out that I am engaged in, among other things, artificial intelligence.  The concept of the game involves creating bots.  In fact, for ordinary players, a number of points have already been automated here.  But the environment of the game is such that modern methods of artificial intelligence do not allow to unequivocally get the win using a bot.  At the same time, the game easily falls into formalization, which can be described as "the <i>search for a certain state by the character of the game, under which a certain criterion will be maximized under given constraints</i> ".  From here there is an opportunity <b>to arrange bots competitions</b> .  Therefore, I urge discussion, who would like to do this, I am ready to contribute and write an API for this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  News in the game concept </h4><br><br><blockquote>  The game "Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãDevelopment" is a free browser-based real-time strategy.  Getting into this world as a laborer, without property and experience, you may or may not have a family.  You can become a craftsman, a merchant or a knight.  Each profession has its own unique advantages, and not necessarily a knight will be more successful than a merchant, or an artisan - everything is determined by the current development of the game world.  A person can not be different, but you can play simultaneously for different characters, making them part of your family.  So you will create your own unique kind, which will be remembered for ages. </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/211028/">Since last time</a> , the concept has changed somewhat.  Instead of allowing clones to be created, the ability to manage them from one account was made and conceptually this turned into the concept of a game in the form of a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù.  The concept of "Family" is quite important.  A family can consist of both real players and clones.  By registering in a game, a player‚Äôs character can get parents ‚Äî other players who are already playing.  It is assumed that more experienced players will help their "children" - the players beginners.  But in order for ‚Äúchildren‚Äù to appear, players need to create a marriage.  And then they have a chance to get "children", the healthier the characters of the players, the higher the chance.  Having children is not just a social connection between players, but also has practical implications.  The spouse (s) and / or ‚Äúchildren‚Äù receive an inheritance in the event that a family member dies. <br><br>  Another type of family members is so-called.  "Other family members."  In fact, these are clones, only they are forbidden to have families.  They are useful in doing business.  Cities are distinguished by the availability of resources and it is important to study where resources are greater and there it is beneficial to have your own artisan representative who can work on the daily routine of automatically extracting food.  Then it becomes possible to create entire production retail networks.  And the one who will succeed in this and will be in the top of successful players in the ranking. <br><br><h4>  How players developed the game </h4><br><br>  I already wrote that the players have a significant impact on the development of the game world.  The game initially had only a small amount of basic products with about 50 items.  Now, players have proposed the introduction of new products and ways to create them, and now there are already more than 120 items. <br><br>  I also mentioned that the players helped with the graphics.  One artist (non-specialist) painted the background and all the buildings to display the city.  And since the number of products in the game is growing, the need to display them in the form of a small pattern is constantly growing.  And here, at first, the players helped to find relevant pictures on the Internet under free licenses, and then they began to draw themselves. <br><br>  In addition to the development of a chain of products, the core of the game involves the ability to increase the characteristics of the character.  These characteristics are enhanced by the creation of a number of items.  Of course, some software support is also needed, but it's worth it.  Thus, the temperature in the city was introduced into the game, and the character feels hot and cold, can heat the stove, cool down, otherwise health is lost.  You can also create clothes that will warm in cold weather.  And this is just one example. <br><br>  Even at the moment in the game such product characteristic as quality is not very often used.  But at the suggestion of players, a mechanism has now been introduced in which raw materials need higher than a certain quality to create certain products. <br><br>  Also, if earlier for the growth of the level of buildings it was necessary to pay only in cash, now you may need to perform a so-called.  tender.  Tender is also a kind of product that requires different raw materials.  When it is executed it can be the subject of purchase / sale. <br><br>  Thus, the game makes you - the players, and we are waiting for you.  It is assumed that players will develop the game world to modern times and go on creating cyber-organisms :) But for now this is still far away - but you can be the first! <br><br><h4>  The introduction of an artificial market? </h4><br><br>  Initially, I did not want this.  And previously wrote exactly the opposite <br><br><blockquote>  the question arose, where do you get the money supply?  If it is issued through fictitious demand, then again we will get an artificial market.  Then an interesting idea occurred to me.  Money must be provided with something.  In reality, gold or the state‚Äôs obligation to always receive goods for money.  But what is really appreciated by players playing browser games?  And then I understood - time is money, and vice versa.  There was also such a fantastic film, where people earned and paid the time.  So, in the game ‚ÄúCyberset‚Äù, everything is exactly like that - money is given out for $ 1 per second spent on the creation of goods (except for the case of automated production by an artisan).  And at the end of production, you get the goods to the warehouse and money.  It would seem a bit strange.  But consider that this is such a new social system, where everyone is allowed to print money depending on the time spent on production.  And then the one that does not have a natural market begins - you buy, sell, rob the time of another player who earned more - he is in the top of the best players. </blockquote><br><br>  Alas, in the conditions of a small number of players, this idea does not work.  Here, of course, the fact that the audience of economic games is not so large and it is difficult for players to think through economic development schemes and set prices is also affected.  Everyone wants one click and develop a character, so the markets in the game are not developed.  It turned out that there was little incentive for the player, since everyone can "print money" himself. <br><br>  Therefore, we had to introduce a government that buys goods at prices close to world prices.  In world prices takes into account the time spent on the production of the product and all its components.  Prices in a particular city change - if there is no product in the city for sale, the price increases by 1% (there is an upper chapel), if there is a decrease by 1%.  And competition issues are decided by the following approach: <br><br><blockquote>  In the city, for each product per game day, only one item is selected for purchase - the best price / quality combination.  Each product has its own liquidity, and depending on its government, a certain amount of money is allocated for the purchase, if there is not enough money for units.  product, then nothing is bought, and accumulated cash accumulates.  If the money is bought, then the quantity, how much money is allocated for this product. </blockquote><br><br>  But this artificiality of the market is still not the same as in other games.  There is a clearly distinguished character "government", and only it prints money.  Keeps records of how much cash it spent on purchases.  But the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù has revenues - cash, which is paid for an increase in the level of buildings.  Therefore, the economic system is closed and close to real, in contrast to the ‚Äúdominance‚Äù of open economic systems, which have nothing to do with reality. <br><br>  Perhaps in the near future, the government will also sell the products purchased earlier, transporting them to the capital.  And thus, the government will become just a bot at the state level.  Well, with sufficient development, other governments may be introduced, but already controlled by bots of players. <br><br>  Therefore, gentlemen programmers - welcome, let's discuss the creation of bots for this game. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221195/</a></p>
