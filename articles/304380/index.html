      Predicting the future of a university graduate is not so easy.  Some professions will die away under the influence of widespread automation or lack of demand by the market, for some there will be an oversupply of offers and high competition.  Take for example the popular specialty - economics.  Many of the applicants, having passed the profile mathematics, are going to go to study for accountants or other financial professionals.  And although now the demand for them is high, what will happen in 2020, when the student unlearns and will look for work, it is difficult to predict.  It all depends on the state of our long-suffering economy. <br><br>  The director of the <a href="http://academiarf.ru/">Federal Center for Online Training "Academy"</a> decided to help parents and applicants with the choice of a promising profession.  Gennady Bazhenov asked me to make a selection of specialties, which, according to experts, will be in demand in 2020. I‚Äôm offering it to your attention now. <br><br><h2>  How was compiled </h2><br>  1. I studied the results of a study conducted by the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives ( <a href="http://atlas100.ru/upload/pdf_files/atlas.pdf">download</a> Atlas of Future Professions). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/107/55e/e50/10755ee509f24a27bca86e771af92345.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75b/0d3/da5/75b0d3da5d1a4f88b3c7ac411fe15706.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2. I selected the most promising sectors of the Russian market from the atlas, according to the experts I interviewed.  And within these industries - the most relevant specialty-2020 - engineering (as predicted by the Ministry of Education and Science). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d6/4a2/ecc/7d64a2ecc30747149c9b0d9c38c623c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Left those of them, for admission to which you need a specialized mathematics (based on the hypothesis of the inclinations of your child to the exact sciences). <br><br><h2>  Promising industries and specialties </h2><br>  In short, the promising sectors of the future are areas of activity related to the formation of the sixth technological order (for some reason I am sure that you do not need to explain what it is). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/973/c58/b28/973c58b28ab947f4835bc91070acebdd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Namely: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">Biotechnology, based on the achievements of molecular biology and genetic engineering,</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">nanotechnology</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">production of construction materials with predetermined properties,</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">flexible production automation,</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">artificial intelligence systems and global information networks,</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">robotics,</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">integrated high-speed transport systems</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304380/">alternative renewable energy sources.</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Why specialists of these industries will be in demand?</b> <br><br>  Yuri Mikheev, consultant of the GC ‚ÄúInstitute of Training - ARB Pro‚Äù (works in the field of HR consulting), expresses his opinion: <i>‚ÄúOn the one hand, our country has a technological base and relevant developments.</i>  <i>On the other hand, there are very few highly qualified specialists.</i>  <i>In the near future, deep competences will become more and more in demand, because the market is actively maturing for high technologies (including the biotechnological sphere).</i>  <i>Today in our country we see the following picture: on the one hand, a developing market economy, on the other - not fully realized potential. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h3><a name="bio"></a>  1. Biotechnology </h3><br>  According to the <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20150527/1066743842.html">report of the FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Program</a> , about 800 million people on our planet suffer from hunger (of almost 7 billion living).  One way to solve the problem of world hunger in the 21st century will be genetic engineering. <br><br>  The situation with biotechnology in Russia is commented on by Olesya Elagina, an expert of the Job.ru portal: <i>‚ÄúAccording to most forecasts, the nutrition of the future is, alas, not natural, natural food, but products with an ever-increasing proportion of additives.</i>  <i>Therefore, food industry experts with knowledge of biology and engineering will be in great demand</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bf/bc3/bf5/5bfbc3bf5e2144abb31755eb5b1c78c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Biotechnologists will be in demand in the food industry, medicine (the production of organic medicines and household chemicals), energy (biofuels), the production of raw materials and biomaterials for construction.</b> <br><br>  Basic training can be obtained in the following specialties: <br><br><ul><li>  03/12/04 Biotechnical systems and technologies </li><li>  06.05.01 Bioengineering and Bioinformatics </li><li>  03/19/01 Biotechnology </li></ul><br>  Where: <br><br><ul><li>  Tomsk Polytechnic University </li><li>  Moscow State University </li><li>  Northern (Arctic) Federal University </li><li>  Udmurt State University </li><li>  Far Eastern State Technical Fisheries University </li><li>  Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Agricultural Academy.

New materials and nanotechnology </h3><br>  <i>‚ÄúModern technologies have reached a level where any improvement requires a real breakthrough.</i>  <i>The main limitations of development are laid down in familiar materials, whose possibilities are almost exhausted.</i>  <i>All breakthrough technologies in the next 5-10 years will be based on new materials,</i> ‚Äùsays Alevtina Chernikova, Rector of the National Research Technological University‚Äú MISiS ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f81/5c0/074/f815c0074e8048e9ba45205c64ec0323.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Future materials are composites created, including with the use of nanostructures.  They leave far behind traditional materials (wood, metal, stone) in terms of strength, lightness and even cost.  The scope of application of composites is enormous - aerospace industry, engineering, construction, etc. <br><br>  Composites began to be used in the 2nd half of the XX century.  Russia is ten times behind the West in terms of the use of composites.  Recently, the gap is narrowing, but the lack of personnel slows down the process.  <b>Therefore, in 2020 and further there will be demand for specialists in the field of materials science, the creation of new and modification of already existing materials.</b> <br><br>  In addition to composites, 3D printing has a great prospect.  It is a technology that allows you to print any objects from special compositions, be it a computer board, a musical instrument, a weapon, or a medical prosthesis. <br><br>  In the coming years, we can expect a transition from modular production to the production of whole products using a 3D printer.  <b>This means that the demand for 3D printing specialists will grow.</b> <br><br>  A future material scientist may receive a basic education in the specialty: <br><br><ul><li>  03/04/02 Chemistry, Physics and Mechanics of Materials </li><li>  03.22.01 Materials science and materials technology </li><li>  28.03.01 Nanotechnologies and microsystem technology </li><li>  03.28.02 Nanoengineering </li><li>  03.28.03 Nanomaterials </li></ul><br>  Universities: <br><br><ul><li>  Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) </li><li>  National Research Technological University "MISiS" </li><li>  Russian University of Chemical Technology  D.I.
