Is it all a high-quality picture, a stunning effect of presence?  Maybe in the indescribable feeling of involvement in the most incredible events?  Or nevertheless in the maximum universality of use in any situations? <br><br>  Of course, any of these reasons deserve to be the main one.  But‚Ä¶ <br>  The camera remains just a camera, no matter how sophisticated it is.  Without talent to create interesting moments millions of likes can not be collected.  Just as without the ability to remove these moments.  But to help novice operators work a whole industry: new accessories for GoPro are created daily by the dozens.  And only the best of them get funding on Kickstarter.com.  In this collection of 10 projects that managed to collect the stated amount. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>MOTA wireless charging</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/193/c87/356193c87dba4ca88fbecbf803383fc8.png"><br><br>  Batteries and rechargeable batteries - one of the weakest points of all electronic gadgets.  But, when we talk about filming in extreme situations, for which sometimes you are preparing for a month, there should not be any fakaps.  Even if you shoot UHD or 4K.  But open the camera case, pull out the batteries - and if there is water all around?  Or dirt? <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mota/mota-wireless-charger-for-gopro%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">MOTA</a> wireless charging for GoPro 4 and GoPro 3 cameras is a solution that should have appeared sooner or later.  Charge the camera, smartphone, player in any conditions, without violating the integrity of the box.  You can buy a kit with wires and an extra battery for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mota/mota-wireless-charger-for-gopro%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">$ 90</a> . <br><br>  <b>Sidekick Flash for GoPro</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/208/09d/e5920809dfa7416289d63e51dddfebab.png"><br><br>  Lightweight, compact, fully compatible with GoPro models, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lightandmotion/sidekick-a-gopro-companion-light%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Sidekick</a> flash illumination will solve all shooting problems in low light conditions, and in any situation, up to diving under water to a depth of 60 m. The design uses the most efficient LED lamps to date. Cree U2 capacity of 600 lumens and a scattering angle of up to 90 degrees.  You can order a flash <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lightandmotion/sidekick-a-gopro-companion-light%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">here</a> , $ 100 - and in March you will be shooting. <br><br>  <b>EasyGimbal Triaxial Stabilizer for GoPro 3</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d80/a45/d2d/d80a45d2d12f43c38a8186ac6c17526b.png"><br><br>  Love to shoot video, but you just can not achieve a smooth shooting and a clear frame?  With the new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/48127572/easygimbal-an-advanced-gopro-3-camera-stabilizer%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">EasyGimbal</a> holder with a built-in three-axis gyroscope for your GoPro 3 / GoPro 3+ camera, you no longer have to sweat and re-shoot the scene - just <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/48127572/easygimbal-an-advanced-gopro-3-camera-stabilizer%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">hold the</a> holder in your hand and turn on the camera.  And with the second hand, you can do your favorite thing - all real directors do this.  I mean, they drink beer. <br>  True, the device is not cheap - <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/48127572/easygimbal-an-advanced-gopro-3-camera-stabilizer%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">$ 599</a> per set, but judging by the successful funding, the thing is worth it. <br><br>  <b>Drone stabilizer for smooth video shooting of XproHeli XPG</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/155/a41/164/155a41164f2f4a2ea7cb55e38596a220.png"><br><br>  Smooth shooting from any angle and from any point - even on the ground, even in the air.  Plus both hands are free. <br>  Another development for directors of all genres and artistic styles.  The portable <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hansskjersaa/xpg-brushless-gimbal-for-gopro-hero-2-3-by-xprohel%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">XproHeli XPG</a> holder for a camera with a built-in two-axis gyroscope will solve all the issues of professional shooting in a stationary position on any surface.  There is also an option to use the holder as a drone - you can purchase a full set for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hansskjersaa/xpg-brushless-gimbal-for-gopro-hero-2-3-by-xprohel%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">$ 498</a> . <br><br>  <b>Morpheus Stabilizer for GoPro</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/bb8/91d/9d1bb891d400446a9df9964a0ccc15ac.png"><br><br>  Judging by the number of developments for high-quality shooting, the problem of hand shake among users of GoPro cameras is really acute.  For whatever reason this happens, one can only guess, but the most talented minds are thrown at the solution of the problem. <br>  Another device with a patented frictionless gyro on a magnetic disk will allow you to shoot with one hand or positioning the structure on any surface - the specified camera position will be unchanged.  It is possible to buy Morpheus stabilizer for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cinevate/morpheus-stabilizer-for-gopro-smartphone-and-small%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">$ 125</a> . <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúNext on the heels‚Äù: automatic drone operator AIRDOG</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cac/723/759/cac7237592944b0cba2b602536da6add.png"><br><br>  Do you like extreme sports?  But narrow-angle shooting from a helmet, bike or snowboard is no longer impressive?  No problems!  The new automatic drone AIRDOG will literally follow you on its heels, removing the entire picture entirely from different angles and distances of approximation.  It is enough to put <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/airdog/airdog-worlds-first-auto-follow-action-sports-dron%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">AIRLEASH</a> receiver transmitter on your hand, and the drone will not lag behind!

This is a must <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/95342015/360o-for-gopro-dslr-video-and-compact-cameras-ocul">see</a> !

The cost of the kits starts from $ 59. <br><br>  <b>Safety and universal fastener system from HEADCASEpro</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24c/605/e9f/24c605e9f94f485cad348e0aa316e458.png"><br><br>  To ensure the safety of the camera and to be able to dock it with any holder - this is exactly the task that the engineers who created the universal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jimlclark/unruly-headcase-headgear-cases-for-gopro%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">HEADCASEpro</a> box have <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jimlclark/unruly-headcase-headgear-cases-for-gopro%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">set themselves</a> .
