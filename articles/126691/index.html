Having deflected and decreased in volumes after the collapse of the USSR, it is not inferior to railways in the passenger traffic volumes, and at the same time it is much freer and more market-oriented: unlike the ‚Äúnatural monopoly‚Äù of Russian Railways, the sky is open to all.  And where there is competition, there is a place and choice.  It is not surprising that in recent years services for finding cheap prices for airline tickets are gaining momentum.  One such project, a completely ‚Äúfresh‚Äù startup from Fast Lane Ventures, is a meta-search for cheap airline tickets to <b><a href="http://jizo.ru/">Jizo.ru.</a></b>  The project has its own unique pieces, which I will discuss in this review. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/126691/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fc/a2d/4bc/8fca2d4bcaad2cff2427fa4b0bb97d1e.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  History of creation </h4><br>  Jizo.ru (Dzhizo-dot-ru) is named in honor of the Japanese god-patron of travelers.  The story of creating a project from the category of ‚Äúin the right place at the right time‚Äù - the company's founder, former e-commerce director and former technical director of Amargo, thought about creating an airline ticket aggregator when Fast Lane Ventures decided to expand its investment portfolio by similar project.  The initiative met the initiator, and in May of this year the project was launched. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/about.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/693035ed/6d687f53/8a91e6e4/62826946.png" align="right"></a>  According to the creators of the project, the market is still far from overheating - in Europe and America, such services are much more common.  We have not yet established the tradition of searching and buying tickets via the Internet.  And there are not so many services in this market - the main competitors of Jizo.ru are Skyscanner, Momondo, air ticket purchase services on Yandex. Schedules and AviaSales.  As long as the market is not saturated, there will still be a place for startups like this - consumers are only on hand.

      The functionality of any search engine of air tickets is standard: a selection of offers from airlines for the desired date on the desired route.  Nevertheless, Jizo.ru has its own ‚Äútrick‚Äù, which distinguishes it among competitors and makes it one of the most controversial services on the market.  But let's start in order. <br><br><h4>  the main </h4><br>  The main place on the main page is, of course, the search for tickets.  When you refresh the page, you can notice one of the stylistic features of the site - the background that changes every time. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40f/7e8/eb2/40f7e8eb2b162e8d6ee2775b7101e93d.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Search </h4><br>  It is possible to set the parameters for selecting a ticket - the number of seats in categories: adults, children, babies up to two years.  And, of course, the possibility of choosing the date of departure and route. <br><br>  For example, choose the route Moscow - Kazan on September 2. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/136/4bc/862/1364bc86217d02d9d0790470e659cb8d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The page of all received results is loaded.  By default, sorting occurs at a cost from cheaper to more expensive.  You can specify additional filters: time of departure and landing, used by the airline, airports of departure and arrival (if only the city was specified in the search), as well as airports for transfer.  In addition, the issuance can be displayed as flights, and rail. <br><br><h2>  Interesting fact: the average time of choosing a ticket from the beginning of the search to purchase is about 10 days. </h2><br>  It is worth noting that the price of tickets for the flight is indicated "from".  That is, most likely, we are talking about economy class.  And if you did not find the option that suits you, then in the search results you can subscribe to price updates - or close this window. <br><br><h4>  Full 2D </h4><br>  The way to display information is one of the main features of the project.  It is a timeline, divided into equal intervals, which can be ‚Äúscrolled‚Äù both horizontally and vertically (this can be done only with a mouse or touchpad, but not with a keyboard) - you can immediately see how many time you fly, how many time you arrive. flight expectations during transfer and total flight time.  This is perhaps the most important thing - as experience shows, many users of ticket search engines, choosing the cheapest options with a transfer, do not always pay attention to the waiting time for the second flight - and this can be several hours or night.  The cost of a hotel and just a waste of time can completely mask the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù of such a choice.  Infographics Jizo.ru reduces this risk to a minimum. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/16b/983/e1116b983bcfb85d3e4873df0daeca06.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The structure of the output of the results is not for the humanities - in fact, there is nothing complicated in it, it is a two-dimensional chart, where the price display is vertical and the time scale is horizontal.  Having understood, you find this format quite convenient - but the user may get confused.  Only a ‚Äúgalloping‚Äù plate with a price threshold interferes a little - with careless movements with the cursor on the page, this introduces some visual chaos.  Highlighting the entire line with the selected flight would not be so intrusive and more familiar. <br><br>  When clicking on the selected flight, the Ajax opens a window with detailed flight information. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5a/46c/59b/d5a46c59b6a3c1b6d6ec47ca50867a4e.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Railway tickets </h4><br>  In addition to the selection of tickets, jizo.ru provides the ability to search for trains on the "Russian Railways".  By default, railway and airline options are given out in the general list, so the choice to fly by plane or, for example, to go by train, is absolutely visual.  If the train tickets do not interest you, or, on the contrary, you want to remove the flight, you can do it by simply unchecking the corresponding checkbox in the top menu.  Or, the search can be set directly from the main page of the site: specify the date and point of departure, as well as the destination, click "Search" and see the result. <br><br>  As an example, let's look for a train on the route Moscow-Novosibirsk on August 20, 2011. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e9/9e8/613/9e99e8613afb2cd270d9147d08f458a7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  They are sorted by departure time.  It is obligatory to indicate the time on the way, the date of arrival, brief information about the train (whether it is fast or firm, as well as the possibility of electronic check-in), the minimum fare for each type of car: coupe, reserved seat, suite.  Of course, the display of the number of empty seats in each type of car is also present. <br><br>  Clicking on the route of a particular train (for example, let's take the corporate fast train ‚ÄúSibiryak‚Äù), you can see detailed information about the trip: at which stations it stops, how long the stop lasts when it arrives and departs from this or that station. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c5/fb4/7eb/0c5fb47eb97d835af6aed28d3c61c51e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Clicking on the same type of car, we get to the menu of buying a ticket.  Information about available places in the cars of this class, the car number and its category (for example, ‚Äúcompartment car of enhanced comfort with power‚Äù) are displayed in more detail.  Accordingly, these indicators indicate the price.  From here you can book a place.  I chose coupe-class cars on the Sibiryak train. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/977/bc9/c06/977bc9c06ce8379c6b0a7ad9f8c6a58a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The success of the solution with the joint data output is indicated by the project statistics: despite the fact that Jizo.ru is an air explorer, orders for railway tickets on it today make up a very large share, which was a pleasant surprise even for the project founders.  Although it is surprising - the night on the train on the route, for example, Moscow-Peter wins before the day flight, not only for money, but also for convenience.  An important caveat - in the railroad issue, the minimum bracket is the price for compartment tickets, and not, God forbid, reserved seat. <br><br><h4>  Site Navigation </h4><br>  Almost all actions related to the search and selection of tickets take place without reloading the page - at <a href="http://www.jizo.ru/">www.jizo.ru.</a> To change the input conditions (for example, arrival city), for example, just click on the logo - and the page will ‚Äúgo up‚Äù, returning search form.  Another thing is that this is not an obvious move from the point of view of usability - a link like ‚Äúchanging route data‚Äù would not hurt. <br><br><h4>  Hotels and car booking </h4><br>  In general, how to get - decided.  Now at the same time on Jizo.ru, you can decide the question "where to live" and what is the time to move around.  Go to the tab "Hotels" and enter the required data.  For example, you gathered in Moscow on August 30 and leave on September 3.  At the same time living in a hotel is lower than the "5 stars", your person does not want.  Everything is very simple!  On the tab ‚ÄúHotels‚Äù we indicate the necessary information: Moscow, 1 person, 1 number, we will leave on August 30, we will arrive on September 3.  Click "Search" and get the results.  Now we remove all this ‚Äúlow-star garbage‚Äù by adding an additional criterion - in the ‚ÄúStar rating‚Äù field we tick the 5 stars and get the results only for the hotels of the selected class. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/802/f8f/6ed/802f8f6ed4fc0675d0796b1f66797073.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In addition, using Jizo.ru, you can rent a car rental.  We indicate the place where we want to take it, the place where we are going to return (if it is different), age (I should point out that I could not find cars for those under 21), currency and country of residence.  Having tried to rent a car, we will get to the booking menu.  There you can specify additional parameters, such as built-in GPS, personal driver (no more than 4).  In addition, if you are traveling with a newborn child, you will receive a discount of about 10%.  Thus, booking a Volkswagen Golf car for 3 days will cost 13,184.52 rubles.  plus 620,29 rub.  for GPS.  You can pay immediately using an affiliate network, however, additional options are paid separately when getting a car in your hands. <br><br> <a href="http://jizo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbb/4a2/fdd/bbb4a2fdd74631196659d54bdc7dab61.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The current audience of the project is about 25,000 people per day, and it is constantly increasing.  They learn about the site from the specialized press - for example, magazines on the sides of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù aircraft of domestic air carriers - Aeroflot, Transaero and S7.  And, of course, a significant part of the audience comes from the context.  In any case, Jizo.ru, like any other projects in the search engine niche for air tickets, has room to grow - according to statistics from the second half of 2010, less than 1% of those flying were engaged in finding and buying tickets via the Internet.  Most people still buy tickets at the air ticket offices, travel agencies, and even on the Internet using their online offices. <br><br>  According to statistics from 2011, preliminary estimates give an increase of up to 2.5%, which is still very, very little - which means the market has room to grow.  Jizo.ru will grow and change - we will tell you about the most important news of this project. <br><br>  <b>NB: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/">Subscribe</a></b> to our blog and you will not miss anything interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126691/</a></p>
