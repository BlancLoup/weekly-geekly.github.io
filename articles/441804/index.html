  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to teach children programming?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year, HeadHunter holds a ‚Äú <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">School of Programmers</a> ‚Äù, where it teaches students and young professionals all the tricks of development, as well as teamwork.  In addition to programming languages, children learn the basics of design, the subtleties of team development. <br><br>  Recently, we began to discuss how to be parents, if their children want to become developers.  The question is even interesting because in our technical department there are more than 130 employees - almost everyone has their own way of development and it was not possible to identify a single success story. <br><br>  I was puzzled by this question and decided to ask my parent colleagues what courses, books and websites can be advised to a novice programmer.  Following the results I collected for you a selection of materials that, according to colleagues, will help children learn the basics of development.

But there are so many interesting problems in the world that can be solved by accumulating points, teaming up with friends in groups and showing off the results: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> .  Achivki, grades, good tasks - such options motivate even adults to learn and work. <br><br>  You can also pay attention to similar primary sources of projects such as <a href="https://projecteuler.net/index.php">Project Euler</a> . <br><br>  Let your novice developer paint a figure with a bug, make a couple of useful programs.  For starters, this is what you need to decide whether he wants to develop and whether he has the makings of a novice coder.  This will help <a href="https://codewards.ru/">Codeward</a> , which in a game form will teach children skills and concepts, universal for any programming language. <br><br><h3>  // Full-time education <br></h3><br>  Does your child have eyes and he wants to go deeper into developing and communicate with those who are also interested in this? <br><br>  For younger children, there is an <a href="http://sch-int.ru/">Intellectual</a> School. <br><br>  But for grades 10-11 I recommend trying to enroll in the <a href="http://internat.msu.ru/">SSC at Moscow State University</a> : <br><br>  The level of training in these schools is at a high level and can simplify admission to leading universities. <br><br>  Additionally, I recommend to pay attention to the All-Russian school action of the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Education ‚Äú <a href="https://xn--h1adlhdnlo2c.xn--p1ai/">Lesson of the number</a> ‚Äù (formerly ‚ÄúHour code‚Äù).  A programming lesson is held once a year (usually in winter) for students from grade 1 to grade 11 throughout Russia.  Maybe it will be for your child the first step in a big and interesting world of all things coding? <br><br><h3>  // Circles </h3><br>  At many specialized universities there are circles and evening schools where they teach courses beyond the curriculum. <br>  There are two of them at MSU: <br>  - <a href="http://mmmf.msu.ru/">Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics</a> <br>  - <a href="https://cs.msu.ru/education/school">Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics</a> <br>  There are also circles at the <a href="https://www.mccme.ru/circles/mccme/2019/">Center for Continuing Mathematical Education</a> . <br><br><h3>  // Correspondence schools at leading universities </h3><br>  If you do not live in Moscow, or you do not have enough time for full-time study, you can always enroll in the correspondence course: <br>  - <a href="http://www.school.mipt.ru/">correspondence school of the Physics and Technology Department</a> <br>  - <a href="http://internat.msu.ru/distantsionnoe-obuchenie/zaochnaya-shkola-sunts-mgu/">SUNTs MSU</a> <br><br><h3>  // Olympiad </h3><br>  If a child is interested in algorithms, writes the implementation of quick sort faster than you manage to google it, and the algorithms on the graphs you have refreshed with him, then you can definitely try your hand at the Olympics. <br><br>  See these options for the Olympics: <br>  - <a href="http://olympiads.mccme.ru/matprazdnik/">Math holiday</a> (6-7 classes) <br>  - <a href="http://mos-inf.olimpiada.ru/">Moscow School Olympiad in Informatics</a> (grades 6-11) <br>  - <a href="http://turlom.olimpiada.ru/">Tournament named after MV</a>  <a href="http://turlom.olimpiada.ru/">Lomonosov</a> (grades 6-11) <br>  - <a href="http://olympiads.mccme.ru/mmo/">Moscow Mathematical Olympiad</a> (8-11 grades) <br>  - <a href="http://olympiads.mccme.ru/ommo/19/">Joint Intercollegiate Mathematical Olympiad</a> (grades 9-11) <br>  - <a href="http://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> <br><br><h3>  // Books </h3><br>  As for the books, they do not keep up with the latest releases, but they make the base clear, they learn the basics competently and in order. <br><br>  You can start with the books of the publishing house ‚ÄúMann, Ferber, Ivanov‚Äù: <br><br>  <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product--programmirovanie-dlia-detei-illiustrirovannoe-rukovodstvo-po-iazykam-scratch-i-python/12432291">Programming for kids.</a>  <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product--programmirovanie-dlia-detei-illiustrirovannoe-rukovodstvo-po-iazykam-scratch-i-python/12432291">Illustrated Scratch and Python Language Guide</a> <br>  The authors of the book offer the child simple projects of games and animations that will involve him in the development process.  Acquaint him with the basics of programming and teach the two most common languages ‚Äã‚Äã- visual Scratch and textual Python. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/python-dlya-detej/">Python for kids</a> <br>  This book is a tutorial on one of the most popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãto date - Python.  Starting with the simplest steps, step by step, you will write your programs and comprehend the subtleties of this language.  You will be able to check your knowledge immediately on funny examples and hilariously funny tasks, which will be handled by greedy monsters, secret agents and thieves-crows. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.labirint.ru/books/551756/">JavaScript for kids</a> <br>  This book is not only an introduction to JavaScript, but generally programming. <br>  It will help you learn how to code in this language ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù.  Each chapter is devoted to a separate topic, and in each subsequent chapter something new is studied, based on what has already been read.  In addition, the book has exercises that will help expand the examples and write your own code.  By the end of the book, the child will be able to program his game with animation! <br><br>  Must read is a <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/34353864/">book about designing worlds in Minecraft</a> <br><br>  The book is specially written for those who not only loves to play, but also wants to create something new.  It will help you easily master programming, just playing Minecraft.  This will help step by step instructions to build a house, a fantastic structure or a 3D copy machine. <br><br>  And those who are older should not forget about the classics of the ‚ÄúPerfect Code‚Äù type genre or GoF.  ‚ÄúObject-oriented design techniques.  Design patterns "- <br>  Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides <br><br><h3>  // Other options </h3><br>  Definitely it makes sense to be like a conference / meeting, it can throw ideas, interest. <br><br>  There is even the cool experience of <a href="https://twitter.com/revelcw">Revel Karlberg West</a> , a 9-year-old girl from New York.  She went to speak at the New York Mitap and is now developing her own React hooks library with the support of the community. <br><br>  Formed the opinion that children need to try.  Trying everything at once or in turn, and already see for yourself what you like and what doesn't. <br><br>  Even if, as a result, the child‚Äôs development does not work, there is a feeling that the basic programming skills will have to be in future jobs - and we know a lot about vacancies! <br><br>  Of course, not everything is here - so we are waiting for your recommendations in the comments.  Online course, book, website, forum - any option from our selection.  <b>The author of the most reserved recommendation will receive all 4 books that I have advised, and a valuable merch from HeadHunter.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441804/</a></p>
