      Compared to smartphones, devices are primitive, but this is part of their charm.  It's like a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/geek-transportation-systems/">scooter</a> compared to a motorcycle.  Not so versatile, but as a simple transport it is radically simpler, cheaper and more reliable.  This is an example of how you can drop the excess and leave only the essence. <br><br>  Paradoxically, eInk devices are also pleasant because they are bad for everything except reading.  At first it doesn‚Äôt look like an object of lust, but then you notice how you read all the time on Twitter, Facebook, Tinder, Snapchat or else where you‚Äôre reading.  And eInk devices allow you to escape from the world and immerse yourself in reading entirely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c8/f28/4d6/0c8f284d66de4af2bb8fe62c65960006.png"><br><br>  I myself think that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/books-bits-vs-atoms/">electronic devices are cooler than paper books</a> .  Of course, we can read on any device that is now with us, and which can show words and paragraphs.  And the appearance of ‚Äúretina‚Äù screens made reading more enjoyable on tablets and smartphones. <br><br>  But the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvery cheap and common eInk devices replacing the very cheap and common paper books that I absorbed as a child attracted me a lot.  I can not refuse it.  <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">Reading is the basis of everything</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4a/6cb/f3e/c4a6cbf3e3724a47aaf514d16261ead3.jpg"><br><br>  That's why I will buy, without looking, every new Kindle device on eInk.  I had the sense not to buy the first one (you just look at it), but since the third generation from 2010 I have all the models. <br><br>  I also tracked the cost of the devices to see when they dropped to $ 49 or less.  While there is no such thing - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I15SB16%3F">simplest reader</a> , which, compared to the first device from 2007, still looks cool, is now selling for $ 59. <br><br>  But back to the flagship device, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ%3F">Kindle Voyage</a> .  It is trying to be not cheap, but cool.  First, this is the first device with a resolution of 300 PPI (also known as ‚Äúretina‚Äù) from Amazon.  If you know how the iPhone 4 changed the world of smartphones, you should already line up. <br><br>  When you see 300 PPI in eInk, you actually think that you are looking at high-quality printing, and not at a matrix of RGB pixels.  Yes, she is still black and white, but awesome.  Here are some screenshots from my device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b94/c8b/822/b94c8b822f5e47109e27eb942cca9b7c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62b/a3a/9cc/62ba3a9cc8b94af4934cb8dc5ecb6621.png"><br><br>  Due to some vagueness inherent in eInk, the image resolution seems even higher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d9/f5f/89f/7d9f5f89f6c648399475d825a5d41bd0.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the resolution allows me to choose a thin, not thick, font, namely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/">Caecilia</a> . <br><br>  The highlight was on the Paperwhite device, and it delivered a lot of toothache.  But the third time is magical, and they have achieved a good backlight, which improves the overall contrast and allows you to read at night.  Voyage also received a light sensor, so that it automatically adjusts the backlight, whether you are outside on a clear day or in a dark room.  It's like auto-tuning the brightness of the headlights - one setting less for manual adjustment. <br><br>  Also, Voyage returned the page turning buttons, more precisely the touch areas on the case.  I admit, it took me a long time to adapt to them, and I already thought that it would not work out - but now I am their follower.  The ability to turn the page, almost without moving a finger - just lightly pressing, to which the device responds with a light tactile vibration, adds pleasure to reading.  But this had to learn and get used to. <br><br>  In my experience, eInk devices are more fragile than average tablets and smartphones.  Therefore, you will need a case to automatically turn on and off and protect the type of "throw the book into the bag."  But unfortunately, the original case is terrible.  Do not buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1f/63f/7a3/f1f63f7a387a49588fb874ba55e8aaf8.jpg"><br><br>  Previous original covers were expensive, but well made.  The cover for Voyage is expensive and disgusting.  Strangely folded, dangling, destroying the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the book should open.  I recommend a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KD7ZRJ4%3F">simple case for $ 14.99</a> , which works with automatic shutdown and opens in a normal way. <br><br>  Well, not all the device has really roses and songs, of course.  <a href="http://www.lunascafe.org/2011/04/typography-is-about-reading-and-so-are.html">Problems with formatting the text</a> have not gone away - but I would like to expect more from a huge company that deals with books.  And which has a huge budget and a lot of smart people on the salary. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1551950527990381426="true"><p>  This is what it looks like. </p>  - Justin Van Slembrou ...

While this is the best device.  I would recommend, I would buy again, and probably buy all the future models on eInk, because I am addicted to them.  Addicted to reading.  Reading is the basis of everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364399/</a></p>
