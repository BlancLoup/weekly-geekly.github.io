  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seller without experience: to take or not to take?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Sellers or, as it is now fashionable to say, sales managers, are needed by every business: from a stall selling vegetables and seeds to a large IT company that turns zeros and ones into someone's income.  And any competent leader understands that it is not enough just to do SEO-optimization of the site, pay for the context, buy links and wait for customers to hurry to bring the company their money.  Accordingly, a volitional decision is made at one or another stage of the company's expansion: to organize a sales department. <br><br>  It would seem that half the work is done, it remains only to hire competent specialists who know exactly how to offer / explain / persuade. <br><br>  This article is about whether to hire experienced sellers and how to organize the correct work in the sales department. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d0b/d35/03c/d0bd3503c64032c196323cc3b52d616c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  + He can sell.  He sold toothbrushes, glasses and household appliances.  He worked in the online store, on cold calls and in the cabin.  He will sell, you can not doubt. <br>  + He knows everything.  He went to a bunch of trainings, he will teach you many chips that you wouldn‚Äôt have thought of to use in the sale yourself. <br>  + He has experience.  You have deprived a competitor of a serious advantage; this advantage now works for you. <br>  + He knows not only how to sell, he has a base of your competitors. <br>  + He does not need to learn.  Sales will start immediately, you will not spend time.  After all, the main thing - to be able to sell, the product can be learned in the process, he already knows, faced. <br>  + He will help.  He will tell you what motivation systems were in the past, how the department‚Äôs work was built, and help you find other cool vendors from those with whom he worked.

      I can miss something from the pluses, if I wish, this list can be added to myself for everyone.  Supplemented?  Let's go further.  Reverse side of the coin: cons of an experienced seller. <br><br>  - He is able to sell.  Do not hesitate, he will sell you himself very expensive, but so beautifully that when you understand this, you will once again make sure that he is a cool seller.  But darling. <br>  - He knows everything.  Better than you, better than competitors, customers and everyone else.  He will not learn new things, he will teach the old you and lower you 1 lvl lower.  But he has a lot of certificates, and this means that you need to listen to his opinion. <br>  - He has experience.  He knows the value of this experience in the labor market.  You should be glad that you have such a cool spec.  And do not swing your rights if he doesn‚Äôt like something, competitors will take him away with his arms and legs, and your reputation may also suffer if he doesn‚Äôt like something at all. <br>  - He has a base of your competitors.  And your base, which can easily become the base of your competitors. <br>  - He doesn't need to be taught.  He will not learn anything.  He always sold radio components on the market and actually bought from him.  But his sales style with specific vocabulary may not be suitable for selling SEO services to an internet marketer or business owner.  Do not tell him about it: he always sold it like that, he rolled it there and gave him a ride, he has experience, he knows better. <br>  - He will help.  At his previous workplace, there was a coffee machine, logisticians were subordinate to accounting, sales managers had access to all initial prices and the admin site, and therefore you should have it.  And then there is Sanya from the last work, he sells at a half-word, we must take it.  You will believe his experience, do your best and will be glad that everything has worked out for you.  Until you realize that your employee has all the conditions and a salary (do not forget that he has sold himself to you qualitatively) that suit him, but there are no orders.  Of course, why miss each client if you can do nothing and get everything for it?  And Sanya from the past work as a person, of course, is cool, but firstly, he also got comfortable, and secondly, he is not your person, he is a person of your subordinate. <br><br>  All conclusions are at the end of the article, and it will be fair to describe the pros and cons of hiring a seller with no work experience at all (ideally, this is a senior student, or just graduated from the university).  So, the pros: <br><br>  + He does not know the price.  He will monitor the labor market, will see the proposed salaries, but in each job he will see the phrase: work experience is necessary.  The assessment of oneself as a specialist falls, the amount of the desired salary falls.  Saving in pure form. <br>  + He has no experience.  He will not dictate terms such as he is a million, and he understands that.  He needs to get a job and not get a warm place. <br>  + He does not know.  That is nothing at all.  He does not know how it is with others, he is not tied to the phrase ‚Äúbut in my old work ...‚Äù, he will study, he is a student, he is used to studying.  The student tries to infuse ALL the knowledge in general and prove to you that you chose him correctly, that he is a good employee. <br>  + He is afraid.  What will not pass the interview, test, does not know the product, the market, does not know how to sell, that he will be fired, that he has nothing to pay for the apartment, that the labor will have a bad record and little experience and a lot of cockroaches!  Yes, he will do everything, just to not be fired.  The number of shoals will be reduced to a minimum, KPI will be at the highest level. <br>  + He is grateful.  You are his salvation, he is your debtor forevermore: you, such a big and important businessman, took him to work, with all his complexes and fears.  He will immediately begin to repay his debt, will try to please you, which means productivity will be maximum. <br>  + He is willing to work overtime.  As a rule, he still has no family, no obligations, and he really does not want to return to the hostel or to a rented apartment, where besides him 4 more students live. <br>  + He is happy that he was taken.  One of the main secrets of a successful sale is a good mood.  A smile is heard even on the phone, which is to say about personal negotiations. <br>  + He truly loves his company and will prove it with delight to all his friends, including customers.  He will create the image of the company, make an advertisement for the brand, without knowing it. <br>  + The most unpleasant plus - for the dishonest.  Students can be used as expenditure: on a test salary, and, quite low, and the conditions of the test impossible.  But he does not know about it, right?  This is not a guide to action, but if for someone it sounded like a great idea, consider: karma will hurt you and your company. <br><br>  The list can be continued again to infinity, but there is a fly in the ointment, which means that there are disadvantages in hiring students.  And here they are: <br><br>  - He does not know his prices.  But you need to be clear about his needs.  If you give him a salary of more than he imagines, he will work halfway.  It is necessary to create an artificial deficit, so that earnings for the most part depend on it.  But the salary should also be, prove that you are a serious company and it will not remain without money.  But he must be very small, he did not hold big money in his hands and he may have enough money to live on, otherwise there is a risk to get an office vegetable that does not want to get more salary. <br>  - He has no experience.  Diploma is also silly to judge knowledge.  And no one will tell you what kind of person he is.  Most likely, you are not a psychologist either, but you can only add up your opinion about this person from your own conversation, his resume will not tell you anything useful. <br>  - He doesn't know anything.  He needs to be trained, reduced to trainings, go to the training himself, then conduct a course for him, but he needs to be trained.  It will take time, it may take money, but consider what will be more expensive, his training or high salary for the burnt huckster? <br>  - He is afraid of everything.  Sometimes, the more we are afraid to make a mistake, the greater the chance to make it when a person is worried, his thoughts jump, and his hands are shaking.  You need to monitor your behavior and be a competent leader, make warnings and fine, ask how the weekend went, but not go beyond the limits of a business relationship.  To work was done qualitatively, the manager should be afraid, but not to a state of panic.  You can not be subordinate to a friend, but you should not be a dictator, look for a middle ground.  Choose the path of the teacher, in the end you have to be. <br>  - He is grateful, yes.  But over time, experience comes, acquaintances get and prospects open up.  Your employee can learn a lot and become interested in competitors, he can also understand that he is still heated on his salary, and Yurka earns $ 100 more from a parallel stream.  It is necessary to create a maximum of conditions and comfort so that the employee does not have the idea to learn at all how others are.  And you need not to overdo it, remembering about the office vegetable. <br>  - Most likely, he was used to skipping.  And in a hostel or rented in four apartments, he can be very fun.  So much so that one of Mondays he will not come to work, because  he has a really bad headache.  Only responsibility can save.  Having once received a fine in the amount of an average salary for 0.5 days + having issued this day at his own expense, in the future he will think whether he should continue to do so. <br>  - He is happy that he was taken.  He searched, found and ... relaxed.  Now mom will not say that he is sitting on his neck.  The flag is taken, you can do nothing further. <br>  - He truly loves his company.  And he will tell his friends not only by whom he works, what kind of cool pieces he sells, but also what a funny tie he had today.  Unfortunately, no one is immune from this, and thus the image of the company will not only be spoiled by a newcomer. <br>  - It is easy to put in an expense and pay a penny.  Anti-advertising you provided.  Any portal of vacancies through 5-6 such students will promote you as a dishonorable employer. <br><br>  And there are plenty of pros and cons everywhere, but as a result I can say the following: <br>  If neither you nor anyone else in your company really knows how to sell, an experienced seller is almost indispensable.  But only one who will work for you, and not for himself and who will be able to train other employees.  And it is much better if you first learn how to sell yourself, and then teach new students.  But when choosing the rest of the team, my choice definitely falls on young future specialists.  Teaching to sell can be retrained - it is much more difficult, it is almost impossible to adjust for yourself.  If you compare with no one, then there will be no discontent.  And staff turnover.  But there will be a fresh look at things, a quick learner for all processes, just as you see them and a strong foundation for your company in the face of grateful, satisfied and satisfied employees.  Commands. <br><br>  The choice is yours, I will add only that every manager should remember the following: a properly organized enterprise structure is built on the basis of the oldest principle ‚ÄúMy vassal's vassal is not my vassal‚Äù.  Create units, assign them managers, provide them with mandatory control.  You do not need to communicate with the rest of the unit staff.  All tasks are assigned only to their managers.  In their department, they set priorities on their own.  Do not interfere with their work and they will work for you. <br><br>  Successful sales and cool staff! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291252/</a></p>
