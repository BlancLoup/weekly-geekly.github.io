History of success</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to tell the community my story about the return of money for windows 8 pre-installed on the laptop. Fortunately, this process is becoming more and more human, although it is not so unfortunately popular yet. <br><br>  The process in brief: <br>  0) I wrote to MSI to get a refund application form for windows. <br>  1) I bought an MSI gs70 laptop in a large Russian online store, which by luck turned out to be the official MSI dealer. <br>  2) I sent the application from p.0 to MSI with the registered serial number of the laptop. <br>  3) Within a day after paragraph 2, I received a statement from MSI with a part of them filled out. <br>  4) Take the laptop to a certified service center. <br>  5) A week after p. 4 took the laptop and the money. <br><br>  Total the whole process after the purchase took me about 10 days.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br><ol><li>  Ideologically.  I believe that all laptops should come with the ability to choose \ abandon the OS.  Especially paid OS. </li><li>  Mercantile  I like this particular laptop by the totality of characteristics, I do not see analogues without windows.  I myself use Linux.  And these two percent of the cost of the laptop, which is Windows, I would rather spend on another donate to the developer community using the OS I use. </li><li>  Curious.  This experience seems to me very useful. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Preparation before purchase. </h4><br>  In the beginning I expected great difficulties, I was preparing for the event for a long time, incl.  pre-written <a href="">support for MSI</a> (they also have a phone: +7 (495) 981-4509, ext. 1) in order to learn the return procedure.  I was answered: <br><br><blockquote>  The operating system can be returned within a month after purchase, if it has not been activated.  To do this, after the purchase, you write a request to this address with an indication of the serial number of the device, fill out an application and contact it at any warranty service center. <br>  The cost of the OS about 900 rubles, will be returned within a month after treatment. </blockquote><br>  <b>The laptop must be purchased from an <a href="http://amigo.msi.com/MSI_shops.aspx%3FLOB%3DNB">authorized MSI dealer</a> .</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/hprj1i4CRufW5">Application form</a> .  Use only for familiarization, as it may well change.  For real use, it is worth asking for the current one in MSI. <br><br>  The month is of course tin, but, first, the laptop did not burn here and now, and second, the principle is interesting and interesting. <br><br><h4>  Purchase. </h4><br>  Laptop bought with delivery.  When the courier checked that it turned on, but the Windows did not load and did not activate, otherwise no one would return anything to me for it. <br><br>  I discovered an interesting nuance: for some stores (it is better for everyone to be on the safe side), you must specify when ordering that you want a completed warranty card.  Otherwise, they will bring it to you unfilled and will have to either go to the store representative office, or send a ticket by mail.  They argue with the fact that many customers want the goods to reach them in unpacked form, so by default they do not unpack the goods and, therefore, the warranty card does not reach.  My laptop just came with a pristine warranty card.  Fortunately, this was no problem for me.  But I still went further and for the pro forma filled it. <br><br><h4>  Preparation after purchase. </h4><br>  Somewhere on the day after the purchase I fill out an application form.  Generally MSI give it 30 days.  I am writing a letter with a statement to MSI.  You also need to attach a scan scan to confirm that you bought the laptop from an authorized dealer.  I do not send any more documents.  A few hours later I receive a reply email with a part filled in with MSI.  From it I learn that for MS Windows 8 Pro they will return me 1,200 rubles.  And in the letter there is also a postscript that, of all the <a href="http://amigo.msi.com/MSI_service_centers.aspx">service centers,</a> only centers from the company RSS can return money for Windows. <br><br>  Going to the service.  Just in case, I call them by phone, to clarify the possibility and procedure for returning Windows.  I am informed that I need a printout of the application from MSI and the laptop itself.  No other documents, such as a warranty card or check, are needed to contact the service.  They work on the serial number of the laptop.  Also, at the request of the workers, I specifically clarified to MSI whether a passport or some of my documents are needed.  Their position is unambiguous: you need a laptop and a printed application filled out in MSI.  Everything. <br><br>  By the way, if you just call the service center, they sometimes deny that they return money for Windows on MSI laptops.  This is because the refund is made after contacting MSI with the service center, which in turn occurs after you send the above-described application to MSI.  So it is better to call having a repair number on hand that MSI will send you. <br><br><h4>  Delivery in service. </h4><br>  I chose the most convenient RSS service center, put the laptop in the bundled case and drove off.  The service line was small (3-4 people), several receptionists, but each visitor was served for a VERY long time.  So I spent about an hour there.  When my turn came, I had the following dialogue with the receiver (P): <br>  Me: Hello, I would like to hand over an MSI laptop for a refund for Windows. <br>  P: We do not do that. <br>  I: Do, info from MSI and your telephone support. <br>  P: Well, let's get a laptop and warranty card. <br>  I: You do not need a warranty card.  INFA with your telephone support. <br><br>  As a result, he went, consulted with someone, asked if I had the first time with them, wrote down my data in the system, carefully examined the laptop, sketched all the scuffs and the smallest scratches in two copies and, giving me a sign, gave me one copy and took the laptop. <br><br><h4>  Return from service. <br></h4><br><br>  With RSS, you can track the repair status online, which I used a week after it was submitted.  As a result, after 10 days, in addition to the status, indicating that I could take the laptop, a robot called me and reported it in a voice. <br><br>  In the service I was given a notebook in a new hour in the queue and 1200 rubles from the cash desk. <br><br>  Do not forget, upon receipt, to verify that you are given a piece of paper that the laptop was in warranty service, the term of this warranty service and the phrase that the warranty period of the laptop is extended for a period of warranty service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214981/</a></p>
