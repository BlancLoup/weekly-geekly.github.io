You are already familiar with Linux, and it‚Äôs time to dive deeper and get familiar with the command line features.  The command line is always with you, from the first acquaintance to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell.  Get familiar with the basics of file system navigation, environment settings, command sequences, pattern matching and more. <br><br>  After reading this book, you can easily learn how to create and delete files, directories and symbolic links;  administer the system, including network equipment, package installation and process management;  edit files;  write scripts to automate common or routine tasks;  perform any work with text files. <br><br>  Having overcome the initial fear of the Linux shell, you will realize that the command line is a natural, logical and easy way to communicate with a computer.  And do not forget to wipe the dust from the mouse. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  What is this book about </h3><br>  This book presents an extensive overview of the ‚Äúlife‚Äù in the Linux command line.  Unlike other books devoted to one program, such as the bash command interpreter, in this book I will try to tell you how to get along with the command line interface in a broader aspect.  How does he work?  What can be done with it?  How best to use it? <br><br>  <b>This book is not about administering a Linux system.</b>  Even though any serious discussion of the command line invariably leads to a discussion of the topics of system administration, this book covers only a narrow circle of tasks related to administration.  But it prepares the reader for additional research, laying the foundations of the knowledge necessary to use the command line as the main tool for solving any serious system administration tasks. <br><br>  <b>This book is exclusively about Linux.</b>  Many books try to expand their target audience, including other platforms, such as Unix and Mac OS X, in the discussion. For this reason, they only discuss general topics.  This book, by contrast, is devoted only to modern distributions of Linux.  And although ninety-five percent of the information will be useful to users of other Unix-like systems, the main target audience of this book is the command line users of modern versions of Linux. <br><br><h3>  Who is this book for? </h3><br>  This book is addressed to new Linux users migrating from other platforms.  It is very likely that you are an ‚Äúexperienced user‚Äù of a certain version of Microsoft Windows.  Perhaps the manager gave you the task of mastering the administration of the Linux server, or perhaps you are a regular user, tired of endless security problems and decided to try Linux.  Whoever you are, a warm welcome awaits you here. <br><br>  However, it should be noted that there are no easy ways to master Linux.  Learning the command line is not an easy task and requires some effort.  Not that it is too complicated, rather, very diverse.  A typical Linux system contains thousands of programs that can be used on the command line.  Therefore, keep in mind that the desire to learn the command line must be conscious and focused. <br><br>  On the other hand, learning the Linux command line is extremely useful.  If you consider yourself an experienced user, wait a bit and you will know what a truly experienced user is.  In addition, unlike other computer skills, the ability to work on the command line will remain useful for a long time.  The skills acquired today will remain useful in 10 years.  The command line has stood the test of time.  If you have no programming experience - do not worry, we will help in its acquisition. <br><br><h3>  What is given in this book </h3><br>  In this book, the material is presented in a carefully verified sequence, as in a school where the teacher guides you and guides you along the right path.  Many authors sin by submitting material in a ‚Äúsystematic‚Äù order, which has a definite meaning for a writer, but can cause confusion among novice users. <br><br>  The purpose of this book is to introduce you to the ideology of Unix, which is different from the ideology of Windows.  Along the way, we will sometimes deviate to one side in order to try to understand why this or that works this way and not otherwise.  Linux is not just software, it is also part of the vast Unix culture that has its own language and history.  Here I could add a couple more pompous phrases.  But I will refrain from this. <br><br>  The book is divided into four parts, each of which covers a certain aspect of command-line ownership: <br><br>  <b>Part I</b> ‚ÄúThe command shell‚Äù introduces the basics of the command line language into the course: command structure, file system navigation, command line editing, and search for reference information with commands. <br><br>  <b>Part II</b> ‚ÄúEnvironment and Configuration‚Äù is devoted to editing configuration files that control the command line. <br><br>  <b>Part III</b> ‚ÄúTypical Tasks and Basic Tools‚Äù explores many of the typical tasks often performed on the command line.  Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, have many "classic" command-line programs that help you perform various data operations. <br><br>  <b>Part IV</b> ‚ÄúCommand Shell Scenarios‚Äù introduces programming in the command shell language, which, in general, is not very powerful, but is easy to learn and automates many computational tasks.  Studying programming in the command shell language, you will get acquainted with ideas that you can apply in other programming languages. <br><br>  ¬ªMore information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/linux/product/komandnaya-stroka-linux-polnoe-rukovodstvo">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602303/978549602303_X.pdf">Table of Contents</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602303/978549602303_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Schots</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310452/</a></p>
