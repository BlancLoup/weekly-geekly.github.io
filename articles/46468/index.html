  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Write about what will be interesting"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some clustering by interests is characteristic of any human community, when there are more than three people in it.  There is no exception and the online community, where almost every user has their favorite thematic areas in which information and communication belong to a particular thematic area.  The site <a href="http://roem.ru/">Roem.ru</a> serves as a similar platform for communication of experts in the field of Internet technologies and has already become a recognized authoritative news expert resource of the Russian Internet.  Its founder and editor-in-chief, Yuri Synodov, shared the secrets of promoting thematic sites at his lecture at the <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/about.html">State University of Management.</a> <br><br>  For the development of its thematic Internet project, it is important to understand the peculiarities of competition in the Internet.  Mr. Sinodov separately touched on this issue. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is often stated that there is no competition on the Internet,‚Äù he noted.  - ‚ÄúIn fact, this impression is due to the fact that the audience of sites often does not overlap.  For example, I worked on the Medportal project.  This project consisted of subprojects: Medmedia and Mednovosti.  And both of these subprojects were devoted to one thing - medicine, they had the same sponsor, but the intersection of the audience was only 10 percent.  However, competition, of course, still exists, because it is very difficult to get users to stay on your site.  It should be understood that the one who appears first gets an advantage.  If you come to an empty field, you will get an entire audience and a competitor will be forced to move on ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù, competing with you for a fraction of the growth of the Internet audience.  You will already have some kind of your own audience.  However, in this case, do not relax and do not forget about the audit.  After all, you may feel that you are very cool and no one is afraid of you.  But competitors can accelerate the growth rate of the audience and quickly get closer to you. "

      Thematic, especially news, Internet resource requires constantly updated content that is interesting to the user.  Therefore, Mr. Synodov also spoke about the search for topics for news and articles on the site. <br>  ‚ÄúWhere to search for topics?  What should be the principle of selection?  Roem.ru began with small paper squares, on which the most influential and interesting companies were written, which were supposed to be constantly monitored for news.  And it helped.  You need to monitor what is happening in the industry about which you are writing, about companies playing a prominent role in this industry.  Regularity is important here: you need to browse all available sources of information in search of news on the topic.  This may be useful information from blogs.  If you start using them, very soon you will have your favorite blogs that you use most often.  One of the main mistakes made by the creators of online media is that they publish all the news they find.  Filtering is important here.  Here, like mushroom pickers: not sure - do not eat.  Publish only what will be feedback - the response from the audience. <br><br>  For online media, an important issue is how to post news: you can post either the full article or just headlines.  For myself, I decided to post the full news.  But good headlines are also very important.  The site, in fact, is a set of links.  Attendance spreads over the site is not linear and depends on the clickability of the headers.  Here you can give advice: if you do not know how to write good headings, the easiest way is to create verb headings.  They have an ‚Äúobject made something‚Äù structure.  They may not be the best possible headers, but by itself this is the most reliable way to create headers.  And over time, you yourself will begin to understand which title is good and which is bad.  In general, it is not difficult to formally learn journalism: in any news article you only need to first describe the news story, reveal what happened, and tell what happened before in this area. <br><br>  How to get exclusives?  This is not only what nobody knows.  It is also those things in the information area that may eventually cause other events.  In order to find exclusives, you need to communicate, go to a variety of activities.  Purposefully go out into the information field and do not mow exclusives - they appear gradually. <br><br>  Sooner or later, when you write news, a negative appears.  That is some negative information about specific organizations or events.  When working with a negative one should not forget a few important points: <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is necessary to discard unverified information, cover yourself, because you become a source of information, so you need to work with negative; <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can‚Äôt throw away the negative either - they‚Äôll just stop walking to you.  In journalism, blocking negativity is a big sin. ‚Äù <br>  To assess the effectiveness and dynamics of the site development, you must not forget about auditing the audience of the resource. <br>  ‚ÄúAn audit of the attendance of your resource should be conducted constantly, so that you understand what is happening with your audience,‚Äù Mr. Synodov pointed out.  ‚ÄúThus, for example, you can evaluate the person who is writing articles for you, how popular he is with visitors.  However, the attendance numbers should be looked at as relative.  Only the lack of growth or fall in the number of visitors should be alarming.  If there is no growth, two explanations are possible: either your audience is selected and you have nowhere to grow, or your site is not interesting, and you need to change the editor.  Another important indicator is the ratio of attendance and the permanent core of visitors.  Sometimes attendance grows, but the core does not.  This means that visitors who are not interested in the theme of the site come.  The audience does not read the site. ‚Äù <br><br>  - <b>What to write on the site to make it interesting for users?</b> <br>  - The readability of the material depends on two factors - how quickly you prepared it and how well it did it.  Quality is a very subjective indicator.  It can be improved after the news is published by updates.  At the same time, when the news appears in public space - the longer you prepare the material, the less you read. <br><br>  <b>- How did you promote your project?</b> <br>  - I did not promote it.  You can see the statistics of visits to my site - it is freely available.  There you can see that the initial growth of the audience is quite high.  Just the site did not start from scratch.  I had a blog where I wrote about all the rumors that came to me.  There were about 500 visitors.  And these visitors switched to Roem.ru when I opened up.  Actually, I thought the dynamics would be worse. <br><br>  <b>- How does the size of the core site on the preferences of advertisers?</b> <br>  - Here we can distinguish two factors.  Firstly, if the core is large, then it ‚Äúburns out‚Äù too quickly.  The user will see the ad once or twice - and she gets tired of it.  On the other hand, if the core is small, it‚Äôs not clear what the site‚Äôs audience is interested in and what it‚Äôs advertising on it. <br><br>  <b>- Why is there no contextual advertising on Roem.ru?</b> <br>  - She was there, but I decided that she was not profitable.  For two weeks I received 100 rubles for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46468/</a></p>
