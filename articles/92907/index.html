  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WPF application interface design, and a bit of usability</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Design in WPF is based on the principle of nesting dolls.  The main window is a large container, inside which are controls (controls) or other containers.  There are no coordinates, and bindings are used to keep the contents from hanging.  Suppose we need the main menu - we create a container for it, we bind to the upper side of the working window.  Inside the container of the main menu already put the buttons with the binding to the left.  The location of objects inside the container is sliding, so if the left button increases in size, then the rest will simply move away without any problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can do this layout in Visual Studio, but why do you need Expression Blend, you ask?  And because there are styles!  In a good way, in order for a designer to learn how to work in the Blend program, he needs to sit next to a programmer, who would explain what controls are, which one is TextBox, and which is Button.  Initially it seemed to me that such things should be known to all those involved in web design.  Probably the maker-ups should be aware.  But designers all live together under the motto "It is enough to know Photoshop, and then at least the grass does not grow."  For me, design is first of all proportions and gammas, well, and then already squiggles.  A photoshop is one of the tools that are many.  And if I need an application, then I want the designers to set up buttons for me right where they will work. <br><br>  The WPF designer was hard to find, except for the architecture designer ‚Äî I could not find one at all.  So, I am big, lucky and I found a selfless person who is ready to comprehend Blend and WPF.  After three explanations on the fingers, the designer was already mentally ready to create without any tampering.  I myself am from a breed of non-drawing designers, like Tatyanych, but still made an effort and opened the point.  It turned out like this: <br><img src="http://i060.radikal.ru/1005/ad/66346a807825.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My designer was absolutely not sorry for his strength and it was scary to take on Blend, so he started all the same in Photoshop.  After 4-5 iterations of spinning and redoing, it turned out like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f71/3f1/628/f713f16289dbb230b83c62aceee2ccd7.jpg" alt="image">

      Yes, I agree, the yellow buttons on the side panels delay attention too, but these are trifles. <br><br>  By the way, about the birds.  Recently I saw a discussion on the question of what education a user interface specialist should have.  It is said that both humanitarian and technical, which reasoned more.  As a career counselor, it was funny to me.  They say, after all, that the education of the mind does not add.  Similarly, education and does not affect a person's ability to different types of activities.  And yet, artistic harmony and the logic of functionality in one person can not be combined.  Therefore, the design of the user interface can not be the product of labor of one person, at least two here it is necessary. <br><br>  PS: I appeal to the designers, who nevertheless decided to master WPF or Silverlight - email me, I‚Äôll introduce you to each other, share experiences, shablonarium@tigrest.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92907/</a></p>
