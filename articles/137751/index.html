      Once we realized that the main key to success in any business is the ability to hear our customers, we decided to develop a truly useful and high-quality service that would help companies get feedback from their customers. <br><br>  Our solution was a slider that can be adapted for any issue and aspect of the company, set its dimensions, color scheme and embed it in any part of the site. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c27/86c/79e/c2786c79e93c37e508e032d7dec6a541.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Here are the main advantages of our tool:</i> <br><ul><li>  The ability to receive all reviews in private, in a private office, and not to keep them in sight of competitors, as is done in existing services. </li><li>  Getting feedback on each aspect of the company separately, and not all reviews in a bunch.  For example, you can create a slider with the question ‚ÄúHow do you like our company?‚Äù, ‚ÄúRate our tech.  support ‚Äù,‚Äú Rate our blog ‚Äù, etc.  It is more convenient to analyze the reviews and the picture is much clearer. </li><li>  The ability to understand how people relate to the company, because  Each review is assigned a customer rating from 0 to 100%.  The slider also remembers the opinion of the person, giving him the opportunity to periodically change it.  You can analyze what affects the deterioration or improvement of the views of your customers. </li><li>  Another plus is that the client can speak easily and comfortably.  No need to open multiple links, submenus and pass authorization.  For many, this is just laziness, so they will never leave their feedback to you. </li><li>  In your personal account, reviews are not just stored, but formed into analytical information and graphs that tell you how to become better and in what priority to fulfill the wishes of customers. </li></ul><br>  This is in brief.  You can learn more from our introductory presentation, which is available immediately after registering on <a href="http://uppza.com/">our website</a> .  And in this welcome topic, we would like to tell you what innovations we managed to implement from the moment of release and how our own sliders helped us with this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1d/8c8/66e/d1d8c866e6e2912ec21fa27df0469bbe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To begin with, we have slightly expanded our feedback management capabilities.  About the reviews, which are less than a week, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù label now appears.  It helps to see the latest reviews in the analysis process and filter them by rating level.  We also added the ability to delete reviews, along with their statistics.  Since inappropriate comments always and everywhere have a place to be, and we do not want them to spoil the big picture for you. <br><br>  In addition, for your convenience, we have made memorization of the last state of the filter.  For example, if you set a filter to view comments from 80 to 100%, then the next time you do not have to re-configure it.  Honestly, it was not even an innovation, but our omission, which we quickly corrected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2b/07a/b11/c2b07ab11c8acfba6aca52217491816e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd0/35f/f4e/fd035ff4e7616ca35ed21d8424066442.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the main page, it has also changed a bit.  We added examples of using sliders to visually show what the essence of our service is and how our tool is applied in practice. <br><br>  For the near future, we have planned a number of useful improvements and functional enhancements that will help you use the service even more efficiently.  We thank habrazhiteli for the first reviews and comments, they helped us a lot! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137751/</a></p>
