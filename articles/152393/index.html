In principle, everything is true, but somehow it looks highly idealistic.  But the real picture is probably closer to this: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Vasily, junior </h4><br>  Vasily is no longer a child, but also not a man.  Here it is necessary to make an important digression, Vasily is a slave.  At this very moment, a quarry is mined in a quarry.  Incredible heat, dust.  From all sides can be heard moans, cough.  The scourge of the overseer does not seem to stop for a minute.  Basil is assigned to a group of slaves, his task is to bring water.  When the supervisor sees that the cry and the scourge are already powerless, the slaves are allowed to go to the bucket brought by Vasily, take a few sips.  Today was a significant day, Vasily, in the intervals between jogging to the pond, helped to carry the stones up.  Taskmaster was pleased.  Now, every day, Basil will be less likely to carry water and more and more often take up heavy stones.  He will cope! <br><br><h4>  Peter, tmlid </h4><br>  Peter is the oldest slave.  He rules all the slaves of his master.  His task also includes distribution by works.  To get to a lighter site, many in front of him fawns over, as far as their position allows, give Peter part of their food.  Peter does not have a moment's rest.  The master's slave during the construction of the city wall fell from the scaffolding.  It is urgent to seek a doctor.  Alarming news comes from the quarry - one of the slaves dying.  We have to think about whom to replace, then keep the answer before the lord.  Whatever the outcome, Peter knows there will be no mercy from the master, no matter how hard he tries.  At best, he will be deprived of water, at worst he will get lashes and will not be able to walk all day.  But it will be later, but now we must run while the owner is resting after the hunt in the female part of his house. <br><br><h4>  Maria, tester </h4><br>  At first glance, Maria is an ordinary concubine.  But no.  Mary is one of several wives of the lord.  For all the years spent in captivity, she has managed to preserve her beauty, given to her by nature.  But besides beauty, Maria is still very smart.  Not a single glance of the gentleman, the half-whisper of eunuchs, escapes from her sensitive ear.  A few words said to the lord at the right moment, the golden ring presented to the elder eunuch and now the foundation of her future victory has been laid.  Mary's goal is to remove the current favorite and become the main one in the harem.

    <h4>  Vyacheslav, system administrator </h4><br>  Vyacheslav can say lucky.  Since childhood, he had a penchant for the visual arts.  And he had the talent of a sculptor.  And now Vyacheslav in the service of the lord.  Paints the walls, ceiling.  Sometimes decorates the halls with stucco.  At first glance, light work.  But only at first.  Do not forget, Vyacheslav - a slave, powerless.  Once, standing on the stairs almost under the ceiling, he was pushed by his master's children.  Miraculously nothing happened to him and he did not lose his ability to work.  While working with clay, for the sake of fun, a guard can drag it with a whip.  Well, so as not to lose vigilance.  Picky gentlemen from the first time very rarely take the job.  Even if they liked everything.  For courage, punish and force rework.  This is a common thing. <br><br>  And finally: <br><br><h4>  Gennady, those.  support </h4><br>  Gennady - the main specialist in contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.  He always stands guard over interests, even if in his heart he is disgusted.  When humanity is confronted with something inexplicable, the first one they call is he.  To establish contact, to prevent war, to stop the invasion.  Gennady can communicate not only with humanoid races.  His record includes talks with protoplasm, living in the photosphere of the red giant with civilization, with silicon pillars.  For successful contact, Gennady needs to know and be able to summarize almost all the accumulated knowledge of mankind.  This is a difficult and thorny path associated with stresses, conflicts and other pleasures of a modern, inhabited galaxy.  But the successful resolution of problems, the satisfaction of the needs of both humanity and extraterrestrial life forms make Gennady go forward with his head held high. <br><br><h4>  Gennady, those.  support </h4><br>  Gennady - shaman, visionary, doctor.  Sometimes he can be stoned and kicked out of the inn as a dirty, unclean sorcerer.  But one way or another, all the lower strata of society turn to him.  To speak a bad tooth, reduce pain, cause rain.  If, by a happy coincidence, Gennady succeeded, everyone takes it for granted.  If not, he cannot avoid the punishment of an angry people.  By social status, such as Gennady are considered rejected.  They do not communicate with him, preferring not to notice even slaves.  The only possible society of Gennady is the same as he. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152393/</a></p>
