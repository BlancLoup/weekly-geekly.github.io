You are not a lazy jerk if you ask yourself such a question.  You are a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù owner of one or several maladaptive mechanisms implemented by your brain, and as a result some behavioral exits are blocked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will try to answer this question fully enough to those who asked him after the last article.  And this article, I close the topic Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ Ã∂ instead of medical self-diagnosis.  If in the <a href="https://habr.com/post/409887/">first</a> article I objectively (as far as possible) presented my portrait, then in the <a href="https://habr.com/post/412199/">second</a> I wanted to make out specific behavioral examples, so that this would allow us to compare the symptoms as a visual aid.  In my opinion, the second article turned out to be bad, and I did not cope with the task.

      But the current one, I hope, will remove questions to itself from those who feed bad suspicions.  In this article, I will not focus on characteristic facings, procrastination, and incomplete cases. <br><br>  In the next article, I‚Äôll write some general terms and some life hacks, which may allow you to slightly muffle the symptoms, and also, if your ADHD pathology is moderate or weak, take control of your life. <br><br>  I will also allow myself some remarks concerning such a mass phenomenon as disadaptation, which manifest themselves in the widest range.  If loss of will, ability to concentrate, desocialization, etc.  recognized immediately, many forms of loss of adaptation are accepted as a given, part of a character or simply not identified by ‚Äúhappy‚Äù owners. <br><br>  So: <br>  ‚ÄúLazy m *** k‚Äù, which burns deadlines, procrastinates, avoids labor, fails to fulfill promises and makes srach everywhere, but at the same time he feels good and happy, not wanting to change anything, doesn‚Äôt interest us.  He may well be ADHD, but if he doesn‚Äôt care, then we‚Äôre all the more so.  We will just stay away from that. <br><br>  Another case: you are not obligatory, violate deadlines, immerse yourself in procrastination and breed piggy in habitats, but you really don't want to do that.  However, everything goes by itself, and this is a repeating pattern. <br><br>  The reasons for this behavior can be many.  Not only ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). <br><br><h2>  I. Disadaptation </h2><br>  The most well-known factors are: anxiety disorder GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder), which continuously loads the fear of failure and, forcing down the focus, prevents to fulfill obligations, to stop procrastinating, to get down to business.  Lack of will, chronic fatigue and a sense of meaninglessness of one‚Äôs own actions may indicate a state of learned helplessness with the depressive protocol of the brain‚Äôs work - MDD (Major depressive disorder).  But disadaptation (hundreds of them, thousands of forms) have a complex or combined set of reasons. <br><br>  In Russian culture, appeal to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist is stigmatized.  And in all sectors of society.  The lumpens profess a cult of brutality, considering the appeal to a specialist of this kind of profile as a weakness: ‚ÄúHere is a shovel, here is manure, here is a field, and there is a sun overhead.  And until it has sat down ... ‚Äù <br><br>  But intellectuals, (especially in the IT environment), prefer to cope with such problems themselves.  When experience suggests that high intelligence and high cognitive abilities previously allowed to solve a wide range of tasks from mastering a new programming language to developing heating systems for a country house, false self-confidence arises.  Naive comparisons of computer systems with the brain, which IT specialists regularly allow themselves, are especially appealing. <br><br>  But before trying to reflash your brain, think about this: some of the maladjustments are caused by congenital abnormalities, some by the breakdown of the reward system, some by the loss of a specific cognitive skill, followed by the reduction of critical neural connections. <br><br>  But most often all the factors at once: <br><br>  A set of genes provided vulnerability in the psyche ‚Üí environmental impact provided discomfort ‚Üí the psyche did not cope and instead of an external response gave an internal ‚Üí balance in the reward system moved ‚Üí the limbic system under the action of non-optimal reinforcement with the whip and gingerbread began to develop and consolidate counterproductive cognitive and behavioral responses.  <b>Hi, disadaptation!</b>  Give the brain some time, it will also rebuild the neural-linkage architecture for optimal generation of non-optimal responses. <br><br>  I hope the habro community will forgive my causticity.  But when you have a hammer in your hands, everything seems to be nails.  Probably from here these naive comparisons of the brain with the computer.  But here's why it makes me laugh: <br><br>  <b>(see ‚ÄúReminder‚Äù I paragraph)</b> <br><br>  First, because all the power of logical thinking is powerless in the confrontation with the reptile that slid off the coils, which, with its cold clawed legs, stretched out of the most ancient and deep parts of the brain, pulls levers in all the main control centers of the limbic system.  And the problem is not that she got out suddenly and broke everything.  You have always been a passenger in a taxi, behind the wheel of which sat a lizard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/z0/u6/eqz0u6hkunxlishd0e46mgmuhrq.jpeg">  " <br><br>  Go to the zoo and talk with the Komodo lizard about the benefits of the case in the language of logic, if with the help of logic they are going to persuade the internal lizard to stop sabotage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/ks/hc/wvkshcdv5u-nsluzdv3mqlb4p_8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, when evaluating the range of possibilities of your intellect, remember two outstanding people.  One was the greatest physicist of the twentieth century, who changed our understanding of space and time, matter and energy.  But until the end of his life, he was not resigned to Heisenberg‚Äôs principle of uncertainty, essentially denying the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and protesting against the probabilistic nature of the microworld.  The second was perhaps the most prominent inventor and engineer of the twentieth century.  He single-handedly created almost all the electric machines and AC-powered devices that underlie modern electric power industry.  And yes, radio was also invented by him, and not by Popov and not by Marconi.  But I remind you that he spent all of his condition, as well as all his time and efforts of the second half of his life, on fruitless attempts to force resonant transformers to transmit electrical energy over considerable distances without wires.  Now, no decent party can do without man-made lightning, but electric energy still shoots through wires. <br><br>  I gave these examples not only so that you kill optimism about your abilities in logic.  These examples most clearly demonstrate the overwhelming power of emotions.  <b>You are rational only where trained and only as long as it does not affect the limbic system.</b>  But if, for some reason, it invades the neocortex‚Äôs area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, it quickly subjugates it, forcing any game to be made, so that it confirms and justifies the ‚Äúlizard‚Äù of the beautiful. <br><br>  On a smaller scale, you come across a similar everywhere.  Surely you have met with generally competent engineers, stubborn in the mystification of the flight to the moon by the Americans.  Normal at first glance, biologists, suddenly sharing the myth of the dangers of GMOs.  (I‚Äôm not talking about Ermakova, of course, even at first glance, she doesn‚Äôt seem normal.) Doctors, who seem to be good specialists in their field, but who are against vaccination.  Etc. <br><br>  Therefore: <br><br>  1. If your maladjustment has not yet ruined your financial situation, go to a specialist without delay. <br><br>  Do not self-medicate!  Otherwise, you will quickly come to point 2. <br><br>  <b>In one of the following articles, I wanted to carefully consider the methods of rejecting psychotherapists.</b>  <b>But (see ‚ÄúReminder‚Äù paragraph I) I am afraid that this will be a walk on very thin ice.</b>  <b>Therefore, I am indecisive.</b> <br><br>  Psychiatry is not a science.  Science she will become in the near future.  Basically, the field of psychology, as well as "small" and "large" psychiatry is richly honest, but sincerely erring alchemists in a wide range of skill and practical skills. <br>  This means that within any of the psychotherapeutic trends and schools you can look for a specialist who can help.  But in general, of course, pure esoterics. <br><br>  Because the revolution in neuroscience, in particular in psychology and psychiatry, is happening right now and not in Russia.  A flurry of articles on neuroscience published in English is almost unnoticed by the Russian medical community.  Only a few professionals are involved in this process and burden themselves with work on a regular and systematic basis to monitor and read this wide stream of publications.  Looking ahead, I will say that more or less acceptable results in the field of evidence-based medicine show only the direction of CPT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy).  Within the framework of other trends, you will most likely find a worthy specialist who can help with a mild emotional breakdown, but he is unlikely to be able to get rid of the established maladjustment and significant psychological disorders.  You can mentally talk with anyone, even with Freud, even with Jung, but with the correction of behavioral reactions to Burres Frederick Skinner.  Yes, the conversation with him is not so pleasant, but a banana, a red light bulb and an electric shock are the right tools for bringing reptilians to their senses. <br><br>  For the same reason, I am skeptical about hypnotherapy.  Well, yes, there are people prone to hypnotic suggestions.  You will not believe, there are even individuals subject to television suggestions.  And this is a feature of their consciousness. <br><br>  The subconscious mind, to which hypnotherapists turn with suggestions, looks at them with a cold, unblinking gaze. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/u8/cw/apu8cwzvwg6hfl5une9yfzma7ns.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>!!!</b>  <b>The criterion for the credibility of the statement is the personal opinion of the enthusiast immersed in the problem = amateur, who is not an expert.</b>  <b>(see ‚ÄúReminder‚Äù I paragraph)</b> <br><br>  Remember!  Desocialization, loss of contact with like-minded people, self-isolation, alcoholic loneliness, a feeling of persistent fatigue, loss of ability to concentrate, loss of interests, reduced curiosity, a painful feeling of loss of feelings eventually become a habit, a way of life, are perceived as normal.  But the most common maladjustment - the inability to make a decision - to change the usual way of life when such a decision is long overdue.  (Change jobs, business, country ... in a situation where your daily activities have long been funeral for your ambitions and, in general, weeped off). <br><br>  For example: self-isolation is not normal, even if you are Aspi!  Yes, hanging out from Friday to Monday is not your norm.  But complete self-isolation requires treatment.  As well as the inability to get out of the ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù, although there is no longer any comfort in it. <br><br>  2. If your disadaptation has already affected the financial side, or there are no (almost) qualified specialists in your country (for example: ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; BPD - Borderline personality disorder ...), then your path - by mobilizing the rest sthenichnost, by the power of his intellect to grab oneself by the hair and drag it up, as the baron known to all of us did.  Where science will be the only external point of support.  Not all will cope.  I now can not cope. <br><br>  3. If disadaptation has destroyed the financial basis of your life and has seriously impressed your intellect and / or sthenichnost (will), and there is no close person who can help and fight for you, then this is the saddest option.  Try extraordinary measures.  For example, buy a bus ticket to Tallinn, and, getting off there, go to London on foot, alone.  (put psyche before surviving challenge) <br><br><h2>  II Do you suspect you have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD)? </h2><br>  NB! <br><br>  Below I will give a set of signs, in my own opinion, that are characteristic of ADHD.  With the <a href="http://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/suppl/2016/10/19/WNL.0000000000003265.DC1/Appendices_e-1_through_e-8.pdf">DSM-IV / V</a> criteria my list will have nothing to do. <br><br>  I intentionally do not duplicate the list of criteria from the DSM-V!  (Otherwise what is the meaning of this scribbling?) <br><br>  The following list should be taken as identikit of the suspect.  This is a general portrait as a whole.  Details may not be the same or be mild. <br><br>  I do not specify the required points and the number of points you must score.  Simply, if you generally recognize yourself in the descriptions - this is a reason to search for a specialist.  (If, of course, the negative aspects of ADHD poison your life and you are not satisfied with your own efficiency. If you don‚Äôt suffer, cope with procrastination, drown in chaos, then it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have ADHD or not. You can only envy). <br><br>  I fully agree with the opinion of the user <a href="https://habr.com/users/orcus13/" class="user_link">Orcus13</a> , expressed to the previous article, that we cannot say for sure: it is a question of a single pathology with a wide range of symptoms, or we are dealing with a variable set of pathologies / dysfunctions.  Or maybe this is the extreme value on the normal distribution curve.  In fact, only a strong pathology is accompanied by serious maladaptation processes. <br><br>  Remember, only a qualified psychiatrist makes a diagnosis!  (currently qualified in ‚Äúthis country‚Äù). <br><br>  ADHD is put only after the exclusion of all other reasons, when it alone best describes the clinical picture. <br><br>  Important: ADHD can not get sick in adulthood. <br><br>  ADHD is with us since birth, although the first signs up to 3-5 years old are problematic.  All of the following should occur throughout life from childhood. <br><br>  <b>Barcode number 1.</b>  Since childhood you have never felt awkward.  On the contrary, they <b>showed dexterity and reaction</b> not lower than their peers.  And in adulthood, when you master new skills that require coordination and dexterity (skate, surf, rollers, monowheel, etc.), you demonstrate good performance.  However, since childhood in everyday life, you regularly <b>spilled paint, scattered rice, overturned a sideboard</b> .  And still often wake up sugar, salt, and at a party you can roll a floor lamp. <br><br>  <b>Barcode number 2.</b>  <b>Sugar.</b>  If you have never consciously worked out your diet, then most likely you do not measure it with teaspoons, but pour it into the cup ‚Äúby eye‚Äù with a small excess of the amount necessary for maximum saturation of the sweet receptors on the tongue.  With further addition of sugar, tea <b>does not become sweeter, it becomes thicker</b> . <br><br>  <b>Barcode number 3.</b>  The state of trance (including hypnotic trance) is difficult for you to reach, or not at all.  This paragraph is formulated arguably, and below I will reformulate it differently, but I added it.  Let me explain why: <br><br>  In the comments to the previous article, several users expressed their opinion on the effectiveness of the treatment of ADHD by Erickson hypnosis.  Before that, I had never investigated the question of what hypnosis is, especially Erickson.  Quick googling immediately gives a lot of articles to ‚Äúreal‚Äù hypnotists (ok, okay, hypnotherapists) that Erickson hypnosis is a method of immersing a person in a light trance by means of modulated chatter.  In short, something akin to "gypsy hypnosis."  Classical hypnotherapists have noted the problem of confirming and sustaining the trance induced by such a technique. <br><br>  And I would like to ask a question <a href="https://habr.com/users/fenix8/" class="user_link">fenix8</a> .  You claim that in your practice you actively apply Ericksonian hypnosis, including with ADHD children.  Question: How do you determine that the child is in a trance? <br><br>  This picture seems to me as follows: When you are in an unfamiliar environment (at a psychologist‚Äôs reception), the characteristic motor and motor activity of the hyperactive can be turned off almost completely.  Then the consciousness ceases to scan a new place in search of what would be interesting to grab, twist, turn, disassemble and break and completely flies into the inner world of swarming thoughts and fantasies.  How do you understand that the patient is in a trance, and hears your exquisite Ericksonian metaphors, and does not rush about between supernova explosions at a distance of several parsecs from you?  I admit that I may be wrong.  And since this happens to me often, I apologize to you in advance, and appeal to <b>paragraph 1 of ‚ÄúReminder‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Now to hypnosis.  To be honest, we all are subject to cognitive distortion ‚Äúgeneralization of our own experience.‚Äù  And I just did not think about what trance is.  The most common description of hypnotic trance tells us that this is a deeper and more persistent phenomenon of our everyday states of auto-consciousness shutdown.  For example, you sit in the corridor of the polyclinic and wait until the X-ray results are displayed.  Or in the evening, tired, you go home by car and arrive at the machine, completely unaware of how you arrived, until you woke up in the courtyard.  <b>And here I received a lightning strike.</b>  I have never experienced such states!  Never, in my whole life, not a single minute!  Have you ever come home on the machine?  Yes.  Have I ever discovered that I was moving to the far right, although I had moved to the far left before, not remembering how I crossed a continuous stream of cars?  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It happened, and often, that in a slowly crawling traffic jam, I found my car in the rear bumper in front of a moving vehicle. But I can say for sure where my ‚Äúconscious‚Äù was in this time interval. It didn‚Äôt turn off at all, it was competing with Mask in rocket production at that moment, or imagined that the next script was finished and the film turned out to be just an ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù (although the script will not be finished in a year, and there will be no film, but the bumper will have to be changed ). Neither waiting for a diagnosis, nor trance music, nor the shaman‚Äôs tambourine, along with the powerful ‚ÄúOOOOOM‚Äù crowd of yogis around, are able to clear my brain of chaotic activity, fantasizing right away on a dozen of those juggling dozens of irrelevant thoughts and giving the order to his hands to grab that innocently left whistle which, having made forty turns in deft hands, ‚Äúfor some reason‚Äù,‚ÄúSomehow‚Äù now consists of four separate parts and no longer whistles.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, my case of ADHD is resistant strong. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ADHD is characterized by a continuous stream of thoughts and fantasies that cannot be turned off! </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is probably the only common symptom for almost the entire set of types of this hyperkinetic disorder</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : from a kid who, with a wild aurora, chases the 8th hour around the yard of his tired, barely living Doberman, to a quiet, dreamy girl sitting near the window with a look beyond the horizon. </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just sit at the table, light a cigarette, look out the window and not think about anything is very difficult or impossible.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At best, a swarm of thoughts can be driven away, replacing one, but never-ending: ‚ÄúHow not to think about anything‚Äù! </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Barcode number 4.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Above, I have already noted that </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">increased and poorly controlled activity of the forelimbs</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The fact that my family was called </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äúnaughty hands‚Äù</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Frequent symptom, but not at all mandatory. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stroke number 5. </font></font></b> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At any moment in time</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for execution you have </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">several equally cool projects or ideas.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, and this is in addition to the work, the deadline for which was already charred. You seem to be able to rank the tasks with intellect, but emotionally those three are equally important. Super important, maybe even grandiose. Requiring immediate and one-time execution. Neocortex prioritizes, highlighting the working task as the main for the momentary performance, and sends a signal to start to act somewhere in the limbic system. There, this vigorous signal on emotional strength seems to be compared with the strength of the three tasks on which all further development of civilization depends, at least in the Orion arm. The thalamus, receiving a request to activate the maximum of the reward system and reinforcement of all four tasks, sends all four to f **. And the reticular formation dictates a way out: while the brain areas are arguing among themselves, turn on porn or download Battlefield.</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Just in case: I do not know where and how the failure occurs, and about the Talamus and f ** </font></font></i> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">d </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I made it all up.) </font></i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Barcode # 6,7</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . There are studies about tests with a black and white card or two sticks of different lengths. The authority and part of the decoy confidently assert, they say, the white card is darker than the black one, and the long stick is shorter than the short one, and this makes all the subjects agree too and accept the point of view of the majority / authority. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am taken aback by these results.</font></font> How so?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not understand it at all. In fact, lack of respect for authority, coupled with impulsiveness and lack of restraint, often played a disservice to me. Not understanding the question or missing important details, I started to argue and tried to deny authority when right was on their side. And sat in a puddle. But it also happened differently: when I was in the eighth grade, the director brought us a video pair (someone remembers what is this?) With an important look for a biology class. And together with a biology teacher, he showed us a film about the horrors of telegony. After the film, it was assumed that we as a whole class would have to discuss what we saw and express our impressions. Actually, the director took the floor first to summarize the main thing. But I could not wait to speak about the second minute of the twenty-minute film, which I could barely see through.Forces remained silent for another forty-five seconds, but the principal seemed to have just begun his speech, so, jumping up, I finished in an elevated tone for him, for the biology teacher and for the whole class. I did it just before the call. The fact is that before the eighth grade I studied in another school, and there the teacher of biology was of the level of God. My last remark was a recommendation to the director to return to the main specialty - physical education, if he finished all administrative matters, and he has nothing to do.My last remark was the director's recommendation to return to the main specialty - physical education, if he finished all administrative matters, and he has nothing to do.My last remark was the director's recommendation to return to the main specialty - physical education, if he finished all administrative matters, and he has nothing to do.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bar number 6 - the neglect of authorities, including the authority of the crowd</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bar number 7 - affective ignoring the consequences of their actions</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, at that time there were no consequences. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Barcode number 8.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Almost all studies of ADHD patients mention the instability of social connections between carriers of pathology. Some researchers (I am sure of this firmly) mistakenly explain the volatility of the social circle and the inability to maintain long-lasting friendships by disrupting the mechanism of empathy, due to the inattention of ADHD students and their inability to understand the emotions of the environment. This is complete rubbish. On the contrary, according to subjective observations, we have increased empathy. Simply, if our sphere of interests changes, we have nothing to talk about with the old environment.</font></font> <b>But!</b> <b>                    .         .</b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, the sample is small, but more than twenty surveyed by me confidently confirmed the phenomenon: Autonomy and immunity to collective emotions. I only once in childhood was in a football stadium. Football does not interest me at all. But a wave of unified collective euphoria of the covering tribune during the heads crashed into the memory. I have not experienced anything. Later I had a service in the army, participation in meetings, open airs with a large crowd of people. I always felt my autonomy, at a time when around the crowd was a single organism enveloped by a single collective emotion. Five of the people interviewed by me for ADHGshnikov confirmed that they are football fans and regularly attend the stadium. At the same time, everyone noted that although they, like all other fans, jump up and react to the goal of a supported team,but they clearly feel their autonomy and inability to merge with the masses in collective joy. The same was confirmed by seven of those surveyed who regularly attend musical concerts - the inability to share collective emotions. And all of the twenty-two available to me for the survey, confidently expressed that</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">did not experience collective emotions</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> during public celebrations. The sample is small, but there was not a single exception. Therefore, I have included this item. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Barcode number 9.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In companies and at parties, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">you are either absent</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , flying away into the world of your own thoughts and fantasies, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">or there are too many of you</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and you occupy the entire available space with your emotional speech. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Barcode number 10.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (Frequent, but not obligatory item) </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strange and irrelevant ideas live in your head.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So personally, thoughts about the low efficiency of electrojet engines live in my head. Ionization of the working fluid by electricity requires tremendous energy, and the thrust is calculated in tenths, hundredths of Newton with the kilowatts spent. Periodically I hang out in reflections, on why there are no electric propulsion designs, where all the electricity would go to accelerate the ions, and the ionization was carried out by the reactor core, a tubular shape. I will never work at LJE, and I already missed my chance to become an engineer after leaving the Faculty of Robotics after the fourth year. Moreover, I obviously will never encounter the design of anything with fissile materials. And yet, for some reason, this strange idea lives on in my head.</font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not describe the impatience, hatred of the queues, incontinence, all that you already find on the link in the directory. </font></font></i> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let me remind you that the above is a conditional identikit of the criminal according to the victim, although he personally interviewed another two dozen victims and rummaged in the archive with the statements of other victims.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Remember that the symptoms of ADHD are very variable and not discrete yes / no. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that even if you have identified all of the above, then you, my brothers, are becoming softer and more gentle. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-checking against the directory </font></font><a href="http://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/suppl/2016/10/19/WNL.0000000000003265.DC1/Appendices_e-1_through_e-8.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">DSM-V</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> makes sense. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember that all aspects of ADHD must be traced from childhood. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In adulthood, more than half of all cases of ADHD pathology are added.</font></font><a href="https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201300298"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">generalized anxiety disorder</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . But do not dwell on it. We mow, and therefore worried. Although alarming, we mow twice as intensively. Anyway, you should first deal with ADHD. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also remember that self-diagnosis is bad, just sometimes there is no way out. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then you need to show maximum rationality and emotional restraint. Attempting to pull the owl on the globe, pulling the symptoms by the ears, will only be a deception of himself. Assigning yourself a false, you miss the real. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, ADHD cannot be cured. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can learn to live with it and control the negative manifestations. </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This, by the way, is the point by which one can mercilessly reject charlatans and incompetent idiots. ADHD cannot be cured in either a child or an adult.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another question is what is possible with moderate severity even without medication: diet, sports and training skills almost completely compensate for it. But in a difficult case, without preparative reinforcement, it will not be possible to move far. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you feel maladjustment, loss of efficiency, reduced interest in life, weakness (asthenia) - this does not mean that you are weaker and worse than Vasya from 9th microdistrict, which already goes for the third time to the zone, and nothing disturbs it, nothing grieves . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, in Russian society, mental disorders are highly stigmatized. And people prefer to cope / not cope on their own alone, vodka and salted cucumber. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most acquired mental disorders are eliminated by CBT, and maladaptation becomes adaptive.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you can easily make a date with a girlfriend or boyfriend, but do not want to, then this is one thing. But if you can not arrange a date with a girlfriend or boyfriend and therefore do not want to, then this is a completely different turn. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A date with a girl or boyfriend is just an example. Changing jobs, maybe even a country, learning a new language, growing professionally, and establishing contacts with like-minded people all over the world is what makes a person free. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Drill or not drill - you decide. But the drill must be and must be in good order. However, once you tried and started to drill, most likely you will not stop and will not allow such a wonderful tool as a drill, forgive, adaptability, break.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I promised an article about ADHD children following an interview with children from the 4th Department of Child Psychiatry at the Bekhterev Institute. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they, apparently, leave-gardens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A neurologist sensitively refused to talk.</font></font> It's a pity.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He was interesting to me. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be continued ... or should not ...</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/1h/hu/sn1hhu1rohdyxaykzd0ijgrgllg.jpeg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419689/</a></p>
