We all know about Forex, maybe even one of you has tried (or is still trying to) <strike>play to</strike> earn a living, beer, telephone, car, startup (underline the necessary).  But in our life to devote all the time to trading in the foreign exchange market, it is practically unreal and as a result, automated trading experts appeared. <br>  In this post I will talk about some paid advisors that I bought and used on a real account.  All graphs and figures are taken from personal experience and in no way belong to the developers of advisers. <br>  So it is proposed to choose a "red" or "blue" pill :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Foreword </h3>

      Most brokers use MetaTrader4 as software (by the way, the 5th version with OOP elements is already being actively introduced and tested).  It has a built-in API called MQL.  Actually, it did not take much time for the first program to appear that would trade on the forex market according to a given strategy (by the way, even the annual international competition of such robots is held).  And so the current day on the Internet is full of such programs here, but they differ in price, quality, availability very much.  Take the average prices and good "reports". <br>  So I decided to share my modest experience in using these systems.  Let's stop first on some developments of our compatriots. <br><br><h3>  Associated Trend </h3><br><br>  <strong>EnLight¬Æ Surfing.</strong>  <strong>( <em>$ 98</em> )</strong> The developer‚Äôs website provides a detailed description of the strategy (this article doesn‚Äôt talk about it), reports, or settings tips.  Here is what the developer shows us: <br><img src="http://www.fxchannel.ru/backtests/enlight_serfing.gif"><br>  Not bad for EUR / USD on the hourly charts for six months (1 Hour (H1) 2007.05.07 00:00 - 2007.12.03 23:00). <br>  But what happens at the end of 2009 - the beginning of 2010 with optimized parameters: <br><img src="http://car-watcher.ru/mt/post/en_1.gif"><br>  Something is not like that ... But there is a huge fat <strong>plus</strong> ... out of 23 deals, 19 are <strong>positive</strong> .  So if you sometimes monitor the robot, you can close the positive deals well above the stop-loss level, for which he closed the deal to breakeven. <br>  A year ago, this adviser successfully worked on the GBP / USD pair, but unfortunately, in the past six months, this pair cannot work for him. <br><br><br>  <strong>enLight¬Æ Average Breakout Trader ($ 89)</strong> This is where things are more interesting, this is what the development site shows again: <br><img src="http://www.fxchannel.ru/backtests/enLight_Average_Breakout_Trader_TP_555.gif"><br>  Immediately there is one fat minus (and maybe a plus for someone) - this strategy is used exclusively for day timeframes (i.e., there will be no orders placed within the day, the analysis takes place in the next two hours after the daily candlestick closes), hence the fact that the number of transactions is very small compared to intraday strategies (1-2 transactions per week). <br>  This is what happens for the period from 11/01/2009 to 02/01/2010 to GBP / USD: <br><img src="http://car-watcher.ru/mt/post/ab_1.gif"><br>  From 8 deals 7 profitable!  and what a result! <br>  or suppose for the same period, but for USD \ CHF: <br><img src="http://car-watcher.ru/mt/post/ab_2.gif"><br>  Not really, but still in the PLUS :) <br><br>  <strong>enLight¬Æ DX II Trader ($ 82)</strong> This time there is no advertising report on the site, so let's start with our pictures right away.  This Expert Advisor also uses only daily timeframes, which implies a small number of transactions.  This is what happens for the period 01/09/2009 - 01/01/2010. <br>  On the EUR / USD pair: <br><img src="http://car-watcher.ru/mt/post/dx2_1.gif"><br>  Of the 8 transactions, all are positive ... <br><br>  On the GBP / USD pair: <br><img src="http://car-watcher.ru/mt/post/dx2_2.gif"><br>  Wow!!!  out of 7, all 7 are positive ... <br><br>  On the remaining major pairs, the results are not so hot, unfortunately ... <br><br>  On this, perhaps, it is better to stop and take a small summary. <br>  As you can see, automation in the forex market exists and develops by leaps and bounds, and a person without professional knowledge can earn in this segment, without losing precious time. <br>  All advisers (experts, robots) work on the same account, without interfering with each other, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  (I, for example, rent a virtual dedicated hosting for this purpose). <br><br>  <strong>PS:</strong> If this topic is interesting to habravchanam, then I will prepare some more reviews on other paid advisers.  I mentioned in the beginning about the competition of such robots, here is a <a href="http://championship.mql4.com/">link</a> to it (with the results). <br>  <strong>PPS:</strong> My first big post, do not kick much :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> gentlemen, I do <u>not</u> sell, do <u>not</u> advertise these advisors, I do <u>not</u> insist on trading in the Forex market, I just share my modest experience of using these advisers in realities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83340/</a></p>
