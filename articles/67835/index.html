  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Offline lead tracking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I had an idea to write about it for a long time, but I still doubted whether it would be interesting to you?  And based on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/66404/">this topic,</a> it turned out that the topic was really interesting, and I decided nevertheless. <br><br><h5>  What is the problem? </h5><br>  We all know that in our time there are many tools for web analytics that allow us not only to count the number of visitors, but also to draw conclusions - investments in which type of marketing is the most effective, or which keywords in contextual advertising work better.  But is this data correct? <br>  Yes, you tell us, we can at least roughly estimate that it is better to ‚Äúbuy air conditioning‚Äù or ‚Äúair conditioning with installation‚Äù.  Nevertheless, a significant proportion of visitors to online stores will either want to call and order, or come to your store in person, touch and choose.  How to be with her?  They are not tracked in Google Analytics or, especially, the button Rambler Top100.  We will talk about this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      To begin with, let's divide offline clients into two categories - <b>Callers</b> and <b>Incoming</b> . <br>  <b>Callers</b> call, make an order and quietly wait for it in their cozy office, or, perhaps, they will clarify the availability and buy it in the online store.  Or they will clarify the availability and come to your store, in which case they turn into calling. <br>  <b>Let us</b> call those who know about you online come to your offline store and buy there. <br><br><h4>  Method 1: Phone spoofing </h4><br>  Perhaps the most famous way.  A second (third, fourth ...) telephone number is being purchased.  When a visitor comes to the site - depending on its source (search engine, context, ad in directories ..) this number is shown to him.  Leads are determined by calls according to the corresponding numbers.  Additionally, you can use the detail of the phone bill and compare it over time with visitors, to bind a specific call to a specific visitor.  Conventionally, you can see the average time of viewing the site and link the call to the visitor at ¬± this time.  I think I should not tell you how important it is to record the paths of each visitor‚Äôs site?  (paths).  In due time, we had to make our own script to do this, now probably we can already find a ready one.  If you have a good programmer on staff, you can parse the details and paths and combine them into a single report.  With a small flow of such leads, you can use 2-3 numbers for a large number of advertising campaigns. <br>  <b>Pros and cons:</b> <br>  + fairly accurate determination of the number of leads from specific sources <br>  + it is possible to try and link to the paths on the site, which gives more information <br>  - expensive: direct mobile number from 850r, virtual from 1200, federal - not solid, but cheap. <br>  - difficult to tie to the paths <br>  - only suitable for <i>callers</i> . <br><br><h4>  Method 2: Discount Coupons </h4><br>  When the purchase of additional rooms is not suitable, you can use the discount coupons.  A visitor who visits the site next to a phone number, address, map, or other location sees a coupon for a small discount - 3-5%, representing a few numbers (letters are often confused, it‚Äôs better to use just numbers). <br>  It is better to make it so that you can click on the coupon, and when clicked, a page with the description of the discount program opens.  When calling or visiting the store, it is better that the manager independently asked if the client has a discount coupon, since  Customers themselves will not often use it. <br>  + just implement based on existing popular cms <br>  + estimated unlimited number of sources of visitors <br>  + ability to count <i>incoming</i> <br>  - not high tracking accuracy <br>  - If the margin on the product is small, a 5% discount can be noticeable. <br><br><h4>  Method 3 = Method 1 + Method 2 </h4><br>  It's simple: we combine both methods and get the advantages of both methods, and one minus is the price. <br><br><h4>  Method 4: Call log and statistics.  Method1-light </h4><br>  This method is something like a cheap alternative to <i>method 1</i> .  You have one phone number, we make the details and compare, for example, with a visit to the / contacts / page.  The sample will not be very accurate, but we will receive at least some additional information. <br>  This method is not even very accurate, and often can only confuse, therefore it is suitable only for those who have a small number of leads.  With an increase in the number of sources (newspapers, prints, online advertising, etc.), the data with the real state of affairs will diverge seriously. <br>  + Very cheap <br>  - Only for micro business <br>  - not accurate <br><br><h4>  Method 5: Printed discount coupon - print out and get a discount in the store! </h4><br>  From the name it is clear - the coupon code is printed from a special page and presented in the store.  By experience I will say that if the coupon is combined with a map to the store, it will be much more in demand.  Sometimes, in order to save money, in order not to give out a discount to everyone, a coupon can be distributed only to visitors from a certain source, for example, those who came from contextual ads. <br>  + Cheap and easy <br>  + Keeps <i>track</i> <br>  - Tracks only <i>incoming</i> <br>  - Not very accurate <br><br>  For example, using method 3, we at one time determined for our company that, contrary to Google Analytics and our CRM, which showed a large number of purchases from AdWords, ROI is much higher than regular print advertising in thematic magazines!  By adding a couple of magazines and their sites to the list of sites, we raised sales by slightly more than 30%. <br><br>  Tracking offline leads is quite an interesting and not easy thing, so I ask you again - write your own ways, add mine, I will be glad to discuss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67835/</a></p>
