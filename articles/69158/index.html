  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúKommersant‚Äù about social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently read an article in the September <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D1228608%26ThemesID%3D374/">Kommersant</a> dedicated to (yes-yes, to them) social networks.  A significant part of those networks that are created by large companies, turn out, to put it mildly, not as effective as planned.  But why this happens - in the article there is no answer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For a start, for some reason, caught the phrase in the title: "Creating a social network on the Internet brand followers seems to be an inexpensive alternative to conventional advertising."  No, well, of course, the alternative, is not going anywhere, but why compare such different tools?  The purpose of the usual, mass advertising is for people to remember the product image, and then their hand in the store reached for the right shelf.  And what is the purpose of creating a social network?  Yes, very simply, it is needed in order to give people the opportunity to communicate with each other, a social network is a tool of trust marketing, building relationships with each individual user.  And the wording in the same paragraph about the ‚Äúera of saving advertising budgets‚Äù pleased: saving is good, you can remove the entire budget altogether and this will be the biggest savings you can think of.  Maybe efficiency is more important than just saving? <br><br>  But this is so, just a discrepancy in terms :) Next comes really interesting information, a kind of overview of those who have already tried to make a social network for their company in runet.  Well, just does not allow the glory of Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki to sleep peacefully.

      Example one: the coffee <a href="http://www.sodo.ru/">bean</a> network Coffee Bean and their ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù <a href="http://www.sodo.ru/">Sodo.ru.</a>  To be honest, besides the fact that several Coffee Bean points are indicated in the users' favorite places, there is no longer any connection between the site and the coffee houses.  And the purpose of this social network is not to advertise the commitment to this brand, but to the communication of the participants among themselves - the discussion of books, films.  Such a site with recommendations "what to read, see where to go."  It is a pity that there are only 507 not very active users on the network, the idea itself seems very interesting. <br>  Example two: the portal <a href="http://www.velleoats.com/">Velleoats.com</a> is not yet a social network as such, but in general it is clear that the company is actively using social media, trying to unite people around the topic of healthy eating. <br><br>  Example three, four, five, and more: their social networks, online parties around the product, tried to make and PepsiCo, and Amstel, and Tuborg, and Befree ... And this is natural, because the social network allows you to directly connect with consumers, communicate with them, get the right information, attract buyers to exchange ideas.  But few who manage to create such a platform on which users would actively communicate.  As the author Tatyana writes in the article, even on the Pepsi website, new topics appear a couple of times a month, and the average time a user spends on a resource is generally about two minutes according to Alexa.com.  The purpose of creating such a platform is to interest visitors in the company's news, to bring people together through interest in the brand.  But it does not work, for some reason ... <br>  Maybe it does not work simply because in the case of such well-known products on the market, the principle of association will not be unlimited love for the product, but any additional services?  The article gives an example with the large social network Ax, which in two years gathered 175 thousand users.  But the network is built as a dating site for real people with certain values, in addition there are various games and online contests.  In this case, the product has long been known, and it is necessary to attract and retain users in other ways. <br><br>  But for small and medium-sized business companies, the network seems to me to be a more necessary tool - the number of customers is smaller, mass advertising is useless, the trust of each customer is more expensive.  As an example, the company <a href="http://community.yavsemogu.ru/">Yavsemogu.ru</a> , which sells developing products for children.  They have created a whole club of early development in which you can ask your questions to a psychologist, go to the online store, buy necessary and extremely useful books for children, toys, movies.  There are about 600 participants on the site who spend more than 40 minutes a day on the site.  This is really the place where you can come, discuss what you care about and get advice.  This is the party where people come and spend their time. <br><br>  From all these examples, we can make such a brief conclusion: not one, not even the most wonderful and wonderful product, can by itself become the center of an active social network.  It is much more important that the network has that useful additional ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, because of which users will spend time online. <br><br>  What do you think? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69158/</a></p>
