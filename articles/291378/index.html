Only one warrior from now on</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b94/f8f/c46/b94f8fc46ba34b31b65d86d1614f79b2.png"><br><br>  It is no secret that not only in retail, but also in the IT business is widely used form of doing business called "Self-employed".  Not so long ago, this class of businessmen was dealt a heavy blow, which radically increased the level of taxes paid.  The result was a significant reduction in the population of this "beast" in our Taiga.  However, this was not enough. <br>  The new attack on the self-employed was organized, oddly enough, by the Commissioner for the Rights of Entrepreneurs under President Boris Titov, whom the position obliges entrepreneurs to protect. <br>  Learn more about why entrepreneurs are so attractive for beginners in their IT business and what the most senior ‚Äúbusiness advocate‚Äù in Russia actually offers under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the Federal Tax Service, in April 2015, Russia had 3.46 million individual entrepreneurs ‚Äî more than small and micro enterprises combined (2.35 million).  The reason for the popularity of the IP form in Russia is largely in the simplified procedure for reporting and taxation: the IP may not keep accounting and balance.  PI pay less fines than legal entity.  The popularity of the IP status is primarily high due to the simplicity of its receipt and liquidation, taking into account our extremely complicated legislation: you do not need to write a charter, determine and divide shares, keep in the state or involve accountants and personnel managers.  Finally, PIs are rarely targeted by raiders.  It is not surprising that this form of entrepreneurship is often chosen by freelancers, programmers and novice IT teams. <br>  PI is the most dynamic and flexible sector of the economy, responsive to changes in the labor market and able to soften the blows of the crisis.  After the increase in social benefits in 2013, the number of individual entrepreneurs, according to the FTS, decreased from 4 million in January 2013 to 3.4 million in January 2014 (0.9 million individual entrepreneurs were eliminated).  The propensity of individual entrepreneurs to conduct informal business is understood by the state as a propensity to evade taxes and obligations to employees and tries to bring them ‚Äúto the light‚Äù.  But the reasons that force entrepreneurs to work informally, officials do not eliminate: the complexity of registration and re-registration, hiring and firing employees, high taxes and bureaucratic pressure, weak guarantees of ownership. <br>  <b>The Commissioner for the Rights of Entrepreneurs under President Boris Titov proposed to abolish the individual entrepreneur as a vestige of the 1990s, retaining this form only for those who do not have employees</b> , reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta. <br><br>  As a result, Russia may lose one of the most common and enduring types of business - individual entrepreneurs (PI), hiring workers.  The initiative of the defender of the rights of businessmen looks at least strange.  Apparently, in this way the state decided to fight the too independent and active part of society and the problem of tracking their incomes <s>and, above all, expenses</s> , but the latter goal is unlikely to be achieved as a result. <br>  Apparently our remarkable business ombudsman does not know that individual entrepreneurs who use hired labor do not have significant advantages over small business today.  Such individual entrepreneurs pay contributions to the Pension Fund and other funds on a par with legal entities, but the main thing is that in the event of default or bankruptcy, the individual entrepreneur risks losing everything, including the apartment and personal belongings, and the liability of the limited company is limited only by the share capital.  In the case of criminal responsibility, the entrepreneur himself is at the risk of being caught, and not a ‚ÄúZits Chairman‚Äù or an accountant.

      The estimated outcome of the new prohibitive initiative - part of the PI and their employees (4.6 million people, according to Rosstat for 2013) will become officially unemployed or go into the shadows.  And state officials will be surprised at the growth of the shadow sector and resent that millions of people "are not sure what they are busy with." <br>  Attempting to convert IP to MP will lead to the flourishing of the shadow sector.  Economist Alexander Chepurenko believes that individual business will largely turn into illegal.  A new change in the rules of the game will destroy a whole layer of entrepreneurs who will not be associated with the registration of an LLC and the associated bureaucratic burden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f4/5eb/1f9/8f45eb1f90f6469497fc086cc0437c6e.png" width="230" align="left" alt="image"><br><br>  The desire to cancel the IP status for businessmen hiring workers resembles the story of the Soviet slogan of "eliminating the kulaks as a class," where hiring workers was a key sign of the fist.  In the late 1920s - early 1930s.  This led to the enrollment of millions of peasant families into the fists and "henchmen".  Soviet and party workers considered even mutual assistance of neighbors and fellow villagers in rural and other jobs for a nominal fee or treat as hiring. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291378/</a></p>
