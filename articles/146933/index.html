  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you get paid enough? (opinion of programmers)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A good programmer is highly valued in the labor market, and the current situation of a shortage of highly qualified personnel leads to the fact that there is often competition between companies, as a result of which employers, first of all, try to offer the most favorable payment terms.  Here it is necessary to properly evaluate the work of the candidate and offer him the best option of monetary reward.  In addition, today many companies offer additional bonuses in the form of social packages: payment for mobile communication, full or partial payment of meals, visits to sports clubs, etc.  It can be said that this is a serious additional incentive. <br>  And, nevertheless, despite the beneficial additional material options, it is non-material motivation that is of great importance for programmers. <br><br>  At the beginning of 2012, <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/">the Luxoft Personnel recruitment agency</a> and the portal <a href="http://it.rabota.ua/">it.rabota.ua</a> conducted a survey on the motivation of programmers, which was attended by <b>1,560</b> respondents.  The main audience of this study was software developers from different companies aged 21 to 25 years (45%) and from 26 to 30 years (27%).  The share of specialists under the age of 20 years was 3%, from 31 to 35 years old - 14%, from 36 and more - 11%. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>15. Distribution of respondents by age</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38a/557/879/38a55787957e206428277fbc48fb0540.jpg" alt="image">

      About a third of respondents (32%) are Middle-developers.  28% of respondents are Junior, and 21% are Senior.  Top level positions Team Lead and Head were 12% and 7% respectively. <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>16. Distribution of respondents by position</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d2/093/df1/9d2093df1807169d10808084b7f1a0db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong the surveyed programmers are PHP (30%), JavaScript (25%), C ++ (21%), C # (21%), and Java (20%). <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>17. Distribution of respondents by programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãused in their work.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a73/049/81e/a7304981e89a4a3da8f3db2bf72992ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main reason for changing jobs for programmers is wages.  35% of survey participants would agree to move to a new place, provided that thereby they increase their monthly income (Fig. 18). <br>  In fig.  19 shows that the lower the level of the position of the respondent, the greater the role for him is the salary. <br>  Almost a quarter of respondents are willing to change jobs to tackle a new project that is interesting for themselves.  This is especially true for higher-level specialists (29% of respondents with the Head level and 25% with the Team Lead level are willing to change jobs if they are interested in a new project). <br>  10% of respondents would be interested in participation in the profits of the company-employer.  This method of motivation is attractive for high-level respondents - Senior, Team Lead and Head. <br>  Another 8% of respondents would change their current place of work if they were invited to work in an international company, 6% each - in case of improved working conditions and in the presence of foreign business trips at the company's expense. <br>  They do not want under any circumstances to change the work of only 9% of the surveyed programmers. <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>18. What would make you change jobs right now?</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d8/6a9/395/6d86a939553237e7ddaa7fe810d79045.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>19. What would make you change jobs right now?</b>  <b>(in terms of position levels)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db7/91f/592/db791f592e39944b62080e8827c06924.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Software developers are ready to change jobs, provided that a new place brings them an increase in wages of 20% or more (Fig. 20).  About a third of specialists holding positions such as Middle, Team Lead and Head will be ready to change their homeland only if they are offered a salary 40% higher than the current one. <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>20. What is the minimum salary increase that would make you change jobs?</b>  <b>(in terms of position levels)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7e/9fd/ba8/f7e9fdba89dc83085b811fa4ca9c7bb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among the main motives in the work, in addition to wages, programmers refer to professional and career growth (79% and 54%, respectively), freedom of action and recognition among colleagues and management (50 and 44%, respectively).  They may also be interested in responsible projects (32%), overtime pay (26%) and participation in the company's profits (24%). <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>21. What motivates you in work besides salary?</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a91/a40/c3e/a91a40c3e69541102d8e9dfabecd3b9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For Junior-developers, the main incentives for work are professional and career growth, which is directly related to an increase in salary in the future, Head level specialists are more motivated than others to recognize their colleagues, work on very important projects and participate in the company's profits (Fig. 22). <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>22. What motivates you to work in addition to wages?</b>  <b>(in terms of position levels)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a4e/a71/0f7/a4ea710f7dc379ca96678d5bc2e5921c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  60% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the size of their wages.  If you look at this issue in the context of job levels (Fig. 23), it is clear that younger specialists are the least satisfied with their salary, and with increasing job level, satisfaction increases. <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>23. Do you get paid enough?</b>  <b>(in terms of position levels)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a0/ad6/122/0a0ad6122c976a83aae9697931f8d2ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is interesting to note that with age, wage satisfaction decreases (Fig. 24).  Most of them are satisfied with their wages among respondents under the age of 20 and 21-25 years (69% and 62%, respectively), while among those who are 36 years old and more than all, 41% are satisfied with their salary. <br><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>24. Do you get paid enough?</b>  <b>(by age)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c71/de1/02e/c71de102ee2e9c85863014143f9dce1f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, the results of the survey showed that for programmers the main reason for changing employers is an increase in wages, and not less than 20%, as well as an invitation to work on a new interesting project.  In addition to salaries, programmers are motivated by professional and career growth. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/about/management/khrebto.html">Renata Hrebto</a> , head of the Luxoft Personnel recruitment department in Ukraine, comments on: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bc/67a/a01/8bc67aa012bda929ce78235d244a2f9f.jpg" align="left">  <i>‚ÄúGiven the shortage of highly qualified IT staff in the labor market, we see that it is no longer possible to attract the best specialists with wages, and this is not news for most companies.</i>  <i>For many applicants, professional growth is the best motivation.</i>  <i>More and more companies offer competitive working conditions and professional development by opening their corporate universities or training centers.</i>  <i>Increasingly, when choosing a potential job, applicants are paying attention not only to the prospects of the proposed position, but also to the social package.</i>  <i>Competently compiled social package in the company is one of the tools to increase staff loyalty.</i>  <i>Comfortable offices with equipped relaxation rooms, private gyms equipped with shower cabins, etc.</i>  <i>‚ÄúIt all works well as an added bonus to the factors listed above (salary + development + confidence + comfort).‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/press/research/ukraine_2011/">Download in PDF (full version of the study).</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146933/</a></p>
