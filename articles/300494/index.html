The VentureBeat publication together with Spoke Intelligence recently updated the results of the mobile market research as of March 2016, distributing the main areas with the largest amount of attracted investments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In total, all application segments have attracted $ 28 billion in investment since 2010, and currently the estimated cost of these services is $ 405 billion. But recently there have been new trends that can significantly change the market, among them VentureBeat has selected several segments that will be are popular.

Now, Airline KLM integrates the ability to communicate via instant messengers with the support of companies. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe noticed a serious increase in consumer interest in using messages in instant messengers, instead of posting feedback on social networks,‚Äù said Gert Wim, manager of Airline KLM. </blockquote><br>  In confirmation of this, Airline KLM reports the results of launching a bot for Facebook Messenger support - the number of hits per day increased by 40%, reaching 13 messages per minute. <br><br><h2>  Merging websites and applications </h2><br>  Google is already working in this direction when it embeds relevant applications into a search.  In the case of end-to-end search integration in Apple devices, the same thing happens - users can find the necessary content without downloading individual applications or opening additional sites. <br><br>  The close interaction between mobile applications and websites in the near future will be one of the most relevant areas of development of new solutions. <br><br><h2>  Finance and payments </h2><br>  APIs for making payments on mobile devices are particularly relevant at the moment.  However, in the near future, services that provide the ability to pay via mobile devices will be popular.  For example, at Starbucks, about 21% of the profits come from payments using mobile devices. <br><br>  Other major Wal-Mart retailers are considering integrating mobile payment options. <br><br><h2>  Artificial Intelligence, Virtual and Augmented Reality </h2><br>  These areas remain one of the priority for large companies - during the last financial report, Facebook announced plans for development in these areas in the next few years. <br><br>  Augmented and virtual reality gradually changes the pattern of interaction with devices, as well as increases user engagement. <br><br>  As for artificial intelligence, it is still not enough for the full-fledged work of such assistants as Siri, Alexa and Cortana, but investments in this area will continue to grow in the coming years. <br><br>  Now on the market there is only the beginnings of the development of mobile devices and wearable electronics.  At the moment, this segment remains one of the fastest growing and most difficult to predict.  Despite the existing solutions, it is not necessary to make sure that at the moment mobile devices have completed their development and are not expecting significant jumps in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300494/</a></p>
