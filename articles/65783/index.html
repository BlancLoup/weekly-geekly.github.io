Go crazy - you can sleep as much as you want!  You can work when there is a ‚Äúverse‚Äù, and when it is not there, you can walk and breathe air and have fun as soon as it comes to your head.  Is this not happiness?  About half a year I spent in such a state of constant high, and then gradually began to get used to.  And then began what usually happens with the majority of prisoners of the "home office".  And now, after a year and a half of such a life, I wondered - is it really that good for me, as it seemed at first? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, what I came for a half year of "free" life: <br><br>  - Since I set myself the tasks before me, and there were no time limits (you can work for yourself at night, you can!), Their number in the ‚Äúmemorial‚Äù exceeded all reasonable limits.  And they all came.

      ‚ÄúThe working day never stopped ‚Äî only by opening my eyes, I was already in the workplace, and a great sense of guilt and responsibility in front of that huge list of tasks that I had taught myself prevented me from leaving. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt the same time, the amount of work that was actually done during this incredible working day turned out to be surprisingly modest.  What have I been doing all these long 16 hours of ‚Äúfree time‚Äù? <br>  Critical counting of working time brought disappointing results.  The computer, my workplace, was also the main obstacle in work.  How not to read a fresh selection of stories or anecdotes?  They, however, until the fig, but after all the same fun! <br><br>  Again, the news - I wonder what is happening in the world, so a couple of news sites welcome me every day in their arms.  And under the articles on them there are also discussions.  Often, however, stupid and meaningless, but also somehow delays.  I want to read to the end and still find out for whom the last word remains. <br><br>  Forums on the specialty - you need to know what the brothers in the profession breathe.  Himself to write something there - holy work! <br><br>  All sorts of different newsletters and RSS - so much interesting there! <br><br>  And then there is the mail - the current working (there is a lot of it) and personal - and I love to write long, interesting letters! <br>  Here are just all cursed ICQ for devouring time on this list is not lit up, then I practically did not use it, not like now ... :) <br><br>  In short, the result was sad - most of the time I suffer a natural garbage, giving me nothing, but it takes a lot of money: money, because the work is not done;  health, because the 16-hour sitting at the monitor point does not pass without consequences;  happiness, because why is there something happy to be?  Without money and health? <br><br>  Ozverev from such an understanding, I decided on extremist measures.  An alarm clock was set on the table, and it was announced to my family that I was now with them again, except for two hours a day. <br><br>  All day except for these two hours I did not touch the work.  And threw it in any place when two hours expired.  And he lived like this for about a week.  The result was shocking - in two hours I managed to do substantially more than sixteen!  Understanding that the time is not rubber, that it is about to end, completely cut off all the desire to escape for a minute.  For this week, I redid a bunch of things that have hung heavy for several months.  Of course, there were cases that could not be pushed into at two o'clock.  Anything that requires thoughtfulness, analyticity, some things that are not fundamentally accelerated (you cannot, for example, type text faster than you can), etc.  All of this was either divided into pieces or postponed.  But the result did not change because the reduction of working time by eight times led to a sharp increase in the efficiency of its use. <br><br>  Then I gradually returned to my former life.  To favorite jokes, news, mail.  But when I feel that the routine is starting to overwhelm me, I remember this experiment and take the most paradoxical decision: not to add a couple of hours for ‚Äúraking‚Äù, but, on the contrary, to shorten my working day, to limit it to specific rigid frameworks, for which .  And the "blockages" begin to melt magically ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65783/</a></p>
