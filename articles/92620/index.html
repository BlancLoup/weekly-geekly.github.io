  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qubrit.com: How we did Startup 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Preamble</b> <br>  I will begin with the fact that it was registered on Habr√© for a very long time - however, I could not remember my password and could not recover it due to the fact that I don‚Äôt already use the e-mail address I specified during registration.  Therefore, at first I published this article in pesotsnitsu - and now with some changes I transfer here. <br><br>  <b>Prehistory</b> <br>  The idea came to mind by accident.  As in September 2009, I had to find one architect with whom we worked 2 years ago and who became urgently needed for additions to the project for which we hired him for the first time.  I was looking for his business card among about 500 different business cards (+ another contact base in the address book).  I was looking for 10 minutes - I found in correspondence with him two years ago.  I found ‚Äî I called his company with a sense of accomplishment ‚Äî and a bummer ‚Äî Mike doesn't work there anymore and can't give me his coordinates because ‚Äúwhy do you need him ‚Äî we have all good architects here‚Äù (yes, it happens in London - and then so no one will give anything). <br><br>  Well, I don‚Äôt mean to be a fool - I googled his name and eventually found him on Facebook - where I wrote to him that we needed him to go.  In general, the situation was resolved and he contacted me.

      <b>What's next</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And here, as the Goblin says, ‚Äúwhile we went Senya with a taboo back and forth, I won the Green Card‚Äù - in general, I thought about something like this ‚Äúit‚Äôs necessary that all contacts of a person are automatically updated for others‚Äù, then I immediately thought that physical business cards that would be on the chip and with the display and once a month connected to the Internet and updated the contact details of the owner of the card. <br><br>  <b>Qubrit.com</b> <br>  Actually one after another - and the thought came to make online storage for business cards where all the business cards of other people that you have will always be updated. <br>  The main idea of <a href="http://qubrit.com/">Qubrit.com</a> is a virtual business card storage service and their synchronization.  When registering, a unique number is issued (or which you can choose if you want) and to which absolutely all data is tied up - name, work, study, profiles in social networks, and so on. <br>  As a result, the core of the service is actually your business card which has: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Your Qubrit ID (i.e. card number) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Your name <br>  ‚Ä¢ Position and place of work <br>  ‚Ä¢ Addresses, phone numbers and emails <br>  ‚Ä¢ Links to social networks in which you are (as a single list of all facebook and twitter and so on in which you are registered) <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can also add up to 10 photos. <br>  Note: This is not a dating service or searching for ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and we do not position ourselves as such. <br><br>  <b>How it all works in real life</b> <br>  So, there is Vasya Pupkin who has a physical (that is, paper) business card which says only ‚ÄúVasya Pupkin: xxxxxx‚Äù where ‚Äúx‚Äù is his number on qubrit.com (according to the idea, the service should be popular).  Then Vasya Pupkin gives this map to Fyodor Sumkin.  Fedor Sumkin comes home / opens his Qubrit profile at the office - enters Vasya's number in the search field and Vasya's card appears.  Next Fedor presses "Add Vasya."  Vasya also receives a notification that Fyodor wants to add him and he either appruvit or rejectit. <br><br>  <b>What else</b> <br>  The cornerstone of the service is the branding of the symbol of this number.  That is, where people see some numbers and a given symbol - this means an ID in Qubrit.  While this is such a symbol - it's just a little man in a circle, the smarter have not been invented yet. <br><br>  Programming and Design <br>  Well, in general, everything is like everyone else, I think since this is the first such average site service I‚Äôve been doing in my life (well, I‚Äôm telling the current, and the programmer does hehe). <br><br>  The first concept of the main page <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/36/63/366385d428506a2dad6e7288a3367e5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second concept of the main page <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c4/79/c479f885a05b4fe25b47e2652ae88ae6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The final design of the main page <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/de/c6/dec6feb5c2ecc1f28a86805df8c0d403.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The list of the user's social networks on his business card <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ea/54/ea54401aa51754befe4728bccc298be9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually the business card itself - that is, the user profile <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cd/61/cd610f7c14d29ccb1d8f8528f84b80fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Settings: edit card and user data (as long as this design is not live) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/76/e9761e382dfb8a3d06da0a73d29408d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Users and Finance</b> <br>  Development began in January 2010 and on April 16 we launched the early Beta version for everyone.  Now about a couple of hundred users.  I think many here will be interested in the financial side of the issue.  Everything is simple - a programmer and designer (Michael and Alexander thank you very much), dedicated server, domain, and other administrative costs = ¬£ 4,800 (where is $ 7,000) for the entire period. <br><br>  <b>Plans for 2010</b> <br>  a) Qubrit Messenger: with voice / video support and free calls to local numbers and mobile (while in England), <br>  b) App for Blackberry (in England, the Blackberry is mega popular among business people and is even more common than the iPhone); <br>  c) Service ‚Äúsearch for professionals for recommendations‚Äù - when, for example, I need an architect and I look for him automatically through my contacts and see that ‚ÄúThis person is recommended as an architect by the XX number of users‚Äù <br>  d) User Portfolio - which will be something like a mini resume; <br>  e) Consider adding calendars and managing tasks; <br><br>  <b>Request</b> <br>  Dear Habrayuzer, although Qubrit and in a very raw Beta, your comments and suggestions will be very important.  During the next week we plan to finish the design of the internal pages and some functions as well as to complete the Invites module so that we can invite friends. <br><br>  PS if it is interesting - next time I will write about the investor‚Äôs already found angel of which is willing to invest the amount when we reach the milestone in active 100,000 users until September 2010. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <a href="http://qubrit.com/">Qubrit</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Thank you for your comments and opinions - probably I was not able to convey the essence of the service.  Ideally, the idea is simple: the average person now has a lot of contacts (phones, emails, social networks, etc.) - Qubrit is the place where all this will be combined.  That is, instead of ‚Äúrecording my phone‚Äù or ‚Äúhere is my business card‚Äù - in the future everything will be easier ‚Äúhere is my Qubrit ID‚Äù where all your data is - and then you can control who and what will see about you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92620/</a></p>
