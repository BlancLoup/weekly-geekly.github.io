Just want to make a reservation that I am not trying to become true in the first instance.  I just want to discuss the whole situation from an objective point of view.  I am interested in two main questions: a new marketing strategy and a comparison of WP7 and its main competitor Android.  Perhaps the answer to them I will find in the comments.  There are many letters under the cut <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Marketing strategy</b> 
      <br>

      <br>
      To begin, consider what they are, depending on the desired market coverage: <br><br>  1. Mass marketing involves focusing on the widest possible range of consumers without taking into account the differences between them.  I produce what everyone needs.  At the same time, the company seeks to reduce the costs of development and production.  effect of scale is achieved.  Perfect example - Apple with its phenomenal iPhone <br><br>  2. Concentrated (target) marketing targeting a specific segment, trying to satisfy its needs as much as possible (for the mobile phone market: to provide models with multimedia tendencies, navigation, and so on).  Advantages: maximum satisfaction of needs, used by small companies.  Disadvantages: the segment may unexpectedly be reduced, limiting the possible growth of the company.  A great example of such marketing phones Sonim, with their clear focus on people involved in tourism and travelers. <br><br>  3. Differentiated marketing is the desire to capture a large part of the market as a whole and at the same time offer several varieties of the same product, which is distinguished by its consumer qualities and can satisfy the needs of many segments (Several phone models are offered for different segments at once).  Benefits: meeting the needs of all users.  Difficult to implement.  Then look for examples not long, most manufacturers go for this model.  The largest of them are Nokia, Samsung. <br><br>  Before we continue, let's see how this model develops in Samsung. <br>  By itself, the company offers models in all market segments, regardless of whatever criteria we use to share it: <br>  - For the price: cheap, medium and expensive, not only in the luxury segment (but this account can be wrong) <br>  - According to the main functional sharpening: multimedia, photos, communication, and so on <br>  - In all form factors: monoblocks, folding beds, sliders, keyboard and touch. <br>  - On all platforms: WinMo 6.5, WP7, Symbian (yes, yes, if anyone does not know and there are such), of course, Android and its own for operating systems for low-end models and Bada for expensive ones. <br><br>  Using different OS gives them confidence in the future (what we used to call: do not put all the eggs in one basket).  Even if one of the AXES becomes not competitive, there are always models with other AXES (There was a company that put all the eggs in one basket, I would say, not in a basket, but in someone else‚Äôs fist and not chicken, but their own, it was called Sendo, read about it <a href="http://ishc.livejournal.com/136661.html">here</a> ) <br><br>  So, it‚Äôs clear that Nokia shouldn‚Äôt change the marketing model of market coverage, but according to Stephen Elop, all baskets except one should be thrown away, called WP7, but not tested (And this is <b>question number one</b> for which I myself can‚Äôt find the answer, I will formulate it more specifically: Why should Nokia have to abandon the diversification of its product line and put on almost everything on a dark horse?).  I don‚Äôt mind Nokia starting to produce WP7 phones, I‚Äôm against the fact that it doesn‚Äôt produce phones on other platforms.  Why not offer MS to help sharpen the iron of some Nokia phone under WP7, create and release it together.  Without the adoption of a large-scale partnership.  If sales try to continue in the same vein, only increasing the number of phones from this OS.  Well, the general idea is this, but you can think of any variations on this topic. <br><br>  We are going further, analyzing the current state of the cell phone market, we need to understand that there are three types of players on the market: hardware collectors (OEM, etc.), OS developers (Apple, Google) and giants like Nokia or Samsung, who do both .  I can not understand (and this is <b>question number two</b> ) why nokia should leave the OS market, while losing its self-sufficiency, essentially turning into a regular collector? <br><br>  Now let's see what income the sale of modern smarts brings: 1 - the income from the sale of the device itself, in the form of a trading margin;  2 - income received from the sale of software and other beleberds, made through the marketplace (appstore or googlemarket), as a percentage of the cost;  3 - advertising on smartphones (iAd and others like it).  The <b>third question</b> immediately follows: how will the revenue be shared between nokia and MS, from the sale of WP7-based smartphones, and the revenues obtained from the sale of content through the markepleys for Nokia's wp7 smarts and advertisements?  Considering such facts, smartphones on WP7 will be quite budget, and WP7 itself is quite demanding on hardware (ie, stuffing is expensive), which in turn means the minimum markup on the matrix - the cost is large, releasing the price is small (of course, the first is not lower than the second) .  Is it possible that Nokia almost sells smartphones on WP7 without revenue, and the MS collects all the profits from the marketplace? <br><br>  <b>Comparison of operating systems</b> <br>  Now the second part of the article questions.  Let's compare the competitive advantages of the OS between which Nokia chose.  To begin with we will list the parameters by which we will compare them, so let's go: <br><br>  1 - Convenience UI for the end user <br>  2 - Requirements for iron <br>  3 - Ease of software development for OS <br>  4 - The number of applications in the market <br>  4 - Image of the OS and its developer <br>  5 - Availability and quality of online services (mail, search, music store, maps, etc.) <br>  6 - Frequency and quality of updates <br>  7 - Openness or commitment to open standards <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/08/81/08817b607ae0ef5b4aa91cc340faed8a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  if you want to dispute the value of any parameter or you think that there are parameters that I did not take into account, write in the comments, I will try to add as soon as possible.  Parameters stupidly we count.  to calculate the coefficient of proportionality there is neither the possibility nor sufficient knowledge and experience (such things are involved in the whole institutes of social studies and analytical agencies). <br><br>  Toward the evening, we will try to make a general recommendation recommendation together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114164/</a></p>
