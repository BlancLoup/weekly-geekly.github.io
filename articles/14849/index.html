Then information came in that there was a competition between the European Union and the United States for the right of primacy in Web 3.0 technologies, or, as it is also called, the Semantic Web. <br><br>  In general, Web3.0 is a rather conditional name, because not everyone recognizes Web 2.0, because I will call this something a semantic network.

      What really is the Semantic Web and is it worthy to replace the existing Internet - the main questions of users and network investors.  This will be discussed. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Web1.0, Web2.0, Web3.0 - count before bedtime </h1><br>  When we talk about the Web, we primarily mean content.  Download a referral or a new software from a giant planet-wide landfill and pay for this with eye strain with banner advertising - this is the concept of what can now be called Web 1.0.  The user acts as a passive consumer of information, which is created by 2-10% of active participants in the network. <br><br>  The Internet is a global information network.  The Internet consists entirely of content and the distinction between the ‚Äúversions‚Äù of the web is only the difference between the ways of organizing / serving the content. <br><br>  Web 1.0 meant a complete amorphous user, who was a simple consumer. <br><br>  Web 2.0 is usually understood as services that allow users to generate content themselves, as well as to distribute it via feeds and hyperlinks.  The user himself chooses what kind of content he should receive, going online, tune in to reading selected blogs, communities, and feeds. <br><br>  Realizing this simple fact, a number of large corporations (in particular, BBC, IBM, Google, Oracle) proposed the semantic Web 3.0 system based on ‚Äúsmart‚Äù information processing as the main direction of the Internet development for the next 5-10 years.  Its essence lies in the fact that not the users, but the machines themselves search for information by content, including the search for video and digital images, based on metadata and metabase data.  Web 3.0 should solve the most urgent problem of the development of the Internet - the search for relevant information, its separation from informational garbage.  One solution is to rank the information by source of authorship, depending on the rating of the source.  And the rating itself should not be automatic, charged simply for online activity, but determined by other Internet users.  Other more popular solutions are mostly built around metadata. <br><br><h1>  What and how </h1><br>  <strong>Semantic Web (SW)</strong> is an add-on over an existing <strong>WWW</strong> .  Semantics uniquely characterizes the content found by a number of characteristic features.  SW uses a universal identifier of resources (URI; these are links not only to email addresses or some Web pages, but also to individuals, cities, artistic artifacts, etc.), ontologies and metadata description languages ‚Äã‚Äã(lexical analysis for machine processing). <br><br>  Now most of the information on the network is completely incomprehensible for computers.  That is, the program can‚Äôt say exactly what the text is about, who A. Pushkin is and collect the posts of two blogs in one thread on the same topic. <br>  In the SW, the RDF (Resource Description Framework) is used to describe the information, which uniquely describes the logical links of the information. <br><br><h1>  "The ice has broken ..." </h1><br>  The semantic web is used not only in the fantasies of Sera Timothy Berners-Lee, but also in large corporations and government agencies, but these are special developments that require great effort.  For example, in intelligence, semantic technology is used to identify connections between people in the fight against terrorism.  All information about terrorists is stored in a three-tier RDF system built on a standard database.  To manage the complex process of processing this data, the system requires 22 TB of RAM, and it is unstable, and it takes a week to restore the system after a crash. <br><br>  Let's try to look at the technologies that are waiting for us in the world wide web. <br><br>  You may be familiar with technologies such as RDF, OWL Web Ontology Language, and SPARQL, as well as their relatives, like XML.  This whole set of letters allows developers to organize data into a semantic structure. <br><br>  The most basic language is of course RDF.  It describes all the data through triplets: subject - predicate - object.  For example, the statement ‚ÄúSky is blue‚Äù in RDF terminology can be represented as follows: the subject is ‚Äúsky‚Äù, the predicate is ‚Äúcolor‚Äù, the object is ‚Äúblue‚Äù. <br><br>  Another whale on which Web 3.0 stands is Web Ontology Language (OWL).  OWL is an XML-based ontology language.  Web ontology language OWL is designed to provide a language that can be used to describe the classes and the relationships between them, which are inherent in web documents and applications.  At the core of the language is the representation of reality in the object-property data model.  Each element of the description in this language is assigned the www-address of the URI. <br><br><h1>  And what do we have? </h1><br>  First of all, to view (or even use presence on the page) semantic data, you will need RDF browsers or extensions for HTML browsers.  For Firefox, the perfect combination is <br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/3886">Semantic Radar</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/4106">Operator Toolbar</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/4106"><br></a>  . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.freebase.com/signin/">FreeBase</a> is a community of users who create links to freely submitted databases of WikiPedia, Musicbranz and others.  Linked data is added to the Wiki-style by meta-tags, categories, and Volksomony.  The database now has about 20,000 films, 350,000 music albums, 350,000 data about people, a total of 873 categories.  Each entry in the database can be discussed, view relationships or edit.  The project is in alpha testing, and therefore access to the database is by invitation only. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> is also a community that extracts structured information from Wikipedia and creates links to other sources.  The project uses RDF (9.3 million documents with 647.348 links in 11 languages), which makes it possible to make SPARQL queries to this data (SPARQL is the standard for language queries of the semantic web)).  Several implementations for different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãalready exist.  At the moment, has associated links with the databases Musicbranz, Geonames, YAGO-classification and contains almost 60 thousand data about people.  The database includes such sections as movies, music, politics, science and others, constantly updated. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">Friend of a Friend (FOAF)</a> - a project to create a model of machine-readable home pages and social networks.  The heart of the project is the specification, which defines some expressions used in statements about someone: for example, name, gender, and other characteristics.  To refer to this data, an identifier is used that includes the friend‚Äôs unique properties (for example, SHA1-sum from E-Mail address, Jabber ID, or home page URI, weblog). <br>  Based on RDF, defined using OWL and designed for easy extensibility, FOAF allows you to distribute data between different computer environments. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sioc-project.org/">Semanticly Linked Online Communitis (SIOC)</a> is a way to link blog posts, comments on forums, articles and other posts in one thread by topic or keywords.  Recently, W3C sponsored technology. <br><br>  <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> is the lexical base for English.  The database contains nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, which are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms.  Synsets are closely connected with speculative semantic and lexical relations.  The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be found by the navigator presented on the site.  All database data is freely accessible using machine queries SPARQL. <br><br>  <a href="http://ww.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> is a geographic name comparison project with associated RDF data.  In other words, geographic information will be presented on the site according to RDF standards. <br><br>  <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData">Linking Open Data on the Semantic Web</a> - is going to transfer all open information on the Internet to RDF and, moreover, is engaged in compiling RDF links between other Web 3.0 projects. <br><br>  <a href="http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki">Semantic Mediawiki</a> <br><br>  All sites using RDF and not to list, this is <a href="http://">LiveJournal</a> and <a href="http://dobrometr.ru/">Dobrometr</a> who recently <a href="http://dobrometr.ru/">jumped</a> on the <a href="http://dobrometr.ru/">habre</a> <br><br><h1>  In conclusion </h1><br>  Web 3.0 today to a greater extent meets the internal changes in the mechanisms of the Network, sometimes invisible to the average user.  The Semantic Web is not a revolutionary solution that will one day change the world around us, but a gradually introduced (and successfully) technology, a tool that allows you to better use the resources available to us now. <br><br><h1>  Recommend </h1><br>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/SW">W3C Semantic Web Activity News</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.semanticfind.com/">Semanticfind</a> <br>  Articles and discussions about the progress of the semantic web, related technologies and specifications, semantic extensions for browsers. <br>  <a href="http://www.semanticweb.narod.ru/">All about SW</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.semantictools.ru/">Also a great site about SW</a> <br><br>  <font color="gray">In creating the article used excerpts from the articles xakep.ru</font> <br><br><br>  <font color="gray">PS I want to devote my blog to this, share recipes with people, translate news and specifications, promote SW to p / va / baynet.</font>  <font color="gray">What do you think is a worthy topic?</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14849/</a></p>
