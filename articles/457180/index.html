  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The official site of Node.js is now in Russian</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/4n/a1/xc4na1sca8xlufsjkj3yyo1z9m8.jpeg" alt="nodejs"></p><br><p>  Hot on the heels, finally accepted by the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/2243">pull-request</a> , I hasten to announce that the official website of Node.js is <a href="https://nodejs.org/ru">now available in Russian</a> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="predistoriya">  Prehistory </h2><br><p>  A couple of months ago, I opened the <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> site, where from the English version I was redirected to Ukrainian <a href="https://nodejs.org/uk">https://nodejs.org/uk</a> .  I was born and live in Ukraine, therefore, I did not see any unreadable hieroglyphs on the screen, but I became interested in the question: </p><br><blockquote>  How did the site decide to offer me this particular translation?  The language of the system and the browser, I usually put English or Russian, and it is very interesting why instead of them I received the Ukrainian version. </blockquote><p>  Having quickly rummaged in the <a href="">source code on GitHub</a> , I could not find any bindings to the time zone or location, so I returned to the site.  The search for the language selection menu was not successful, so I decided to do what every self-respecting web developer would do and change the path from <em>nodejs.org/uk</em> to <em>nodejs.org/ru</em> .  But as a result, I received only 404 pages, to which I was surprised.  After checking the spelling of the path, and also, just in case, testing <em>nodejs.org/rus</em> , I got the same result.  I went to GitHub again, but now to find the right path for the Russian version of the site. </p><br><p>  And that's what I found: </p><br><ol><li>  Folder with Russian translations is simply missing in <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/tree/07b3e250191e4922c032f73d5028cf542903bc7e/locale">/ locale</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-ru">The Russian-speaking community has been</a> inactive for more than three years and is marked as outdated </li></ol><br><p>  Actually it was at this point in time that I decided that I could help with the translation. </p><br><h2 id="realizaciya">  Implementation </h2><br><p>  There is nothing to say about the translation process itself - you take it, you do it.  The repository has instructions and recommendations on this topic.  Difficulties arose where they were not expected - at the very end. </p><br><p>  After finishing the translation, I created a <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/2243">pull request</a> directly to the main repository, which is contrary to the rules, but I did not have another option, due to the lack of a streamlined process and the Russian community as a whole. </p><br><p>  The translation was uploaded to the <strong>master</strong> after almost a month, because for a very long time they were looking for someone who could check the Russian translation. </p><br><h2 id="cennost">  Value </h2><br><p>  Speaking about life, I thought about the expediency of such translations, because, no matter how cool, in the IT world without English, nowhere and it is the main one.  There are also problems with the relevance of translations and their obsolescence. </p><br><p>  For these reasons, it can be said that I did a meaningless job ... perhaps, but there are still advantages in this kind of activity.  I remember myself at the beginning when the documentation in English scared me and reduced my motivation to do something further.  Translations of English-language articles on Habr√© are quite content that has its audience. </p><br><p>  I do not know the right answer, whether this work is valuable or not, I just <strong>translated because I can</strong> . </p><br><h2 id="sleduyuschie-shagi">  Next steps </h2><br><p>  This version of the translation, of course, is imperfect and, of course, needs corrections and improvements.  I plan to work on this and further and invite you to participate.  Since the creation of pull requests to the main repository contradicts the recommendations for joint work of nodejs, at the moment making changes to the translation is problematic.  I have already created an <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/2284">issue</a> regarding the future of the Russian-speaking community nodejs, which will determine the process of making changes. </p></div>
