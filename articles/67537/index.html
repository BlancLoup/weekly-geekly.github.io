Despite the fact that this is an almost literal crosspost of a post from my personal <a href="http://lasos.livejournal.com/44541.html">file</a> , I cannot find a resource with a larger audience.  The rudeness of the gentlemen described infuriates. <br>  <b>Update:</b> continuation of the story <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/67635/">here</a> <br><br>  <b>Prehistory</b> <br>  I used tyrnetami, enjoyed.  The machine is perfectly clean from any infection laptop with XP SP3 and KIS as a mesh for sand.  Tyrnet - Sky with a limit of 50 MB / hour, bust - 4 p \ MB. <br><br>  And yesterday, for the first time in four days, knowing that I was spending 50-70 MB at six o'clock, I decided to check the balance. <br>  On the 16th there was 1,659 rubles.  Yesterday - 101 rubles 30 kopecks. <br>  I was advised to contact the subscriber department for a logical question to the caliper "what the hell" ...

      <b>Update history</b> : thanks to the good-hearted link to cells.ru and shy away from the _official_ Moscow Skye Forum, we managed to find out about this ... <br><br>  a) Sky _ rounds dozens of megabytes.  That is, if GSM-OPSOS love to round up to a megabyte, then they round up to a dozen.  Just 45 MB is equivalent to 50, and so on. <br>  b) In Skye, the billing is manually billed.  Judging by the reviews of people, at the end of each month, most of the avalanche passes such incomprehensible charges, especially on conditionally unlimited tariffs.  The conclusion is that the MCC and Askarte at the end of the month definitely need loot.  It's interesting. <br>  c) Make Sky do a recalculation - something of the kind of fiction.  3/4 complainants stumbled upon the complete unwillingness of anyone to do anything: OPSOC defended with phrases about the certification of its billing (it‚Äôs already ten years soon, by the way) and ‚Äúnon-recognition of traffic _directing_,‚Äù imagine. <br><br>  My six years of experience as a sysadmin, first in my own school, and then in one of the regional providers of Tver, simply succumb to such a madhouse.  I have no words. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - <b>Act one.</b>  <b>Office Serpent</b> <br>  I come.  I fall on the first stand and wonder what is going on. <br>  The manager, scratching his chin, notifies me that it is impossible to find out - they can only give me the details now in the form of ‚Äúconsumed traffic input / outcome‚Äù, but not in terms of ‚Äúip port-time-volume‚Äù.  It is logical to assume that it did not suit me at all.  When I asked to speak with someone from the technical department, I was told that it was impossible - they say, the processing time of your complaint is one month, so keep using.  Yeah.  They took one and a half pieces, use.  Okay, I turned around, went to work for a passport, which, as it turned out, I did not need. <br><br>  - <b>The second action.</b>  <b>Ibid</b> <br>  I come once and again I fall, but already on the other counter, and politely (this is very important, I emphasize!) I am interested in a girl with whom I can speak above the average manager.  The girl says that there is no director, there is no deputy, there is no head of the department for work with clients - in general, there is no one.  <i>And what actually doesn't suit you?</i>  <i>Oh, billing?</i>  <i>Well, we offered you to write how much you spent?</i>  <i>And where to?</i>  <i>No, this we can not, can only technical department.</i>  <i>What?</i>  <i>Write down the details?</i>  <i>Full?</i>  <i>Until the address?</i>  <i>In terms of?</i>  <i>No, we can not, it can technology, but they are in Moscow, and will not do that.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What?</i>  <i>Director?</i>  <i>A complaint?</i>  <i>And what, the director should talk to all such nervous?</i>  <i>Young man, calm down, enough to arrange a tantrum here!</i>  <i>No, you are exactly hysteria, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what you say calmly and carefully!</i>  <i>What?</i>  <i>A complaint?</i>  <i>What other complaint?</i>  <i>Vaughn, in Megafon no one will come to you at all, and we still talk to you at all, appreciate, aha.</i> <br><br>  - In the end, somehow I snatched the application form from this girl‚Äôs <s>mymra</s> and scribbled a statement in which, because I was denied detailing the services, conversation with the authorities, I refuse to pay penalties and bills of any kind that during the inspection (30 days, they said) may occur.  Of course, the fact that I was brazenly rude and constantly interrupted, I did not fail to mention. <br><br>  - <b>Finite la comedy</b> <br>  The girl, having hardly dismantled my scribbles (I admit, it‚Äôs very difficult to read my handwriting is guilty), stated that no one insulted me here, was not rude, did not refuse anything, so she wouldn‚Äôt sign anything and would not put the seal on statement.  Raising a tantrum, she went to another manager, the third one, whom I did not communicate with today, and who showed enviable prudence against her background - read, restrainedly snorted, stuck in a copier, signed and stamped.  The manager violently grabbed a piece of paper, threw it in my face, grunting ‚Äúwe will contact you,‚Äù and crawled away, making it clear that she wouldn‚Äôt speak anymore. <br><br>  Okay.  Thank.  Themselves to blame. <br>  For reference: after my repair of the database, my CDMA catches only CDMA-450, i.e.  1x - 153 kbps with a maximum in both directions.  That is, in forty minutes I physically could not choose the 349 MB that they impose on me. <br><br>  In the project - submission of an application to the court and cross - to the local receiving office of the Ministry of Communications. <br><br>  The gentlemen did not understand either the requests or the description of possible prospects in the legal aspect - even a hint that everything could be made public, they did not sober up.  Apparently, in our country a new principle is right: the one who has power is right, and not the one who pays the one who has power. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67537/</a></p>
