RANCID - development of the American company <a href="http://www.shrubbery.net/">Shrubbery Networks, Inc.</a>  This is a team that has 20 years of experience in administering, configuring, and supporting Unix systems and network devices.  The system was developed for Unix, Linux and MAC OS X. Although Cisco Systems is mentioned in the title, the system works with equipment from other brands, quotes from offsite - <i>‚ÄúRancid currently supports Cisco routers, Juniper routers, Catalyst switches, Foundry switches, Redback NASs, ADC EZT3 muxes, MRTd (and thus likely IRRd), Alteon switches, and HP Procurve switches and a host of others. ‚Äù</i>  This product is used by companies such as AOL, Global Crossing, MFN, NTT America, Certainty Solutions Inc.  I will consider installing and configuring RANCID to store Cisco router configurations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a few words about how it works. <br>  RANCID automatically downloads configuration files from network devices and compares them with previous versions, which allows you to track configuration changes and keep a history of configuration changes on your network devices.  It is possible to notify by email when you change the configuration and upload configuration files to the device  RANCID uses version control systems - Subversion or CVS (Concurrent Version System) to store configuration changes. <br>  RANCID works according to the following algorithm: <br><br><ol><li>  Connect to a network device (the list of devices is specified in the file router.db - a kind of database of used network devices). </li><li>  We carry out the commands necessary to obtain information from the device that we want to store. </li><li>  We bring the received information to the necessary type, format. </li><li>  We check if the configuration of the device has changed and if it has changed - send a notification by e-mail, if necessary. </li><li>  And finally, change the information in the version control system. </li></ol>  I will review installation and configuration using the example of RANCID 2.3.2 (version 2.3.3 is currently available, you can see the list of changes <a href="http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/CHANGES">here</a> ), we will install it on Ubuntu 10.04 Server Edition LAMP, (for FreeBSD, you can install RANCID from ports). <br>  For simplicity, let us assume that we have several routers in the branches of the company, the configurations that we need to monitor and store them with all the changes. <br>  So, in order: <br><habracut><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br>  Suppose we have a server with Ubuntu Server 10.04 installed, to install the RANCID only one command is required:

      <br>
     <code>aptitude install rancid</code> <br> <br>  During the installation process, the system will warn about dependencies, and if everything went well, we will see the following: <br><br> <code>root@test:~# aptitude install rancid <br>   ...  <br>    <br>    ...  <br> Reading extended state information <br> Initializing package states...  <br> The following NEW packages will be installed: <br> cvs{a} expect{a} libfile-copy-recursive-perl{a} rancid tcl8.5{a} update-inetd{a} <br> 0 packages upgraded, 6 newly installed, 0 to remove and 27 not upgraded. <br> Need to get 3 778kB of archives.

With cvs, everything is clear, this is the version control system used by rancid by default.  Why expect and tcl? <br>  And again, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ru/library/l-expect_1/index.html">quote</a> : <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe Expect tool is intended primarily for managing interactive programs that display an invitation and expect the user to enter a response from the keyboard, for example, passwd, ftp, telnet, rlogin, su, and many others.</i>  <i>In ordinary shell scripts, such programs require the mandatory presence of a person who enters the answers to their requests.</i>  <i>Expect allows you to automate the conversational mode using simple scripts based on the Tcl language, and in addition, provides step-by-step management of subprocesses: you can check the result of each operation and determine which input data you need to provide by the result of the check. ‚Äù</i> <br>  Now that we have installed rancid, we understand the algorithm of its work, we know the means used by rancid - we can begin to configure it. <br><br><h4>  Customization </h4><br>  After installation, by default, the files will be in the following directories: <br>  / var / log / rancid - directory of logs; <br>  / var / lib / rancid - installation directory RANCID (BASEDIR); <br>  / usr / share / doc / rancid‚Äì documentation and examples of configuration files; <br>  / etc / rancid - the directory where the configuration file is stored - rancid.conf, this file contains settings for variables, such as job execution delay, number of connection attempts to the device, connection timeouts, it also indicates device groups, notification parameters and paths to directories RANCID. <br>  It is assumed that network devices will be grouped by some parameters, such as the type of equipment or its geographical location.  The group name is set in the LIST_OF_GROUPS parameter of the rancid.conf file.  For example, LIST_OF_GROUPS = ‚Äúrouters‚Äù. <br>  After installation, you need to create a .cloginrc file or edit the sample file located at /usr/share/doc/rancid/examples/cloginrc.sample.  This file is placed in the home directory of the user with the rights that will be run RANCID scripts.  For security reasons, only this user needs to set read and write permissions to the file: <br><br> <code>root@test:/root# chmod 600 .cloginrc <br> root@test:/root# ls -la <br> total 32 <br> drwx------ 5 root root 4096 2010-06-09 12:10 . <br> drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 2010-06-09 10:38 .. <br> drwx------ 2 root root 4096 2010-06-09 10:58 .aptitude <br> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3106 2010-04-23 13:45 .bashrc <br> -rw------- 1 root root 153 2010-06-09 12:10 .cloginrc <br> drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2010-06-09 10:59 .debtags <br> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 140 2010-04-23 13:45 .profile <br> drwx------ 2 root root 4096 2010-06-09 10:51 .ssh</code> <br> <br>  This is an important point, since RANCID will not work if the file is read / write for other users. <br>  In .cloginrc, you can specify the following connection parameters: <br>  add method &lt;device name, IP address&gt; {telnet, ssh} - the method of connecting to the device, telnet or ssh, you can specify both, the first in the list will take precedence; <br>  add user &lt;device name, IP address&gt; {username} - username that will be used to connect to the group of routers; <br>  add password &lt;device name, IP address&gt; {vtypassword} {enablepassword} - passwords for connection, respectively, the first will be used to connect to the device, the second for privileged mode; <br>  add autoenable &lt;device name, IP address&gt; {0,1} - allows you to automatically use the privileged mode after connection. <br>  I got this file: <br><br> <code>add user 10.5.51.* root <br> add password 10.5.51.* Rsduj%0 <br> add user * admin <br> add autoenable * 1 <br> add password * P@ssw0rd83 <br> add method * telnet ssh</code> <br> <br>  To connect to devices whose IP address falls under the mask 10.5.51. * Login will be used - root, password - Rsduj% 0, for all others - admin, P @ ssw0rd83. <br>  The next step is to run the rancid-cvs script: <br><br> <code>root@test:/var/lib/rancid/bin# ./rancid-cvs <br> <br> No conflicts created by this import <br> <br> cvs checkout: Updating routers <br> Directory /var/lib/rancid/CVS/routers/configs added to the repository <br> cvs commit: Examining configs <br> cvs add: scheduling file `router.db' for addition <br> cvs add: use `cvs commit' to add this file permanently <br> /var/lib/rancid/CVS/routers/router.db,v &lt;-- router.db <br> initial revision: 1.1 <br> root@test:/var/lib/rancid/bin#</code> <br> <br>  Rancid-cvs - creates all the necessary directories and configuration files for each of the groups specified in the LIST_OF_GROUPS variable of the rancid.conf file and imports them into CVS.  This script should be run every time after adding new changes to existing groups of devices.  For each group, a file routers.db is created in which the list of devices in the group, the type of devices and their status are stored.  Routers.db has the following entry format: <br>  <b>‚ÄúRouter: mfg: state‚Äù</b> <br>  router - FQDN name or ip address of the router; <br>  mfg - manufacturer (cisco | cat5 | juniper ..); <br>  state - device state (up or down), if you specify down, the script will simply ignore this device. <br>  My routers.db has the following form: <br><br> <code>10.5.51.17:cisco:up:"backbone" <br> 10.5.51.25:cisco:up:"router1" <br> 10.5.51.33:cisco:up:"router2" <br> 10.5.52.41:cisco:up:"gateway1" <br> 10.5.52.49:cisco:up:"gateway2" <br> 10.5.53.57:cisco:down:"old_" <br> 10.5.54.105:cisco:up:"851_12" <br> 10.5.55.113:cisco:up <br> 10.5.55.129:cisco:up</code> <br> <br>  This completes the setup, you can start checking and running the script.  I gave an example of the simplest setting, there are many more parameters in the file rancid.conf, all of them contain comments, so it‚Äôs not hard to figure out what it‚Äôs about. <br><br><h4>  Check and start </h4><br>  We check the availability of the device and the correctness of the parameters specified in the cloginrc. <br><br> <code>root@test:/var/lib/rancid/bin# ./clogin -c "sh ver" -f /root/.cloginrc 10.5.51.17 <br> 10.5.51.17 <br> spawn telnet 10.5.51.17 <br> Trying 10.5.51.17... <br> Connected to 10.5.51.17. <br> Escape character is '^]'. <br> User Access Verification <br> Username: root <br> Password: <br> VPN_Balkany# <br> VPN_Balkany#terminal length 0 <br> VPN_Balkany#sh ver <br> Cisco IOS Software, C850 Software (C850-ADVSECURITYK9-M), Version 12.4(4)T4, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2) <br> Copyright (c) 1986-2006 by Cisco Systems, Inc. <br> Compiled Thu 03-Aug-06 17:16 by kellythw <br> ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 12.3(8r)YI3, RELEASE SOFTWARE <br> VPN_Balkany uptime is 2 days, 23 hours, 12 minutes <br> System returned to ROM by power-on <br> System image file is "flash:c850-advsecurityk9-mz.124-4.T4.bin" <br> This product contains cryptographic features and is subject to United <br> States and local country laws governing import, export, transfer and <br> use.
