      On the diagram, internal communications mutually penetrate all indicators of the site.  And external optimization is no exception.  But let's order.  And we begin with a common understanding of why we are needed ... <br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br>  In general, a link is something that allows the Internet to function; without it, it simply could not exist.  And although the ultimate goal of the user is content or service, he could neither find nor use them without links. <br><br>  From the very beginning of the existence of search engines, the link was for them not only a navigation mechanism, but also a sign of the quality of the content.  The very fact that the materials are referenced adds weight to these materials in the eyes of search engines.  And this principle is preserved today, although its value in the general structure of modern search engine algorithms has significantly decreased. <br><br>  Links still help promote sites, they just do it a little differently.  Once it was possible to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of the site for 2,000 white directories, and in a couple of months, successfully reach the Top-10.  A little later, there were stock exchanges where you could already buy links on websites with a guarantee of placement and open information about page indicators.  In those days, a two-thirds promotion (or even more) consisted of link management. <br><br>  Today, everything works differently: links are taken into account differently, there are mechanisms that can determine SEO links and punish violations in the field of external optimization. <br><br>  Therefore, now work with the reference environment is carried out in a complex and very carefully.  Mass methods are practically not used. <br><br>  We will begin with how today they are and are established ... <br><br><h2>  Subject references </h2><br>  As the name implies, these are links that are put on sites with a theme that matches the theme of your site and the page the link points to.  It sounds simple, but in fact there are many pitfalls here. <br><br>  The resource on which the link is placed should not have any compromising signs or already applied sanctions.  Speech in this case is about paid placement, so you should thoroughly evaluate the donor site: a link for which you are going to pay may not bring any result if it is on a page with a bad rating. <br><br>  The task of the thematic link is to transfer part of the weight of the page of the donor site to the page of the website being promoted.  There are specific indicators that search engines optimize when choosing a donor site: <br><br><ul><li>  Whether or not in large network directories </li><li>  Is the page or its content not being indexed </li><li>  The number and quality of links that the site puts on the page </li><li>  Site Quality Index </li><li>  Thematic proximity of the site content in general, and the content of the page from which the link is bought </li><li>  The frequency of updating the content on the site </li><li>  The location of the link on the page </li></ul><br>  Therefore, links are purchased not in batches of 100-200 pieces, but selectively and with the analysis of each proposal.  Stock exchanges are used for making purchases: there are well-thought-out tools that allow you to secure a deal for all participants.  As a rule, the exchange itself monitors the placement through automated services.  In case of violation by the seller, the buyer can rely on compensation and support. <br><br>  How to make a link?  First of all, let us turn to semantics.  Initially, all links were set with the entry of key requests to the anchor (link text).  Search robots tied the page referenced by the donor site to a specific keyword, and this affected the position of the site on that keyword. <br><br>  Now the approach has changed, links are bought not only anchor, but also bezakornye.  This is done in order to make the link environment of the site look more natural. <br><br>  Special algorithms are able to calculate links with a clearly commercial nature and lower the sites that buy them.  So, you cannot use the direct occurrence of a keyword, if it does not agree with the surrounding text on the grammar.  And even more so if it does not agree on the subject.  Links from frankly commercial anchors are perceived by search engines worse, and it is always very difficult to write them in the direct entry into the text. <br><br>  For this use bezankornye links.  The name does not accurately convey their essence: in fact, they have anchors, they just include keywords.  These are links like ‚Äúhere‚Äù, ‚Äúby reference‚Äù, ‚Äúhttp://site.ru‚Äù, etc.  Keywords are inserted into the surrounding text.  Such a link looks more natural, and is much better perceived by search algorithms. <br><br>  As it is reflected in our concept and scheme: the semantic core influences the development of a plan for getting thematic links, but does not directly form their anchor component. <br><br>  But the link between the link and content, on the contrary, is the most direct.  These are two sides of the same communicative impact with the user: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúText of the donor site page -&gt; link -&gt; Text of the page of the acceptor site‚Äù </blockquote>  This is the standard chain of user learning of content, and the search algorithm also evaluates potential communication.  If in this chain logic is violated somewhere (for example, the text to which the link leads does not correspond to it), then the chain is evaluated negatively. <br><br>  We will return to this topic when we summarize the results, and now we will consider another type of links, namely ... <br><br><h2>  Crowd links </h2><br>  They are sometimes called ‚Äútraffic‚Äù.  These are links from forums, sites with reviews, ‚ÄúQuestion - Answer‚Äù services, blogs and other similar sites where users ask questions to the community and get direct answers.  Social networks sometimes also fall into this category, but we will consider them separately. <br><br>  Crowd links are good for several reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  They are placed in the most natural and organic environment, so search engines are not perceived as tools for manipulating the algorithm.  Moreover, with proper placement, even a purely technical search engine will not find a reason for mistrust.  This means that such a link will not exactly cause the imposition of sanctions, but on the contrary, will improve the performance of the site. </li><li>  They are absolutely naturally perceived by the community, and minimize negative in relation to the brand.  Of course, much depends on the filing and the level of performance, but more on that below. </li><li>  They provide a good stream of targeted visitors to the site.  And this is a very important point: visitors are the impact on behavioral ranking factors.  We will discuss this in the next article, here we only mention that crowd-links (and this is even reflected in their name) make it possible to quickly get visitors, even when you have no positions yet.  And most importantly, these are people who have already identified their interest. </li><li>  They often have a long-lasting effect: if you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù a popular public inquiry that does not lose relevance, then a series of such publications can deliver unique visitors to your site from search for a very long time.  In particular, the ‚ÄúAnswers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãservice from Mail.ru is known for being very good at the top of the search for popular questions. </li><li>  They increase not only SEO indicators, but also brand indicators: the frequency of references grows, and then recognition increases.  This, of course, does not directly affect the speed of advancement, but an indirect factor is, because after a while brand traffic to the site grows and this generally has a positive effect on its rating. </li></ul><br>  Unlike regular subject links, crowd links are on the border between content promotion and link management.  You can not just place a link to your site, you need to find the perfect place for it, where you will be allowed to speak and not be banned for this very link.  Since this is a very laborious process, one of the solutions is to create such an environment on your own. <br><br>  Organizing discussions and leading them to the publication of a link is a kind of art, if not too complicated.  You will need the help of a professional copywriter who will prepare the materials.  It is very important to build on the content to which the link is sent.  The above logic of communication with the user in the case of crowd-links becomes the main element. <br><br>  Crowd links usually do not contain keywords in the anchor, they remain in the surrounding text significantly ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù and adapted.  The decisive factor here is the maximum correspondence of the conditional answer (page of your site) to the question that the user of the service formulates. <br><br>  You can place crowd links through special services, but it's better to do it yourself: if you want to get a result, you still have to analyze each placement. <br><br>  If you are promoting in specific regions, I advise you to cover local resources.  Local users usually show higher session rates (time on the site, depth of view, etc.), and this will be useful for SEO. <br><br>  Please note that the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù audience often comes from crowd-links, which is already as ready as possible to make a purchasing decision.  Therefore, it is important to choose or create a landing page that will put this audience in the right place of the sales funnel.  So, again, we think over what questions will be answered and what problems each page will solve, cluster the semantics in detail and work on the content. <br><br>  When selecting semantics, it is necessary to immediately identify those questions and answers that disturb the target audience, carefully systematize this knowledge and work out the structure of the site for them (if it is required to do this additionally).  In the future, it will simplify the process of creating a link-crowd-the right content. <br><br>  If you see that a large number of people are looking for non-commercial information about the product, then now plan an information section in which you will ‚Äúland‚Äù this audience.  Think over scenarios of communication with the user and summarizing his purchase. <br><br><h2>  Social cues </h2><br>  Now they write a lot about social signals, there are even interesting experiments, including from our compatriots.  If we summarize all the experience that has been accumulated so far with regard to social signals, then we can say that they do affect the ranking, but so far they cannot be considered as the most important factors. <br><br>  However, in SEO there are no such factors that can be neglected.  Everything is important for us, including social signals. <br><br>  What it is?  These are all actions that users perform on social networks regarding your website and brand.  Likes, reposts, links, even just mentions.  It is clear that search engines physically can not track all the data that users generate in social networks: most of this information is banal from robots.  Nevertheless, the part is still found and taken into account. <br><br>  Therefore, the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù program for us will be to create accounts in popular social networks, install widgets and buttons on the site, and publish new materials.  Here, we almost come to the border where SEO ends and SMM begins, but this is normal: Internet marketing is a complex thing. <br><br>  Ideally, an SMM specialist works in conjunction with an SEO specialist and a copywriter, they create a single content product and implement it at all levels.  In this case, even a contest that is held on Instagram will help you climb in the search a little higher. <br><br>  We return to the strategy.  Once we need widgets and buttons, it means that the site should be able to.  We check CMS for the presence of appropriate tools, if they are not there, then we find the necessary plugins. <br><br>  Where to get content for publications?  First of all, this is the same content that you post on the site, but adapted to each specific social network.  If appropriate, add links, if not, mention the brand.  Any news on the site is a free info service for social networks and vice versa. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Our scheme is almost completely covered, it established strong reciprocal links between content, reference environment, internal optimization.  The main link in the whole scheme: promotion strategy, based on four key parameters: <br><br><ul><li>  Site </li><li>  Keywords </li><li>  Regions of promotion </li><li>  Competitive analysis </li></ul><br>  All these parameters establish certain vectors of development of each of the indicators.  Regarding the reference environment, we can distinguish the following regularities: <br><br><ul><li>  The structure of the site determines the content of its pages (and vice versa), and on this basis links are placed. </li><li>  Site content determines the required content of donor sites. </li><li>  The semantic core simultaneously determines the theme of the site pages, the theme of the donor site, anchor links and the content of the surrounding text.  And it combines all these parameters into a single system. </li><li>  External resources of the company (accounts in social networks) are not only points of seeding of content, but also placements of links and receiving social signals. </li><li>  Regional targeting establishes an additional list of resources for placing links and receiving social signals.  And, at the same time, determines the content of the landing pages that users will be led to. </li><li>  Crowd links increase site traffic and directly affect the improvement of site behavioral indicators, becoming points of long-term user engagement. </li><li>  Metrics make it possible to understand how effectively link management is conducted, to identify problem areas, to correct shortcomings. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444156/</a></p>
