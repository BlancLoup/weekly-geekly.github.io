Nearby it was stated: “the goods are in stock, dispatched on the day the order is received”. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d87/173/b3e/d87173b3ef4d3f1da176fc467e77487e.jpg"></div><br>  On the evening of August 22, I made an order by paying with my Israeli card at the HP online store.  I received a confirmation by e-mail, “the order was accepted”, and peacefully went to bed. <br><br>  What was my surprise to find the next morning in the mailbox message from HP: "the order is canceled." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I called the phone number listed on the site, listened to quiet music for five minutes, and received an explanation: foreign cards are not accepted under any circumstances, and my only way to pay for a purchase is a bank transfer, which can take up to six days.  After half an hour, I received the requisites for transfer, another hour later I made a transfer through my Internet bank, and in confirmation sent the screenshot to HP.  By evening, the answer came: “when we receive the funds, we will contact you.” The former peace has already been replaced by a slight irritation. <br><br>  I will add that payment by card is free, and for a bank transfer I paid a commission of ₪ 54, or about 4% of the order amount.

      <font color="#808080">I understand that some companies refuse to accept foreign cards on the site for fear of fraud.</font>  <font color="#808080">But if the client confirms by phone and calls his address for delivery, you can probably assume the likelihood that he is not a fraudster?</font> <br><br>  On August 31, after six days from the date of the transfer, I call HP again, listen to another five minutes of quiet music, and try to figure out what happened to my money?  According to them, six days were not enough, and the translation has not yet arrived.  <font color="#808080">In subsequent correspondence, it turned out that my transfer was received on August 26, three days after sending.</font>  <font color="#808080">The left hand does not know what the right one is doing?</font> <br><br>  On September 1, I receive a message about re-canceling my order, “because the funds were not received within the prescribed period.  A new call, another five minutes of music, and the surprising is cleared: in fact, my money came, and the order was canceled because this model was out of stock, and will no longer be made.  <font color="#808080">(Did I draw the screenshot to you in Photoshop? And I also just called by phone? Could I put one laptop aside?)</font> I was offered to either pay £ 100 and get the cheapest model left in stock (a new bank transfer and another week of waiting! ), or get my £ 249 back. <br><br>  <font color="#808080">The standard scheme of promotion sucker, is not it?</font>  <font color="#808080">From the online store Vasi Pupkin, I would have expected this, but from HP?</font> <br><br>  Frustrated, on September 2, I demanded a refund from HP.  A day passes, the other - no reaction.  I found on the site a form for reviews that are allegedly read by the director of HP UK once a week, and formulated there all my thoughts about the missing money for the missing laptop.  Of course, I still have not received any response. <br><br>  September 7, a week after re-canceling my order, I finally get confirmation that my money is going to transfer me back.  A week later, on September 15, a message comes that the money has been transferred.  September 19, after less than a month from the date of the order, damn him three times, the money is returned to my Israeli account. <br><br>  But not all.  I paid £ 249, they returned me £ 234.  Where are another £ 15 gone? <br><br>  I received the answer to my question: “and you only transferred £ 234!” Yeah, right now, and you only noticed a month later that my money was not enough for the laptop I ordered?  Desperate to come to any kind of mutual understanding, on September 28 I sent HP a registered letter with an ultimatum: either I get my money back, or they get a lawsuit for non-delivery of goods and non-return of money.  Needless to say, I received no answer. <br><br>  On October 4, I filed a lawsuit for £ 31 against HP, including the amount I did not receive, commission for the initial transfer, and phone bills for listening to calm music - all my losses were due to my negligence to contact HP.  On October 24, I receive a check in the mail for £ 56 - the amount of the claim plus legal fees - and the request to withdraw the claim.  It would seem, happy end, my claims are satisfied?  But I do not have an account in a British bank, and it cost me £ 9 to cash a check without a bank account.  Anyway, I remained at a loss.  <font color="#808080">I did not guess to get the received check for a habrapost, so I insert an image from Google Images.</font> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8f3d67c3/51cd5cf3/0fcfa63f/bb629558.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the meantime, I ordered a Dell laptop for £ 289, paid for it with the same Israeli card, and without any problems I received it a day later.  I’m writing this post now, and I’m sending trouble to HP employees. <br><br>  PS: On November 2, two weeks after sending me a check, a message came from HP: “send us an extract in English from your Israeli bank, otherwise we cannot be sure what the amount of transfer was.” What should be smoked so as not to find out the amount “ 249.00 "in the document, even in a foreign language?  to request a statement from a foreign bank in a foreign language?  to find out all this after I’ve already paid off my lawsuit? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132871/</a></p>
