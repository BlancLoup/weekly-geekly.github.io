Today we will try to prove that there is a place in the recruitment for data collection.  Because data = benefit and even data = cool HR brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4b/3bb/36e/e4b3bb36ea5f4feaa772ad64fefe97a9.png"><br><br>  Yes, our experience shows that HR'y and analytics in the majority are still far from each other.  This is not about Big Data, but even about Small Data, about the simplest ability to collect data and process it.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What indicators in the recruitment process is important to keep in mind? </h3><br><h4>  1. Sources of candidates </h4><br>  Understand where candidates come from <br><br>  If the company uses only XX to search for candidates - one thing.  They have enough internal analytics.  But, say, if SuperJob or social networks are already connected to work, it becomes more difficult to collect data.  It takes time that could be spent more efficiently.  Every hundred. <br><br>  Understanding the effectiveness of each individual source is important for the entire recruitment process.  Everything is very simple: you will continue to scatter the vacancy to the right and left, but it will not bring a response.  Because # tut_e_ne_mest.  Analytics = saving time and resources.  Understanding the effectiveness of channels of attraction, it is possible to distribute vacancies only on resources, thanks to which the right candidates come.  The method of pollination should not work here and will not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6a8/edb/f9d/6a8edbf9d94f4987b5cf8b88c6511d43.png"><br><cut><br><br><h4>  2. Passive or active recruitment </h4><br>  Understand more effectively the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù search for passive candidates or the response of active applicants <br><br>  If you are engaged in attracting passive applicants, then work sites are not as relevant for you as social networks.  To analyze which approach to the selection is more effective for a particular position, it is important that the next time is reduced to unnecessary posting, as well as to immediately know where to look for candidates.  For IT specialists - in Telegram chat rooms, here, on Habrahabr, on Github, on My Circle, maybe in VK or in Slack.  Especially interesting are those who are already busy at some place of work, in demand and simply very cool.  Maybe you don‚Äôt make sense at all to attract active candidates and you can limit yourself to ‚Äúmanual search‚Äù by adding them to the resume database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1bc/760/ac8/1bc760ac818243b480c722768a9d038b.png"><br><cut><br><br><h4>  3. Candidate Candidate </h4><br>  Know where candidates fall off <br><br>  Traditional and for some reason especially respected statistics in the world of recruitment.  The funnel, which shows at what stage the most candidates fall off, how effective the specified selection steps are.  It is necessary to understand at what stage a huge crowd eager to work is delayed and why you killed a lot of time for screening by phone, and you could have studied some summaries in advance.  Extremely close to the heart of those involved in recruitment statistics. <br><br>  Necessarily in order to effectively build a selection for each specific vacancy.  Do not blame the customer 35 resume ‚Äúto see‚Äù.  It is also a straightforward critical indicator for each position (let's say, for an IT vacancy, more steps are required than for an accountant ‚Äî this is logical and simple).  Again, the question of logically aligned processes and well spent resources and time for recruitment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e84/f7e/34b/e84f7e34bdbd4083a407eb21277d249e.png"><br><cut><br><br><h4>  4. Closing time of the job (as well as cost) </h4><br>  Understand how much time it takes to make decisions <br><br>  Superjob in 2015 conducted a study and found that the average time for closing a job in Russia is 3 weeks.  Opossum has time to make and give birth to a baby.  In fact, the period is not very long, but you need to understand exactly how much time you and your colleagues spend on finding a new employee in order to optimize the processes you are stuck with.  Let's say the passage of the Security Service.  Or an interview, or view a resume by the customer.  By reducing the time to close a job, you reduce costs and help your company grow faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/add/6be/920/add6be920a2f4c3c9a44d571d31c3bcb.png"><br><cut><br><br><h4>  5. Productivity (there is such a rather unique report in potok) </h4><br>  Know how much effort you need to make to close a job. <br><br>  This is not to say that this is direct Mastkhev Petrovich, but such an analyst allows you to take a sober look at how many actions were performed by you or colleagues to close a vacancy.  What was the response, how many interviews you assigned, letters wrote, how many offers were taken specifically from you or in some department.  A useful thing, especially if you have an internal assessment system or it is important for you to monitor team performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/939/0ec/26b/9390ec26b79143c0911ef85e42b27d85.png"><br><cut><br><br><h4>  6. Reasons for failure </h4><br>  Know why the candidates reject the offer and for what reason you refuse them <br><br>  It is necessary to draw conclusions about what does not suit successful candidates in your company.  Maybe you took the time and he accepted the counteroffer, and maybe the wages are too low for him, it seemed to him that the tasks in the company were not interesting and you could not sell the vacancy.  If you refuse, you must understand why you are doing this.  And if, say, you constantly understand that the experience of the candidate found and the interviewed is not enough, questions about how you conducted the screening and how your selection stages work in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ca/d9c/be8/4cad9cbe8c7a4d5a8865e6a4ff4db826.png"><br><cut><br><br><h3>  Pluses analytics </h3><br>  <b>// Improving the quality of work</b> <br>  Due to the fact that you will know what the ideal source of response is, build the optimal selection stages for each vacancy, understand why the candidates are most often rejected from the offers, you can approach the selection differently.  Reduce the time, cost of closing a job.  Assemble a team that will work efficiently. <br><br>  <b>// Predict the timeline for closing a job</b> <br>  In case of emergency, this can be a critical indicator.  When a project is burning, a task, well, or something else on fire, this data can be useful. <br><br>  <b>// Leave a better opinion of the company candidates</b> <br>  If you pay attention to these useful numbers, you can not attract candidates who really do not suit you.  Straight ahead to filter out ineffective sources, those who have insufficient experience or too much, do not work with "hanging" candidates.  In general, even in the case of some misunderstanding, the candidate will leave with a better impression, because you will form a more specific request, predict the efficiency of the process, the productivity of your selection stages.  All this ultimately reflects on the employer's brand.  Positive, of course. <br><br>  <b>// Set up business processes and stop being a personnel officer</b> <br>  This is what distinguishes the personnel officer from the HR department.  Now all the issues of hiring and forming a team are very strongly related to solving business problems.  From the proper use of data depends on the success of the company and its effectiveness.  If you close a job within two months, the position will be idle, money will drip, and the company will not cope with the tasks.  Communication is straightforward very simple. <br><br><br><h3>  How to process data? </h3><br>  <b>There is always an option - manual data collection (do not do it!)</b> <br>  Ok, if XX provides free analytics to companies that have an employer profile, what about other sources?  To do this, recruiters and HRs get incredible Excel files.  Where information about each candidate is carefully entered.  The comments indicate at what stage it is, where it came from in the table.  This is a huge waste of time and energy.  And if you at least several times forgot to change the status of the candidate, that's all.  Your stats fly to hell. <br><br>  <b>The second option is to do nothing and simply receive reports in ATS in real time.</b>  That is, in CRM for recruitment.  This is not a subtle hint at potok.  This is an allusion to the fact that data processing and reporting is not a question of a quarter or a year; it is just a task for every day.  Only by analyzing the activity, efficiency every day, you can establish business processes, including in relation to personnel and their search. <br><br>  <b>Well, there can be only one conclusion: an analyst is needed to make smart decisions.</b>  <b>Smart companies already understand this.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/179/e6c/b97/179e6cb97b844933af8f774d3f99f744.png"></cut></cut></cut></cut></cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330982/</a></p>
