Therefore, it is not so easy to find a good IT specialist, even with a huge number of proposals.  A professional knows the price of his work, so he will not agree to a modest salary.  But, even if a programmer gets a high salary, this is not a guarantee that he will not quit soon.  Programmers are sensitive people in terms of various professional nuances.  If the motivational factor is not only high salary, but also some intangible values, you can guarantee by 90% that a high-class specialist will not move away from you to a competitor.  So, what are these factors? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Workplace equipment.  This IT pro will consider it a grudge that he is offered to work at the old bulky computer in an unventilated room.  And if the machine also ‚Äúslows down‚Äù, even the most responsible worker can spit on everything.  Do not save on the workplace for the programmer - after all, the coordinated work of the entire company often depends on his actions.

      2. Lack of "supervision".  In large companies, where there is a well-built hierarchical system of management, there can be several managers over one employee ‚Äî the manager, the head of the department, the production manager, etc.  For employees who perform mechanical work, such control may be imperceptible; however, the programmer will work much more efficiently without constant supervision of a heap of managers.  The control system for the actions of the IT department should not be too rigid - then there is no talk about the comfortable work of specialists.  Enough infrequent, but thorough checks by top management. <br><br>  3. Flexible working hours.  This is one of the factors that is decisive for the programmer when choosing one or another place of work.  One good specialist can fulfill the norm that a single private person would perform in a day, in two to three hours.  Why then hold it in the workplace longer?  The professional puts in the first place the result of work, and not the period of its implementation.  Many programmers would like the employer to allow them to take part of their work at home.  If there is such an opportunity, why not allow it? <br><br>  4. Opportunity for professional development.  If you have the opportunity to send an IT-specialist to a training seminar or conference - do not neglect it.  The prospect of professional growth is a great motivator for young programmers. <br><br>  5. Participation in the management of the company.  Even fictitious, it should be.  Let the representatives of the IT department be able to attend discussions of working moments, various ‚Äúfive minutes‚Äù, trainings, even if the questions being solved concern other areas.  IT professionals need recognition no less than top managers.  Therefore, give them the opportunity to feel important to the company. <br><br>  6. The lack of a dress code.  Programmers do not need to impress the company's customers - so why put them in the framework of the dress code?  According to the survey, more than 80% of employees of IT-departments have a negative attitude to its introduction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138343/</a></p>
