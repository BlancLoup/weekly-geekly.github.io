  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rulim playlist from the couch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I, like many of you, really love listening to music.  I‚Äôm also lazy and often I‚Äôm too lazy to get up from the couch to switch the track.  Yes, of course, you can buy a remote and control playback from it, but I also listen to breakfast in the kitchen, so this option does not satisfy my needs by 100%.  After I got tired of running from the kitchen to the room and back, I decided to change something - either to have breakfast in the room (which is not good) or to find a way to control the playback remotely, but without using the remote control on the infrared connection. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rummaging on the Internet, I found these solutions to the problem: <br><ul><li>  Wireless keyboard </li><li>  Mobile phone with Bluetooth + special program on the computer </li><li>  Radio remote </li></ul>  All these methods are poorly suited for remote control - it is desirable to be in direct line of sight with the computer so that you can see which track / playlist you put on playback.  In addition, all three options are quite expensive for me (to point number 2 - my mobile phone is Siemens C75 and, unfortunately, it does not support bluetooth). <br><br>  Realizing that a solution that suits me inexpensively simply does not exist, I decided to act myself.  Obviously, this should be a convenient, handheld device that can communicate with a computer and has a screen for displaying information.  All these criteria perfectly meets the mobile phone.  For a couple of hours, I wrote a small C # web server (I used the <a href="http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html">Bass</a> library for private use to play music), filled in the database and registered at <a href="http://no-ip.org/">no-ip.org</a> (a free DNS server).  As a result, the following picture appeared on the mobile phone screen: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/11/07/05/57/1322369_441x176.png" alt="Do you also read descriptions in pictures?"></div>

      It was much more convenient than previous transfers to the computer and back, but there was a feeling of some kind of dampness, incompleteness of the project, then I had an idea to write a java-applet, it was only my lack of knowledge of this language that prevented it.  Fortunately, I remembered that I had previously heard about the java-implementation of pascal for mobile devices - <a href="http://www.midletpascal.com/">Midlet Pascal</a> , which allows you to write an application on pascal, compiling it into a Java applet.  The language is rich enough, it contains all the components necessary for my intention, including working with HTTP.  For a couple of days I wrote an applet, a few more days it took to rework the interface (the notorious usability) and, in the end, I became the proud owner of the console of my dreams.  I apologize for the lack of screenshots of the applet (the camera has been under repair for the fourth week), but there are no radical differences from the HTML version, except that the speed of work has increased, the amount of transmitted data has decreased and the information on the main page has been updated automatically. <br><br>  PS In the near future I will lay out the sources of both projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44141/</a></p>
