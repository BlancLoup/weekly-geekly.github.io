Ultra High Performance Storage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Infortrend EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 storage systems are among the first in the world to use the latest Intel Xeon processor from the D-1500 family of products, designed specifically for SAN Enterprise-level and cloud storage, which, in conjunction with advanced hardware solutions from Infortrend, provides the best in its classroom performance. <br><br>  When it comes to performance, the IOPS value in EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 series systems reaches 600K in the end-to-end channel, which is 20% higher than in previous generation systems.  In addition, the bandwidth in the systems of the new series is 30% wider and reaches 11000 MB / s in reading, 5500 MB / s in writing - these are the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat define the new level of characteristics expected from middle-class storage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0c/378/541/d0c3785418594c6a9fa0a1b837e23976.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/2f4/af2/edb2f4af2e6147a6862ff85bf3f9fc51.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 systems come in high density 2U 24-bay packages (SFF). This series features ultra-high performance and a variety of connectivity options through the design of controllers with dual expansion cards for all host interfaces, such as Fiber Channel, SAS and iSCSI for SAN, IP SAN and DAS in one efficient system.  In addition, with up to 128 GB of cache memory, 12 Gb / s SAS end-to-end high-speed interface from both the host and the disks, as well as the optimization of SSD functions, these systems give users unparalleled flexibility, performance and capacity to satisfy requirements of any applications. <br><br>  Moreover, EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 systems can grow up to 444 disks, ensure complete data security and integrity, restore them, are fully prepared for backup tasks, and also allow deep integration of VMware SRM and VASA and OpenStack, which makes them an outstanding solution for a wide range of applications, including media applications and entertainment, VDI, network servers, databases and cloud computing.

      Being part of the EonStor DS family, this new generation of storage systems immediately received deserved recognition, as well as arrays of previous generations.  Only in 2015, the Infortrend EonStor DS family received several prestigious awards and distinctions, including: <br><br>  ÔÅ¨ The first and fifth places in terms of price and performance in the world ranking of average storage systems according to SPC-1 with record results of 0.24 and 0.43 IOPS per $ 1, respectively <br>  ÔÅ¨ The title of ‚ÄúDisc Product of the Year at the Primary and Intermediate Level‚Äù according to a survey of Storage Magazines 2015 <br>  ÔÅ¨ Five-star ITPro UK report ‚ÄúNew opening of primary-level storage facilities for the MPS‚Äù <br><br>  This year, Infortrend also won recognition in the latest issue of one of the most prestigious analytical reports Gartner Magic Quadrant on universal disk arrays for completeness of the concept of general purpose disk arrays and the ability to implement it, as the undisputed leader in the industry, when it comes to innovative solutions in which the latest technological advances have been applied, such as 16 Gb / s Fiber Channel, 12 Gb / s SAS and HDD 2.5 ‚Äù, along with the SANWatch integrated array management package, which allows users to  ovatelyam discover, configure, manage storage systems, including virtualization, as well as check their status. <br><br>  More information about EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 Series storage systems can be found at <a href="http://www.infortrend.com/global/Home">www.infortrend.com/global/Home</a> <br><br>  <b>Opinion experts Trinity</b> <br><br>  To date, there are still no results of open testing of EonStor DS 4000 Gen2 systems, but the data on the younger DS 3000 line are available: <a href="http://www.storageperformance.org/benchmark_results_files/SPC-1/Infortrend/A00158_Infortrend_DS-3024B/a00158_Infortrend_EonStor_DS-3024B_SPC-1_full-disclosure-report.pdf">_ rage rage _ B 24 24 _ ull 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 f 24 24 24 24 30 -report.pdf</a> <br><br>  The results shown in this test are worthy of respect.  The configuration included only 15% of unused space, while many more eminent manufacturers allow themselves to much worse utilization of disk space (to optimize performance).  Not only good performance results were shown (more than 200.000 IOPs with latency below 4ms for only 24 SSD drives), but also the lowest cost of the solution (for IOPs).  Since the DS 4000 Gen2 system is noticeably more productive than the DS 3000, we hope that its results will soon appear on the SPC pedestal. <br><br>  If some 10 years ago, the Infortrend storage system could be considered solely as inexpensive ‚Äúworkhorses‚Äù for standard loads, in recent years a lot of attention has been paid by the manufacturer to software components, such as integration with virtualization systems, cloud solutions, etc.  As a result, EonStor DS systems are now at a completely different level - they are quite suitable for the most demanding customers and can be used as main storage systems for business-critical applications.  But, despite this breakthrough, the main advantage has been preserved - quite affordable prices and excellent performance. <br><br>  You can pick up the storage and consult the competent Trinity specialists <a href="http://storage.trinitygroup.ru/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273257/</a></p>
