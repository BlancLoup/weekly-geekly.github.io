During these two years, we have gained a lot of experience and understood how to make the app really great.  It became clear that users want faster access to notes, a simplified process for creating notes, an improved viewing mode and more ways to find what they are looking for.  In other words, performing tasks should be as simple as possible. <br><br>  Armed with these observations, we reviewed every aspect of Evernote and the iPhone.  It seems to us that you will like what we have done.  Try downloading Evernote 4 on the App Store <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108%3Fmt%3D8">right now</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  New home screen and mixed view. </h2><br>  The first thing you will notice is the unified zone for viewing and creating notes on the updated application home screen.  The list of your notes is now displayed in mixed view mode.  This mode allows you to fit the maximum information in a fairly limited space. <br><br>  If we are talking only about a text note, the application will show its title and a couple of lines of text.  If the note contains only an image, we will take part of the image and show it in its entire width.  When it comes to a note that has both text and content of a different type, the title, part of the text and a sketch of the note will be shown.  This approach will allow you to immediately get at a glance more information about the note than before and in many cases even do without opening it. <br><br><img title="IMG_0742" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0742.png" width="320" height="480"><br><br><h2>  New note creation screen </h2><br>  The big buttons in full screen on entering the application are a thing of the past.  We moved them to the multifunctional screen for creating a new note.  When you press a button with a big plus, the screen is divided into two parts.  In the upper half is a standard text entry field.  A set of buttons ‚Äútiles‚Äù at the bottom allows you to attach pictures and photos to a note, record <em>90 minutes of</em> audio, specify a notepad for a new note, assign labels, and even explicitly set the georeferencing of the note to the map.  Now you can attach several photos and audio recordings to one note at once.  So, if you are sitting in a meeting or lecture, you can make text notes, record the voice of a partner or lecturer and take a picture of the presentation board / slides in a single note. <br><br><img title="IMG_0746" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0746.png" width="320" height="480"><br><br>  To create audio notes (this is one of our favorite innovations in the interface), click on the ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù tile to start recording, then click again to stop it and attach the recorded sound file to the note.  Clicking on the tile again, you will start recording again, and upon completion it will be added to the note as another attached file. <br><br><img title="IMG_0747" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0747.png" width="320" height="480"><img title="IMG_0749" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0749.png" width="320" height="480"><br><br>  <strong>Remove attachments</strong> <br>  To remove an attachment, click on the paperclip icon.  The attachments note screen appears.  To delete, click on the "Change" button and then on the red circle.  You can also use the standard gesture ‚Äústrikethrough‚Äù by dragging horizontally across the entire line. <br><br>  <strong>Selection of several pictures from a photo album</strong> <br>  When adding images from the device's photo album, you can select several photos at once to add to one note or create a separate note for each picture.  To select multiple notes, click the arrow in the lower left corner of the Camera Roll screen.  In this case, in the absence of already attached files and text in the note, when selecting several photos, two buttons will appear: ‚ÄúOne note‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeveral notes‚Äù.  When you click on the last, several notes will be created at once, and in that notepad and with the set of tags that you selected in advance in the note creation window. <br><br>  <strong>Specifying Notepad, Labels, and Location</strong> <strong><br></strong>  The top row of tiles allows you to select a notebook and set labels, and the Location tile will help you to check automatically determined coordinates and, if necessary, correct them (by moving the pin to the right place on the map) or delete the coordinates from the note. <br><br><h2>  View by Notebook or Label </h2><br>  This is a significant innovation.  Many users have requested the ability to view the contents of a separate notebook.  Now she is.  Options with navigation on notebooks and tags are located in the tabs of the bottom panel.  Simply select the notepad or tag that you would like to see. <br><br><img title="IMG_0750" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0750.png" width="320" height="480"><img title="IMG_0751" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0751.png" width="320" height="480"><br><br><h2>  View the contents of notes </h2><br>  You probably also had a feeling when trying to remember something, it‚Äôs just spinning in the tongue, but it‚Äôs impossible to do it.  A new view of the contents of the notes will take care of this.  After opening the list of notes, click on the icon in the form of four squares in the upper right corner of the screen.  Displays displayed on the screen relate only to the current list of notes, so if you look at a particular notebook, you will be shown the content solely from the notes it contains. <br><br><img title="IMG_0753" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0753.png" width="320" height="480"><img title="IMG_0754" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0754.png" width="320" height="480"><br><ul><li>  <strong>View images:</strong> This view mode displays all images from all notes.  Just click on the desired picture to open the corresponding note. </li><li>  <strong>View attachments:</strong> This mode shows a list of all attached files (except images) contained in notes. </li><li>  <strong>Map View:</strong> This mode shows a map with ‚Äúpins‚Äù in the places where notes were taken (if they contain geographic coordinates).  Click on the compass icon to navigate on the map to your current location). </li></ul><br><img title="IMG_0756" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0756.png" width="320" height="480"><br><br><h2>  Search </h2><br>  The search has its own screen.  This is done in order to make convenient access to search history and saved queries.  The function of creating and editing saved queries is available in Evernote clients for Mac and Windows. <br><br><h2>  Reminder of offline notes and notebooks </h2><br>  As always, Evernote for iPhone supports offline notes and notepads.  If you use a free service, then any note that you create, view, or added earlier to Favorites on your iPhone will be available without the Internet (access to the Favorites can be obtained from the notebooks menu).  Evernote Premium Subscribers can independently specify notebooks, which data should be stored on the device - this feature is available in the application settings.  By the way, you can purchase a premium account directly from the app! <br><br><h2>  Evernote for iPad </h2><br>  Evernote for iPad has received numerous technical improvements in this update.  And many of the ideas and concepts of this redesign for the iPhone will be implemented in future versions for the iPad. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  We have spent the last few months seriously reworking Evernote for iPhone.  This version has received many new features, but we still have not implemented all our ideas and are releasing this version today, so as not to make you wait even longer.  In the next versions, many other frequently requested features will appear, including collaboration with notebooks, sets of notebooks, and editing notes with complex formatting and multimedia content.  Stay with us! <br><br>  And of course, we are interested to know what you think about this update.  Tell us in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114695/</a></p>
