As one of the results - they made a game for the development of logic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/eb0/082/c45eb008241e42f5a8b72a52e740dc52.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the young programmer will need to write a stack of actions for the <b>taxi driver</b> .  To take the passenger to the right place the first time.  Immediately I say - you can play with 4-5 years.  As usual, if the child is the son of an engineer, feel free to subtract 2 years from the minimum age. <a name="habracut"></a>

      First you need to collect the city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ef/0b1/085/3ef0b10856074a65834b34dcd1497190.jpg"><br><br>  In the complete set 21 tiles for its assembly, on tiles - roads, turns and different objects like a toy store, an airport and so on.  The city is going as it will, even a rectangle, even a zigzag.  The main thing is to connect everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecc/b8d/671/eccb8d6712a84af59b0e98cbd5b80e69.jpg"><br><br>  The road is stuck on the road, not otherwise. <br><br>  As the city is ready, the child takes the card from the pile.  On the cards - routes like "from the airport to the zoo" and so on.  Something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/3c9/d0a/2b03c9d0aa8241198cfce0247a1134de.jpg"><br>  <sup>We must also recognize the beginning and end - on the map only the most important part of the object.</sup>  <sup>For example, an airport in a city is a field and a plane on the side, and an airport on a card is only the same plane.</sup> <br><br>  The child should not be able to read, the main thing on the cards is pictures.  We must find both on the map of the city and put the car on the road near the start of the route.  In my example - to school.  Here are the cars: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d2/286/ce4/7d2286ce4d294796b565a880d94a7d32.jpg"><br><br>  Next - you need to program the stack of actions (well, or if the programmer is very small - the usual queue), without moving the car from the spot.  For this, 50 cards with arrows are used.  This is how it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd6/988/f10/dd6988f10c9b4f7097f897941c8198fb.jpg"><br><br>  Then, as a child laid out everything - the program is executed.  He takes the car and takes every step on the map himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdf/faf/ce1/cdffafce127c4678810ef581397a45d8.jpg"><br><br>  If you manage to get there - the card remains with him.  It did not work - the card is put back in the box.  Who has collected more route maps at the end of the game - wins.  Everything, the course is transferred to the next child. <br><br>  <b>This game is an example of how completely simple adult activities become a real challenge for children.</b>  A child needs to do a lot of processes in the head at once.  First, imagine yourself in the place of a typewriter or inside it.  Secondly, our relative coordinate system is not ‚Äúsouth-north-east-west‚Äù, but ‚Äúgas, turn‚Äù.  That is, you will need to program a taxi driver, taking into account the orientation of the map.  I remember even the whole book was about why women turn cards when they go.  For a child, this is a really serious skill - to put yourself in the place of something, to see the road with ‚Äúalien‚Äù eyes.  Thirdly, a child learns to quantize actions into commands.  If he can compile routes without errors, the main logical skill is gained. <br><br>  It is clear, further it is possible to complicate on ‚Äúwho will collect this route faster‚Äù, ‚Äúand follow along with this‚Äù with a particularly long task from the father, ‚Äúbut let's play the stack‚Äù with the assembly reversal, take 2-3 route cards at once and so on.  But the main thing - learn to control the robot.  Here he is. <br><br>  The rules of the game can be picked up <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/taksi/">here on the page</a> .  Do not want to buy - to make houses by the rules, in general, is quite simple.  Just do it beautifully, the child is important not so much the mechanics of the game, how many funny pictures.  It is possible and to buy, it is a good gift to familiar parents.  Who will choose the second - do not forget to say ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù in the note to the order or when calling the operator (or when calling back when the address is specified).  There will be a maximum retail discount of 10%. <br><br>  And yes.  Remember, you <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/199372/">told</a> me about the moments that were most important in childhood?  This game is already in print. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : who is already playing his or the purchased version - go to the game page on Monday after dinner again, we will lay out the complications of the rules for the child and dad playing together.  They are also cool and use the same hardware platform. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246795/</a></p>
