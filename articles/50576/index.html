  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inter.By: According to social programs in every hand!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, after many months of development, the <a href="http://www.inter.by/">Inter.By</a> project <a href="http://www.inter.by/">starts</a> .  You can make a standard release in which, choking up, to talk about its over-use, crazy functionality and mega-actuality.  But it still will not give a complete and vivid picture of the project.  It will be much more interesting and more effective to describe the image of the average user of this service itself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's say I am a culinary blogger who runs a regular blog on a regular WordPress.  About three thousand people visit me on a day, and I know for sure that many of them are not against sharing their recipes and uploading photos of their masterpieces.  But the trouble is that my blog in this form, as it is, does not allow to do this.  And how do I do?  I bring myself a subdomain on Inter.by and create a news tab on it.  Since the service allows for very fine-tuning, and my imagination works well, I add individuality to the tab through simple manipulations: renaming ‚Äúnews‚Äù to ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù, ‚Äútags‚Äù to ‚Äúproducts‚Äù, and ‚Äúauthors‚Äù - to ‚Äúchefs‚Äù.  For complete happiness in the rights settings, I allow all users to publish their recipes, turn on voting for recipes - and get a full service with a selection of recipes for products.  Vebdvanol, UGC - all right, all in the spirit of the most recent culinary startups. <br><br>  It would be possible to dwell on this mini-service, but since I am an active person and I want to cover culinary topics as widely as possible, I create two more tabs on the domain.  On one posting news from the world of cooking, and the second - RSS feeds culinary sites, blog-forums and a block of bookmarks.  And in the end I get a self-sufficient culinary site with recipes, news, RSS-aggregator and my own bookmark service.  Time and effort to create - at least, special skills and training - and even less.  By the way, the example is not abstract - it is completely taken from life.  You can see and evaluate the result of all the described manipulations on <a href="http://cooking.inter.by/">Cooking.inter.by</a> .

      Understandably, a good startup should have a basic functionality with nice gadgets.  At Inter.By there are enough lotions: <br><br>  <b>Distribution of rights.</b>  Rights can be configured very flexibly - there are general policies and the appointment of editors.  You can arrange entire closed clubs <br><br>  <b>Related tags</b> .  This is generally the most wonderful, in my opinion, chip.  It works like this (using Cooking.inter.by as an example): after selecting the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù tag, all recipes with this tag are loaded.  And in the tag cloud, only those product tags that are in the displayed recipes are displayed.  Well, for complete happiness it is worth adding that the sample by tags can be crossed with samples by headings.  That is, choose recipes with flour and eggs from the category Desserts. <br><br>  <b>Broadcast</b> .  To keep track of interesting domains / tabs / blogs / news of other users for me, I can connect them to broadcast on my domain.  It turns out such an internal aggregator. <br><br>  <b>Customize the look</b> .  Ultimately, you can give your offspring an appearance that you can think of, and at any time change it to your liking, depending on your mood / state / season. <br><br>  Polls, ratings, voting options for news / posts, auto-selection of tags for a post, autosave - enough details and functionality in which you can dig. <br><br>  In a word, any person, even inexperienced in website building, will find here a wide scope for creativity and self-realization.  Wellcome, you are welcome to test and use! <br>  <a href="http://www.inter.by/">Inter.By</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50576/</a></p>
