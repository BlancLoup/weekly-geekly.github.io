Virtualization News Digest # 0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello% username%! <br>  My colleagues and I attended to the issue of the fact that today there are quite a lot of news resources (blogs / microblogs / conferences, etc.) covering news in the world of virtualization.  The biggest problem in this field is not that there is too much news or that they are too technical, and not even that information on this topic is difficult to access!  By no means!  We did not find a single resource that would aggregate this news and give it in the form of a digestible digest. <br>  Our disorder about this did not last long, and we found a way out! <br>  As you already guess, we ourselves decided to make a selection of news on the topic and submit them to the court for Habra- and not only users. <br><br>  In the first release: free SAN emulation on HDD, backup of VMware infrastructure and much more. <br><br>  So, the first digest of news from the world of virtualization from CROC <a name="habracut"></a><br>  For ease of reading and searching for information, the pilot issue of the digest will be divided into several parts: <br>  Enterprise - news on the enterprise solutions market (as is clear from the section title); <br>  OpenSource - about all (and especially recently our state) favorite open source applications; <br>  Desktop is what you can ‚Äútwist‚Äù on your home computer; <br>  This is interesting - links to articles and facts that seemed curious / useful / interesting to me and my colleagues; <br>  Useful links - I do not even know whether to comment).

    <h3>  Enterprise </h3><br>  VGate 2.3 has been released with full support for ESXi 4.1. <br>  vGate 2 is a product of the domestic developer Security Code, which is used to provide security and audit of a virtual infrastructure based on the VMware Infrastructure 3 and VMware vSphere 4 platform. And as a bonus, it makes it easier to bring the virtual infrastructure in line with Russian legislation and industry standards ( FSTEC).  Link to download in the last section. <br><br>  VMWare made another gift for users of its products by releasing a utility that allows you to backup your current infrastructure.  Personally, it seems to me that this is a tool that has long been lacking.  The link, as usual, in the appropriate section. <br><br>  Citrix bought <a href="http://www.kaviza.com/">Kaviza</a> and their VDI solution, which is mentioned on the home page of the acquired company.  You can read more about the company's products on the <a href="http://www.kaviza.com/VDI/VirtualDesktopsProducts/Overview.html">corresponding page</a> .  If we take into account the fact that Citrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa company aimed specifically at virtualizing workstations and applications directly for the user, then the acquisition should benefit both companies.  At least, now there is another VDI solution from a proven vendor. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/38d35e97/df2447ab/321a41dd/ea3c171c.jpg"></div><br>  One of the most personally impressed of me was the information that SAP is going to adapt its systems for Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms.  What was announced at the SAPPhire conference.  You can read about it <a href="http://sapphirenow.news-sap.com/2011/05/18/sap-and-amazon-web-services-partner-to-deliver-enterprise-solutions-in-the-cloud/">here</a> and <a href="http://sapphirenow.news-sap.com/2011/05/18/sap-and-microsoft-to-deliver-tighter-integration-for-application-development-and-cloud-deployments/">here</a> .  The news is particularly impressive in the face of some SAP employees saying that <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%253ASAP%253A_%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%258F%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">cloud solutions are not suitable for critical business applications</a> .  SAP has already certified 2 of its Amazon cloud applications (SAP Rapid Deployment and SAP Business Objects, which now bring the company about 50% of revenue).  Certification and SAP ERP is planned for the near future. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/51071abc/b71e4de7/8c07d6c4/e7cec52e.jpg"></div><br><br><h3>  Open source </h3><br>  Undoubtedly, one of the most notorious news in the field of OpenSource virtualization is the news of the creation of the <a href="http://www.openvirtualizationalliance.org/">Open Virtualization Alliance</a> , which will be engaged in the promotion of KVM solutions in the virtualization market.  The alliance includes such "pillars" as HP, IBM, Intel, RedHat.  It is planned that the alliance will be engaged in the publication of documentation, stories of successful implementation of virtualization systems based on KVM, the organization of advertising companies and support for various events. <br><br><h3>  Desktop </h3><br>  A new version of VMWare Fusion 3.1.3 has been released. <br>  From the changes: support for Windows 7 SP1 32 / 64bit, support for Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 32 / 64bit, updated WDDM driver, improved reliability of access to shared files within the host, as well as fixing smaller bugs and improved performance.  <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion3/doc/releasenotes_fusion_313.html%3FClickID%3Dc44eknnsenwzznvssa77wap4nqpl4vafanea">More about changes</a> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/be6141cc/0bce9fd1/e3ef98fc/1a2096f2.jpg"></div><br><br><h3>  It is interesting </h3><br>  Post about a small study of cloud antiviruses on OSZone <a href="http://www.oszone.net/15437/cloud_security_apps_promise_uptodate_protection">Cloud antiviruses promise timely protection</a> .

And if you,% username%, have read this far, then either you have a lot of patience and a lot of free time, or the post turned out to be really interesting and informative, as I expected.  Naturally, your humble servant hopes for a second. <br>  Of course, the topics indicated in the topic are subject to vigorous discussion, as far as possible, and I will accept all wishes for compiling such digests in the future and I will try to execute the most adequate ones honestly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120693/</a></p>
