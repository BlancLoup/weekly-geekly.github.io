  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Career in Digital: what is it, who needs it, where to start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we will talk about the career in digital: what it is, what are the directions, what you need to know, who will be interested and where you can already start working.  Laid out on the shelves and share with you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/68d/c83/039/68dc8303950c49c7b7be7e0a855e2b3d.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  1. What is this something? </h2><br><p>  It's like big data - everyone says, but nobody knows what it really is.  Digital is the use of digital resources / channels to achieve company goals.  Digital is connected with everything related to information technology: contextual advertising, display advertising, website development, SEO, web design, SMM.  The goal of titanic efforts: brand promotion, sales growth, the formation of audience loyalty, attracting employees and many more interesting things. <br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fa/473/eec/4fa473eec09bdea54768a0913c2aa224.jpg"><br></p><br><p>  In fact, everything is simple.  Digital is technologies (cap, yes) that are used in marketing to promote products and / or services. <br></p><br><h3>  2. And what could be interesting about that ?!  (Caution! Junk mode on) </h3><br><p>  Digital is a promising industry.  Cossa conducted a <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/152/161878/">study</a> where they analyzed job opportunities in digital directions and talked about the average salary of specialists in Moscow.  In addition to the material, think for yourself, every company has a product / service that they sell.  All revenue of the companies depends on sales (we will not talk about investors and complicated things).  Marketing and advertising - the main tools to stimulate demand.  No company will survive without marketing, because competitors do not sleep!  And in order to be remembered (and you need it) you need to constantly remind yourself of yourself.  Otherwise, your company will die from bankruptcy, and you - from hunger. <br></p><br><p>  <strong>// Analytics</strong> <br></p><br><p>  "This is a turn!" - say?  Even analysts are needed here: CTR, CTB, CTI, CTR, conversion, attendance, coverage, involvement and a lot of important advertising indicators.  It clearly needs someone who is able to memorize decoding, and whose brain does not explode from a variety of information. <br></p><br><p>  The company can not spend money on advertising wasted.  The analyst must research the market, find potential customers, interested audiences, analyze the strategy of competitors and make their own.  This is important and necessary, otherwise all efforts of the digital division will be in vain.  The direction is suitable for those who own a couple of skills from our cheat sheet: <br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9b/6f2/70d/c9b6f270d971746a14c28df99bc4b875.jpg"><br></p><br><p>  If you need to tighten knowledge - catch materials from our library: <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/besplatnye-kursy-po-sql-vsyo-chto-vy-ne-znali-o-bazah-dannyh/">Free SQL Courses: Everything You Didn't Know About Databases</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/11-kursov-excel-dlya-nachinayushih-i-guru/">11 Excel courses for beginners and gurus</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/51-besplatnaya-kniga-o-data-science/">51 free books about Data Science</a> <br></p><br><p><br>  <strong>// Internet Marketing</strong> <br></p><br><p>  ‚ÄúKreaaaatiiiiv‚Äù - we just shout to you!  This direction is saturated with ideas, innovations, trends and endless streams of information.  SMM, media, information channels, memes, gifs, videos, write cool materials and submit useful materials to their readers.  You are the voice of the company in the information field!  It is you who will acquaint you with the company's products and tell you about how you can be useful. <br></p><br><p>  Work with the audience, huge advertising campaigns (yes!) And the creation of useful content.  In large companies, entire departments for work with social networks have been created for a long time.  Here you will immediately see the effectiveness of your actions - users will read your materials, put likes, repost, visit a resource more often.  Just instant feedback!  And if you know your audience well and are creative in your work, then you will definitely be satisfied with the result. <br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce6/4c8/603/ce64c860304c436b2c9b073e0b27000b.jpg"><br></p><br><p>  Rather, look what skills you need, look for yourself and catch useful materials: <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/72-poleznyh-ssylki-dlya-teh-kto-hochet-sharit-v-marketinge/">72 useful links for those who want to fumble in marketing</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/9-instrumentov-dlya-teh-kto-pishet/">9 tools for writing</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/22-onlajn-kursa-o-kotoryh-vy-ne-znali/">22 online courses you didn't know about</a> <br></p><br><p>  <strong>// Web development</strong> <br></p><br><p>  Show a company that does not have a website or its own mobile application.  That's it!  Ok, if applications are needed only by service providers, everyone needs a site.  Therefore, everyone needs SEO, web developers and interface designers. <br></p><br><p>  It seems that the creation of the site is a single case - once done and maintained.  The market will quickly fill up and all these web-masters will remain without work, but you are mistaken.  Everything is changing: there are new technologies, trends, interfaces, platforms.  Companies expand and create several sites depending on the goals: career, client, partner.  Older sites need to be updated to keep their positions.  We think that you definitely do not want to go for an interview or buy products in <br>  <a href="http://www.spaceistheplace.ca/">Space Is The Place</a> : D <br></p><br><p>  We show skills that will be useful in this area.  It is not necessary to know everything and everything at once.  If you have a good pair, the rest will quickly pull up in the process of work or internship!  :) <br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f2/230/aec/7f2230aec5e4a905097000e1e503412f.jpg"><br></p><br><p>  And some useful links on the topic: <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/7-kursov-po-web-programmirovaniyu/">7 courses on web programming</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/13-resursov-dlya-izucheniya-programmirovaniya/">15 resources for learning programming</a> <br></p><br><p>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/10-kursov-chtoby-stat-tyzhprogrammistom/">10 courses to become a "programmer"</a> <br></p><br><h3>  3. Well, who needs it? </h3><br><p>  If you are interested in media, online media, advertising, marketing, understand (well, or really want to understand) in the target, metrics and other complex tools.  You are constantly interested in what is happening.  You are aware of the events of the Internet party: you know all the trends and even look at the pictures in the posts.

      You can‚Äôt imagine your life without social networks: 24/7 you scroll your tape not only in search of new memes, but draw ideas and inspiration.  You are technologically advanced, and you also like to write, look at beautiful new landings, analyze the market and generally cannot live outside the info-field.  Therefore, the monotonous work kills you and you are looking for something dynamic and driving!  And we have something to advise. <br></p><br><h3>  4. I am ready, where to go? </h3><br><p>  When there is no experience, the coolest way is an internship.  We often share interesting vacancies and useful materials for beginning specialists in the Telegram-channel: <a href="https://goo.gl/EyHxKh">goo.gl/EyHxKh</a> .  You can get acquainted with digital companies, find a lot of vacancies in this area and make the right choice <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/">here</a> . </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330976/</a></p>
