It has long been a well-known means of delivering drugs to "hard to reach" places, bronchi and lungs.  Their task is to grind the drug so that the particles reach 100% of the desired place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/oe/hs/sgoehsplmt0vhjxh_o-g4t3ncbo.jpeg"><br><br>  In the middle of spring with changeable weather - this is still relevant. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Judging by the pharmacy kiosks, TV programs, articles in the press, nebulizers have become quite a mass product, and now their purpose is not limited to patients with atsma, COPD and other chronic diseases.  Now it is a tool for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory viral infections and other respiratory diseases, up to the commonplace rhinitis.

      And, although science is now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866545">considering</a> even ‚Äúinhalation chemotherapy‚Äù (judging by the teaser, not very successful), still in the usual ‚Äúnon-clinical‚Äù world, nebulizers have become something of a ‚Äúremedy for the common cold‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>What can a nebulizer as a remedy for a cold:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Moisturizing mucous </li><li>  Softening crusts in the nose </li><li>  Elimination of burning, dryness </li><li>  Thinning mucus for a more comfortable excretion from the body </li></ul><br>  Plus, as noted in several articles: with a properly selected inhalation solution, which the physician does, as a rule, nebulizer therapy has practically no side effects. <br><br>  Because of the peculiarities of carrying out: in a comfortable environment at home, such therapy has become popular among young parents, as it proceeds painlessly for the child, which from the psychological point of view is an absolute pleasant bonus. <br><blockquote>  The main competitive advantage lies in the uniform flow of the drug into all parts of the nasal cavity and its uniform distribution. </blockquote>  It is often possible to come to the conclusion that some of the modern aerosol means, such as Aquamaris, also represent something like a sprayer, but at the same time, let's say, they do not have long-term impact capabilities, which makes them worse. <br><br>  Of course, in addition to the prevention and treatment of rhinitis, nebulizers are also used in chronic diseases.  Here are some of them: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Croup</b>  A disease that can provoke swelling of the respiratory tract, which as a result can cause a "barking" cough, severe runny nose, fever. </li><li>  <b>Cystic fibrosis</b> .  A genetic disorder that causes thick mucus to accumulate in the airways makes breathing difficult. </li><li>  <b>Epiglottitis</b> .  A rare but rapidly progressing bacterial disease that can trigger pneumonia, severe airway edema. </li><li>  <b>Pneumonia</b> </li></ul><br>  <b>Nothing vague - everything is transparent: how the nebulizer works</b> <br><br>  The pun suggests itself from the very beginning: the word ‚Äúnebulizer‚Äù comes from ‚Äúfog‚Äù: at the basis of the device, as noted above, the principle of ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù drugs into tiny particles, which as a result resemble something like ‚Äúhaze‚Äù. <br><br><ul><li>  Compressor nebulizers - break down the drug with a strong air flow. </li><li>  Ultrasonic nebulizers - split the drug with ultrasonic waves. </li><li>  Membrane, or Mesh - are considered the most advanced and modern.  In fact, they are a ‚Äúcontinuation‚Äù of ultrasound, but they provide smaller particles and also exclude excessive heating of the drug than previous ultrasonic nebulizers sinned. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  It is important to remember that not a single nebulizer is designed for inhalation with essential oils, decoctions, infusions of medicinal herbs. </blockquote>  <b>Nebulizer vs Inhaler</b> <br><br>  The edge is quite thin, and in the modern world, in fact, this is the same thing.  For example, when they say "ultrasonic inhaler", then most likely it means "ultrasonic nebulizer".  In the classical sense, an inhaler is a device for ‚Äúturning‚Äù liquid into vapor, something like an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù saucepan with decoction, which must be inhaled intensively. <br><br>  The nebulizer sprays and splits and delivers the smallest particles of medication into the respiratory tract. <br><blockquote>  The advantage of a steam inhaler is that almost anything can be used as a medicine.  The downside is that it is only suitable for the treatment of the upper respiratory tract: the medicine does not penetrate deeply. </blockquote>  <b>Nebulizer Glenmark</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/nebulajzer-nebzmart-mbpn002.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dglenmark%26utm_campaign%3Dglenmark">This model</a> stands out among other several advantages. <br><br>  <b>Compact</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/q3/5f/ndq35fu589gdzemsemtrp18bpxm.jpeg"><br><br>  The point is quite important.  First, the compact dimensions make it easy to store the device in the house, without allocating a separate shelf for it.  For children, when there is no need, it will be unavailable.  Plus, small size is a great solution for chronic patients who have to carry the device with them everywhere and always. <br><br>  For business trips there is a special tight case, inside of which everything is packed with foam rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/or/si/oz/orsiozsrvd_a_c_h-oklh712yaa.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Universal</b> <br><br>  The kit includes two nozzles of different sizes: this gadget can be used by both children and adults. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/gs/tg/togstggv4-r17vml38bxw9hwymw.jpeg"><br><br>  In order for the child not to lose the device, it is possible, for example, to provide a lace around the neck.  Not very aesthetically pleasing, but always at hand: there is a special mount for this on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/o-/2x/eko-2xpd9wxbazh7salxpiqftle.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Two modes of "power"</b> <br><br>  At home, the nebulizer can be connected directly to the network: there is a special cord included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/gu/mf/ivgumf7c9dcwz3q51nd5g_0ykg8.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, below is a compartment for two ‚Äúfinger‚Äù batteries, which makes this nebulizer truly mobile. <br><br>  <b>No complicated settings and settings</b> <br><br>  The nebulizer works very simply: just pour the solution into a special container: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/of/wn/rq/ofwnrqfh7kmosbbb1w8331mxsxc.jpeg"><br><br>  Then attach one of the complete attachments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/7m/h9/gi7mh9nmsarbdaufqxgqtnmxqfa.jpeg"><br><br>  Then click on the button above: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/4e/dm/kd4edm_b_urolynsa5vantg6zxw.jpeg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gif 2 MB</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ga/xx/l-/gaxxl-6v_gfnrluc3kqe5t1a4ru.gif"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  The nebulizer is a practical device that may well be in every home as a means of treating and preventing respiratory diseases. <br><br>  Despite all the idealization, you don‚Äôt need to use it yourself and at your discretion: the doctor prescribes the therapy, but he also selects the drug for inhalation. <br><br>  Compact mesh nebulizers compare favorably with their cumbersome competitors: they can be taken with you, which is especially important for people with chronic diseases.  Plus, these nebulizers do not occupy space at home. <br><br>  The Glenmark nebulizer is made for them by the medical company MicroBase, has all the necessary international and Russian certificates, is a medical device.  It is distinguished by its compact size, universal possibilities in terms of connectivity, user-friendly design and good equipment. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">ten%</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The cost of the Glenmark nebulizer is <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/nebulajzer-nebzmart-mbpn002.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dglenmark%26utm_campaign%3Dglenmark">3750 rubles</a> .
