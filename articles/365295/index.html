  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 non-obvious ways to use the endoscope</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I saw a review of the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/247156/">endoscope</a> and it seemed to me an interesting thing.  Having seen the <a href="http://dadget.ru/autors">program for authors from the company Dadzhet</a> , I decided to respond and try this dadjet on myself.  After all, really, look where you haven't looked before - what could be more exciting?  Of course, we will not get into the macrocosm, but it is possible to look around the corner of everyday life.  So, 20 non-obvious ways to use the endoscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf8/54a/3c4/cf854a3c4aff442b8dccdad945fb33db.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The Hive <br>  Have you seen what a beehive looks like from the inside?  Not with sleeping and calm bees, but the usual life of bees?  And take a look!  The chances of being bitten are noticeably less, but still it is worthwhile to attend to a beekeeper's suit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/611/40c/2b9/61140c2b94124f3aa6fd984f9c94fe86.jpg">

      2. Well <br>  Do you remember the story about the Kola Superdeep?  Then at the twelve-kilometer depth they lowered the microphone and heard heart-rending screams.  And what if you drop the camera there?  Many cottages have a borehole, and some drillers even lower the camera to control drilling.  Using your own endoscope, you can do it yourself, since the ‚ÄúVideomaster PRO‚Äù model is endowed with a slot for microSD cards. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKxCERSOjwU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjqx0uXQdhVpUR_DTkg8bIsXtRtSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  3. Motor <br>  To look into the engine or estimate the thickness of the brake pads without disassembling the details is great.  You can see the valve, assess their condition and calculate further actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f60/649/624/f6064962422741698fdf40d84a7f0d20.gif"><br><br>  4. Ice fishing <br>  The length of the flexible leg of the endoscope is 1 meter.  In most cases, you can look into the hole with such a camera and evaluate the under-ice world for upcoming fishing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0f/a96/459/f0fa964594224e7bbfbc002df88b8f9d.jpg"><br><br>  5. Medieval labyrinth <br>  In Europe, the medieval attraction with a maze of shrubs, which are grown above human height for several heads, is still popular.  Of course, you can use the prompts, call Manmarensi (see ‚ÄúThree in a boat, not counting dogs‚Äù) or set up camp in the hope that someone will stumble on you, but there is an easier way.  It is enough to lift the endoscope and look around, in the manner of a periscope. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUmrAXelA9o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4YY16UCQATXRaVnHRqExChrh4jA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  6. Look around the corner <br>  How often do you need to look around the corner and go unnoticed.  You can use a mirror, but do you often have a mirror with you if you are not a girl or do not carry a girl's makeup bag?  In addition, the mirror can be unmasked, but the little black camera on the background of asphalt is almost imperceptible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/e58/864/6f6e58864f64425d8a938de2a574f627.jpg"><br><br>  7. Paintball or airsoft <br>  Of course, such a competition involves the strategy and tactics of the team.  In addition, ambushes or observation posts may well be organized.  And here the compact camera will help, as it is impossible by the way: you can observe from any natural or artificial shelter without the threat of being hit by a ball. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c0/75b/c6e/1c075bc6ec704e63b82872af03cb4c25.jpg"><br><br>  8. Look out of the trench <br>  If you happen to be in a trench, then you really want to hope that in your hands there will be no real weapon and the threat of someone‚Äôs life is not foreseen.  But in training or paramilitary games, as a trump card, you can use this endoscope as a periscope.  And the endoscope will be much less noticeable standard periscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b16/6e7/9f5/b166e79f546545efa0c84188befa8620.jpg"><br><br>  9. Thumbnail <br>  There is a whole world of people fond of miniatures.  They make copies of real houses with real wiring, furniture, and even books the size of a nail.  But a tour of such a house can only be in real life.  Thanks to the endoscope, it is possible to direct and shoot an entire film from a small world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ad/5ba/da7/7ad5bada730445a8a788890a4127e170.jpg"><br><br>  10. Let's play doctor? <br>  Down with smiles from your faces and think: what does the doctor see when you, with your mouth wide open and tongue sticking out, say ‚ÄúAAAAA‚Äù?  If really interesting, then it can even be removed on video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/763/64b/0f8/76364b0f85974e189265112f3ddf3577.jpg"><br><br>  11. Upskirt <br>  Peeping behind girls in skirts on escalators, and even photographing, is quite popular among the Japanese.  Being seen in this event almost guarantees a slap in the face, but if you stand at a distance of a meter, then the chances of a bad event invariably decrease.  We are not agitating in any way, but the Japanese are such Japanese! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/696/b67/14c/696b6714c6ed40098e2171c6836bb335.jpg"><br><br>  12. If you have a dog ... <br>  If you have a pet, then standing in the stalls and extracting another ball from under the sofa or from under the chair will be quite a common thing.  But we must remember that it is difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially when it is not there.  Therefore, it is worth looking under the furniture with the help of an extension camera with light before you climb into the dusty bins with your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f62/c6b/166/f62c6b1669ee440697068e5f0f3df956.jpg"><br><br>  13. Underwater Odyssey <br>  Surely, many watched the Cousteau Underwater Odyssey.  How interesting it was to dive with the team into the underwater world and observe the behavior of sea creatures: how weightless and graceful they hover in the water.  An aquarium is an artificial underwater world recreated in a small volume of a house.  So why not do the same shooting.  If a simple observation of fish calms, then how nice it will be to put a live video on the desktop computer screen with a picture from your own aquarium.  On the USB stick in 32 GB, by the way, quite volume video for several working days will be located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a2/5f1/060/9a25f1060fc24d2f87f0bba9a4a80cac.jpg"><br><br>  14. Have you heard how thrushes sing? <br>  Pets can be not only domestic, but also close to people.  Children will certainly be interested in how chicks develop in a self-built nesting box.  That's just to disturb the birds with the constant presence of man is not worth it.  A small camera will easily pass into the opening of the birdhouse and show what is happening inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/ba4/8f4/cf7ba48f449642c89af2f4365f7a8eda.jpeg"><br><br>  15. Another useless gift <br>  Who has not yet been given useless gifts in a large and beautiful box?  We unpack them, turn the knickknack in our hands and put it on the shelf as another dust collector.  But it is enough to make a small cut in the wrapping paper and insert the camera into the box in order to understand whether it is worth unpacking or if someone can peredarit ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/add/9a8/bdbadd9a8bf5433a8d6af51082640a1b.jpg"><br><br>  16. When there is a bounce <br>  Often, as the weather changes, not only the joints of people prone to rheumatism begin to creak, but the plastic panels in the car creak and thunder.  To understand what is shaking there, sometimes it is not enough to remove the panel and see - it is better to do it in motion.  This is where the compact camera on the leg and help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd2/bd3/867/dd2bd3867b3b443d83310e50c06ffd23.JPG"><br><br>  17. Keys in the gutter or elevator shaft <br>  It happens that a big trouble happens and the keys fall into the elevator shaft or end up under the drain grate.  You can try to raise the lattice or call the lifter and wait for it, hoping for an early arrival, but the ‚ÄúVideo Master PRO‚Äù endoscope can be equipped with a magnet or a hook ‚Äî just penetrate the slot of the camera and find the necessary keys, and then - the matter of technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/ed0/82f/60bed082f2534e7aa7a6c592bc2f3320.jpg"><br><br>  18. soap bubble <br>  Have you seen a bubble from the inside in the bright sun?  Patterned play will be especially attractive if you take a photo from inside of such a bubble - the benefit of the camera is not afraid of moisture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d7/b09/a4b/6d7b09a4bc434541a45f6e94068170c5.jpg"><br><br>  19. High neighbor <br>  If you happen to get to the concert of your favorite artist, then it may well be that a rather tall person will appear in front of you who will close the entire review.  You can sit on his neck if you are a beautiful girl, otherwise a tall neighbor may not appreciate the joke.  Raise the camera above the crowd and record the historical event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f73/6d1/996/f736d19969f4437783c3316c51075595.jpg"><br><br>  20. Endless traffic jam <br>  In urban traffic, watching movies, making suggestions, perhaps even giving birth.  But the most interesting is in front, where there is an answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhy are we standing?‚Äù.  We raise the ‚Äúperiscope‚Äù, bring the picture closer and rejoice that only 100 meters and 2 hours are left until the end of the traffic jam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f66/9fb/eed/f669fbeedb4449888bc1b079b031501d.jpg"><br><br>  Once I happened to collect a nested doll from a VCR that was connected to a digital camera that was connected to a computer in order to digitize old tapes.  Also this endoscope " <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/endoskop-pro/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_term%3Dvideomaster-pro%26utm_content%3Dendoskop-pro%26utm_campaign%3Dendoskop-pro">Videomaster PRO</a> " found non-standard use.  And what non-standard ways of using video and equipment in general did you have to invent? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365295/</a></p>
