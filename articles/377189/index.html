At MWC-2015 was presented a lot of interesting gadgets and technologies - perhaps no less than at CES-2015. <br><br>  Telecom operators, mobile device manufacturers, wearable gadget developers - all showed something of their own.  But, as always, among the multitude of devices shown at this event, there were several devices, which we simply cannot pass by.  Here are these devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  LG Watch Urbane LTE </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ad/688/9c5/6ad6889c55a5b44b2a83f6ad8984759d.jpg" width="600">

      The company LG, it seems, seriously fascinated by smart watches.  And the developers from LG were able to create a unique device that can be called universal.  First, the operating system for the LG Watch Urbane LTE is webOS, not Android Wear. <br><br>  Secondly, the battery capacity is 700 mAh - this is the maximum indicator at the moment among almost all models of smart watches of the past and this year. <br><br>  The clock configuration also includes 1 GB of RAM, which for such devices is also the maximum at the moment.  In addition, there is an LTE module that turns the watch into a self-sufficient mobile device, a miniature smartphone. <br><br>  The user can make video calls, ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù translate foreign speech and arrange video conferencing. <br><br>  By the way, despite the name, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/predstavlena-lte-versiya-lg.html">LG Watch Urbane LTE</a> is not so much in common with the LG Watch Urbane, which, in turn, are slightly improved version of the LG G Watch R. <br><br><h3>  Round Runcible Smartphone Watch </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/cef/0a3/a29cef0a38d31d3d9881578fc8dc153e.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  This device is difficult to classify.  Just because it looks like several devices at once.  This smartphone, and smart watches, and pocket watches.  The case of a round-shaped device is very unusual - there are practically no such devices on the market (with the exception of smaller smart-watches). <br><br>  Runcible is equipped with a separate lid - straight as your great-grandfather's pocket watch.  Now the cover is wooden, but the developers promise to create covers from other materials, including bronze, leather, and even ceramics. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pAcw28MRMH0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhih_SEanp2Rg4Ja98L4nEjOYsZEqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Developers bind the functionality of the device to its form.  For example, rotating the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/mwc-2015-runcible-umnye-chasy-smartfon-ot-kompanii-monohm.html">Runcible</a> around its axis, you can control the zoom of the camera. <br><br>  The operating system used here is Firefox OS.  So far, there are no details about the configuration of the device, as its price is also unknown.  But it is already clear that the gadget is something new in the market of wearable devices. <br><br><h3>  Kyocera Phone with Screen - Solar Battery </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQXW8B_EklU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-WBl-nnrmbJ428qhojcP9Qmt9Iw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The fact that the batteries in the phones are discharged faster than the user would like, we all know.  You have to charge them quite often, but not the fact that at the right moment the socket will be at hand.  And the company Kyocera <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/new-technology/kompaniya-kyocera.html">introduced a new type of screen</a> , which also serves as a solar battery. <br><br>  The transparent layer in the display, just 0.1 mm thick, is called Wysips Crystal.  This material converts solar energy into electrical energy.  Performance - at the level of 5 mW / cm2, which, of course, is not enough to fully charge the battery.  But in any case, at least a little to replenish energy reserves is quite possible - for this purpose such a display is intended. <br><br><h3>  Yi Action Camera </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d24/c4c/d28/d24c4cd2869990e1ff4f12b9aac55d43.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br>  The Chinese company Xiaomi creates a lot of interesting, practical and inexpensive devices.  Not so long ago, the company distinguished itself by the release of the ultra-low-cost fitness tracker Xiaomi Mi Band. <br><br>  And now the Chinese have released a camera for extreme lovers, the functionality and configuration of which exceeds the GoPro Hero, and the price is lower by half.  So, the cost of this device is only $ 64. <br><br>  In this case, the device can be immersed to a depth of 40 meters, the matrix here is 16 MP, and the weight of the device is only 72 grams.  The developers also provided the user with a large amount of 64 GB of available memory. <br><br>  Finally, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/fitness/mwc-2015-kompaniya-xiaomi.html">Yi Action Camera</a> is equipped with a wireless module, so that the device can be controlled from a smartphone or tablet, via Bluetooth. <br><br>  As they wrote on Geekah, immediately after the introduction of this camera, the GoPro stock collapsed by almost 5%.  And this is not surprising. <br><br><h3>  HTC GRIP </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/a2a/a48/2d8a2aa48f415ccc2b59df22e59277d4.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  Fitness bracelet from the Taiwanese company HTC, first of all, draws attention to the fact that this is the first wearable device from HTC.  According to rumors, the company has been working on something new since last fall, and now, finally, everyone has seen this device. <br><br>  The functionality of the bracelet is quite interesting.  So, the developers installed five different sensors at once, which allow not only to calculate the number of calories burned or measure the distance traveled, but also to analyze the owner's activity in different parts of the terrain and in different modes (bike, jogging, walking). <br><br>  Plus, the bracelet can give advice to the user, contributing to a more active workout.  The program is developed by professional athletes, doctors and fitness instructors. <br><br>  Issue price - $ 199. <br><br><h3>  Lg magic mirror </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a7/fd0/edb/6a7fd0edba84eda48a96973727961da5.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  This device can no longer be classified as "wearable", but it is impossible not to mention it.  The fact is that this is not just a mirror, but a smart device with Android OS on board.  You can control the device with ordinary touches - the surface of the mirror is touch-sensitive <br><br>  And the device itself, ‚Äúlooking‚Äù at the user, can evaluate the state of his skin, recommending that some elements of his mode be changed (if he, of course, has a mode).  The results of the "inspection" mirror gives in the form of points, assessing the general condition of the person. <br><br>  Probably, it can be programmed somehow and that every morning it says to its owner that he is ‚Äúsweeter, sweeter and whiter‚Äù.  In the meantime, unfortunately, this function does not exist. <br><br>  In general, the exhibition from Barcelona this year can be evaluated on a solid "top five".  A large number of excellent devices were presented, many of which we expected.  In addition to wearable devices, manufacturers also showed new flagships in the world of smartphones, productive tablets, innovative products of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù category (one LG's mirror is worth something).  It is hoped that all these cool gadgets will soon get on the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377189/</a></p>
