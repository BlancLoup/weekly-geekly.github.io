Of course, without HTML / CSS!  Knowledge of HTML / CSS is the basis for further study of server programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand one of the main tools of the layout designer, programmer or designer.  After studying HTML - Hypertext Markup Language - you can create a static web page or website.  CSS language - cascading style sheets - will allow you to design your site according to any designer's idea.  The course "HTML / CSS. Basics of creating websites" from GeekBrains is built on the principle of learning through practice: students create an online store site and during all the work on the project they study the properties and possibilities of using HTML / CSS.  After completing the course, each student will create a ready first case for the future portfolio. </p><br><p>  Lesson 1. Basic concepts in web development <br>  Lesson 2.

This is the basic foundation that serves as the basis for creating modern websites and is the first step to explore other programming technologies for the global Internet.  Any significant organization has its own representation in the global network.  This is a requirement of time and a market requirement.  Without taking into account the modern realities of the world, it is impossible to achieve competitiveness and therefore success.  It is a bunch of HTML / CSS that allows you to impose layouts, create and edit static sites.  The programming technology studied in this course allows you to lay a long-term basis and gain a foothold in this area in the labor market. </p><br><p>  Lesson 1.

One of the most interesting and popular tools for creating easily scalable network applications is Node.js, a server-side implementation of the JavaScript programming language based on the V8 engine.  Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl, the project is currently being developed by Joyent, a major cloud computing provider in the United States.  The Node.js server environment consists of 80% of C / C ++ code (core) and 20% of the JavaScript API.  CommonJS basic principles and specifications also apply.  This course is designed for those who already know and use JavaScript on the client well and want to learn how to program in JavaScript on the server side. </p><br><p>  Lesson 1.

He was introduced to Facebook in 2013, and very quickly gained popularity.  Today, it is used by many well-known companies, including Instagram, Airbnb, Ebay, Netflix, Yahoo and others.  This course is designed for novice front-end developers who have mastered the JavaScript language.  On the course, we will master one of the most popular libraries for professional development in the field of frontend - ReactJS.

And for many applications, this solution becomes MySQL.  Proven on many popular and large projects, this DBMS is developing and is one of the main solutions for organizing databases.  The course is built on the example of MySQL DBMS, and will allow step by step to master the process of designing data and working with them.  You will also get acquainted with other popular databases, but before taking this course, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the video course "database basics". </p><br><p>  Lesson 1.
