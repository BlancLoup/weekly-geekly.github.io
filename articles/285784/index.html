We are going to summarize for you the main causes of poor customer service. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Long wait for a response </h4><br>  Crawling through a tangled IVR, and then hanging on the line for a few minutes while waiting for an employee to answer is humiliating, at least.  Your call is very important for us - are you kidding me?  With e-mails, the situation is no better - often the feeling that they fly into the expanses of the worldwide network and disappear in the mist, and not reaching the addressee.

      <b>Why?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Lack of staff</b> to provide customer support is one of the biggest problems.  Companies save on staff, but lose customers who have not phoned and have not received a response.  For small companies, it is disastrous.  And if most recently the giants could afford it, now ignoring the trend of quality service, attention to the customer even monopolists will be more difficult. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Lack of system for handling requests.</b>  The call distribution system is incorrectly configured, and the letters are all rolled into one pile without sorting and prioritizing. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>There is no interaction between departments.</b>  The solution to the client‚Äôs problem is not only the support service.  The process when a client‚Äôs call wanders from department to department must be strictly regulated, otherwise the customer risks never getting a response. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Lack of help </h4><br>  To explain the problem many times to different people is not the most pleasant thing.  Switched to one, second, third.  As a result, no one helped and sent a complaint to the office.  The fewer employees involved in resolving the issue, the happier the client. <br><br>  <b>Why?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Low-skilled staff at the start.</b>  The support service is usually considered as a starting point - often neither experience nor education is needed, it is enough to have no speech defects and to be able to type on a computer.  As a result, the client often has the fair feeling that they ‚Äútake everything from the street‚Äù.  In my opinion, when applying for a job instead of a meaningless interview, ‚Äúwho do you see yourself in 2 years after in our company?‚Äù Is enough to ask <br>  1) write a dictation, but rather a mini essay; <br>  2) utter the words "calls", "funds", "agreement"; <br>  3) solve the practical case. </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Bad learning.</b>  In large companies, a week or two training before you go into battle is a standard.  But even here they make fatal mistakes: <br>  - theory and not enough time are given practical tasks. <br>  - important moments are left for "self-study" <br>  - no psychological training </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Lack of discretion.</b>  An employee on the first line of support, as a rule, ‚Äúdecides nothing‚Äù.  He has a script from which he will not move, even if they put a muzzle on his temple.  Support ceases to be support in this situation.  The client understands that they will not solve a non-standard problem, is angry and calls the employee a ‚Äústupid little dummy‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Impolite and indifferent employees </h4><br>  - Here is your help, hold, but no, lunch. <br>  - But you already stretched it to me. <br>  - Lunch. <br>  - Yes, she is in your hand. <br>  - Young man, I close the window. <br><br>  <b>Why?</b> <br><br>  <b>Motivation problem.</b>  I worked in three support services and nowhere ‚Äî anywhere did they say what my meaning is mission?  We were told that the client is important, everything is for the client, we are a customer-oriented company.  We were forced to work according to the script, frightening us with bad grades and lower premiums.  No one has ever said - guys, you are professionals, you do a great job, learn and be the best, so that everyone will be equal to you.  Tell that this is not just a job, that this is a vocation, that only a filled person can give something to another - employees must work consciously. <br><br>  Demotivates the lack of evaluation criteria, monotonous mechanical work, when you can not express yourself, the lack of prospects, additional training.  Even if your company does not have a career opportunity, no one bothers you to ‚Äúbleed up‚Äù employees.  Arrange a Russian language lesson - let, finally, learn to put a comma, training in psychology - to better understand people and know how to work with different types of clients.  Professional development motivates and improves self-satisfaction, and a happy employee will make your customers happy. <br><br>  Moving from thinking about the reasons to the solution, we conceived a tool that will set up the work of the support service and help companies and customers get closer.  We are glad to announce that he is ready in five minutes.  Very soon we will tell and show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285784/</a></p>
