    <h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Actually, the story is.  We have done hardcore Java conferences several times.  The main feature of the program is that we decided to throw out the smoothies, marketing, management, ejails and other things overboard, and leave only the technical part.  Because then startups come who tell about monetization - and it seems that it is about easy money.  We are focused on middle and senior-developers. <br><br>  The conferences were successful, because after it turned out that there would be no water, the developers shared information with their colleagues. <br><br>  Last year, there was a desire to assemble a mobile conference in the same spirit of hardcore and technical reports only.  There was the first "Mobius", so literally the other day, on Friday, the second one will begin. <br><br>  The first was with our mistakes.  And to fix them, we started working in December. <br><br><h4>  What worked, what did not </h4><br>  <b>Firstly,</b> it quickly became clear that it was not enough to attract developers from Oracle, Samsung and other large companies.  It seemed to us from the old memory that a big brand attracts listeners - but not everything is so simple.  Developers come to listen to what the speaker will tell. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, the</b> program we got was not very smooth.  There were brilliant reports, they were very weak.  I was responsible for the content, and I realized that I needed to change the approach a little.  To this end, since December I began to simply listen to each report before taking a person into the program. <br><br>  What did the review report look like?  They simply contacted a potential speaker on Skype or met in person, and the speaker showed his presentation and told to several reviewers (there were sometimes up to 5-6 people), what and how.  Among the listeners there was necessarily a live developer who is interested in the topic of the report, and in which he really works, that is, he understands.  For us, the depth of development and the ability to convey all this is important.  5 reports fell off at the ‚Äúsend theses‚Äù stage - they simply did not fit into our vision of hardcore.  6 more left after viewing such speeches - alas, either not very well chosen content, or the developer does not know how to tell.  This happens more often than it seems. <br><br>  Here, for example, was one cool techie - came to tell you about a cool topic with Rock on Android.  We had 4-5 meetings: the material is simply the golden mountains, but it did not work out to select one topic for the report.  It was a pity, because the experience was really good - but it wasn‚Äôt possible to explain to whom and what it didn‚Äôt work in the report - we tried for a long time and eventually parted.  Alas, it happens that the speech is not yet ready. <br><br>  Or Denis Kretov came to me at the beginning of 2014, he said that he wanted to make a report on the development of Xamarin and Azure.  Well, new man, you need to meet.  I went to his office, he was also very cool in the design, showed a good demo.  But, alas, simply could not explain.  Therefore, I refused him.  Here it should be noted that he came to St. Petersburg, entered the university, and while he was a student, he had to earn money.  Now he is the owner of his company.  Surrender is not used to.  Asked for detailed feedback from me.  And I am glad to try :) Then throughout the year he spoke at three conferences, wrote to me, showed presentations - we discussed them.  And Denis shook himself all this.  Well, in December 2014 he came to us again with the experience and understanding of what and how.  He also passed special training for 16 hours for the speakers, where he was constantly corrected and taught.  Will perform on Friday.  The day before yesterday was another run, I now know for sure that I will not be ashamed of him. <br>  Here is what Denis wrote in his review of the training: <br><blockquote>  On April 3, I am going to speak at the Mobius conference with the report ‚ÄúiBeacon in payment solutions‚Äù.  The organizers - great lads - not only take care of the topics of the reports to be interesting, but also organize free trainings for the speakers in order to improve their public speaking skills.  I was at one of these trainings and I can say that it was great.  For 2 days from morning to evening, our group, under the leadership of the leading coach of the school of oratory, Vladimir Brik, studied and practiced the skills necessary for successful public speaking.  For two days we performed material on blocks in comic performances: how to prepare for the performance, how to start and end the performance, how to confidently stand on the stage, how to perform if there are several of you on the stage.  Worked with voice, posture and gestures.  Personally, I can say with confidence that in two days I had a holistic picture of how to conduct presentations, and some technicians allowed me to stay more confident.  I plan to demonstrate my knowledge this coming Friday.  See you at Mobius! <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Third,</b> yes, for the selected speakers, we did a special training.  I once attended a free training from Vladimir Brik (actor of the theater ‚ÄúShelter of the comedian‚Äù and cinema), and he simply fascinated me with his desire to learn and the depth of study of the material.  As a result, we bought training for 2 days, collected 12 speakers (who wanted to learn), and drove everyone away by oratory.  Ordinary conference attendees, of course, will not even recognize this, but the quality of reports will increase.  And this is important to me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/1e8/3db/52d1e83db2f7d9cd2c2704c0d1a28ffe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From the training <br><br>  <b>Fourthly,</b> we had a lot of remarks about the security roundtable about the previous program.  The most striking example - Vladimir Ivanov came and said, they say, why do you have such a light report?  Nothing hardcore.  Sons in general.  Want to do a normal?  Well, I caught him at the word, and now he also speaks on Friday.  You can come and troll, and then say that his report is something very light. <br><br>  <b>Fifth,</b> as collected.  It is easy to find people from companies in general, but this is if you need comrades who are connected with public relations.  But specifically to pull the developers - this is the whole story, and it is more difficult.  They relied on those who were interesting at the first conference, asked all the participants, whom they would advise, personally went to all the development leaders on the forums and in the near-repository discussions, asked, invited.  As it seems to me now, the program is very tight. <br><br>  <b>Sixth,</b> a dense program always has a big problem - I want to get on two reports at the same time.  When in one room Android, in another iOS, and in the third - the framework for games, in general, you can decide.  But when the reports are not so divided polar, I want to see everything at once.  Therefore, we write a video and post it to all participants after the conference.  And after another six months, we simply open at least half of the reports for free access.  Here, by the way, is the past.  People watch and say - would you like to tell how it evolved?  I contact, call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9f/6b8/ac0/e9f6b8ac0187acbe3de2ff381a3a6687.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From Mobius‚Äôs Past <br><br><h4>  Come visit </h4><br>  The conference begins tomorrow, tickets for direct participation and remote (broadcast) is still there.  Drop in, and if something goes wrong - honestly, I will return the money.  Did not like it - write to me, I will cry, but I will return the fee for the ticket and start digging, which was not the case. <br><br>  For now, I‚Äôll tell you briefly what I managed to assemble into the program.  <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/">There are official announcements here</a> , but I would like to run informally, like this kind of advice in a human way, what is interesting and to whom. <br><br>  <b>Block 1.</b> Matvey Malkov from 2GIS talks about reactive Android applications.  He is, if not the coolest on this topic in Russia, then one of the coolest for sure - few have such mobile expertise.  Nearby Anton Keks reads about Chromecast - ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù in HDMI, which transmits a signal to a computer and back.  Just such a good gikovaty report on the piece of iron.  And in parallel, Alexei Zinoviev from TAMTEK talks about embedding maps in Android.  He knows what problems they get out of when the number of users grows, the details of the licenses, he himself wrote the pairing with the backend of such cards, released applications for millions of installations with quick maps. <br><br>  <b>Block 2.</b> First, a round table on security - topics that will not be on the reports, the very place where you can fight with an expert.  Virtually.  You can learn firsthand about very topical issues.  Next to Philip Keks talks about the total coverage of the application with unit tests.  I listened to him with interest, although the topic is a bit not mine, very cool.  Parallel SmartTV and Alexander Korshak - shows that writing under the TV is easier than it seems, and will show its commercial cases.  Will tell you how to write a product for the evening and test.  There will be a live demo on the device. <br><br>  <b>Block 3.</b> Mikhail Samarin from Finnish FUTURICE will talk about how difficult it is for developers to make applications that come out of the box with firmware.  He has been doing this for about 9 years.  Next to it is Yury Leonychev about working in a team that has committed to work on ensuring the interaction of all Yandex applications with a passport.  It is clear that a purely Yandex central authorization point, the security of user certificates and handing over keys are very few people needed, so a report on how to make 80% of this house on your knee with a fairly high level of reliability.  Plus a couple of patterns of interception of traffic from the topical.  And in parallel, Victor Korsun from ZEPTOLAB will show that under the hood of their framework.  Here he wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ZeptoLab/blog/254009/">few details</a> next. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97b/328/3b1/97b3283b1aa9cd586077bee5c9d313da.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From Mobius‚Äôs Past <br><br>  <b>Block 4.</b> Yuri Buyanov from Odnoklassniki burns about how to make the development process economical by purely technical means.  Nearby Andrei Belenko from NOWSECURE cuts the truth about security on iOS.  He has Citibank, Lockheed (half of the US defense) and many other interesting offices in his clients.  And in parallel, another report from Zepta - already about the smooth animation, which they disassemble from FLA-files. <br><br>  <b>Block 5.</b> Alexander Smirnov will talk about debugging highload applications;  if you have a lot of installs - definitely worth listening to.  Nearby Vladimir Ivanov with examples of how a malicious program can climb on your application, where are the holes.  They, at Kaspersky Lab, have a commercial product that they sell.  And on the report he tells how it works and how to do it in the same way on your own and to caste.  And next to iBeacon in payment solutions - Denis shows an interesting chip with demos and a simple application on the framework.  In the demo there will be a proximity detector that pulls the ID out of the cloud and cocks the screen with the cost. <br><br>  <b>Block 6.</b> Kirill Bessonov from the bank talks about analytics: they bring about 90% of the clients from the phones, without them visiting the bank‚Äôs website from the desktop.  Since these are their grandmothers, it takes a lot of effort to understand what was missing, where it was not, where it was abandoned.  Pick very cool.  Consider the three frameworks, show the pros and cons.  Next to Ivan Kinash talk about the security of Android and ARM TrustZone, a lot of good architectural things.  In the third hall about the Corona SDK, Sergey Lalov (this is an alternative to Unity) explains and shows himself the Crown propagandist, but the report will tell you what advantages and disadvantages and when to choose which framework. <br><br>  <b>And the last block number 7.</b>  Alexey Rybakov talks about the development for wearable devices.  Weak, small and functionally cropped gadgets.  The firmware is different, the developers are different, but you need to squeeze the maximum performance out of each device - this is the general approach.  There will be a couple of devices and demos to touch.  Next to Misha Dudarev about the survival of Android and iOS applications in untrusted environments.  If anyone knows, this dude wrote the jCardSim, which won one of the most prestigious awards in the Java world Duke's Choice Award.  He knows a lot about protecting applications from reverse engineering.  Will give practical advice on how to protect your application.  By the way, on the test run we had a not-so-strong such dispute over the content of the Misha Report, when Dima Evdokimov in principle disagreed with some theses.  It was a really exciting test run!  And in the third hall - NoSQL for mobile platforms, interesting things about optimization. <br><br>  In the expert zone throughout the whole case, the security <s>guards drink vodka,</s> sit at the tables and communicate with everyone in a row.  We had a lot of feedback that we need such a zone for hemispheric conversations, so we did see.  It seems to be angrier and more fun than you can talk on a public report. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254699/</a></p>
