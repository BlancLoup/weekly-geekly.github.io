  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple may acquire Yahoo ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rumor has it that Yahoo continues to look for a major partner to sell its Internet business ... <br>  Microsoft has already tried to conduct <a href="http://vz.ru/economy/2007/5/4/80773.html">official negotiations on the acquisition of the Internet corporation Yahoo</a> , but did not agree on the price.  And after that, <a href="http://net.compulenta.ru/339677/">Microsoft announced that it wants to become the leader of the</a> online advertising market, having pressed Google and Yahoo on it. <br>  The financial position of Yahoo over the past years is gradually deteriorating.  In 2006, the company's shares fell 38%, and in December Yahoo was forced to conduct a major restructuring.  In the summer of Yahoo CEO Terry Semel, who led the company since May 2001, <a href="http://business.compulenta.ru/336122/">transferred his credentials to Jerry Yangu</a> , one of the founders of Yahoo.  At the same time, <a href="http://net.compulenta.ru/340252/">Google continues to increase its market share</a> .  The approach used by Yahoo is different from that of Google.  The Yahoo site is a portal with a lot of different services and their <a href="http://www.nyquistcapital.com/2006/07/31/yahoo-vs-google/">services are used by a huge number of people</a> , but at the same time Google manages to earn a lot more money on the Internet (in particular, on contextual advertising) and Google's net profit is steadily growing up, unlike Yahoo! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, new large players appear in the Internet business, such as Sony and <a href="http://internet.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml%3F2007/12/05/278140">Nokia, which are going to compete with Google, Apple and Microsoft</a> .  It is curious that in the above news, Yahoo is not even considered a competitor for the Nokia Internet project.  Although Yahoo is actively involved in selling digital music (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/12962.html">‚ÄúYahoo! announced the purchase of Musicmatch‚Äù</a> , or <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/23184.html">‚ÄúYahoo! offers free-to-copy music‚Äù</a> ). <br>  The competition in the Internet business is intensifying to the extent that even such a player as Yahoo!  may not be enough space. <br>  Six months ago, there were rumors that <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/26750.html">"The merger of Microsoft and Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/26750.html">- just a matter of time "</a> i.e.  at Yahoo!  so concerned about finding a partner to grow their business, they even <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/26741.html">agree to be friends with Microsoft</a> .  Although for Yahoo this ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù can mean complete dissolution in the giant arms of Microsoft and in the future non-existence (I mean death).  Apparently in Yahoo!  are becoming afraid of Google, so that they are ready to sell to anyone, just for a good price.  In this case, someone will buy them for sure, the only question is time and price!  So who can buy Yahoo? <br><br>  Steve Jobs 7 years ago announced that Apple will actively work in the Internet business: "Steve Jobs, founder and CEO of Apple Computer, made a statement that the company will now not only produce computers and software products, but also will develop a wide range of Internet services on its updated website apple.com.  Jobs predicts that the company will enter the top ten most successful Internet companies in the coming years.  He emphasized that the company will focus its services on Apple Macintosh users.  This will require the latest software company, which is significantly different from the general trend to provide services to users of different platforms.  Apple also announced an investment of $ 200 million in US Internet service provider Earthlink and urged its customers to use this company to connect to the Internet. "(CNews.ru, 01/06/2000). <br>  Today, <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/28568.html">Apple.com is nearing the top ten most visited</a> network resources, and the iTunesStore and AppleStore online stores are the business from which Apple makes enough profit to get a taste for online money.  Moreover, some analysts consider the <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/29043.html">Internet service iTunes - the basis of all current and future success</a> of Apple. <br>  The iTunesStore is even a very attractive business for both Yahoo !, Google and even Microsoft (this can be seen from the <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/26815.html">statements of Microsoft head Steve Ballmer</a> ). <br>  Apple actively cooperates with various Internet companies, but it has the closest relations with Google (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/26099.html">‚ÄúWe are waiting for new joint projects of Apple and Google‚Äù</a> ).  One of the options for effective cooperation was discussed in the article <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/27148.html">‚ÄúApple and Google will create a new .Mac service?‚Äù</a> .  There were even rumors about the merger of these companies, for example, in the <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/25424.html">speech of the head of Google, Eric Schmidt, at Macworld Expo 2007</a> , even the words ‚ÄúIf we are united, what will the joint company be called?‚Äù  Applegoog? " <br>  When you merge these companies, Google managers will obviously become the head of the united Applegoog, because  Today, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2007/10/19/271277">Google has peaked in the Internet business</a> and Google‚Äôs market value is ~ 1.5 times the cost of Apple Inc. <br>  <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:GOOG">Google Market Value (12/2007)</a> - 223,640 millions $ <br>  <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:AAPL">Apple Market Value (12/2007)</a> - 170,120 millions $ <br>  Google is an Internet giant and for it the classic Apple computer business may seem burdensome and just a waste of effort and money.  And Steve Jobs is clearly not going to fundamentally change his company and this approach obviously does not suit him.  For Apple, the Internet business is only part of the company, and it is viewed more as an advertising platform for its iron products, and of course Apple will not want to part with the release of Macintosh computers. <br>  In addition, the release of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/android/29533.html">the Google Android platform</a> for an Internet phone clearly introduces <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/28890.html">cooling between Apple &amp; Google</a> (with a paranoid attitude to secrets about their products, Steve Jobs can generally regard this as industrial espionage). <br>  But if Apple &amp; Google‚Äôs relationship is frustrated, then obviously Apple can get close to its other Internet business partner and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/web_2_0/29801.html">Web2.0-apps promotion,</a> and this is of course Yahoo! <br>  And in this regard, it becomes very interesting, the fact that <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/28346.html">Steve Jobs suddenly appeared at a meeting of Yahoo!</a>  After all, the unification of Apple &amp; Yahoo is possible under the terms of Apple‚Äôs leadership  Today, Apple ~ 5 times the cost of Yahoo: <br>  <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:AAPL">Apple Market Value (12/2007)</a> - 170,120 millions $ <br>  <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance%3Fq%3DNASDAQ:YHOO">Yahoo Market Value (12/2007)</a> - 34,250 millions $ <br>  And in Yahoo!  most likely will agree to a guide from Apple, because  In recent years, Apple has emerged as a developing company that has achieved very good financial results (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/articles/25216.html">‚ÄúFinancial romance: Apple 2007‚Äù</a> ).  For the opportunity to manage the combined company Apple may pay Yahoo shareholders in cash, which Apple accumulated enough.  And such a union would suit Steve Jobs very much.  In addition, Apple‚Äôs fairly democratic corporate culture should not fundamentally contradict Yahoo‚Äôs corporate culture; this combination of cultures would be much easier than combining with Microsoft, for example. <br>  And there remains only one question - the question of price.  Yahoo asks a lot of money ~ $ 50 billion, which of course no one is willing to pay for it (even the super-rich Microsoft).  But Steve Jobs is a man who knows how to find the right time and drop the price at an incredibly low price. It happened once when he bought <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/statements/14">Pixar in 1986 for only $ 10 million</a> .  Maybe today he will be able to buy <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/28730.html">Yahoo, well, let's say for $ 15 billion</a> + Apple shares :) <br><br>  PS: Who owns the companies under discussion today: <br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh%3Fs%3DAAPL">Apple Major Holders</a> ; <br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh%3Fs%3DYHOO">Yahoo Major Holders</a> ; <br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh%3Fs%3DGOOG">Google Major Holders</a> . </div>
