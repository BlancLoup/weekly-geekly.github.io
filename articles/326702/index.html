It is called "internship."  Today we want to tell you about 5 types of internships that are waiting for you on the path to good work. <br><br>  Get ready, it will not even run with obstacles - this is a test by Winda, Lyudmila Ivanovna and a coffee machine.  But at the end of the way you will receive a reward, as befits any decent IT-hero.  (spoiler: a link to a cool internship, that's it!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16b/ed9/b4a/16bed9b4a4924a6db2e035822199b088.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  # 1. Office Barista </h3><br>  The impossible happened - you found a dream job: made a cool resume, put your soul into a cover letter (all relatives appreciated!) And received an invitation for an interview.  A good recruiter, the conversation is taking shape and it seems that you are lucky: a friendly team of specialists, work with the use of Agile-methodologies, a head goes around from project budgets, understanding leadership and everything is cool.  You are accepted and happy.

      A trembling hand signs an offer for a two-week unpaid internship, but the main experience is the same!  The first working day and nobody will spoil your mood!  You meet the leader, ask for the task and hear: ‚ÄúHi!  Please bring some coffee.  That's all for now, you can take a walk. ‚Äù  ‚ÄúMaybe they are waiting for me to get comfortable?‚Äù - you think, but this goes on every day and all week.  At the weekend, even awkward to somehow relax. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/443/e32/88d/443e3288d1b342d8a3f7ec3e74eec9b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During your internship, you received more information from Instagram than you did in your entire life: as a classmate you got married, and your classmate brags about her cool work and her first salary.  You sat on all the chairs and even lay down on all the sofas.  Never in a life washed hands 3 times an hour.  Hmm.  It's time to shed a tear, forget about this office and run from there! <br><br><h3>  # 2. One for all </h3><br>  You were so convincing in the selection process that you were called for an internship.  Huge competition, but you are wearing a white shirt, your eyes are burning, and your hands are doing.  You prepared, read the business literature about how to become successful, studied time management.  And on the first day you step over the office threshold. <br><br><blockquote>  It's hard to say what went wrong, because you woke up at 23:46.  All subsequent days you are beating on endless tasks and demands - they are put before you by the people you see for the first time (seriously, does this company have so many employees?). </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c62/8f8/838/c628f88381004216878fc2f9d708119c.jpg"><br><br>  You have to clean someone's code that was written in shaggy 2003, then rake documents in dusty boxes, deal with safety certificates, for some reason, advise the legal department, drag furniture, and then talk with Lyudmila Ivanovna about which the university is still worth going to her son.  Well, in the evening stuck on Torrent, to download the movie boss.  You are on fire, everything is on fire.  In addition to your colleagues, who have already departed from the office at 17:56. <br><br>  For the first time in your life, you spend the night in a chair, eating cereal after a colleague and drinking the fifth power engineer with a single thought: ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù.  For what you are so well done.  Here for this. <br><br><h3>  3. Wrestler with Wi-Fi and Windows </h3><br>  Any experience is good.  And in general - it is needed right now.  And no matter how classmates laughed at you, you got a job as a sysadmin.  You all cursed when Windows 10 finally came out. I bet you never thought that installing software in a company with only 25 people would eat so much of your time and energy.  And you also naively did not take into account that every second employee would have questions about where to click and where they now have the file that they saved two weeks ago. <br><br>  You devote several hours a day, working as a psychotherapist, reassuring those who are sure that the data are forever absorbed by the evil system and they will never see their photos from their vacation in 2012 in Adler, and also will not go to Odnoklassniki. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/9da/386/99a9da386dd6408cbb5d76e510d09347.jpg"><br><br>  But the task ahead is even more difficult - you are pulling away, because this time you will have to install a new router.  Then came the day when Valeryanka will be used instead of coffee.  In the whole company. <br><br><h3>  # 4. Cleaning Master </h3><br>  Imagine the worst case in which you are not lucky at all.  The dean's office promised to send them to work practice at Microsoft, but something went wrong and now you wash the windows of your alma mater.  Carefully rinsing the cloth and scrolling the thought ‚Äúwhat am I doing here?‚Äù In your head, you wipe the walls, desks and sign every day in a piece of courteous deputy deed (after all, the grade for the practice in the diploma depends on it) and not a glass washer. <br><br><blockquote>  The only increase you can count on is work in the selection committee.  Here you will "communicate with customers", "check the paper" and with an important kind of stamp.  By the end of the summer, you don‚Äôt pay attention to the questions: ‚Äúwhat is the passing grade?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere to apply for, exactly on the budget?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd do you have a dormitory?‚Äù. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/48b/9d3/6b148b9d3f7145b8ae2619bb5dc1105a.jpg"><br><br>  Your nervous system atrophies from the same dialogues, applicants with a crowd of relatives will not cause laughter, and complete frustration in the prospects and only "salt to the wound" of your IT career. <br><br><h3>  # 5. Dream job: parallel universe </h3><br>  Internship dreams, friendly team, Linux users, Agile in business and code with comments - it seems that this is a parallel universe.  I can not believe that this happens to you (especially when you learned barista skills during your first internship).  Here you are not asked to install Windows on a Mac and there will be no pain from unlicensed software curves.  Victoria Petrovna from the accounting department in an outsourcing company, the project manager clearly sets tasks and distributes the work, and Friday night ends with a team trip to the bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/607/95d/a31/60795da31dc747308a339477ba1ad197.jpg"><br><br>  They ask you for an opinion about the project, tell you how the system works, and advise you to read useful books.  We do not know how you managed it, but you were in the right place.  Hold on to such an uncomfortable chair and such cool people around and knowledge that will stay with you for life. <br><br><h3>  Important advice and promised bonus: </h3><br>  Internship is what happens to each of us (or almost to each).  It's like a roller coaster, quest or thriller, which will bring experience.  What this experience will be and what emotions it will bring is up to you.  We know about the right place in which you are already at the right time.  Now opens a cool internship at the bank "Discovery".  Go <a href="https://go.open.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dit_intern">here on this link</a> and rather try your hand at any of the spheres represented there.  Themselves or with the team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326702/</a></p>
