My attention was attracted by the description of a new reality formed by 3D printing technology.  I quote:

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúTo understand the structure of the upcoming calls, I‚Äôll return a little to the sphere of production, because you need to understand that military technology is a consequence of production technology, and military organization is a consequence of a production organization ...‚Äù </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One cannot but agree with this statement.  Indeed, all military technology related to production.  And often they are easy to convert to civilian technology, and vice versa.  Moving on to the 3D printers themselves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed5/6c0/6d3/ed56c06d361dd97ff26141d78f0de486.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhat is a 3D printer?  Roughly speaking, this is a production in which there is no working class, there is no person as a participant in the copying process.  That is, there is a designer who designs on the computer what needs to be produced, and then we have a purely automatic process of manufacturing any quantity of this product.  If you can make an aircraft engine by spraying a laser out of composite materials, then naturally the task is to make any aircraft body from powder or aluminum alloy an order of magnitude less complicated.  The same with any other technique.  After some time, it will be possible to do the 3D printers themselves using 3D printers, and we will have not only direct automatic production, but also strategic automation of the entire production process, including the production of means of production ... " </blockquote><br><br>  On Habr√© already published an article on social and economic changes occurring in the new economy, where the basis of production - 3D printers.  In this article, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169719">habrahabr.ru/post/169719, the</a> author gave an analysis of the emerging new economic class "digital artisans", as he called them (I am more inclined to the name "class of post-industrial producers").  It was not by chance that he compared the new era with the Middle Ages, even called the class: ‚Äúdigital artisans‚Äù, who resemble their ‚Äúancestors‚Äù artisans.  Although the article is poorly affected by other classes of the new era.  If we talk, for example, about a new class of netocracy, then it looks like an aristocracy.  Although relations have a different technological and economic basis than in the Middle Ages, they are still similar in social terms. <br><br>  The author of the book ‚ÄúThe Post-Industrial Transition and the World War‚Äù goes further and gives not only social and economic analysis.  He describes in detail the changes now taking place in the field of military strategy and tactics, and what main contribution 3D printers make here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71e/800/69b/71e80069b0ebb86eb4ad5a140c3bc57a.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOnly large states, large corporations, large systems could be engaged in the production of military equipment in the 20th century.  Only 10 years have passed since the end of the 20th century - and we saw a completely different picture.  Today, any kid can put himself a 3D printer in the basement, and if his head works well, he will be able to design a UAV or some other nasty thing.  He can design it, but I can't even predict what he designs.  We see an opportunity for a private person, or some small group, to have their own production of cutting-edge military equipment.  Own production is not just military equipment, but extremely effective military equipment.  Adolf Aloizych had to build a giant underground plant, and today it is enough to have a 3d-printer in the basement ... " </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/191/33e/8ba/19133e8ba3298c81c8f35df1e73d6e18.jpg"><br><br>  What does this mean in practice?  Now corporatocracy is acquiring private armies around the world.  And states tremble with fear.  Syria, Libya - who is fighting there?  Private army of corporations.  And what happens with the advent of 3D printers?  Now any small innovative organization can bristle with its drones.  It is clear that monstro-like organizations, such as the state, will find themselves in the role of a hulking dinosaur who will die immediately when the war begins, as was the case with empires in World War I.  Who remains?  Corporatocracy, innovative communities that include ‚Äúdigital artisans‚Äù (post-industrial producers) and netocracy.  Over time, they will establish a balance of power.  Innovative communities themselves, in the opinion of the author of the book, will be located in enclave bases, where there will be a high-tech, environmentally friendly infrastructure.  The rest of the territory will arrive in a dilapidated and backward condition (direct analogy with the Middle Ages: castles and environs inhabited by illiterate peasants with relatively poor living conditions).  There is a possibility that almost every person will fly near his own drone.  Like a weapon situation in the United States, every citizen has the right to it.  Just as in Russia now with traumatic weapons.  Naturally, more advanced classes will be better protected, and will rarely crawl out of well-protected enclaves.  It will be like a fork and a bat with a peasant, compared to a sword or a nobleman‚Äôs sword.  And wherever you go, a drone with a camera and a weapon flies with you.  This my assumption intersects with Pelevin's novel "SNUFF".  Only UAVs guard exclusively the highest caste there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a31/098/afb/a31098afbf10f76230956c5180823602.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f8/c20/cfc/5f8c20cfc7e888bbc5bbc97c8b8e97b6.jpg"><br><br>  The author of the book continues to describe the military prospects for the use of UAVs printed on 3D printers in the basement or special enclave bases: <br><br><blockquote>  "A non-specialist in modern military technology in this place will be indignant:" The plant produced huge airplanes, and this is just some models, unmanned aerial vehicles can.  If we compare the mass of the metal, then Adolf Aloizych will be out of reach.  And if in terms of strike power, then the strike power of this UAV, if properly organized combat use, is in no way inferior to the power of the Messerschmidt itself.  Say, it is easier to hit a tank of a small UAV, and even more so an ABPLA, than a Messerschmidt ... ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/0d6/0e5/6e70d60e58c33e966921379e2ce55e93.jpg"><br><br>  And further, an example from the modern army: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/a70/9cc/39da709ccdc4da2c9d5fd9d7ab838ddd.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGround combat vehicles - all types of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery and other belongings, which land forces have - are just targets.  Saddam Hussein had more of this good, probably, than Hitler had.  In the 1990s, he was confronted with a US-organized division, modeled on the 1970s.  This division alone smashed all its million-strong army with all its weapons systems of the Second World War ‚Äî the great creation of the Soviet military-industrial complex reanimated by Rogosin today ... ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/674/7eb/96e/6747eb96ec374248fdbcce10beeb1bfd.jpg"><br><br>  Further in the book Cyber-centers which will control UAVs and all theater of military operations are described.  These cyber-centers will manage production, making an order for new, more advanced robots. <br><br>  In general, the book makes a great impression.  It is possible to disagree with many things, but the tendency of the development of human society is clearly defined.  We see a change in the social structure of humanity every day.  3D printers, this is really a breakthrough technology.  It can be safely put on a par with the Internet, electricity and other outstanding technologies of mankind. <br><br>  3D printing technology brings both its positive and negative sides.  The Internet, crowdfunding and 3D printers ultimately destroy market relations, and with them capitalism.  Whether this is bad or good depends on how you yourself are included in the capitalist system and whether you are ready to change with the world.  The era of creativity comes = an era of quality, not quantity.  The amount no longer matters.  It is possible to further tighten the nuts in the old plant.  And you can put your project, for example, on kickstarter.  The choice as always remains for the person. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172331/</a></p>
