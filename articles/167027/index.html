      For the representatives of the last group, inexplicably caught up on Habr√©: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Google Android is ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Linux-based operating system, mainly for mobile devices with touch controls, such as smartphones and tablets.  By its nature, the OS is open source software, distributed under Apache licenses to the user's environment and under the GNU kernel licenses, which allow the system to be available for modification and distribution by device manufacturers and ordinary users. </div></div><br>  For a long time I collected various kinds of information for myself on this OS in order to create a general picture of its place in the market of mobile devices and prospects. <br>  In addition, the article contains examples of using several useful web services: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/">timeline.verite.co</a> - creating an interactive timeline using the chronology of the release of Android versions, for free; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.easel.ly/">easel.ly</a> is a good and also free assistant for creating infographics. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Evolution </h4><br>  To begin with, there is a little history. It would be interesting to see how the OS development took place, but it‚Äôs boring to read wikis with boring dates and release notes of developers.  It is much better to see it clearly.  Unfortunately, Habr does not support markup with frames and active content, so the whole interactive is available by clicking on the image located just below. <br><br>  The Stone Age era did not fall into the Stone Age era since the founding of Android Inc in October 2003 by the persons listed in the dedication; the corporation Dobra Corporation‚Äôs purchase of this company in August 2005 was not mentioned for a very decent amount of $ 130 million, said David Love, vice Google CEO: <blockquote>  The acquisition of Android is the most significant acquisition of Google since the company‚Äôs existence. </blockquote><br>  The release of the beta version of Milestone 3 on May 15, 2007, the birth of the Open Handset Alliance of 80 companies from November 5 of the same year, which is now engaged in the support and further development of the platform, did not hit either. <br>  The release of Android 5.0 (Key Lime Pie), expected in May of this year, has not yet been displayed, this news has already been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/160343">written</a> on Habr√©. <br> <a href="http://embed.verite.co/timeline/%3Fsource%3D0As0vyjH4fMIFdE5nNXNMZzVPTUpDSjVRbFp5UEhmT0E%26font%3DBevan-PotanoSans%26maptype%3Dtoner%26lang%3Dru%26height%3D650"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56d/38e/506/56d38e506b8d5cee84c36a1e6cf84319.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few words about how the timeline is made:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The online service <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/">timeline.verite.co</a> is a tool for creating timelines, written in JavaScript (anyone can fork <a href="https://github.com/VeriteCo/TimelineJS">it</a> on GitHub).  Allows you to create lines using data from popular social resources Twitter, Flickr, Google Maps, YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Wikipedia, SoundCloud.  Data is received in JSON and from the Google Docs table.  In my example, I just filled in the Google-Spreadsheet <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/">template</a> .  Allows you to use HTML tags in cells.  It is possible to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub%3Fkey%3D0As0vyjH4fMIFdE5nNXNMZzVPTUpDSjVRbFp5UEhmT0E%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D0%26output%3Dhtml">look at</a> it yourself. </div></div><br><br>  Based on the above information, the life of Android can be divided into three generations: <br><ul><li>  <i>First generation.</i>  From early versions to the release of "Eclair".  <b>Features:</b> low demand, cheap iron, extremely high fragmentation of devices.  About 100 thousand activations per day. </li><li>  <i>Second generation</i>  From Froyo to the first release of ICS.  <b>Features: a</b> growing number of users, more productive devices, higher functionality.  About 500 thousand activations per day. </li><li>  <i>Third, the current generation.</i>  From ‚ÄúICS‚Äù to an unknown border.  <b>Features:</b> mainstream, excellent hardware, excellent user interface (compared to earlier OS releases - <i>as noted by</i> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ninja/" class="user_link">ninja</a> ).  About 1.5 million activations per day. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  The next moment after the biography, which I would like to note, is the prevalence of devices.  To do this, I collected monthly statistics from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">office site</a> from December 2011 to January 2013.  Putting it all into one Google Docs <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub%3Fkey%3D0As0vyjH4fMIFdFZMUllDSlB1UF9HbmdvVFBOdW1idnc%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D0%26output%3Dhtml">table</a> .  Based on this data, I constructed a simple diagram.  The abscissa is the date by months, and the ordinate is the percentage of prevalence.  Graph colors are API versions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eea/ca3/b20/eeaca3b202cd74d301dc2385e1e0b471.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What do we see from this graph?  In general, everything is quite obvious.  So far, the most massive release remains ‚ÄúGingerbread‚Äù, but after the peak of its popularity in June 2012, it declined at a rather rapid pace.  In a couple of months, the prevalence can be compared with ICS, which since March 2012 has gone up rapidly, its growth rate in September 2012 seems to have slowed down the momentum of Jelly Bean, the growth rate of which is about the same as that of the popular Gingerbread and ‚ÄúICS‚Äù at the stage of their appearance.  A minor exception is release 4.2, although it is at the growth stage, but so far not significantly due to the limited number of devices for which it is released.  ‚ÄúFroyo‚Äù declined very sharply, it‚Äôs not worth mentioning other releases because of their low prevalence. <br><br>  Based on this data, developers will be rational to maximize the use of SDK API 10, 14, 16 for applications and to study API classes 17. <br><br><h4>  Data </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/976/a46/ac2/976a46ac28d2260213ce40e88eb7a9a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few words about how infographics are made:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Since I am still not a designer, I shouldn‚Äôt expect any special design delights from me.  The main point here is to use the service <a href="http://www.easel.ly/">easel.ly</a> , with absolute free of charge, it allows you to create simple infographics from ready-made templates and elements with the ability to upload your own graphics.  Russian language support available.  Export only to raster. </div></div><br><br>  Summing up, we can say that Android is not going to give up its position, but rather the opposite - now it is gaining momentum.  Therefore, the activity associated with the development of this platform in the near future remains a ‚Äúbread‚Äù place.  Moreover, there are various prospects, one already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/150292/">wrote to</a> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/hugc/" class="user_link">HugC</a> earlier that Android expects an interesting future in space technologies, which is quite unusual for an open source project, since closed military developments often fly into space. <br><br><hr>  To create an article used materials from the following resources: <br><ul><li>  Drawing with the evolving Android from the personal <a href="http://www.bonkersworld.net/">site of</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/106154493978299996445/posts">Manyu Korne</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android">Section</a> dedicated to Android on Wikipedia. </li><li>  Some statistics from <a href="http://www.statista.com/">statista.com</a> . </li><li>  Google earnings <a href="http://investor.google.com/earnings.html">data</a> . </li><li>  Well, Google <a href="https://www.google.ru/">search engine</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  PS: Thank you so much for the good questions and pointing out my mistakes to the habrausers: <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/goodkat/" class="user_link">Goodkat</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/nikita_sergeevich/" class="user_link">Nikita_Sergeevich</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ninja/" class="user_link">ninja</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/xpert13/" class="user_link">xpert13</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/zubb/" class="user_link">ZuBB</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/noorball/" class="user_link">NoorBall</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/fanex/" class="user_link">fanex</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167027/</a></p>
