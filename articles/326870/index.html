      The latest version of the product complements this popular solution with built-in native security tools, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%25E2%2580%2593computer_interaction_(security)">HCI security</a> , stretched high-availability clusters and 50% more productive, fully flash systems for high workloads in next-generation business systems. <br><br>  <b>General Product Description</b> <br><br>  Today, more than 7 thousand clients of all industries and all scales use the capabilities of vSAN to simplify their IT infrastructure and manage enterprise workloads ‚îÄ from critical business applications to virtual desktops.  Typical vSAN features are as follows: <br><br>  <i>Risk-free deployment</i> <br><br>  As the only native data warehouse for <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html">vSphere</a> , server virtualization platforms for creating cloud infrastructures, vSAN allows you to extend virtualization to storage systems, creating a hyper-convergent solution that fits well with existing tools, numerous software products and hardware platforms, and professional and user skills. <br><br>  Basic information about VMware vSphere can be found <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/226231/">here</a> . <br><br>  The latest version of vSAN further reduces the risks of the enterprise at the expense of the industry's first embedded solution, HCI security.  The system protects data while providing simple storage management. <br><br>  For vSAN there is a wide range of deployment options provided by the large and proven <a href="http://vsanreadynode.vmware.com/RN/RN">vSAN ReadyNode</a> ecosystem of leading server providers. <br><br>  <i>Reduced tco</i> <br><br>  Clients with a limited IT budget often turn to HCI systems based on vSAN, because they reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) to 50%.  VSAN systems can dramatically reduce costs by choosing the appropriate hardware and using flash technology, that is, better server-side economics. <br><br>  In general, storage system maintenance becomes easier, with fewer tasks.  Intellectual automation can be controlled by one tool, and without the need for additional specialists. <br><br>  <i>Scaling</i> <br><br>  As companies evolve, the ‚Äúagility‚Äù of vSAN helps prepare for IT tomorrow, ‚îÄ expand into a public cloud or quickly deploy new technologies, ‚îÄ and thereby gain a competitive advantage. <br><br>  vSAN supports a wide range of applications ‚îÄ from legacy critical systems to container architectures.  In combination with the VMware <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html">NSX</a> platform, vSAN significantly enhances the SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center) stack, allowing you to expand on-premises storage systems and management services to a public cloud.  Major new features and vSAN 6.6 updates include the following. <br><br>  <i>The first in the industry "native" encryption HCI</i> <br><br>  vSAN offers a HCI encryption solution for stored (unused) data, protecting it from unwanted access.  Encryption vSAN is cheaper and has more flexibility than similar systems.  It can be used on a variety of hardware from various manufacturers.  The software also implements simplified key management. <br><br>  As a result, there is no longer a need to use self-encrypting hard drives (Self-Encrypting Drives, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-based_full_disk_encryption">SED</a> ).  VSAN encryption is also implemented in accordance with the requirements of two-factor authentication (SecurID and CAC), and is the first HCI solution to have a Security Implementation Guide (STIGs) certified by the Security Information Systems Agency <a href="http://www.disa.mil/network-services/ucco">DISA</a> ) <br><br>  <i>Extended Clusters with Local Site Protection</i> <br><br>  New extended ‚Äústretched‚Äù clusters with local site protection provide protection and fault tolerance of external network systems (sites *) and on-premise systems, while the cost of such functionality is lower (up to 50%) compared to traditional solutions. <br><br>  * In this context, the concept of ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site">site</a> ‚Äù (site) is understood more broadly, ‚îÄ as a site in a convergent infrastructure, and not just a thematic set of web pages. <br><br>  A complete stretched cluster solution provides simple, low-cost disaster recovery and meets business continuity requirements. <br><br>  Additionally, vSAN Cloud Analytics reduces operating costs by automatically providing real-time, proactive system status notifications and related recommendations using the vSAN Health Service Intelligent Intelligence Service. <br><br>  vSAN now supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast">Unicast Networking</a> technology, instead of the previously used Multicast, which simplifies the initial installation of vSAN. <br><br>  This allows vSAN to be used in a wider range of on-premise and cloud deployment options, without requiring network changes. <br><br>  The new ‚ÄúvSAN Management Pack for VMware vRealize Operations Manager‚Äù provides additional options for monitoring, managing, and detecting abnormalities in vSAN performance, along with complete infrastructure solutions. <br><br>  <i>Always-On Protection</i> <br><br>  With the new tools of the Always-On Protection group, vSANs are able to support the operation and availability of applications, despite potential hardware problems. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúDegraded Device Handling‚Äù (DDH) component completely controls the operation of the disks and moves the critical data to another place in advance if there is a possibility of failure.  Then, if necessary, reconfiguration and restoration of disks and their partitions are performed. <br><br>  <i>Lifecycle Management</i> <br><br>  New tools group "Intelligent Operations and Lifecycle Management" accelerate the initial installation of hardware and software.  They also provide simple hardware lifecycle management, predicting their likely future behavior. <br><br>  The management time for common tasks is reduced to 80% due to ‚Äúone-click automation‚Äù.  Optimized data services further increase vSAN performance by providing up to 50% more I / O operations per second (IOPS) for devices using flash drives than previous versions of vSAN, up to 150 thousand IOPS per host. <br><br>  The new architecture allows you to deploy next-generation applications, such as Splunk, Big Data and Citrix XenApp.  In addition, the vSAN for Photon version is now available on the Photon Platform 1.1 platform and the new Docker Volume Driver. <br><br>  Customers can accelerate the introduction of hardware through the Day 1 Support approach, ‚îÄ for newer Intel Optane 3D XPoint NVMe SSD flash drives.  In addition, vSAN now offers options for increasing caching, including flash drives of 1.6 TB. <br><br>  The VMware Ready for vSAN Program program allows customers to expand and complement their vSAN environment with data protection services and file services from third-party partner companies. <br><br>  <b>More details ‚îÄ what is new in vSAN 6.6?</b> <br><br>  The new release of VMware vSAN, which has the version designation of vSAN 6.6, does not match the vSphere release sequence number.  Rather, it can be considered as a big patch for the vSphere, ‚îÄ and at the same time it is the main release for vSAN for today.  Release 6.2 with Stretched Clustering was announced earlier, as well as release 6.5 with iSCSI and 2-Node Direct Connect. <br><br>  However, vSAN 6.6 brings new useful functionality and a whole set of various improvements.  The overall list of improvements is as follows. <br><br>  - vSAN Encryption ‚îÄ Datastore level encryption with efficient compression; <br>  - Local Protection for Stretched Clusters; <br>  - Delete the principle of operation Multicast; <br>  - The management and monitoring functionality of the ESXi Host Client (HTML-5); <br>  - Advanced rebalancing; <br>  - Extended Recovery; <br>  - Advanced sync and resync; <br>  - Preliminary check of service; <br>  - Advanced user interface for stretched clusters; <br>  - vSANs are included in the Phone Home / Customer Experience Improvement Program, including in the cloud health check; <br>  - Advanced API; <br>  - Means to facilitate the installation of vSAN; <br>  - Updated vSAN Config Assist / Firmware; <br>  - Enhanced Performance and Health Monitoring. <br><br>  Pretty big list.  Some points require clarification, ‚îÄ they are described below, ‚îÄ some speak for themselves, ‚îÄ as in the case of Multicast / Unicast, for example. <br><br>  <i>vSAN Encryption</i> <br><br>  A particularly notable improvement in the latest release is vSAN Encryption.  As you know, VAIO encryption based on VAIO (vSphere APIs for IO Filters) appeared in vSphere 6.5, which was well received by many clients. <br><br>  However, for clients using vSAN fully flash, there was one big disadvantage ‚îÄ that encryption is performed at the highest level, i.e., IO is encrypted.  As a result, the gain from compression turned out to be close to zero.  Accordingly, vSAN Encryption was therefore introduced. <br><br>  There is no need for self-encrypting disks.  This is an exclusively software solution that works with hybrid or fully flash systems, regardless of the specific type of storage device used. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94e/d25/761/94ed257610fa47fe98fa2d61a28ade7e.png"></div><br>  <i>Setting encryption in vSAN</i> <br><br>  <i>Local protection for stretched clusters</i> <br><br>  "Local Protection for Stretched Clusters" is a very important and useful function, ‚îÄ perhaps the most significant since the extended clusters were implemented.  In previous releases, it was possible to create a RAID1 configuration on sites, which meant creating only two copies of data, one on each site. <br><br>  But it also means that when errors appear in one of the copies, only a single copy remains in stock, and another failure can lead to data loss.  It also means that if a failure occurs on one of the sites, then resynchronization is necessary. <br><br>  In vSAN 6.6, this potential threat is eliminated.  It is now possible to set ‚ÄúPrimary FTT‚Äù and ‚ÄúSecondary FTT‚Äù, i.e., the permissible number of failures (Number of Failures To Tolerate, FTT).  This indicator determines the "elasticity" of the object in the vSAN, respectively, the number of errors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c04/336/c7f/c04336c7f3584b7691ca669533c8e8e8.png"></div><br>  <i>FTT technology in vSAN 6.6 provides a choice of site for protection, and the level of its local protection</i> <br><br>  The value for Primary FTT can be set to 0 or 1 in stretched clusters, where 1 means the cluster is stretched.  Then in Secondary FTT you can determine how the system will be protected on the site.  This could be, for example, RAID1 with multiple local copies, or even RAID5 and RAID6. <br><br>  <i>Witness VM</i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cde/7a4/20b/cde7a420b3004e5fa981a18818aecf7d.png"></div><br>  <i>Witness VM in a vSAN Stretched Cluster Structure</i> <br><br>  If an extended cluster is implemented, you can now easily replace the ‚Äúwitness‚Äù, Witness VM, directly from the user interface with a few clicks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/eb6/a0f/ee8eb6a0f8344973b65324d7c3840a1b.png"></div><br>  <i>Replacing a Witness VM Host Has Never Been So Easy</i> <br><br>  <i>ESXi Host Client</i> <br><br>  It is useful to introduce the concept of ‚ÄúvSAN Workflows‚Äù into the ESXi Host Client.  If for some reason you do not have access to the vCenter Server, you can now access the ESXi host and retain certain controls and monitoring functionality. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ad/ccc/bd9/7adcccbd9cca4cb68c5cc6de38150050.png"></div><br>  <i>Configuring vSAN settings in ESXi</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ff/e56/f1b/6ffe56f1b71d49ed8a8001c4f3f1c185.png"></div><br>  <i>Here is the monitoring panel of the ‚Äúhealth status‚Äù of the Host Client Health Checks</i> <br><br>  <b>Other vSAN 6.6 features</b> <br><br>  Many customers said they would like to narrow the bandwidth consumed when resynchronizing during business hours.  Now this is an option available directly from the user interface.  However, it is not recommended to set this value by default, since resynchronization suppression also means an increase in the time for its implementation. <br><br>  Many will appreciate the means of ‚ÄúMaintenance Checks‚Äù, issuing appropriate messages, if, for example, it is not possible to complete the task, or with it there are certain difficulties. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/730/c7d/321730c7d9ff4804be462e6a2feb7948.png"></div><br>  <i>Sample warning when trying to delete a disk group</i> <br><br>  Much work has also been done in the areas of rebalancing, restoration and resynchronization.  Today, vSAN can automatically rebalance the IT environment (or it can be done from the UI) when the 80% utilization of resources on any of the system devices is reached. <br><br>  When restoring and synchronizing the procedure for the following system.  If, for example, the host returned to its duties after 70-80 minutes, the vSAN will check what is the preferred option ‚îÄ continue synchronizing / restoring the current component or simply updating it. <br><br>  <b>vSAN Easy Install</b> <br><br>  In release 6.6, the installer for the vCenter Server Appliance has been improved, well suited for the first deployment of the vSAN infrastructure.  This creates a single vSAN cluster using the specified ESXi host. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10a/cfa/3ff/10acfa3ff5ae424c83243e2d3fdb7996.png"><br>  <i>VSAN Cluster Creation Screen as Installation Stage</i> <br><br>  Processes specific to vSAN Config Assist / Firmware Updates can do many different useful things, including network preparation, and also check whether all necessary or expected options are activated and whether they are configured correctly. <br><br>  The Updates option downloads OEM software and drivers, updating them.  Today the option is implemented for Dell, Lenovo, Fujitsu and SuperMicro products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/627/35e/d74/62735ed744004f78b0e9538a581d4536.png"><br>  <i>Possible options for building vSAN infrastructure</i> <br><br>  Some changes have been made to the vSAN Cloud Health Check component to improve its usability. <br><br>  Performance Monitoring includes metrics for vSAN, resynchronization, iSCSI, client cache, and more. <br><br>  Cloud Health Check and Analytics detects problems and relates them to a specific knowledge base (Knowledge Base, KB), the number of which is constantly increasing. <br><br>  In conclusion, it should be added that the Customer Experience Improvement Program has been expanded, which previously belonged mainly to the vSphere.  It now includes extensive vSAN information, which should make troubleshooting easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326870/</a></p>
