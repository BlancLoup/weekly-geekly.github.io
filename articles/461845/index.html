There are not so many other ‚Äúpassive‚Äù ways to save and increase money - for example, the cost per square meter of real estate in the capital has <a href="https://www.irn.ru/gd/%3Fclass%3Dall%26type%3D1%26period%3D0%26grnum%3D1%26currency%3D1%26select%3Dperiod">not</a> actually <a href="https://www.irn.ru/gd/%3Fclass%3Dall%26type%3D1%26period%3D0%26grnum%3D1%26currency%3D1%26select%3Dperiod">been growing</a> for many years. <br><br>  Therefore, those who want to maintain finances and, ideally, at least slightly increase their capital, today have to turn their attention to the exchange.  In a certain situation, using the investment instruments existing today, it is possible to solve the problem described above.  Today we‚Äôll talk about them. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  <b>Note</b> : the investment methods described in the article are accessible to people with little experience and not possessing millions of assets, they do not imply quick enrichment in the shortest possible time, they have their own, albeit not very large risks - this must be understood. <br><br>  In addition, to perform the operations described in the topic, you will have to open a brokerage account - you can do this <a href="https://iticapital.ru/open-account-online/">online</a> (it's free, you can also open a <a href="https://iticapital.ru/services/private-services/demo/">test account with virtual money</a> for experimenting and studying trading software). </blockquote><br><h2>  Structural Products </h2><br>  Not everyone knows this, but in fact, the risk of stock exchange investments can be controlled, even made it practically zero.  This can be achieved with the help of the so-called <a href="https://iticapital.ru/services/private-services/structured-products/">structural products</a> - that is, various financial instruments collected in a single portfolio.  Analysts of a brokerage company select them in a certain proportion in order to ensure either minimal or near-zero risk when investing on a stock exchange. <br><br>  It works like this: assets with a low risk and a small possible profit and more risky assets are ‚Äúcollected‚Äù in a structural product, which, if successful, can bring a higher income.  The idea is simple - if the risky tool ‚Äúdoes not work‚Äù and there is a loss on it, then it will be compensated by the profit from the less risky asset - therefore its volume in the structure of the structural product is higher. <br><br>  For example, 90% of a structural product may be federal loan bonds (OFZ), and 10% of a company‚Äôs shares.  We wrote more about the parameters of structural products (terms, capital protection levels, available instruments, participation rate) in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/iticapital/blog/461421/">this article</a> . <br><br>  Here we will briefly say that strategies with structural products are constantly updated, the most relevant ones are <a href="https://iticapital.ru/assets/files/structured/structured-july-august-2019.pdf">presented here</a> .  In July-August, you can use several strategies with a capital protection level of 100%. <br><br>  An example of such a strategy: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3a/nq/jr/3anqjrlxxntrl_pfw5syrna6444.png"></div><br>  It works like this: <br><br><ul><li>  If at the time of repayment of the product, the value of the price of the underlying asset (Lukoil shares) is lower than the ‚ÄúInitial price‚Äù parameter, then the investor will receive back the invested capital in full. </li><li>  If at the time of repayment of the product the value of the price of the underlying asset is higher than the ‚ÄúInitial price‚Äù, the investor earns participation in the growth plus receives back the invested capital in full. </li></ul><br><h2>  Model Portfolios </h2><br>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/services/private-services/stock-portfolio/">A model portfolio</a> is an investment portfolio that consists of several securities selected on certain grounds (for example, bonds or shares of one sector of the economy).  Something similar to a structural product, but there are fewer risk management opportunities, although you can start investing with slightly smaller amounts (tens, not a couple of hundred thousand rubles). <br><br>  Such portfolios are convenient for novice investors who have several tens of thousands of rubles, but have no experience working on the exchange, which means that there is a high probability of losses in independent trading.  Each portfolio has an indicator of expected return, so the investor understands how much he can earn. <br><br>  The scheme is simple: <br><br><ul><li>  investor chooses a portfolio of securities; </li><li>  makes money for their portfolio formation; </li><li>  sets the term of investments - the longer the term, the higher the total profit is possible, usually choose a period of 6 months (but less is possible); </li><li>  if necessary, funds can be withdrawn ahead of schedule. </li></ul><br>  The essence of such portfolios is that brokerage company analysts constantly keep them under control, add and remove papers in order to arrive at the expected profitability.  It will be difficult for an inexperienced investor to do this on his own. <br><br>  An example of such a portfolio: a model <a href="https://iticapital.ru/analytics/stocks/stocks-model/11126/">portfolio of American stocks</a> - a possible return of 23% per annum with a low level of risk.  Read more about model portfolios <a href="https://iticapital.ru/analytics/stocks/stocks-model/11126/">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  IIS accounts + federal loan bonds </h2><br>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/iis/">An individual investment account</a> (IIA) is an investment tool that makes it possible to save money with a high degree of reliability, and in addition to earn extra money.  This is similar to a savings account: you deposit a certain amount on it, replenish it at any time, do not withdraw your savings for 3 years - and get the right to various types of tax benefits. <br><br>  Such accounts have been earned in Russia since January 1, 2015.  Initially, it was possible to place on the account up to 400,000 rubles, later the amount was increased to 1 million rubles.  In addition, it became possible to add 400,000 rubles.  during two years. <br><br>  When using IIS, two types of benefits can be obtained.  The first of these is a tax deduction (13%).  To receive it, you need to deposit money into the investment account, as well as have an official taxable income (PIT).  For example, if you deposit 400 thousand rubles on the IIS, then a maximum of 52 thousand can be returned as a deduction - for this you will need a salary of 33 thousand per month.  According to the rules, money must be in the IIS account for three years, it can be withdrawn earlier, but then the deductions will have to be returned. <br><br>  The second type of benefit when using IIS is exemption from income tax from transactions on the exchange.  And this opens up space for low-risk investments - it is just suitable for our task of preserving finances and, if possible, increasing them. <br><br>  This strategy can be implemented using ready-made model portfolios using OFZ - Russian federal loan bonds - and bonds of Russian companies. <br><br>  OFZs are securities issued by the state in order to attract additional money to the budget - and pays a percentage for it.  OFZ yield in the summer of 2019 is from 7-7.9%, that is, it is approximately equal to the rates on most deposits.  In terms of reliability, this asset is also comparable to deposits - although the assets purchased on the exchange are not covered by the deposit insurance system, the refusal of the state to pay debts will mean default (with all the ensuing consequences, including for the banking system). <br><br>  Similarly, large Russian companies issue bonds - and their yield is higher.  As a result, using a model portfolio where <a href="https://iticapital.ru/analytics/bonds/model-ru/11088/">such bonds and OFZ are</a> combined, you can earn up to 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper annum.  There are portfolios where exactly <a href="https://iticapital.ru/analytics/bonds/model-ru/11087/">bonds</a> (debt obligations) of companies are collected - including those with state participation.  An important point: several tens of thousands of rubles are enough to start work, and all income will be exempt from income tax - we used the IIS account. <br><br><h2>  Useful links on the topic: </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/open-account-online/">Open a brokerage account online</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/services/private-services/demo/">Test account with virtual money</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/">Software for trading on the exchange: trading terminal, mobile applications</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/services/private-services/structured-products/">Structural Products</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/analytics/bonds/model-ru/">Model Portfolios</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461845/</a></p>
