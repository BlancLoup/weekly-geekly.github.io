For those who think that the younger generation of this CMS also still loves, I would like to present my development, which will make it possible to turn MODX Evo into a full-fledged online store. <br><br>  This solution has its advantages and disadvantages, but I sincerely hope that there will be those to whom the work done will be interesting and useful. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So this is our first release, so maybe you haven't heard anything about SBShop yet.  I suggest to get acquainted a little closer.

    <h4>  What is SBShop for? </h4><br>  At that time, when I started working on SBShop, and it was 2.5 years ago, there really wasn‚Äôt enough really serious decision to develop an online store based on MODX Evolution.  But I didn‚Äôt really want to switch to other full-fledged solutions, since MODX is our everything (and flexibility, and simplicity, and power), and I was also burdened by my experience with online stores in the studio. <br><br>  And we needed a solution to develop an online store. <br><br>  In the end, after looking at different solutions, I decided that it would be better to take up my bike in order to implement my ideas, than to struggle with other solutions and leave Evo. <br><br>  What came out of it is to judge you. <br><br><h4>  Technical features </h4><br><br>  It is worth noting that far from all the concepts have been implemented and we still need to work on many things, but the main features can be assessed right now.  Especially this point concerns those who are actively engaged in development on MODX. <br><br><h5>  Kernel extension and data storage </h5><br>  First of all, you will find here a new kind of expansion, which you probably have not yet met.  SBShop - MODX kernel extension first.  Thanks to this, you can access any online store data through <b>$ modx-&gt; sbshop</b> .  There is also a management module and an auxiliary plugin with a snippet.  This is an important feature that creates some nuances. <br><br>  In addition, it is worth noting that all sections, products, orders, etc.  stored in separate tables.  This is the second important feature. <br><br>  As a result, you can create a huge amount of goods <s>over 9000</s> , as they are not tied to MODX resources, but many standard MODX extensions do not know anything about the store.  They cannot make a menu for it or provide a search.  All of this requires separate solutions. <br><br><h5>  CNC </h5><br>  It is.  Despite the fact that all the data in separate tables you will receive a catalog with the usual CNC, like on ordinary pages. <br><br><h5>  Caching </h5><br>  Unfortunately we have to admit that in the first version it simply does not exist.  That is, all pages are generated continuously and this is a minus.  There are not many requests and they are all fairly light, so the online store can work temporarily and so.  In addition, while an emergency request to add caching has been received.  In the next versions, it will definitely appear. <br><br><h5>  API </h5><br>  The kernel extension allows you to use your own SBShop API.  This makes it possible to make some additional decisions.  Let's say you can easily make a snippet that will do a sidebar about the product directly into the content of the text page. <br><br><h5>  Templates </h5><br>  Here you will see familiar placeholders, as elsewhere in MODX.  At the same time, the templates themselves are stored in files, which makes it easier to edit them.  Also partially used and patterns of the MODX.  What is interesting in SBShop templates is that you can easily make calls to any snippet and chunks, as usual. <br><br><h5>  Documentation </h5><br>  That is frankly bad with her.  All the available time was spent on development and they simply did not reach the documentation.  I myself, of course, easily get along without it, but just so right off to master this solution is not as easy as some ordinary snippet like Ditto.  The only thing that I always willingly go to the discussion and try to help with advice and advice to those who need them. <br><br><h4>  Online Store Features </h4><br>  Let's move on from the technical issues and try to understand what SBShop can offer if you try to compare it with other solutions for the development of online stores. <br><br><ul><li>  management of sections and goods </li><li>  simple performance management (really simple) </li><li>  convenient image and file management for the product </li><li>  optional components for the goods </li><li>  ready-made equipment with a specific set of components </li><li>  mass price regulation using surcharges </li><li>  order management </li><li>  export to YML </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What is not yet:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  caching </li><li>  payment system support </li><li>  shipping accounting </li><li>  user and personal account registration </li><li>  integration with 1C </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Demo version </h4><br><br>  Made very conditional to save time.  But in management you can easily practice and understand what happened as a result. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://sbshop.modx-demo.ru/">Demo version</a> , <b>admin</b> <a href="http://sbshop.modx-demo.ru/manager">panel</a> ( <b>admin</b> / <b>demo</b> ) </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/Carw/SBShop">GitHub project</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Direct link to download SBShop 1.0</a> , as well as <a href="">in the official MODX repository</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://community.modx-cms.ru/blog/sbshop/">SBShop blog with useful information</a> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I will be glad to any useful advice, ideas, suggestions, and if someone adopts this development.  Everything is free and open - GPL. <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> Periodically admin panel is not available (locked).  Some visitors train in its blocking, since everything is open.  Trying to minimize the impact of the locking mechanism. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Login is simplified.  It should all work. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Demos no longer exist, as it does not give someone peace, which leads to its instantaneous breakdown.  Apparently this publication upset someone or crossed the road. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142124/</a></p>
