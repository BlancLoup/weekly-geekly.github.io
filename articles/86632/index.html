  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview based on identifying core competencies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This time, let's talk about how best to conduct an interview when hiring employees.  Interview is one of the most biased processes in the company.  The fact is that companies don‚Äôt always have enough time to create a vacancy profile, during the interview process there are many factors (from HR mood to appearance and well-being of a candidate).  How to translate from qualitative indicators (it suits us / does not fit) into quantitative our attitude towards the candidate?  But it‚Äôs important not only that, it‚Äôs also important that everything is clever by textbooks, but it‚Äôs important how a person really behaves in real life. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  <b>Disclaimer</b> This article does not pretend to absolute clarity, but offers to get acquainted with a simple tool to simplify a specific business process, in order to find more detailed information on this subject. </h6><br><br>  Let's start with the requirements.  I think that everyone will agree that you need a specialist who has the ability to solve your problems.  So you need to describe exactly what competencies a specialist should possess in order to solve the tasks set for him.  Competences are both professional and personal.  For example, the ability to achieve results under stress is personal competence, and the art of negotiating under pressure from partners and time is professional.  Accordingly, you write out on a piece of competence, which should have your specialist. <br>  For example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Professional competencies: - knowledge of Cisco network equipment, - knowledge of Linux OS (CentOS distribution kit), - knowledge of Virtualization tools, - strong knowledge of shell scripting </li><li>  Personal competencies: - focus on results, - ability to work in a team, - ability to take responsibility, - initiative </li></ul><br>  After you have written down for yourself the main competencies, you will make two questions for each competency.  One question should enable a person from the good side to show his competence from previous experience.  Example: ‚ÄúPlease give me an example from the last place of work, when did your focus on customer satisfaction lead to an increase in company income?‚Äù.  The second question about the same competence is better that the second employee would ask, who would also attend the interview: ‚ÄúPlease give an example when a bad client interferes with the implementation of the plan?‚Äù was not focused on working with clients.  If he says that there are no bad customers, they are difficult, then everything is fine with him.  It is better to immediately agree that the two interviewers will have a copy of all the questions.  After answering each question, the interviewers should put N-balls on the answer to each question (the system‚Äôs points should be agreed in advance with the company).  If all candidates are evaluated according to the same template, then in the end it will be possible to quite quantitatively evaluate the best candidate.  I think this tool will be useful in all small companies that can not afford HR with psychological and other entities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86632/</a></p>
