  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SkyLink Feedback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I remember about half a year ago, and maybe I had previously described the experience of my own relations with SkyLink. <br>  The most interesting thing is that life experience does not teach me anything.  As soon as a new device comes out, my hands start shaking, a lot of salivation begins and, like a Pavlovskaya bitch, I crawl to the office for sports and take the device.  And after a couple of months, I sell the phone, throwing out RUIM and returning to normal communication (cellular). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last time I was drenching a new, at that time, U300.  Now the U520.  I said Brokeback! <br>  For the first time, the design of the device does not cause emetic urges, at the first approximation.  He does not stick anywhere, does not creak or stagger anything, which allows you to safely put it in the front pocket of your jeans (the radiation in CDMA networks is not great).  He is light and black.  Actually on this pros end. <br>  A little ahead, I would like to tell the big guys from the ‚Äúconnection of the new generation‚Äù what is the main gimmor of the technological chain of production of these miscarriages of Korean engineering.  The problem is that their (not to say the phones) are designed by the manufacturers - the Koreans.  I will not go into the details of the differences in the perceptions of the peoples of the east and the west.  I will be brief - the Europeans must design, at the very least the Russians, and the drawings are handed over to the Koreans - let them rivet.  Maybe then zero will be placed under the figure eight, and pressing the volume keys outside the conversation will no longer adjust the volume of the keystrokes (which, by the way, the alarm volume directly depends !!!). <br>  Now by specifics: <br>  1. Keyboard - sucks.  First, it is too low.  Thumb, of course, may be so curved, but not for long.  Secondly ... The zero is under the figure eight, the asterisk is under the nine, the grid is under the seven.  You are not Nokia - show off early.  Thirdly, the navigation keys are arranged in such a way that when you press to the right, you press to hang up automatically, and by pressing reception, you automatically launch an mp3 player (by the way, why on the device, positioned as a business class, hard-button an mp3 player?).  Fourth, to unlock, you do not have to press "lattice-&gt; break.", But "lattice-&gt; lattice-&gt; break."  Trifle, but unpleasant. <br>  2. Notebook - shit.  Firstly, it does not allow recording a number longer than 30 digits (yes, I‚Äôm calling these phones :)), secondly, if P is inserted in the number (pause), further commands are simply not transmitted.  Thirdly, well, you will teach Koreans do not attach DB IDs to a quick call.  This is done by adding one table or editing the existing one (but I am in addition. Table).  Fourthly, during a conversation, you cannot send DTFM from a notebook.  Only pens and for memory.  And in combination with a limit of 30 tsiferok ... <br>  3. By the way, did I say that the battery sucks as always? <br>  4. Support mp3 for a call is a silent horror.  I mean, when you just listen, everything is OK, and when you put an mp3 on a call (by the way, they don‚Äôt set a certain size, it‚Äôs too lazy to figure out the size), but when someone calls you, it‚Äôs very quiet.  At times quieter than when setting up or listening. <br>  5. But the speakerphone works well, but just the speaker - sucks.  Apparently due to the fact that it is wide, the sound is somehow cleverly dissipated, and in a noisy room or just on the street, in comparison with the same Nokia and Erics, it is hard to hear. <br>  6. But this is nothing because the opponent has also heard me badly.  I do not know who is to blame, the microphone or the network bandwidth, but the first phrase of my opponents is ‚ÄúHello, hello, can you hear me?  You can hardly speak loudly! ‚Äù.  But my vocal cords are now like Baskov (C). <br>  7. By the way, the U300 was a plus - the caller's photo is full screen.  In the U520, this is a good undertaking hacked to the ground. <br>  8. Built-in tunes - fufel.  No tr-rr-rr-rr (sound of an electronic phone). <br>  9. There is a voice recorder, but it does not allow recording a telephone conversation. <br>  10. There is an organizer that has nothing to synchronize. <br>  11. But there is a competent thing that is not implemented in many nokia - a recess for the lace, to hang around the neck, or to hang pendants.  I hooked pigs. <br>  12. The phone supports work in GSM networks !!!  If you do not switch it to this mode.  Because I could not call (I tried with two operators).  The network sees, but does not ring. <br>  13. By the way, sms-to the far east do not reach. <br>  14. Able to charge via USB, and act on it as a modem (for linux, even firewood was not needed).  More than anything on USB can not. <br>  15. Blue tooth is working suspiciously normal.  That is, as on a normal phone.  I do not know what the joke is.  I even spoke on the headset and the files changed - it works.  Apparently a puncture from the Koreans. <br>  16. There is support for audio output on BT headsets.  But just like with GSM support - only until it is turned on. <br>  17. Supports microSD cards.  Check did not.  Nerves are not enough. <br>  18. By the way, there was a cool opportunity to get a picture from a webcam to a mobile phone.  But this topic is still in the contraceptive state, as well as telephones.  However, you can already watch commercials SkyLink with mobile phones. <br>  19. Internet - as always on top.  Fast, high quality and inexpensive.  In this direction, it remains to wish only to reduce the cost of traffic and the emergence of unlimited Internet tariffs. <br>  20. Very fashionable office.  It really looks like.  Not much invested. <br><br>  ps The author of the article notes that all of the above is not the ultimate truth, and can only be the result of their own curvature or the defectiveness of a particular apparatus.  You can reprint this text anywhere, without prior notice to the author and without the need to provide references to the source, but without distorting the stated facts and observations. <br><br>  pps Selling Ubiquam U520, used for two months, under warranty, perfect condition, the whole set ... </div>
