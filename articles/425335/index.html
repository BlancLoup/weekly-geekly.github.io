In terms of functionality, the difference is huge: everything from Garmin sports watch owners is available, from advanced running functions, built-in maps and to help in managing a yacht.  We talk about the two latest models: Garmin Fenix ​​5S and Fenix ​​5X. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Three Garmin Bears </h3><br>  The fifth generation of the Garmin Fenix ​​multisport watch came out in 2017.  It replaced the previous and very prolific family of Fenix ​​3, which in a few years has grown to a dozen basic models.  A curious moment - the absence of the fourth generation Fenix.  In Chinese, the name Fenix ​​4 can be read as “Ascension to a quick death,” so the American manufacturer decided to skip one digit.  So, just in case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/vu/6x/b6vu6xd2mwdfznk05q4zzfrqrqk.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5s-sapphire-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DgarminF5FS">Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</a></i> <i><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5s-sapphire-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DgarminF5FS"><br></a></i> <br>  The confusion does not end there.  Fenix ​​5 is not just one watch, but a whole generation: Fenix ​​5, Fenix ​​5S and Fenix ​​5X, as well as the Fenix ​​5 Plus, Fenix ​​5S Plus and Fenix ​​5X Plus released this year.  Why extra complexity?  To finally attract the attention of female athletes and not alienate existing fans of sports gadgets.

      Traditionally, devices of the Fenix ​​line are overshadowed by classic men's wrist watches.  A large case is needed to fit all the rich electronic "stuffing" (including the antenna and battery) and protect it from the effects of the environment.  As a result, the device looks massive, and on a thin female wrist it seems altogether gigantic.  Despite this, it is convenient to use the clock, they do not cling to clothes and fit well on the arm.  Nevertheless, the "Phoenix" could be less, as repeatedly requested by users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f1/fb/gz/f1fbgzl-4wou9k4bgtye3h00yfc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  In response, Garmin engineers realized the tale of the three bears.  There are large and massive Fenix ​​5X watches, medium Fenix ​​5 and the smallest Fenix ​​5S.  The diameter of the dials, respectively, is 51, 47 and 42 millimeters.  The clock, objectively, is still large, but now it’s easier to find your “Goldilocks zone”. <br><br><h3>  What is the difference? </h3><br>  An important clarification: it is wrong to assume that Fenix ​​5S is a bad model “for girls”, and Fenix ​​5X is the most correct and “male” model.  Garmin does not have cheap and low-quality gadgets.  Their design in any case adds +10 to the brutality and testosterone of the owner of the watch, even if they are the color of "pink gold".  The specific difference between the different models of the Fenix ​​5 line is expressed in this: <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="center">  Fenix ​​5 </td><td align="center">  Fenix ​​5 Sapphire </td><td align="center">  Fenix ​​5S </td><td align="center">  Fenix ​​5S Sapphire </td><td align="center">  Fenix ​​5X </td></tr><tr><td>  Sapphire crystal </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Yes </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Yes </td><td align="center">  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Wi-Fi </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Yes </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Yes </td><td align="center">  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  The size </td><td align="center">  47 mm </td><td align="center">  47 mm </td><td align="center">  42 mm </td><td align="center">  42 mm </td><td align="center">  51 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Cards </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Not </td><td align="center">  Yes </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  This is not the whole list.  Let's talk about the differences in more detail. <br><br>  The first and most noticeable: the design and dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z1/it/1b/z1it1bu8fwazhfggjcbkcqhssfm.jpeg"><br>  <i>From left to right: Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire, Garmin Forerunner 935, Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Fenix ​​5X is a large and harsh-looking watch, I just want to say: “commanding”.  They need a really big wrist.  Fenix ​​5S is comparable in size with the Forerunner series running time clock ( <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-forerunner-935-hrm-tri/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DgarminF5FS">935</a> / 735XT / 230), plus or minus a few millimeters. <br><br>  The defining element of the appearance of all previous Fenix ​​models was a <b>large rotary ring</b> around the dial (it is also the bezel). <br><br>  The ring in the Fenix ​​5X is more massive, with five noticeable screws in it.  The Fenix ​​5S has a bezel with a thin profile, which in comparison with a large fellow seems really elegant.  But put a number of Apple Watch, and immediately notice how big the "ears" of both models of Fenix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/35/ql/rd35qlxv76lv9m3qjuq9reksl-8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Left: Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire, right: Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  In addition, the depth of 5S is 15 millimeters, 5X - 17.5 millimeters.  The same indicator of Apple Watch Series 2 and 3, for comparison - 11.4 millimeters, Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone - 8.9 millimeters, iPhone 8 - 7.5 millimeters, Xiaomi Mi7 - 7.5 millimeters. <br><br>  In this case, Fenix ​​5S weighs 67 grams, and Fenix ​​5X - all 98 grams.  These are definitely heavy gadgets that you need to consider when choosing a device.  Fenix ​​5X weighs 20 grams more than any device from the above-mentioned Forerunner family.  The “extra” is not felt on the wrist, and the watch does not run along the arm while running.  And almost 100-gram Fenix ​​5X tend to move due to gravity.  Therefore, the device must be firmly fixed, otherwise the pulse sensor may stray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/st/i6/khsti6ny1r4vuoq2b2vjhbictyk.jpeg"><br>  <i>From left to right: Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire, Garmin Forerunner 935, Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Screens of models 5X and 5S have a different size and resolution.  In Fenix ​​5X, it is 240 x 240 pixels, while in Fenix ​​5S it is 218 x 218, as in the models of the previous generation.  Both displays are colored and play a utilitarian role, so there is no significant difference from the extra pixels.  This is not the bright dial of Apple Watch, but two serious interfaces that do not load the battery and are well read in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/4r/vr/ae4rvryfvpydqfjdi8khf4klq0c.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5x-gray-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DgarminF5FS">Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</a></i> <i><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5x-gray-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DgarminF5FS"><br></a></i> <br>  For Fenix ​​5X and Fenix ​​5S, we need <b>QuickFit straps of different thickness</b> .  One is included, if you wish, you can purchase additional ones.  For Fenix ​​5S, you need QuickFit 20 20 millimeters wide, and for Fenix ​​5X you need QuickFit 26 26 millimeters thick.  The strap is removed from the stud at the touch of a button and is worn back in the same way.  Since the lever is located on the back of the bracelet, the watch can not arbitrarily jump off the hand during sports activities. <br><br>  There are three types of strap materials: silicone, leather and steel.  For the Fenix ​​5S, more sports silicone strap colors are available. <br><br>  <b>Maps</b> are the biggest difference between the Fenix ​​5X and Fenix ​​5S.  The latest device is compatible with the Garmin Basecamp mapping program.  The program allows you to create route maps in .gpx format and fill them in hours (and vice versa).  However, this feature cannot be compared with a pack of maps embedded in Fenix ​​5X. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/bb/gp/vgbbgp6yteezjz1czfqa8uyrucc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  These are full-fledged, full-color maps with an indication of the relief, addresses, and even “places of interest” —cafes, gas stations, hotels.  The pre-installed set of cards depends on which continent you bought the watch, you can download the new ones yourself, for which 16 GB of internal memory is provided.  Alas, for something else (for example, music) this free space cannot be used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j3/hi/-x/j3hi-xja1gzpaps8alspneiqy44.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Using a card without a touchscreen is hard, the interface is cumbersome and inconvenient.  However, the watch is able to automatically build a route;  among its settings there is a decrease in lift and distance.  Gadgets are often not chosen by the best paths, so for planning a hike trip it is advisable to explore the route on the map in advance.  Already while traveling the map in Fenix ​​5X you can believe for 100%, because the deviation will be about 15 meters in the worst case.  If your watch fails more - update the firmware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/ai/i0/ouaii0fmwdptsbmbmuctryf-aj0.jpeg"><br><br>  PS: All three Plus models - Fenix ​​5 Plus, Fenix ​​5 Plus and Fenix ​​5X Plus - support cards as much as Fenix ​​5X does.  But they are much more expensive. <br><br><h3>  What unites Fenix ​​5S and Fenix ​​5X? </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zb/pr/we/zbprwevhmfi1nicet0lbkyb0qto.jpeg"><br>  <i>Left Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire, right Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  First: the <b>charging cable</b> .  It fits all Fenix ​​5 devices, as well as the Quatix 5, Forerunner 935, Vivosport and several other Garmin sports watches.  The cable is connected with one plug to the back of the watch, and the second to the USB port of a computer, external battery or adapter.  The plug enters the nest with a characteristic click and sits very tightly in it.  Accidentally "shake off" the clock from the cable will not work, if you apply force - you can. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/gl/q-/0zglq-oc4rmiajo8zgslnryryws.jpeg"><br>  <i>Above Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire, Above Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Secondly: <b>Elevate optical pulse sensor</b> .  For the fifth generation, it has been greatly improved and now removes data every 1-2 seconds.  The design of the watch back has been changed: now the sensor sits in it exactly and does not protrude. <br><br>  By the way, this very cover is completely steel.  What gives us the third point: Fenix ​​5S and Fenix ​​5X (as well as Fenix ​​5) <b>are very durable devices</b> .  They are suitable for use by swimmers, but not for diving, as evidenced by a rating of 10 ATM.  The watch has separate profiles for swimming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/en/zw/gcenzw8-peklfvlxf6qv3lidvjo.jpeg"><br><br>  The fourth common detail: <b>GPS / Glonass support</b> for navigation, tracking and recording workout routes.  In the fifth version, Garmin engineers managed to achieve an instant (5 seconds) satellite search, although the process could be delayed in the city. <br><br>  Fifth point: the <b>built-in gyroscope</b> appeared.  In the previous generation of watches, Fenix ​​3, it was not.  The presence of a gyroscope has a beneficial effect on the UltraTrac function, which allows you to save energy when using a GPS antenna.  If you turn on UltraTrac, the watch records the coordinates at a longer interval.  The presence of a gyroscope helps to more accurately extrapolate the coordinates, although the accuracy will still be low. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/_9/y_/hz_9y_471hzwynpqcmzfdpb5kby.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  The sixth point: the control method remains the same, these are <b>five buttons on the side of the watch case</b> .  The screens are not sensory, so you need to remember what each button does.  The system is not very intuitive.  The buttons are signed, however, those who have not used a Garmin watch before, always missed at first. <br><br>  Seventh: the <b>clock shows notifications from the smartphone</b> .  You can’t answer them, but you can reset the call by pressing the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/fq/js/fofqjs7i-w5w0ha6ddq0hav3w7k.jpeg"><br><br>  Eighth: <b>customizable training modes</b> .  Fenix ​​5S and 5X track dozens of sports, from swimming and jogging to golf and cycling.  If the desired profile does not exist, you can create it or adjust the existing one in detail.  The number of fields for information on the screen, their content and the number of such “screens” are adjusted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9u/yt/aa/9uytaatktobusqngbnpwpq7pbcs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Last: first appeared support for Bluetooth Smart sensors.  Previously, external sensors (chest pulse meters and others) were connected to Fenix ​​devices only via the ANT + protocol, Bluetooth was needed only for pairing with a smartphone.  Now the clock works directly with Bluetooth sensors.  With one serious caveat: manufacturers of fitness devices have not yet agreed on uniform standards.  Your Wahoo Tickr chest heart rate monitor will transmit heart rate data to your watch, but no more.  To be able to get more running data, you will need branded Garmin monitors - HRM-RUN, HRM-TRI.  These are the charms of "closed platforms". <br><br><h3>  What are new Garmin sports watches for? </h3><br>  Both Garmin Fenix ​​5S and Fenix ​​5X are multisport watches.  Their accuracy, usability and functionality are not much different.  However, they target two types of athletes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/86/jp/sa/86jpsa2ja4erzw6heu53rmw49yk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5S Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Garmin Fenix ​​5S is a sports watch runner and triathlete.  They are small, moderately durable and blend well with casual wear.  It is enough to change the silicone strap with one click, and you can start training of any complexity.  It is clear that for such a focus an extra strap you need to remember to purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/kz/oj/afkzojja4x0-pordda48y03a8oa.jpeg"><br>  <i>Garmin Fenix ​​5X Sapphire</i> <br><br>  Garmin Fenix ​​5X - watch for the tourist card on the wrist.  Their powerful and durable design is designed for use in the wild.  The gadget is heavy, so you only need to buy it when you really need navigation.  There are no comparable gadgets, Fenix ​​5X is a separate wrist tourist computer. <br><br>  Until October 14, <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5s-sapphire-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dgarmin">Fenix ​​5S</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-fenix-5x-gray-black/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dgarmin">Fenix ​​5X</a> and other <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/garmin/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dgarmin">Garmin</a> accessories can be purchased with a <b>10% discount</b> at Madrobots.ru online store.
