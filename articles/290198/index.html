  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Office Library: Kawasaki Rules</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello Megamind!  We <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">have</a> a small, even tiny library in <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">our</a> office.  So far there are 12 books, but we, of course, are going to gradually expand it.  Today I would like to talk about one of the most favorite books.  The author is Guy Kawasaki, the book is ‚ÄúKawasaki Rules.  A tough guide for those who want to leave the competition behind. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/1ae/f06/c7d1aef064d442b0a121735b817734f5.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>In the background, Vault-Boy, for yes, ‚ÄúWar.</i>  <i>War never changes ¬ª</i> <br><br>  The book is not new - Mann, Ivanov and Ferber Publishing House, 2014.  The original was released back in 2008.  On the Megamind, many reviews of Kawasaki‚Äôs books are mentioned more often, his work ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù, but in the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù one can also learn a lot of interesting things.

      The book is divided into 12 large sections, each of which consists of 5-10 chapters.  Kawasaki delves into the themes of finding funding, planning, innovation, marketing, sales, communication, competition, recruitment, and even a little GTG.  All this, of course, is seasoned with sauce with references to feature films and books, personal experience, tests and tables. <br><br>  The language of the narration is easy and relaxed, perhaps I should say thank you to Pavel Mironov, who translated from English and managed to keep Kawasaki‚Äôs style with his ability to speak ‚Äújust about the complicated‚Äù.  The chapter "How to kick ass Silicon Valley" will not let us lie. <br><br>  Each chapter begins with an epigraph, not only quotes from various writers, poets, businessmen, philosophers, presidents and other prominent personalities, from contemporaries like Rick Cook to the classics in the face of Goethe and Kant, but also folk wisdom, proverbs and excerpts from the Bible.  Some are very extravagant and convey the whole point.  For example, the epigraph to chapter 66 "The art of driving competitors crazy": <br><br><blockquote>  <i>If one of my competitors was drowning, then I would stuff a hose in his mouth</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Ray Kok (1902-184), owner of McDonalds Corporation</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Kawasaki himself loves to refer and reinforce his thesis with the opinions of professionals or real examples.  In the first chapter, he cites excerpts from Jessica Livingston‚Äôs book Founders at Work: Stories from the Startup Days, and refers to an article by Dr. Zimbardo at Stanford University. <br><br>  In addition, many chapters were written not by Kawasaki himself, but by successful businessmen, for example, Glenn Kellman, the CEO of Redfin, wrote chapter 2 ‚ÄúThe Kitchen of Business‚Äù.  Many other chapters are presented in the form of interviews with experts from different areas.  For example, chapter 13, ‚ÄúThe Kitchen of Venture Capital Laws,‚Äù is entirely composed of questions and answers between Kawasaki and Fred Greguras, a partner at law firm K &amp; L Gates. <br><br>  This is one of the distinguishing features of Kawasaki books.  He does not try to be known as an expert, versed in all areas.  If we are talking about law, he turns to a lawyer, if a business, then to businessmen.  So, for example, in Chapter 16 ‚ÄúParadox of the strategy: how Apple lost and how lucky Microsoft was‚Äù, Michael Raynor, an employee of a large consulting company, a specialist in business administration, the author of several books, answers questions.  This is despite the fact that Kawasaki himself worked at Apple and can tell a lot of interesting things on this topic. <br><br>  Another feature for which they love Kawasaki is that he rarely uses didactics.  Almost everywhere and always he gently advises, backing it with real examples, his personal experience and numbers.  Even where, seemingly, we are talking about obvious truths, he manages to bring something new and prove that "A is bad not because it is A, but because it was found out during the research ...".  Here is an example from chapter 38 ‚ÄúThe Art of Sales‚Äù, where Kawasaki tells why you need to give up cheating.  It would seem to be a truism, but it approaches the question quite differently: <br><br><blockquote>  Give up cheating.  Associate Professor Vanessa Patrick from the University of Georgia, along with Debbie McInnis and S. Von Park from the University of Southern California, found out that ‚Äúpeople pay attention to something when they feel worse than they expected, and not when they feel better than expected‚Äù.  A team of researchers came up with a special term to describe the gap between expected and true feelings - ‚Äúaffective miscasting error‚Äù.  The findings of the study reinforce the old maxim that people tell five others about negative experiences and only one thing about positive ones (can this be considered negative evangelism?).  Therefore, actions in the style of ‚Äúpromise less and do more‚Äù are fully justified. </blockquote><br><br>  Almost everywhere, Kawaski, following the advice, gives an example from real life or reveals a concept.  For example, after the ‚ÄúHire the Right People‚Äù advice in Chapter 55, The Art of Working with Clients, Kawasaki explains what is meant by the concept of the ‚Äúright person‚Äù and how it differs from the wrong. <br><br>  Speaking of patents in Chapter 65, ‚ÄúCounterpoint: Patents and Protection‚Äù, he advises to ensure the security of the document, and after this tells how to do this (publish it somewhere in Albania, which will preserve secrecy and give some protection in terms of patent law ). <br><br>  Separate chapters are devoted to stories about successful services and tips on how to use these products to make your life better.  So, chapter 74 is called ‚ÄúHow to get a job using Craiglist‚Äù. <br><br>  At the end of the book you will find a nice bonus - a test where you can determine what your EQ (preparatory ratio) is equal to, as well as a checklist with 10 questions for everyone who nags your startup: <br><br><ol><li>  Do you do something meaningful? </li><li>  Can your product jump to a new level or even create it? </li><li>  Can your product be considered as Deep, Intelligent, Complete, Elegant and Exciting? </li><li>  Do you have a mantra that describes what you are doing? </li><li>  Do you have a presentation of 10 slides with the text in a font of at least 30 points, which you can set out in 20 minutes? </li><li>  Have you found a way to market your products without a budget? </li><li>  Do you help people who cannot help you? </li><li>  Can you bring any audience to ecstasy by showing off your product? </li><li>  Are you ready to hire "imperfect" candidates who love what you do and people who are better than you? </li><li>  Do you ask people to do only what they could do? </li></ol><br><br>  In conclusion, we would like to say that the ‚ÄúKawasaki Rules‚Äù are not the rules of a single individual taken regarding business and marketing online, as it may seem by name.  This is a collection of stories, tips, stories of victories and defeats of two or three dozen prominent people, wrapped in a simple and readable form and supported by concrete examples.  None of the sentences in Kawasaki says: ‚ÄúThis is the right way‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo it and you will be happy.‚Äù  This is not a guide to action or disruption of integument.  It's just the Kawasaki Rules. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us. <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290198/</a></p>
