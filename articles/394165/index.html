  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2 or how to clean the air of the metropolis?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2 is the second modification of the Xiaomi air purifier.  This device is included in the Xiaomi product line for the smart home, so naturally it has WiFi and it can be controlled from the app.  However, the application serves more to transmit environmental information, and the main function of Mi Air is controlled by one button.  But let's get everything in order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d3/6f0/498/0d36f049818b0d99c9f5faceb0d75f14.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think it is worth starting with the fact that Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2 is not officially supplied to Russia and was primarily created for the Chinese market, but when I posted the Mi Air photo on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/motttoman/">Instagram</a> - it turned out that many of my friends already know about its existence and have been thinking about it for a long time about his purchase, so that the first days I spent describing the first impression to friends.  And, looking ahead, I will say that Xiaomi again pleased.

      This is not a small gadget, half a meter high and a quarter of a meter wide, so there were concerns about shipping from China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5cb/67e/52f/5cb67e52fa7c64efda56935bb97816e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, delivery bypassing Russian mail using the Priority Direct Mail, that is, by courier to an apartment in Moscow was <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/xy">free</a> (which is rare for such a large package), so the risks were significantly reduced.  And, soon, I got my box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b21/97b/b74/b2197bb746b1ebba41a24ff2fc0b2008.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/585/9ab/9a3/5859ab9a384ea9343f761cb71815c102.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The delivery is quite simple: cleaner, cable, filter and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/198/613/63f/19861363ffbd3224657187c2c223c901.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A separate story came out with a cable, which came with a three-plug socket for which I did not even have an adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/6af/fb9/ab66affb9675028fc3c5ec93ed3bf578.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, another standard of connectors helped out - in the cleaner itself (where power is inserted) there was a painfully familiar connector and the solution came instantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9cd/3df/953/9cd3df953ce199261c1789dc4d4e529f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not difficult to guess that this is a normal cable that plugs into the power supply of most laptops.  (I recommend to order the <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/xz">right cable right</a> away for $ 1.62).  And finally, it worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/867/1b1/22d/8671b122d13adac6f15eaac3b083d799.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cleaner looks very presentable: good materials, light colors and thoughtful minimalistic design do their job.  At the bottom there are holes through which air is drawn in, and a large fan on the lid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f30/d25/176/f30d25176d3a1480d9eefaea569dc8eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately on the lid is located the main button to control the cleaner.  With its help, the cleaner starts working, and if you press it a little longer, it completes the work.  It is also designed to switch to one of three modes: <br>  - Automatic (analyzes the air and itself increases or decreases the speed of the fan) <br>  - Night (works in the most quiet mode, almost silently) <br>  - Favorite (you can manually program the speed / noise by using the application) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c41/7ca/318/c417ca318997d90e46f15649dba78be9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  It's all good, but what does this cleaner do? </h2><br>  The main functions of this device are not design and convenience, but air purification from harmful gases and small particles. <br><br>  The purifier is able to carry through up to 380 cubic meters of air every hour and it will be enough to purify the air in the room up to 46.6 square meters.  At the same time, it is able to independently and in real time monitor the state of the environment and automatically adjust the speed of work.  So that not only he knows about the state of the air - the indicator on the front panel is on, which can be lit with red, yellow and green light depending on the air condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e48/520/100/e48520100431ae257b7d66a878b0dd30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the practical properties of the manufacturer states: <br>  - Removal of odors after smoking <br>  - Remove dust from the air <br>  - Removal of formaldehyde <br><br>  In general, leaves only clean air, which is beneficial to the health of all inhabitants of the home or office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/741/cf2/8b0/741cf28b031f31c1f7ff4bf9f9141660.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the filter, it is very easy to get it by opening the back cover of the cleaner.  On the inside of this cover you can read the instructions for replacing this filter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/156/85d/d0c/15685dd0c1ca8fb12fd1e39e77c28366.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, when the time comes to change the filter (after 6 months), the indicator on the rear panel will tell about it.  And in the application, you can always see how many days are left until the filter is replaced. <br><br><h2>  application </h2><br>  In order to connect to Mi Air, you need to download the MiHome application ( <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.xiaomi.smarthome">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mi-home-make-your-phone-center/id957323480%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> ).  After downloading the application, you need to connect to WiFi ‚Äî which distributes Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2 and in MiHome add a new device, following the steps suggested by the application.  As a result, you will have a new application on your device, which will be named as you called your Mi Air - I have this Dronk Air <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/540/f35/2cc/540f352cc9ab0e26aba66ddabbaf22dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Going into this application, we will see the main interface and the conditional number of air condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/042/330/138/04233013835469f6113452bc6b5c2ef2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to controlling the main functions (on / off / switching modes) - in the application you can see the air temperature in the room, humidity, condition assessment (there can be from humid to excellent), your location (if allowed) and how many days the filter remains to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3d/2c4/4bd/d3d2c44bda8d3172279afefa8397f17c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From useful additional features: <br>  1. Child protection (i.e., all the buttons on the filter itself will stop working if activated) <br>  2. There is a detailed instruction with pictures in the section about the device <br>  3. Update the firmware of the cleaner with one button (minutes after 2-3 updates, taking into account the device reboot) <br>  4. Automatic timer on and off (you can drive the air only when someone is at home) <br>  5. Turn off all beeps if annoying <br>  6. Turning off the light indications so as not to interfere <br><br>  And a few little things.  The application is updated frequently and periodically something new appears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/864/911/7d1/8649117d17c35275da239e1e45cd26dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  To the appearance of absolutely no complaints.  This is a very beautiful device that can decorate any home.  But it is important to find him a suitable place so that there is enough space on the sides and front (10-20cm) to take in air. <br><br>  As for the application, sometimes there still can be found hieroglyphs and it is absolutely impossible to meet the Russian word, but this does not prevent using Mi Air at all.  To understand the interfaces, knowledge of the basics of English is enough, but otherwise everything is very simple and intuitive. <br><br>  I can not say for sure that with this gadget health will improve significantly, but the lack of dust in the air and the general awareness that the air in my apartment will be passed through a filter gives us hope that this year we will breathe better.  From the first noticeable sensations (perhaps not related to the operation of the device, but simply due to other factors) - in the bedroom is now not so stuffy and it became more comfortable to sleep.  But, in any case, summer comes to the street, which means there will be a lot of road dust in the air and Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2 is designed to save us from it.  Soon we will learn what and how intensively our filter is clogged, but it is already clear that either our filter will be clogged with this or our lungs.  Perhaps the filter is better.  :) <br><br>  And lastly, I bought a filter on GearBest for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/10l">$ 162.99</a> *, given the free courier delivery to the apartment. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
