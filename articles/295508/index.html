The base of the research is the comments and discussions of customers in social networks, forums and specialized sites, that is, real consumer reviews in the public domain online.  The results of this study were translated and adapted by the authors of the system to accept <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> payments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  An international survey revealed some trends in the shopping world that are designed to help retailers better understand their audience.  The key research results showed that there is a gap between the expectations of sellers and buyers, the essence of which is the lack of new rich experience that would allow consumers all over the world to make purchases "at the speed of life."

      The main results of the MasterCard study: <br><br><ul><li>  Convenience through technological innovation.  Serviceability has proven to be the most talked about aspect of new digital payment methods in e-commerce, especially in the field of tourism.  Consumers stressed that they would not like to take a wallet every time during their travels, but would prefer to be able to use mobile payments. </li><li>  Reward.  Bonuses and special offers for buyers became the most noisy topic in social media when it came to shopping and retail.  When discussing awards and bonuses, the entertainment sphere was mentioned most often.  Consumers have expressed the opinion that paying with NFC technology will stimulate their special offers and discounts. </li><li>  Wide use.  In addition to bonuses and special offers, consumers discussed which retailers accept and do not accept the latest forms of payment.  Buyers talked about how important it is for them to integrate new payment systems into retailers, and in this case the fashion market was most often mentioned.  Fashion buyers enthusiastically talked about retailers who accepted new payment methods such as contactless and mobile payments. </li></ul><br>  In addition, it was revealed that Twitter is the most frequently used social network for discussing shopping and retail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/517/d44/5ed/517d445ed8f94a03b9b321946b9659d4.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/72f/372/af372f372234497796de61f76c07b17b.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295508/</a></p>
