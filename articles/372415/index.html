  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is the cosmological constant constant</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The cosmological constant is the vacuum energy density, due to which it expands and expands clusters of galaxies.  Vacuum is constantly increasing in volume, but its density does not fall, as in ordinary media, but remains constant.  Therefore, its non-decreasing constant density is called dark energy ‚Äî energy of unknown nature. <br><br>  The cosmological constant expressing the anti-gravity force of space was first introduced by Einstein to counteract gravity and explain the static nature of the Universe.  But then it was rejected by him because of the discovery of the expansion of the Universe, which at that time was understood as a consequence of the expansion of matter by inertia from the Big Bang.  It was reintroduced after the discovery of an accelerating expansion of the Universe, which inertia cannot cause. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Under the expansion of the universe is now understood not only the expansion of its visible part of us - the volume of Hubble, but in general our entire universe.  It is much larger than our Hubble volume, and their centers do not coincide.  This is indicated by the discovery in our volume of the ‚Äúdark flow‚Äù - the general direction in the cosmological movement of all its clusters of galaxies.  It has any conventionally allocated volume in the universe, except the central one.  Expanding with it, it moves away from its center.

      Such an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Universe allows us to explain the constancy of the density of the expanding vacuum by the simultaneous action of two reasons.  First, the vacuum everywhere increases its density from the additional fifth dimension of space.  Second, the entire increase in its density is immediately transformed into its expansion ‚Äî into a free increase in its volume in the external, less dense and more extensive environment. <br><br>  This environment can be considered truly eternal and infinite and called superspace.  And immediately populate it with many universes like ours, to avoid a new manifestation of geocentrism.  The superspace creates some resistance to the free expansion of each universe, and this sets the residual density of its vacuum - the value of the cosmological constant. <br><br>  Exactly the same meaning is present in the two-dimensional model of an expanding vacuum ‚Äî in a film of duckweed algae.  Algae multiply in it, compact the film and encourage it to expand on the surface of the pond.  The film expands freely, so its density is constant.  But if it rests in the coast or in the neighboring films, expanding towards it, then its density will begin to grow. <br><br>  Note that the two-dimensional film is replenished with new elastic elements due to the additional vertical dimension to it.  After all, it is part of the three-dimensional world (except for the fourth time dimension).  New algae are born on the edges of the leaves of the parent plants from the air molecules above them and the water molecules below them.  This vertical dimension is not perceptible for the conditional two-dimensional inhabitants of the expanding film. <br><br>  It is also not noticeable for us the fifth additional dimension (already taking into account the 4th time dimension).  Our four-dimensional world is also part of the five-dimensional world - superspace.  In order to understand what is born in it to seal the vacuum of our Universe, it is necessary to figure out what is born in it from the set of freely expanding universes. <br><br>  It is clear that these universes once touch and go into a mutually compressed state.  Not all at once, but starting from some random center.  The density of their environments, continuously replenished from the fifth dimension, will begin to grow.  But they will not be able to immediately increase their volume, since more and more universes will press on them, merging with them into a gigantic environment of mutually compressed universes.  This will continue until their density does not exceed the critical one, and it does not begin ... A big bang formed by the macrocell universe space. <br><br>  In this way, in the eternal and infinite superspace, not one but a multitude of macro-universes is formed.  Their expansion will create even more large-scale universes, and so - without end.  Accordingly, the space of universes of our scale was formed from mutually compressed micro-universes.  And the space of the latter is from an even smaller scale of universes, and so on without end.  The existence of the innumerable scales of the innumerable universes connected with each other lies in the physical essence of the fifth dimension. <br><br>  From it, new micro-universes are born everywhere in our space, which condense it.  It is more convenient to call them ethers - mutually compressed elements of the ether.  They differ from the aetherons of Lesage, but they are also not bubbles of ‚Äúvacuum foam‚Äù or quanta of space.  These are specific and not abstract elements of the environment. <br><br>  In general, it is time to move from the term ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù, which has completely lost its original meaning, to the term ‚Äúether‚Äù.  Emptiness has neither properties, nor structures, these are all characteristics of the environment, and it has its own historical name.  From the fact that Michelson did not find the ethereal wind in the horizontal plane, the absence of ether does not follow at all. <br><br>  Without this concept and without the fifth dimension, the nature of gravity cannot be explained.  And, it means that one does not understand the reason for the discrepancy by 120 orders of magnitude of the cosmological constant, found using quantum physics and the theory of relativity.  To begin with, it is not bad to understand why its significance is constant - due to the constant condensation of the ether by new ethers and its free expansion in superspace. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372415/</a></p>
