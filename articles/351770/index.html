  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gartner released a new quadrant of monitoring solutions for 2018 (and at the same time missed 2017)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Translation of the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-4E0E2VQ%26ct%3D170915%26st%3Dsb%26aliId%3D330900942">Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring Suites</a> report by analyst authors Will Cappelli, Sanjit Ganguli, Federico De Silva. <br><br>  In their materials, Gartner promised to release a report on monitoring systems (aka Magic Quadrant for APM Suites) on December 30, 2017, but apparently, analysts were busy with more important matters and had already delayed by almost 3 months.  I'm not picky - released, and thanks for that.  This report can be interpreted as the results of 2017, because there is no news from 2018 in it.  Some new members appeared, some old ones left.  It is very curious to read the events of the past year, which sometimes could be monitored in real time.  Look under the cat - it is interesting. <br><blockquote>  When each manufacturer was asked about who its main competitors were, AppDynamics and Dynatrace were named more often than others, followed by New Relic, Splunk, and then CA Technologies.  When the survey respondents were asked to identify other APM vendors that they reviewed before making their final choice, the sequence changed slightly: AppDynamics, CA Technologies, Dynatrace, and New Relic.  Note that Splunk does not meet current technical requirements for inclusion in this study. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a>  Every year (well, almost everyone) Gartner publishes a report on the leaders among the manufacturers of APM solutions (Application Performance Monitoring Suites - application performance monitoring tools).  The report includes evaluation criteria, changes and forecast for the next year.  You can compare the current quadrant with the previous one in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jetinfosystems/blog/319948/">my 2017 article</a> with a free translation.  This time I approached the translation with all seriousness (now no joke) and kept the structure of the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-4E0E2VQ%26ct%3D170915%26st%3Dsb%26aliId%3D330900942">original document with the report</a> .  Mostly, however, added his comments. <br><br>  As in the previous time, the advice to those who are looking around in search of a new monitoring system: Gartner <u>does not declare</u> with its magic quadrant that the producers included in the report are great, and all the rest are unruly people.  There are excellent solutions that are good in the areas of event management, log analysis, monitoring without data, but do not have, for example, user monitoring.  I will not give the name, if interested - write to me personally.  But let's move on to the quadrant.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s2/yg/bt/s2ygbtvcz2m-teqeugpohiulcji.png"><br><br>  This year, one condition for the inclusion of manufacturers in the quadrant has changed - there is a requirement for artificial intelligence, and there are three of them. <br><br>  <b>1. Digital Experience Monitoring ( <abbr title="Digital experience monitoring">DEM</abbr> )</b> .  Digital experience monitoring is the control of the availability and performance of an application that determines the convenience of a digital agent, person or machine when interacting with corporate applications and services.  For the evaluation, real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic transaction monitoring (STM) for end users based on web interface and mobile applications are used. <br><br>  <b>2. Application Discovery, Tracing and Diagnostics ( <abbr title="Application discovery, tracing and diagnostics">ADTD</abbr> ).</b>  It is a set of processes designed to understand the relationship between application servers, match transactions between them, and provide in-depth analysis of the application and other host resources.  Under the same application name, the monitoring system contains three previously separate dimensions: the detection and visualization of the application topology, transaction profiling (user-defined) and a detailed analysis of the application component.  All three dimensions are focused on troubleshooting and are interrelated. <br><br>  <b>3. Artificial Intelligence for IT ( <abbr title="Artificial intelligence for IT operations">AIOps</abbr> ) for analyzing applications</b> .  AIOps supports automatic detection of characteristics and event patterns, detection of root causes of performance anomalies for HTTP (S) transactions supported by Java and .NET application servers.  This is achieved through machine learning, statistical inferences, and / or other methods.  In 2016, AIOps for applications was called ‚Äúapplication analytics,‚Äù and then ‚Äúalgorithmic IT operations‚Äù before being changed to ‚ÄúAIOps‚Äù in mid-2017. <br><br><h2>  Benefits and risks associated with manufacturers - quadrant participants </h2><br><h3>  BMC </h3><br>  Despite changes in ownership structure and overall positioning, the BMC has long been a player in the APM market.  Over the past two years, the company has completely updated its entire portfolio of monitoring solutions, adding APM and AIOps.  <abbr title="user experience monitoring tool">TrueSight AppVisibility Manager is</abbr> positioned as part of a larger TrueSight Operations Management package, which also includes <abbr title="Infrastructure monitoring tool">TrueSight Infrastructure Management</abbr> and <abbr title="log analysis tool">TrueSight Log Analytics</abbr> . <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  TrueSight is deeply integrated with a wide range of tools for automating IT service management (event management, log analysis, capacity management, etc.) so that users can manage events and facilities from a single interface. </li><li>  BMC has a large IT management portfolio that provides the manufacturer with several potential customer entry points for sales of APM products. </li><li>  TrueSight transactional synthetic monitoring covers a wide range of applications.  Transactions can be easily recorded from a PC, emulator or mobile device. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  The BMC has shown a low ability to sell outside IT, which can be a disadvantage, since developers or business units ( <abbr title="Lines of business">LOBs</abbr> ) are increasingly initiating the purchase of APM solutions. </li><li>  By regularly positioning TrueSight AppVisibility Manager as part of a larger IT operations management package (ITOM), BMC limits the value of the product to companies that are interested in APM as a standalone solution. </li><li>  The lack of code profiling outside of Java and .NET applications limits the distribution of the TrueSight AppVisibility solution for applications in other programming languages. </li></ul><br><h3>  CA Technologies </h3><br>  CA Technologies has been in the APM market since Wily Technology was acquired in 2006.  Last year, significant improvements were made to the company's APM solutions to eliminate gaps to reduce the remaining market share.  This was the result of a three-year effort to revitalize the APM portfolio, during which CA filed an application for 20 patents for a wide range of APM functionality.  CA again became the market leader, but with the need to further improve usability. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  CA can detect and present topologies at the application and infrastructure stack levels, with the ability to demonstrate individual elements of this topology to strictly defined user roles. </li><li>  CA has significant sales and support resources that allow you to create diverse partnerships and develop relationships with corporate clients. </li><li>  Several large corporate CA clients with tens of thousands of APM agents provide a testing ground for testing scalability requirements. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Some customers believe that CA does not respond to problems that occur during the installation of new versions or updates to the components of the solution. </li><li>  Despite the fact that CA-based SaaS products are easy to deploy, the deployment of on-premise format products that make up your own APM portfolio is extended over time for many corporate customers. </li><li>  AIOps for applications requires better integration with the rest of the package. </li></ul><br><h3>  Cisco (AppDynamics) </h3><br>  Founded in 2008 as an APM solution provider, AppDynamics offers on-premise and SaaS tools with the same architecture for both types of installations.  AppDynamics was acquired by Cisco in March 2017 as a new division of the Internet of Things Department and Applications from Cisco.  The AppDynamics solution consists of blocks: APM, end-user monitoring, monitoring of business indicators, as well as additional features based on the App iQ platform.  The iQ App Platform includes the recently released Business iQ functionality, which provides business-oriented analytics and dashboards. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  The introduction of R &amp; D and sales experience from Cisco reduced the time to market for AppDynamics to the market for new functionality and increased sales opportunities on a global scale. </li><li>  As AIOps manufacturers began to compete with APM, the Business iQ functionality began to support both approaches, so that AppDynamics data was relevant for different business units of customers. </li><li>  AppDynamics's vision of expanding product functionality through network orchestration and monitoring reflects the end users' desire to see through the components of business systems in combination with automation. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics does not improve the company's historically weak position as a supplier of APM solutions for application developers. </li><li>  AppDynamics provides limited support for legacy operating systems, DBMSs, and other environments. </li><li>  Many users still do not quite understand the AppDynamics plans for integration into Cisco network products. </li></ul><br><h3>  Correrelse </h3><br>  Correlsense is a privately held supplier of APM solutions, founded in 2005, with headquarters in Tel Aviv (Israel) and Fremingham (Massachusetts, USA), as well as sales and support departments in the EMEA region and South America.  SharePath provides transaction monitoring for most of the IT stack and has received several patents for its unique instrumental approach, which goes beyond traditional monitoring of application servers.  Although the company managed to close several large deals in the US, Correlsense is not noticeable in the APM market, since the company is focused on profitability and sticks to a cautious approach to expanding its client pool.  The company executes a strategy of avoiding sales in the "fields" and seeks to sell as a subscription through partners and deliver solutions in the SaaS format. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Correlsense has gained a reputation for technological leadership, innovative approaches to APM and related areas of ITOM. </li><li>  Deploying SharePath has a high degree of automation. </li><li>  The SharePath approach to business application instrumentation supports transaction tracking in heterogeneous environments. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  The company has low visibility in a very "noisy" market. </li><li>  Correlsense has limited direct sales force, which is necessary for sales in complex corporate environments. </li><li>  There is limited <abbr title="Digital experience monitoring">DEM</abbr> functionality in the product. </li></ul><br><h3>  Dynatrace </h3><br>  In terms of profitability, Dynatrace remains the largest player in the APM market.  Despite changes in the ownership structure and corporate structure, Dynatrace continues to invest in technological development.  The company often competes with other APM market leaders for large and complex corporate projects. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  While Dynatrace is privately owned by Thoma Bravo, we believe that the company is financially healthy with the largest network of distributed vendors. </li><li>  The company has actively invested in monitoring cloud, container and microservice technologies, as well as in strategic alliances with cloud providers. </li><li>  The platform of the same name Dynatrace (formerly called Ruxit) is based on a single adaptive and functional agent technology that supports advanced features in addition to APM: infrastructure monitoring, log analytics and AIOps for analyzing root causes of faults. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Dynatrace growth is on par with other market leaders in absolute terms, but the relative growth rate looks smaller due to higher revenues. </li><li>  Despite the fact that Dynatrace has clarified the roadmap and positioning, the company still suffers from the consequences of not informing customers about the transition to the new platform.  Since then, the company has clarified the development vector, but customers are advised to update the roadmap of product development with Dynatrace if they have any questions. </li><li>  By offering a single interface as part of the new Dynatrace architecture, customers who remain in the classical architecture may find it difficult to navigate the new interface. </li></ul><br><h3>  Ibm </h3><br>  IBM has been a player in the APM market since 2003.  In recent years, the company has focused on expanding the core functionality of APM towards AIOps and integrating APM with infrastructure monitoring.  The company is in the process of updating its sales approach to focus on industry-specific solutions, rather than on pure technological or product sales.  IBM also focused on extending the scope of APM to DevOps engineers by integrating APM into its DevOps tool chain, improving synthetic monitoring capabilities and incorporating data collection support for cloud microservices (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby). <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  IBM has a significant stack for monitoring cloud technologies (IBM Cloud Application Performance Management and Bluemix Availability Monitoring), infrastructure and ITOM (IBM Tivoli Monitoring, IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager, SmartCloud APM, Netcool Operations Insight / OMNIbus), among which is also supplied the APM package making. </li><li>  The company's investment in "cognitive computing" makes AIOps for applications more functional.  Such an approach is well welcomed by the market both from a technological point of view and from a price point of view. </li><li>  IBM Cloud in a platform as a service (PaaS) format provides a modern APM user interface and allows you to easily implement an application on this platform. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  IBM offers APM solutions as part of a larger ITOM solution, limiting its appeal to enterprises that are looking for standalone APM solutions. </li><li>  Although IBM has global reach, Gartner does not see this benefit effectively in terms of sales of APM solutions. </li><li>  Those customers who are not yet using IBM SaaS monitoring should consider that an APM solution consists of several products and related tools, the transition to which can take a long time. </li></ul><br><h3>  Manageengine </h3><br>  ManageEngine is Zoho's IT management division based in India and operating several independent organizations around the world.  ManageEngine has been working in the APM market since 2008, and, like its parent company, has been very focused on small and medium-sized organizations, offering solutions covering not only many IT segments, but also business applications.  The company continues to offer Application Manager and Site24x7 as its flagship products.  Application Manager - part of a larger portfolio in ITOM-products ManageEngine;  while Site24x7 is its SaaS version and is offered through a separate website. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  ManageEngine facilitates the purchase of a product for small and medium-sized organizations, because  This can be done directly from the manufacturer. </li><li>  The components of the ManageEngine package are tightly integrated with each other, as well as with infrastructure and network monitoring products. </li><li>  APM products from ManageEngine are easily integrated with products that the company offers to monitor other areas, such as servers and networks. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  ManageEngine uses transactional customer relationships and does not provide support at a strategic level. </li><li>  On-premise and SaaS APM solutions differ significantly in features and functionality. </li><li>  ManageEngine has developed limited functionality for AIOps-for-applications. </li></ul><br><h3>  Micro Focus (HPE Software) </h3><br>  In 2017, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) software division was separated from HPE and merged with Micro Focus.  Since then, the rate of innovation of functions in the APM package has slowed, and the strategy for moving forward has not been systematic.  While the company has achieved some success in retaining existing customers, there are few new installations of APM solutions, even within the existing customer base. <br><br>  Micro Focus did not respond to requests for additional information, but looked at the contents of this document.  Therefore, Gartner's analysis is based on other reliable sources, including public information and discussions with users of this product. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Micro Focus has a specialized field organization (sales / pre-sales services, consulting, etc.) to support the sales of APM products around the world. </li><li>  Users will have the ability to integrate APM functionality with Micro Focus native solutions. </li><li>  Micro Focus ‚Äúbig data‚Äù and ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù technologies can be deployed by users to extend APM functionality and integrate APM with other ITOM areas. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  It is difficult to get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe health of an application using the Micro Focus solution package when collecting various types of data from the entire stack of the observed application. </li><li>  APM-package has a limited scope for developers and business users. </li><li>  Micro Focus positions and sells its APM package separately from other ITOM products and services, causing customers concern about long-term APM integration plans with monitoring infrastructure and network performance. </li></ul><br><h3>  Microsoft </h3><br>  Released in 2016, Microsoft's Azure Application Insights product is an SaaS-based APM solution.  Although Microsoft has been working in the APM market since 2007, the company has changed its approach to APM several times.  However, the growing importance of the Azure strategy for Microsoft as a whole has shown that last year the company decided to focus the bulk of its APM development on a cloud-based solution. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  The tight integration of Azure Application Insights with the Azure cloud platform and the Microsoft Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes it a natural choice for large developer communities. </li><li>  Azure's market penetration strategy aims to provide competitively priced Azure Application Insights. </li><li>  Microsoft's investment in an analytics platform called Kusto (which works as the basis for App Insights) will allow machine learning to be applied to several sources of IT data. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Focusing on Azure and Microsoft for developers leads to a reduction in value and interest for more APM customers. </li><li>  Microsoft has limited support for environments other than .NET, Java, and Node.js.  For example, for PHP or Ruby. </li><li>  Microsoft's strategy for delivering an APM solution based on the SaaS model confuses users of on-premise System Center APM solutions and does not provide a clear path to Azure App Insights. </li></ul><br><h3>  Nastel Technologies </h3><br>  The company Nastel Technologies, founded in 1994, offers a product called AutoPilot Insight, supplied in SaaS and on-premise formats.  The company entered the APM solutions market in 2009, relying on historical competence in the field of middleware.  With an integrated view of the performance of applications in the mainframe and in distributed environments, the use of machine learning and other functions related to artificial intelligence, AutoPilot Insight supports both diagnostic and intelligent capabilities. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Nastel's focus on diagnosing problems based on artificial intelligence distinguishes AutoPilot Insight from other competing APM solutions. </li><li>  Nastel is developing unique APM capabilities for decentralized blockchain-based applications (dapps). </li><li>  As a private company, Nastel can quickly introduce new functionality in accordance with the specific needs of customers. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Discreet marketing Nastel limits potential customer awareness of the company's solutions. </li><li>  The Nastel solution has limited appeal to application developers. </li><li>  The company still has limited sales in rapidly growing geographic regions such as Asia / Pacific. </li></ul><br><h3>  New relic </h3><br>  From the very beginning, New Relic focused on delivering APM in SaaS format only.  Despite the fact that over the past year and a half it has expanded its capabilities by adding business intelligence and infrastructure monitoring capabilities, APM remains the backbone of its business.  With an initially attractive solution for small, medium-sized enterprises (SMB) and small development teams, the company has achieved great success among large enterprises as security and performance issues regarding SaaS become less relevant. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  New Relic continues to enjoy success among corporate clients, who will bring almost half of the company's annual annual revenue in the first quarter of 2018. </li><li>  Own data center allows the company to scale in accordance with the needs of its large and expanding customer base, while minimizing any administrative or technical downtime. </li><li>  The SaaS-based product allows New Relic to get in-depth information about its customer base and offer new solutions, such as Project Seymour, now known as New Relic Radar. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  The price of New Relic, subject to flexibility depending on the client‚Äôs environment, is at the upper end of the range relative to the market as a whole, although it is comparable to others in the quadrant of leaders. </li><li>  To date, New Relic is offering its SaaS platform only from its data centers in the US with expansion plans in the EMEA region in 2018. </li><li>  While New Relic controls both cloud environments and traditional data centers, its SaaS delivery model means that customers looking for local solutions should consider alternative offers. </li></ul><br><h3>  Oracle </h3><br>  Although Oracle has been in the APM market for several years now, this year‚Äôs study looks at the proposed Oracle Monitoring Cloud Application Performance Monitoring (OMCAPM) SaaS application introduced in 2015.  Despite its functional breadth, depth, and de facto ability to control non-Oracle application environments, a company's APM package is typically deployed in Oracle-centric environments.  Given the size and breadth of the Oracle client base, this is not a commercial limitation, but it explains the relative lack of market awareness of OMCAPM capabilities. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Oracle has demonstrated a strong dynamic of adding features, adding support for Node.js, Ruby, as well as synthetic and infrastructure monitoring over the past year. </li><li>  OMC presents APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, Log Analytics, IT Analytics and Orchestration in an integrated package based on a shared data warehouse, which also includes integration with PaaS from Oracle (Developer Cloud and Database Cloud Service), as well as IaaS (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) offers. </li><li>  Combining the APM Oracle solution with the broad Oracle Cloud strategy will simplify adaptation for a large Oracle customer base. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  OMC was designed for heterogeneous environments, but there is still a lack of market awareness of OMC capabilities beyond Oracle customers. </li><li>  OMC offers a wide range of machine-based functionality for the entire troubleshooting process chain.  Automatic troubleshooting is an area for Oracle development. </li><li>  While Oracle has offers for customers to integrate Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (OEMCC) and OMCAPM, these are two fundamentally different products that may cause doubts among some users when deciding whether to use OMCAPM. </li></ul><br><h3>  Riverbed </h3><br>  Riverbed has been offering APM products since 2007.  The current portfolio, built from a series of acquisitions, primarily OPNET in 2012 and Aternity in 2016, consists of SteelCentral AppInternals solutions, AppResponse, SteelCentral Portal, SteelCentral Aternity and NetIM.  Riverbed offers AppInternals and Aternity products, both of which were recently introduced, in on-premise and SaaS formats. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Riverbed provides comprehensive monitoring in both SaaS and on-premise formats.  User interfaces are indistinguishable. </li><li>  Riverbed continues the process of integrating Aternity Endpoint Monitoring and Network Performance Monitoring (NPMD) solutions. </li><li>  Cases that require the analysis of unstructured transaction tracing data are well handled by AppInternal. </li></ul><br><h4>  Risks </h4><br><ul><li>  Riverbed should expand its presence and share in the existing client mass of large enterprises. </li><li>  Riverbed should improve its position as a solution for developers. </li><li>  Considering that Riverbed traditionally targets the buyer of network monitoring solutions, a company needs to improve its position for customers monitoring applications. </li></ul><br><h3>  Solarwinds </h3><br>  SolarWinds, based in Austin, Texas, is a provider of ITOM tools that cover IT infrastructure, network and application monitoring.  The company was acquired in 2015 by a private investment group created by Silver Lake Partners and Thoma Bravo, the latter also owning Dynatrace and Riverbed.  This is the first inclusion of SolarWinds in the APM magic quadrant, as the company has added new features for monitoring applications.
