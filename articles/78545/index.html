  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education 4.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My first post is inspired by the fashionable theme of Habr√©, about education.  Being a student of the 3rd year of a provincial university with a degree in software, this topic is very close to me. <br>  But it‚Äôs not for nothing that everyone knows the song from little to great: ‚Äúthey learn in school, they learn in school ...‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a lot of arguments about our education ... and there are few positive ones among them, and even those that we hear are more like excuses.  But we all know that much is laid precisely in school, in elementary school. <br>  My mother works at school, and I myself finished it not so long ago, and often my mother tells me a lot about work, and of course I remember what they taught me ... <br>  Yes, of course, judging by the curriculum, the brain of children should grow by 20 percent, or by the same amount they should be able to rationally use it (before coming to school, we were taught to count and write there, and now most schools have preparatory classes, last year before grade 1) than when I was in elementary school.  I‚Äôll make a reservation that the school is a gymnasium, the best in our regional center, many, according to the results of the USE, are leaving to study in Moscow, St. Petersburg.  And it's hard not to be surprised when equations of the form ax <sup>2</sup> + bx + c and much more are solved in grade 3. <br>  But I was completely different when my mother came home and asked what was the difference between research work and a project, I was very surprised to find out that these were tasks for her students in 4th grade (in the title of topic 4.0 it was not a version, but a class ).  And many successfully coped, and it was interesting to read their work, how they put forward hypotheses, conducted research, conclusions (I was not only not taught this in elementary school, I started to give such skills at the institute). <br>  Actually, I wanted to tell you that children develop not only ‚Äúrectilinear thinking‚Äù (which can be useful for solving the USE, but slightly useless in life), but children are taught to think, discuss, reason ... And it is very nice to see it, because most of all in life it is precisely these abilities that are more important than a large number of formulas learned by heart. <br>  PS do not judge strictly, this is the first topic, just wanted to speak on the topic of education for a long time, and it was not possible to leave comments. <br><br></div>
