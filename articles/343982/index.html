  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM Connections and Verse cloud services: feature overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In modern business, collaboration through cloud services is one of the key success factors of an enterprise.  To do this, IBM offers the functionality of its cloud SaaS platforms ‚Äî Connections and Verse.  A brief description of their capabilities and basic functions read below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/is/7m/yxis7moiuq40gnotjg0xaj5bi6a.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>IBM Verse Email Client</i> <br><br>  This solution offers ample opportunities for organizing, planning cases and communicating with other people.  The IBM Verse e-mail client, in addition to e-mail functionality itself, also has a built-in instant messenger for exchanging instant messages with other users of the platform, which is available for PCs and mobile devices.  In addition, it has a convenient calendar, anti-spam module and antivirus, which provide additional protection against the threats that are spread in emails - malicious scripts, infected files and just spam.

      Unlike regular email, the IBM Verse client analyzes your work patterns and helps you prioritize.  Information, people and tasks are displayed through a personalized, highly customizable interface that predicts what you need at a particular moment.  IBM Verse also integrates collaboration features such as sharing files in the cloud and connecting to social networks.  You can use IBM Verse from the cloud or IBM Domino server, from your desktop or on virtually any mobile device. <br><br>  The built-in calendar allows you to access key contacts in one click.  It also shows what colleagues need from you or you from colleagues, and also allows you to view additional materials on tasks without leaving your email client. <br><br>  <i>Mail Archiving with IBM Connections Compliance for Mail</i> <br><br>  As an add-on for IBM Verse or Connections Cloud S1, you can purchase an email archiving tool in the cloud.  It allows you to send the necessary letters to the cloud archive and access them from anywhere where there is internet.  Also there is a convenient search system for archived letters, the ability to filter and highlight the necessary letters.  The system administrator can assign roles and delegate access rights to different users, which provides access to letters only to those who have the right to do so. <br><br>  <i>Ibm verse mobile</i> <br><br>  Many of the features of IBM Verse Mobile, such as viewing selected users, managing tasks and quickly working with priority elements, are also available on Android and iOS devices.  IBM Verse Mobile offers intelligent, customizable applications for iOS and Android devices with an optimized user interface. <br><br>  For iOS, the IBM Verse app is available in the AppStore (supports both iPhone and iPad).  The previous application, IBM Notes Traveler, still provides synchronization of embedded mail, calendar, and contacts.  IBM Notes Traveler and Verse can work together on an iOS device. <br><br>  For Android users, the IBM Verse app is available on the Google Play store (one app for phones and tablets).  Important note for Android users: IBM Verse replaces the previous IBM Notes Traveler application.  The new Verse application connects to the local IBM Traveler servers without additional changes.  Licensed users of IBM Connections Cloud or SmartCloud Notes with a mailbox on the IBM Cloud, as well as an IBM Notes Traveler user with local access to the mailbox, can work with IBM Verse Mobile. <br><br>  If you have a mailbox in the IBM Cloud and a Verse account with a license, it provides the greatest user experience on the device with support for all IBM Verse Mobile functions.  A limited set of Verse features will be available to IBM Connections Cloud clients and local clients.  For a list of available functions, see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYRPW_9.0.1/UsingVerseMobile.html">the</a> manufacturer's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYRPW_9.0.1/UsingVerseMobile.html">website</a> : <br><br>  <i>Online meetings at IBM Connections Meetings Cloud</i> <br><br>  The system allows for audio and video conferencing, including using recorded video, as well as organizing chats, polls and displaying a common desktop.  The system allows you to display applications (and demonstrate the work in them), documents, presentations, multimedia files, etc. The events on the screen can be recorded in QuickTime, MOV or Windows Media Video (WMV) formats.  There is also the possibility of organizing quick meetings.  They are also available audio and video. <br><br>  Up to 1000 participants can join such meetings.  All that is needed for this is a browser and an internet connection, as well as a computer running Windows or Mac OS.  As a participant, you can connect to meetings organized via IBM Connections Meetings Cloud from mobile devices.  Devices running on iOS, Android and BlackBerry are supported (all of a sudden someone has such a curiosity).  Data transfer during meetings is carried out via HTTPS with 128-bit SSL encryption. <br><br>  <i>Content archiving in IBM Connections Compliance for Social</i> <br><br>  IBM Connections stuns data protection functionality.  The system allows you to track and archive social content to meet corporate and regulatory requirements.  IBM Connections Compliance for Social is also able to block communications, posts and files with confidential information, thereby preventing their possible risks associated with data loss.  The module also keeps track of and keeps a history of all posts, comments and their changes in social networks, helping to monitor the brand's reputation. <br><br>  <i>Project management from a single personal account</i> <br><br>  The IBM Connections system provides convenient project and contact management tools.  They are accessible from a single control panel and have built-in administrative functionality. <br><br>  <i>Collaborate on documents in IBM Connections Docs Cloud</i> <br><br>  IBM Connections Docs Cloud provides a single platform for speeding up editing and document review cycles.  This allows the entire team to work together on text documents, spreadsheets, presentations and other types of data.  The system supports co-editing, commenting, chatting and group file management. <br><br>  <i>Sharing files in IBM Connections Files on Cloud</i> <br><br>  This feature allows you to manage files and share them with colleagues, customers and business partners, as well as synchronize data online from your favorite mobile devices and tablets based on Android and iOS. <br><br>  <b>Technical information</b> <br><br>  Software Requirements <br><br>  IBM Connections Cloud supports Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Apple OS X 10.10, 10.11. <br>  IBM Connections Cloud supports the following browsers: <br>  Google Chrome (current stable version) <br>  Mozilla FireFox ESR, FireFox (current stable version) <br>  Apple Safari 8, 9 <br>  Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 <br>  Microsoft Edge (except Chat, Meetings and Web Mail Cloud) <br><br>  <b>Hardware requirements</b> <br><br>  Since this is a cloud solution, there are no special hardware requirements.  The main thing is that the existing devices work correctly and have enough system resources to work with the Internet. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  Cloud services IBM Connections and Verse cloud services, which are provided on the SaaS model, have all the basic tools for productive teamwork.  Among them, a convenient and functional e-mail client and calendar, the function of joint remote editing of files and data transfer, a convenient user account and other tools.  The functionality of IBM Connections and Verse is useful for companies that employ many employees, distributed teams, different departments and remote users, as well as working together on many projects.  A single platform allows you to unify the approach of employees to work, thereby increasing their productivity and allowing you to get the desired result faster and at lower cost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343982/</a></p>
