  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small Business Grant Support - Myth or Reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The state tries its best to support small business and entrepreneurship.  Business incubators are created, grant support is established, etc.  But as always, everything turns out through the ass.  Here is my little story about how a start-up entrepreneur (IT) tried to get a grant ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69a/ae6/933/69aae6933fae4e1039b7fd2d16ae2851.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It should be slightly clarified what the grant support from the state is ... A grant is essentially a reimbursement of the actual costs incurred by the entrepreneur in setting up his own business.  Moreover, the cost exclusively on equipment, rent, raw materials, etc.  Also, the company must exist no more than a year.  To receive a grant, it is necessary to collect all sorts of certificates and documents (extracts from the EGRIP / Incorporation, certificate of the availability of p / s, etc.).  And also to provide a "business plan" (how much in quotes read below). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now there are several key features that discriminate the very essence of grant support: <br>  - Only those costs that were at the time of application for participation in the grant are reimbursed.  Those.  You can not ask for money for current expenses. <br>  - You can spend money only on equipment, rent, raw materials, etc.  Salaries of employees can not be covered.  It's funny, if you have the main item of expenditure (80% approximately) - this is exactly the salary. <br>  - Applications of state.  adopts a structure called "Business Incubator". <br>  - <b>The same structure,</b> for a fee of 5000r, is taken to make a ‚Äúbusiness plan‚Äù for the grant. <br>  - According to the employees, the ‚Äúbusiness plan‚Äù can be <b>done in 2-3 days</b> .

    <h4>  And in fact </h4><br>  In essence, the grant is not a grant at all.  With the help of it, an organization can only cover current expenses, but creating a new one with this money is practically unreal.  The amount of the way 300000r.  Then why write a ‚Äúbusiness plan‚Äù in which to paint a product or service, competition, marketing, etc.  If in fact it is not needed?  With such a policy, it was easier to call it ‚Äú <b>Reimbursement of expenses of young entrepreneurs</b> ‚Äù.  A nice girl engaged in developing business plans said that this is usually the case: a company comes, talks about its activities and fits a business plan to it.  At the same time, there is a whole procedure for checking the ‚Äúimplementation‚Äù of a business plan.  Why check if everything is already implemented! <br><br>  Also, the problem for me was that the Business Incubator does not have a <b>template for</b> my business.  Bakeries, hairdressers, beauty salons, etc.  you are welcome.  Change only the names and tsiferki.  And then everything will probably have to be from scratch, which is more complicated. <br><br>  Another important point - you can not spend money on salary employees.  I for example have no raw materials, no expensive equipment and other things.  The main resource is human.  As a result, during the work from 2010, I did not have time to spend 300,000 p.  to the office, internet, stationery and office equipment (the company is not from Moscow).  To which I was asked to pay the rent and the Internet before the end of the year ahead + upgrade office furniture. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I probably would have done so, paid everything I could before the end of the year, bought new office equipment and furniture ... but paid for the actual expenses at the time of application, and there is no guarantee that my company will win the competition.  And if not, then the money went down the drain ... Not grant support to start-up entrepreneurs, but a stupid write-off of expenses. <br><br>  PS And everything is probably due to the fact that people who have worked all their lives for work who do not know what entrepreneurship is in principle, are trying to help this very entrepreneurship.  The ideas are new, and the methods of work are the same. <br><br>  In principle, in the proposed concept there is nothing bad, so the money would go at all is not clear where.  For companies, the cost recovery for 300t.r.  nice opportunity, but then you need to review the entire procedure for obtaining a grant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99688/</a></p>
