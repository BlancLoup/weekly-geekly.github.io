Yes, time is running fast - it seemed that only recently we all began to use the Internet encyclopedia, and encyclopedias have been around for many years.  As is known, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">the resource is based on</a> Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, a financier and philosopher. <br><br>  According to the founders, Wikipedia is not just a site, but "a symbol of the era of interaction in which we live, and it is not just a tool, it is the embodiment of a dream as ancient as human intellect and the collection of the Alexandrian Library." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-_0DKPwFXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfGsX7yRo5-guHSzYkhNNj-3ifOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      Wikipedia has many achievements.  So, a lot of people working on the resource speak in 277 languages.  Attendance of the encyclopedia is also enormous.  In the last month of last year, 2.5 billion people visited the resource.  One of the most popular is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Russian-language section of Wikipedia</a> , which is among the five largest.  There are more than a million articles here. <br><br>  In general, this is no longer just an encyclopedia, but the wealth of our entire civilization.  There is a huge amount of information on Wikipedia, and there is hardly any doubt that Wiki is one of the most sought-after and useful resources in the world. <br><br>  Among other interesting facts related to Wikipedia, it is worth mentioning the following: <br><ul><li>  To read all materials only in the English-language section, an ordinary person will need 16 years; </li><li>  The first photo uploaded to the Wiki server is partridges; </li><li>  One of the first articles was about poodles; </li><li>  Wikipedia now has 38 million pages in 291 languages; </li><li>  The fewest articles are in the Creek language (Creek, Mvskoke), it is spoken by some tribes of North American Indians; </li><li>  The first Russian-language article on the resource appeared in 2004; </li><li>  A German court considers Wikipedia to be a reliable source of information. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Most edited articles </h3><br>  Since everyone can work on the materials of this encyclopedia, often the same article has to be edited many times.  There are several reasons for this - this is the correction of outdated information, the addition of new data, the correction of errors. <br><br>  On the day of its 15th anniversary, Wikipedia named the most edited articles.  As for the English-speaking segment, the most edited is the material about George W. Bush.  The article was edited almost 50 thousand times.  In second place is an article with a list of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) employees, which was edited 42,000 times.  In third place - the material on the United States, it has already ruled more than 35 thousand times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0b/b0c/d70/a0bb0cd706fb13d87687b4bad99b3ec4.jpg"><br><br>  As for the Russian-language segment of the runet, here <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2016/01/15/russkaya-vikipediya-nazvala-samye-chasto-redaktiruemye-stati-stalin-i-smeshariki">most often</a> edited an article about Joseph Stalin.  She was changed 9853 times.  On the second and third places are the article "Smeshariki" (7954 edits) and the article "Russia" (7941 edits).  Immediately after this is the article "Ukraine" with 7200 edits. <br><br><h3>  Cake from Roskomnadzor </h3><br>  As you know, this year Roskomnadzor <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/266234/">almost blocked</a> Wikipedia.  The reason is the discovery of articles about narcotic substances, which law enforcement authorities found to be contrary to the law. <br><br>  The conflict was settled, but its echoes will be heard for a long time.  According to Roskomnadzor, it was decided not to block the resource, since the controversial articles were edited accordingly. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/266532/">Representatives of the</a> online encyclopedia even <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/266532/">went to a</a> meeting with high-ranking officials of the department, and one of the participants in this group was subsequently <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/266552/">banned</a> and then <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/266886/">banned</a> . <br><br><h3>  What's next? </h3><br>  Undoubtedly, the importance of Wikipedia is becoming more and more common.  Already, this is one of the main sources of knowledge for many, and what will happen to Vika in the future can only be guessed at. <br><br>  In general, I would like to congratulate the indispensable resource and its founders on almost coming of age. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367609/</a></p>
