      This concept computer is primarily aimed at experts, engineers and hackers, but it is also available to any user who wants to fully control their privacy.  It became available thanks to a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena">successful kraufandingovaya campaign</a> , which has already surpassed the planned amounts of funds raised in 250,000 US dollars (collected 3 times more). <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/90679582&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhEML64ZMtAd_N-cS23Qot5mK-IVQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Novena Open Source Laptop" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe wanted to inspect and understand as many systems and components as possible, so if we are faced with bugs or other oddities in their behavior, we would like to rely on our own mind, and not on self-serving (often empty) promises of the manufacturer‚Äôs sales department.  As a result, we decided to release a laptop, which would have been deprived of embedded firmware with a closed code, ‚Äùsaid the authors of the initiative. <br><br>  For this reason, they chose Linux-based Debian as the operating system, and began to choose hardware that would be open to free configuration.  This allows the user to download layouts, documents, and know in detail how to build or modify the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/65d/faf/5c165dfaf9e9491da3733068cc141a36.jpg"><br><br>  The idea is that the user community can improve the code and each element of the terminal components at its discretion, or even replace them with others in accordance with their needs.  They can also add them without problems, unlike what happens in the case of regular laptops, which cannot be modified, because there is physically no place to place other objects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you want to add a pulse oximeter to <b>Novena</b> so that you can measure the level of oxygen in the blood passing through the capillaries in your fingers?  Or maybe a barometer so you can track the pressure in your room?  With the help of a few screws, you can fix your devices inside the Novena case, ‚Äùits creators say. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50a/d33/456/50ad33456b3e4f6d937c3375c9e1b44e.jpg"><br><br>  Due to this versatility, the computer is quite seriously different from what we are used to seeing in the market.  Firstly, it looks a little different, being a bit big and clumsy, like laptops from the beginning of 2000. Secondly, it does not work as well as products that work under Windows or Mac OS X, despite its higher price. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFrankly speaking, we will not flatter ourselves that we could create a laptop that will be faster, less or cheaper than Apple, Dell or HP,‚Äù says Huang.  "However, we set out to build a machine that is powerful enough and comfortable for everyday use." <br><br>  And this is more than enough for hundreds of people who are primarily puzzled by their security and privacy issues, because  they have already made a bid for this innovative product, as evidenced by the success of the kraufanding project.  If you look at the world in which we live, after the revelations of Edward Snowden, then such an initiative will always be in demand. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSuch transparency is unprecedented,‚Äù say the creators of Novena.  ‚ÄúWe hope that it will become an example for other engineers who will follow our example and help users regain their technological independence.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271629/</a></p>
