Screens of 50-55 inches, which seemed huge only a few years ago, are now commonplace and are sold in any decent electronics store.  They, according to my observations, offer the most profitable combination of screen size and price. <br><br>  But to the devil a benefit!  Our patient today is the 75-inch monster <b>Samsung UE75HU7500</b> , the exact model name of the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/nl/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/uhd-tv/UE75HU7500LXXN">Samsung UE75HU7500LXXN</a> (since I live in the Netherlands, the device version is also appropriate).  Price recommended by the manufacturer: <b>5499 euros</b> . <br><br>  This is one of the largest televisions of the company, available on a mass market today;  there are only ‚Äúbent‚Äù 78-inch <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN78JU7500FXZA">78JU7500</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN78HU9000FXZA">78HU9000</a> and a megahonder <a href="http://www.samsung.com/nl/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/uhd-tv/UE85HU7500LXXN">85HU7500</a> with a diagonal of 85 " <a href="http://www.samsung.com/nl/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/uhd-tv/UE85HU7500LXXN">larger</a> - but their prices are absolutely exorbitant (85-inch model costs ten thousand euros).

In the design, I like the functional minimalism, so the desired configuration of the living room was this: a TV on the wall, a sofa opposite.  But with a room width of five meters, the TV should be of an appropriate size, at least 60-65 inches. <br><br>  Since the panel was supposed to be placed on the wall, the ‚Äúcurved‚Äù varieties disappeared immediately - they benefit in image quality, especially when viewed from a short distance, but they look rather awkward when hung on the wall. <br><br>  If we buy a large TV, then it makes sense to choose a model with a reserve for the future, with support for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">Ultra HD</a> .  In this regard, Samsung noticeably gains from other manufacturers (LG, Sony, Philips), offering similar models (in size, functions, quality), one and a half times cheaper. <br><br>  Samsung UE75HU7500 - LED-TV of the latest generation of the company (model 2014).  It supports Ultra HD (4K video), as well as 3D video (using special glasses). <br><br>  I'll start with a brief listing of characteristics. <br><br><a name="specs"></a><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">  <b>System</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  -

In any case, I have not managed so far. <br><br><a name="unboxing"></a><br><h2>  Unpacking </h2><br>  The box of this TV is immense, it is almost two meters in length and a little more than a meter in height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebf/2f6/069/ebf2f60698bf2385a9ba504c35d75fe7.jpg"><br><br>  Here it is in comparison with the chair - for scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f9/f06/abe/1f9f06abe6b6ff369fa592cd2ba13a1c.jpg"><br><br>  It weighs more than fifty kilos, so that it is almost impossible to cope with it alone.  At the same time, it is only 25 cm in thickness, which must be taken into account when unpacking - it is not particularly resistant.  By the way, what is it written there? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1bc/d31/6eb/1bcd316eb5dc0b309c3e73ecae887a67.jpg"><br><br>  Saved on HDMI-cable for five euros from TV for five thousand.  And they were not even ashamed to write about it on the packaging. <br><br>  The upper part of the box can be easily removed if you remove the plastic latches located below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b37/bf0/3d5/b37bf03d516c0c9e91323e7694c774ad.jpg"><br><br>  The panel is held in a vertical position with only foam inserts in the corners, so you should not deal with unpacking this device in case of an earthquake.  Remove excess foam, take out both parts of the stand and a box with accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/680/eda/4e2/680eda4e29af122c7a507e571271aa13.jpg"><br><br>  Here is all that is included in the kit: two remotes with batteries, plastic sleeves for mounting the VESA-bracket, a power cord, an infrared emitter, an adapter for CI +, two pairs of 3D glasses and instructions.  HDMI cable really is not, hmm ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/788/f25/cbb/788f25cbba4f5317ce490aee87f60397.jpg"><br><br>  Gently attaching the panel to the stand (for the first time), we include the monster in the network.  The first thing you notice is the noise of the cooler!  Yes, yes, there is a cooler in this TV and it is heard quite well. <br><br>  The setup wizard starts and asks the first thing to connect the device to the lively Internet - the benefit of both Ethernet and Wi-Fi is already built in. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d04/55b/d1f/d0455bd1f06e7743edaa435a1645b40a.jpg"><br><br>  Then follow a few more screens with all sorts of things, like a license agreement and privacy policy.  It is the turn to connect an infrared emitter (IR Extender) - a small plastic washer with a wire ending with a standard 3.5 mm plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0b/2d1/38f/a0b2d138f820c8970e43dbc2c608ff1e.jpg"><br><br>  The plug is plugged into a special socket on the back of the TV, and the washer must be put in front of the cable TV decoder (set-top box): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c5/0a4/0f9/6c50a40f94a235ed94fa31e8724c444d.jpg"><br><br>  This mechanism allows the TV to independently manage the decoder, including its power, changing channels or calling the program guide (TV guide), and this is extremely convenient. <br><br>  The tenth, final, screen promises that the TV will become smarter every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/d07/2a7/eb1d072a7930b6c17b5be5a439f1e151.jpg"><br><br><br><a name="overview"></a><br><h2>  Looking around </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08b/c65/97c/08bc6597c2253ea7351c1db9f392c687.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like a monster, admittedly, quite stylish.  Very thin metal screen frame and the complete absence of any foreign objects on the front panel.  The stand made of pure aluminum pulls on seven (!) Kilograms. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18f/e9c/2eb/18fe9c2eb411c1380d958b4474969b3f.jpg"><br><br>  In profile, it is very thin, only 38 millimeters excluding the stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b76/55b/8ba/b7655b8ba6cb22c9598ea6f25a180b52.jpg"><br><br>  Directly below the screen is the blue power indicator, which can be configured via the TV menu (always on, always off, on with the TV): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0c/f53/da0/a0cf53da03ba3e31f16b8b6626b48273.jpg"><br><br>  Rear panel of the device: left connector block, in the middle four holes for the VESA-arm for mounting on the wall, to the right is the power cable socket.  In the lower left corner is a tiny joystick, which can be used to control the basic functions of the TV in the absence of the remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/696/1e9/259/6961e92597ef6dd4a26cf863e00b3ec2.jpg"><br><br><a name="connectivity"></a><br><h2>  Connection </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ba/e48/95e/1bae4895e18ef6c39787b0980b37de47.jpg"><br><br>  What we have: <br><ul><li>  Two USB 2.0 ports </li><li>  One USB 3.0 port </li><li>  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/SEK-2500U/ZA">One Connect Box</a> Connector </li><li>  Optical audio output </li><li>  Four HDMI inputs </li><li>  Satellite Dish Nest </li><li>  Coaxial antenna jack </li><li>  IR emitter jack </li><li>  Headphone output (completely hellish location, I must say) </li><li>  Some kind of service connector </li><li>  Ethernet RJ-45 </li><li>  One scart </li><li>  Combined composite component input </li><li>  CI / CI + adapter connector </li></ul><br><br>  Not so much, but nowadays the main thing is what?  That's right, HDMI, and there are already four of them. <br><br>  If you have an extra four hundred euros, you can spend them on the aforementioned <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/SEK-2500U/ZA">One Connect Box</a> .  When using it, all devices are connected through it, and a single cable goes to the TV. <br><br>  From the AV inputs I used only HDMI.  TV does not support, unfortunately, the connection to the local network via HDMI (HDMI with Ethernet), so Ethernet (100 Mbps) must be connected separately.  But there is support for Anynet + (HDMI-CEC), a system that allows you to control other devices via HDMI. <br><br>  The TV also has two analog and two digital tuners (!), But all this wealth was not useful to me.  Analogue terrestrial television has not existed in Holland for many years, although some cable providers still provide it.  Digital terrestrial TV (DVB-T) is, but only three state channels and several regional channels are broadcast on it.  But they are all in my cable package, and at the same time in Full HD-quality. <br><br>  There is also an input and a decoder for a satellite dish, and the TV even supports antenna positioning (rotation) antennas (DiSEqC 1.2, USALS). <br><br><a name="camera"></a><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  Samsung not only saved on the HDMI cable;  there is also no camera in the standard kit - I cannot say that I approve of this approach. <br><br>  Only Samsung's USB camera works with these TVs, and besides the considerable price (about 100 euros), for some reason, it turned out to be a rather rare bird, which we managed to find with some effort.  In the end, I ordered the required model <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/VG-STC4000/ZA">VG-STC4000</a> on eBay. <br><br>  The camera is mounted on a sort of ‚Äúknee‚Äù with two hinges, which allow to fix it on the top edge of the TV in different positions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fc/036/484/6fc0364846e13847da0e72e37fdcac65.jpg"><br><br>  It also has a stereo microphone and a mechanical shutter, which can cover the lens when not in use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/273/51d/97f/27351d97fe811be314f1c033e28f3289.jpg"><br><br>  The maximum resolution of the camera is 1920 √ó 1080.  It is used, for example, in Skype, as well as for controlling gestures and recognizing faces. <br><br><a name="remotes"></a><br><h2>  Remote controls </h2><br>  With this TV in the kit, two remotes come at once, one traditional, the other - the so-called Smart Touch Control, shaped like a remnant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/879/91e/177/87991e17729e43652f15ea2789098a33.jpg"><br><br>  With traditional remote everything is clear, it uses a conventional infrared channel to communicate with the TV. <br><br>  The second, "remnant" has some interesting features.  On the IR, he transmits only the on / off command, and everything else works via Bluetooth;  In this regard, he has a certain delay in the reaction after a minute of inactivity - the radio falls asleep and it takes time to reconnect (thanks to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/navion/" class="user_link">navion</a> for the clarification). <br><br>  In addition to the minimal set of buttons (the ones that are ingeniously shaped, are quite convenient), it has a large oval mega-button in the center.  If you just put your finger on it, the console turns into a sort of mouse - a light spot appears on the screen, which serves as a pointer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80f/4b7/cd1/80f4b7cd164e2e0052468bb1bdaee60f.jpg"><br><br>  You can move the spot by tilting the ‚Äúmouse‚Äù in different directions (there are gyroscopes in the console to track its position in space), to ‚Äúclick‚Äù you just need to click on this megacutter.  If you lift your finger from the button, the stain disappears.  This is very convenient and generally works quite well. <br><br>  It is especially convenient to use mouse mode for typing on the on-screen keyboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9be/8f6/8ce/9be8f68cea2d17ac480d7d82efb54fa1.jpg"><br><br>  The megacup button is also a touchpad, with which you can, for example, scroll the page in the browser horizontally or vertically.  This, unfortunately, works rather clumsily. <br><br>  But that's not all.  If you press the Voice button, the TV volume decreases, and the voice input icon appears on the screen.  At the very top of the Smart Touch Control there is a microphone, and voice commands are supposed to be dictated there.  The system supports several dozens of teams (right up to ordering movies and searching for programs), but the implementation is again lame - I could hardly find a common language with my TV. <br><br>  If the two remotes are not enough for you, you can connect a regular keyboard and / or mouse, and both USB and Bluetooth connections are supported.  In the case of a keyboard, the function keys are responsible for the specific functions of the TV (for example, F6 = Source, F7 = channel list, F8 = Mute, etc.). <br><br>  Another newfangled thing is gesture control.  If you have a camera, you can move the cursor with the palm of your hand and ‚Äúclick‚Äù, bending the finger.  However, whether my finger was of the wrong design, or the illumination was inappropriate, I didn‚Äôt manage to start this business right away.  On the other hand, such a control system does not seem convenient to me - instead of long magical passes, it is much easier and faster to press a button on the remote. <br><br><a name="ir-extender"></a><br><h2>  IR emitter </h2><br>  The infrared emitter mentioned above can send signals to various devices, due to which, more often than not, the TV remote control is sufficient.  It‚Äôs enough to set it up once and the TV will turn the cable TV decoder on and off.  In addition, it allows you to switch channels, call the menu and program schedule: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/400/6d5/5ce/4006d55ce38868f26db47cb64b9dd6af.jpg"><br><br>  The mouse mode, of course, is not supported here (the decoder doesn‚Äôt know anything about it), so you can only navigate with arrows, but this is implemented quite well. <br><br><br><a name="apps"></a><br><h2>  Smart Hub and Apps </h2><br>  Interactive TV mode, the so-called Smart Hub, consists of four main screens. <br><br><h3>  Screen One: Applications </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a02/fb1/305/a02fb13052cbacac2000329cf55135cb.jpg"><br><br>  On the TV, you can install paid and free applications, this requires a Samsung account.  YouTube, NetFlix, Spotify and a few more are already pre-installed right out of the box.  Applications can also be installed on external USB-drives, and, of course, update and delete. <br><br><h3>  Screen Two: OnTV </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/428/eb3/ef5428eb3c0e54c430aa0e995ea88786.jpg"><br><br>  If you specify your location and your provider when setting up, TV will be able to upload the program schedule from the Internet.  At the same time here in the window shows live-video from the current source. <br><br><h3>  Screen Three: Movie and TV Show Hire </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f9/a8f/902/6f9a8f902986cb5677d0678b08768c11.jpg"><br><br>  Here you can rent movies and shows.  What I have never done ... <br><br><h3>  Screen Four: Multimedia Devices </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9dd/f97/fbb/9ddf97fbbb5a9fe1f6f894d8430d571a.jpg"><br><br>  It displays connected USB drives and DLNA servers detected on the network;  It is also possible to connect some cloud services, such as Dropbox and SkyDrive.  Unfortunately, Samsung does not support (and does not even plan to) connect to network resources, such as SMB or NFS servers (some enthusiasts even create <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/samygo/">alternative firmware</a> with support for network drives). <br><br>  In my home network, it is most convenient, in my opinion, to use a DLNA server, which in turn can connect to a NAS.  <a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a> (formerly XBMC) does a great job with me with an activated UPnP server running on the Mac Mini.  You can just go through the folders and run movies directly on the network: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ee/d37/434/9eed37434b2215af8435c3e0a3f0ce0d.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Some applications </h3><br>  Skype starts and works well, but sometimes it hangs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07a/642/4c2/07a6424c299f3d6cd4757c66c24d8bf5.jpg"><br><br>  During the conversation, the camera automatically finds your face and gives you a zoom.  It looks pretty psychedelic.  But you can walk around the room, talking with the other person. <br><br>  Settings in the application at least, but among other things, there is a login mode on the face.  Recognition works fine, as far as I could see.  Mouse mode is supported. <br><br>  In the Spotify client, the mouse (Smart Touch) is not completely supported, so all navigation and even keyboard input are just buttons.  Also, unfortunately, there is no radio mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44c/700/21a/44c70021a33a60791ecb7119cc442b9c.jpg"><br><br>  The browser is quite functional and works well.  Only here scrolling on the touchpad on the Smart Touch behaves a bit unpredictable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e6/832/37a/6e683237a34f56ffc38760ddd8b44195.jpg"><br><br>  There is a "Favorites" and even the field of Google search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9d/d19/730/c9dd19730dc8b896ea2ba55a9b5b74ee.jpg"><br><br>  The YouTube app, it seems, does not (yet) support 4K video, which is getting bigger on this service.  But in it you can directly send video from a smartphone or tablet connected to a local network. <br><br><a name="video"></a><br><h2>  Video </h2><br>  The video player built into the TV has impressive support for formats and codecs.  Both FLV and MKV are supported, and even the new-fashioned H.265 and VP8 (WebM) codecs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa8/610/574/aa861057481c096b1e2ce7bfcacaf019.png"><br><br>  One of the main components of the unbelievable price of the device is the support of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">Ultra HD</a> video standard, it‚Äôs also 4K, it‚Äôs 2160p, that is 4096 √ó 2160 pixels (taking into account that the panel‚Äôs own resolution is 3840 √ó 2160, it is either cropped or scaled) . <br><br>  What can I say about 4K video?  First, the only way to view it turned out to connect the USB-drive.  My Mac Mini, which I use as a media PC, is only capable of 1920 √ó 1080.  When you try to play video over the network via DLNA, it noticeably ‚Äústumbles‚Äù. <br><br>  Secondly, the quality is, of course, amazing - the smallest details are visible, but!  This is if you stand no further than a meter and a half from the screen.  Already from a distance of two meters, video is visually not much different from Full HD (partly due to the very high-quality upscaling of HD video in this TV).  I usually watch TV from a sofa about five meters away (and, what‚Äôs already there, it‚Äôs rather stupid to stand a meter from such a TV). <br><br>  Thirdly, 4K-video as such is almost absent in nature: basically only demos of TV manufacturers are available.  In addition, the files are huge.  The only source of Ultra HD video I know is <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/13444">Netflix</a> , but considering the previous point, does it really need it? <br><br>  In general, for the time being, I see support for 4K as an investment in the future. <br><br>  As for the 3D video, everything is OK.  The TV recognizes the 3D video stream one-by-one or side-by-side and offers to switch to 3D mode.  In addition, it has the function of auto-conversion 2D to 3D, the meaning of which is not very clear to me.  My personal opinion is that 3D generally adds little to the experience of watching movies. <br><br>  Let's go back to the video player.  Its interface is simple, like a Kalashnikov assault rifle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b74/6bf/ba6/b746bfba689038c419feeb463c31a6dc.jpg"><br><br>  It is very good that subtitles are supported - both embedded and separate files (.srt, .sub, .psb, etc.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af3/3a8/90e/af33a890e26e14ae5bbbfbc4bdd707a5.jpg"><br><br>  You can also go by chapters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edb/f7f/10d/edbf7f10d39d7f0c494b01f18135098f.jpg"><br><br>  And, most often, rewind to an arbitrary place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7d/164/0bc/b7d1640bc0bbaaf1c1bbc3260cb80406.jpg"><br><br><a name="audio"></a><br><h2>  Audio </h2><br>  Supported Audio Formats: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08b/80f/eef/08b80feef90fae1b441f5f1959f44135.png"><br><br>  The audio player is also rather uncomplicated, and besides, a few ... ah ... big for such a screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fb/79b/157/6fb79b1572e6fee9c1a1219edac8e612.jpg"><br><br>  The sound system on the TV is of very decent quality (for the blackboard form factor). <br><br><a name="omt"></a><br><h2>  One more thing </h2><br>  This TV appeared exactly on the eve of last year's World Cup, and one of its killer features advertised "football mode" (for which the Smart Touch Control even has a <i>separate</i> button).  If it is activated, the grass becomes unreal, poisonous green, and the noise of the stadium increases noticeably. <br><br>  In general, this mode (and in this I agree with other observers) is quite specific and <strike>stupid,</strike> and I personally do not need it.  Yes, and I do not watch football. <br><br><a name="recap"></a><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br>  It is impossible to tell about all the features of this model in one post, especially since I have not tried them all myself.  To summarize my impressions of the device: <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  Large, high-quality, clear and contrast screen </li><li>  Very thin </li><li>  Stylish performance </li><li>  A large number of built-in functions </li><li>  Excellent support for video and audio formats </li><li>  Very high refresh rate (1000 Hz) + high-quality upscaling HD video </li><li>  High-quality built-in sound </li><li>  Two remote controls included, one of which can operate in mouse mode </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Price (currently on catalog ‚Ç¨ 5499) </li><li>  The size and weight allow you to move the device only together </li><li>  Not all functions are usable. </li><li>  Quite noticeable noise in the silence of the cooler </li><li>  Episodic interface slowdowns </li></ul><br><br>  In general, the operating experience of the TV is positive.  The "iron" part is made, in my opinion, flawlessly.  In terms of software, there are, of course, some flaws and roughness, but without them.  In addition, the TV is periodically updated via the Internet. <br><br>  If you have questions, I will be happy to answer them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377343/</a></p>
