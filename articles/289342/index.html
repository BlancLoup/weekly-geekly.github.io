  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a company. Exit from the comfort zone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Who creates the company?  Investor?  Initiator (idea carrier)?  Or is it a performer who performs those very real actions, without which the creation of a company would be physically impossible?  This question also applies to a new product of an existing company, or, in another way, to expanding business.  Who is the beginning of a successful organization?  When you finish reading this publication, you will probably have an answer to the question of what needs to be done to realize your (even the most ambitious) desires and how it relates to the comfort zone. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, if we consider separately each member of the project-founder of a business, then it can be noted that none of them individually will create (expand) a particular business, acting in isolation from the other partner.  Based on this, it is logical to assume that a business is created by a group of individuals: someone comes up with (creates) an idea, a correct business plan is drawn up by a competent performer, and an investor is found who finances the project.  An ideal circuit, isn't it?  What prevents it from being implemented? <br>  One well-known author in the field of improving business efficiency, Yitzhak Adizes, to achieve the ultimate goal, regardless of its type, identifies 4 types of people (project managers): <br><br>  1) Head - MANUFACTURER <br><br>  2) Head - ADMINISTRATOR

      3) Manager - ENTREPRENEUR <br><br>  4) Head - INTEGRATOR <br><br>  And yet, how does the comfort zone intersect with the types of project managers during its implementation?  See the answer below. <br><br>  If we analyze the above chain of creation (expansion) of the business ‚ÄúIdea ‚Üí plan ‚Üí financing ‚Üí implementation‚Äù, then it is impossible to overlook the critical role of each member of the company's management.  The entrepreneur has the idea (he justifies why the new project will bring profit), the administrator organizes the system, the manufacturer solves the applied questions, and the integrator unites all members under one authority.  That is, without one or another manager, the project will a priori be stillborn: if there is no idea (entrepreneur), then obviously there is no project.  If there is no administrator, then there will be no proper planning and systematization, which will lead to chaos.  If there is no manufacturer (performer), then the whole idea will remain at the level of plans.  And, perhaps the most controversial element, is the head integrator.  Without it, the team of the above members will be lonely talents who, individually, will be much more effective than with joint interaction.  In other words, the integrator brings people together and tries to make their work more efficient in collaboration. <br><br>  That is, we see that the project will be implemented and will bring profit if all four types of managers unite under one authority.  It looks quite nice on paper and is easy to implement in large projects, where investment and payback is not always the primary indicator.  It is much more difficult to implement this chain of ‚ÄúIdea ‚Üí plan ‚Üí financing ‚Üí implementation‚Äù of a new company, or a company without serious indicators in the market.  What then should be done by an entrepreneur who cannot decide to launch their project?  We finally got to the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe article.  For entrepreneurship, it is vital to get out of the comfort zone and make it so that the right people also leave their zones. <br><br>  How is it shown?  Imagine you are at your main job and you have an excellent idea for a new business.  You think that, say, a new type of sushi delivery will bring you a profit.  Or do you know that the local pizzeria makes not enough tasty pizza and you can easily create a company, the main difference of which will be the manufacture of pizza according to an old Italian recipe, which you will bring personally with a chef from Italy.  That is, when you are at work, where all thoughts are focused on productivity and ingenuity, an idea that you like is born in your head.  My examples above can be replaced by any one that occurred to you in the past few years, even the craziest.  The idea (desire) to live in your head does not require any investment (and you need to use it) and has the right to exist. <br><br>  But the inexplicable happens.  You come home from work, and all thoughts about the new company disappear at the sight of a hungry cat, a fresh news feed on Vkontakte, for some reason a leaky pipe in the kitchen ... Domestic problems can be predictable or not, but the atmosphere for creating your business is lost in this everyday routine, in this old comfort zone, when solving everyday problems already seems like success in life.  Familiar situation, is not it?  Unfortunately, this is only imaginary success.  I asked many of my acquaintances who, in my opinion, are smart enough and competent to create their own business, are they ready to start their own business now and what is stopping them from doing so.  And the answer was often that there is now no money or too little of it.  However, I asked again: that is, sometimes you thought that you could do this or that business, but then you came back home, faced with everyday problems and thoughts about your company faded into the background?  The respondents had their eyes lit up for a second, then they bashfully lowered them down and said sadly that it was this reason that stopped them from an entrepreneurial career.  And the lack of money is a bright and very accessible excuse. <br><br>  <b>We conclude.</b>  <b>For the productive activity of creating your own enterprise, in the absolute majority of cases a constant working atmosphere is required, especially for a new company, where its participants are not even fully known.</b>  <b>To create your own company, sitting in a comfortable home chair, not many have turned out, and these cases are only exceptions than the rule.</b>  <b>It is important to get out of your comfort zone, and do it better in the company of like-minded people.</b> <br><br>  Are you an aspiring entrepreneur?  Do you doubt whether to open your own business?  Great, I see that you have a desire.  Decide what goals will help you realize this desire, and solve the problem setting goals to achieve these goals.  All that bothers you at the moment is your comfort zone, which stifles your entrepreneurial efforts.  Get out of it and take the people you need with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289342/</a></p>
