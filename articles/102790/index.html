  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Potato promotion business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time, your own site spoke of "many things".  At least the fact that the organization (person) is very wealthy and can afford it.  Now about the "many things" will say the absence of such, because each organization has its own website. <br><br>  And when these sites became very many, the question arose of how to promote them.  Bred hundreds of thousands of seo-blogs with dubious advice.  The main one is promotion in social networks.  It may seem that social networks are our everything!  What is worth creating a group of Vkontakte, and thousands of visitors will rush to your site and start buying, buying!  Promotion in the social sphere is such a necessary basis, everyone knows about it. <br><br>  They know not only in the center, but also on the periphery.  After all, if "there" do so, then we must.  They think so in Belarus.  In a country that is a white spot in so many areas: economics and marketing are no exception. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The other day, one site overflowed my patience.  He is a vivid example of how trying to promote your Internet business in Belarus, in other words, how well-known truths of Internet marketing do not work in blue-eyed.  My experimental was the "First Belarusian portal about the door."  It sounds cool.  To be a pioneer in a certain business - a niche, what else can you dream of !?

      - How can we make our site popular and business profitable? <br>  - It is necessary to spin it! <br>  - But as? <br>  - It's obvious, let's register in social programs! <br><br>  Something like this, I imagine the conversation of the director of this company with my marketer.  And what?  But in actual fact everything turned out to be rather sad. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/d/e/upload/d74dbb8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Four icons proudly flaunt in the first column: twitter, Vkontakte, facebook and ya.ru.  Link to the giant of social networks turned out to be bat.  A pity, such a huge piece of my analysts was unclaimed!  Let's start with twitter, because he even won the whole news on the site!  Information about the occasion was the news about "clothing for Twitter."  Moreover, they thank for this ‚Äútailors‚Äù from twides.ru.  Contact the studio to make background for twitter?  Yes, these guys Nemer money!  On the other hand, it turns out that every second who changed the background in his account can already call himself a studio. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/6/b/upload/ec707403.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of writing, 22 followers had ‚Äúdoors‚Äù.  Tweets do not always correspond to the topic, they do not have a tag.  For comparison, take my photoblog, because we use similar methods.  I connected the RSS feed to twitterfeed, and it, in turn, to accounts on twitter and facebook.  I have more than a hundred followers on Twitter and more than two hundred in Facebook.  Each post has a #photo tag.  Thus, the link to the published photo is seen not only by my friends, but also in the search results of Twitter.  With all these nuances of clicks on the links are rare.  I dare to suggest that there are no links through tweets at the ‚Äúdoors‚Äù at all. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/d/9/upload/5983f450.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why?!  What did we do wrong?  Let's think about it.  We open alexa.com and see (data for Belarus) that visitors to Twitter are childless working women of 25-44 years old who have a higher education.  I suppose they are looking there ... well, whatever, but not the door.  At the same time, the popularity of Twitter in Belarus is only in 10th place *. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/8/8/upload/7af15888.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Symbolically looks like a single account, followed by the "door".  As can be seen from the description, this is the ‚Äúinternational trademark‚Äù.  During the writing of the article, they scored 6 followers. <br><br>  Then I mention ya.ru.  I will mention, because there is no registration on this service and I can‚Äôt say anything about it.  The club "door" 5 members.  I think that says it all. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/d/0/upload/94a2c0b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/4/c/upload/f15ebd8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It remains only Vkontakte.  Here, at first glance, things are going better.  The site in the first place in attendance in the republic.  In a group of more than three thousand people.  At the same time on the wall regularly appears spam from competitors, would-be marketers with wedding photos on the avatar. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/1/9/upload/6e4126fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But what do we really have?  The share of Belarusian visitors Vkontakte - 3%.  Most of them are 18-24-year-old boys, students who ‚Äúbrowse‚Äù Vkontakte from home.  Let's predict what is their solvency? .. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/a/c/upload/3b609b0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/0/0/upload/88a2eb01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Working in the construction market for 3 years, I came to this conclusion.  95% of the construction market is provided with budget orders.  In the same state-run organizations, Soviet-era construction superintendents still make sockets and paint the porches with oil paint.  In addition, there is a ban on the purchase of non-Belarusian products for budget objects in the country, and since this is 95% of the market ... Therefore, the doors in the houses will be supplied by those manufactured at some Belarusian enterprise.  And since the foremen Vkontakte do not sit, the only effective method of promoting their products and services in the construction industry is a "kickback", well, or a bribe, call it what you want.  This Belarusian marketing ends.  It turns out that the whole business is ‚Äúmuddied‚Äù for the sake of 5% of the market of private cottages and apartments.  What else can I say?  Good luck! <br><br>  * - <a href="http://marketing.by/main/market/analytics/0035586/">marketing.by</a> research data </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102790/</a></p>
