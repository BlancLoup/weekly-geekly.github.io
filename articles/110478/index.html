    <h4>  1. The lack of a proprietary concept (logo, slogan, etc.). </h4><br>  The first thing that my view rests on entering a page is the site logo and slogan below it.  And the blessing, if on the sites of shops there is at least a logo.  Of the 50 stores issued by Google for various competitive inquiries, there was no logo for 6. Not so much, but not so little. <br><br>  Many owners of online stores simply do not understand (personally asked) - a huge part of sales is built on the brand.  A person has a number of cells in his head, filled with brands of well-known companies.  For example, "headphones - Koss", "operating system - MacOS X", "soda - Coca-Cola", etc.  etc.  The first priority of the concept company is to fill in the ‚Äúonline store -?‚Äù Box with your name.  Then the user will return again and again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, if you sell children's books, instead of just writing ‚ÄúFairybooks.ru‚Äù in the header of the site, write ‚ÄúFairyBooks‚Äù add a logo with a fabulous book, and write a thread slogan, like ‚ÄúYour roads to a fairy tale‚Äù, or "Books for visionaries" (and the like).  Add a couple of fabulous illustrations in the corners of the site, correct the fonts - and voila, you founded the FairyBooks brand.  And thinking about the next book for your baby, parents will not go to Google, but to your website, remembering the colorful logo, the funny wizard in the corner of the site and the sounding slogan. <br><br>  Yes, maybe I'm carping.  But I am a perfectionist, and I love when everything is beautiful.  And since you have already decided to engage in online sales, make sure that he is remembered.  And not as the most inconspicuous site of the Runet, but as a bright, trustworthy brand.  Otherwise, why then begin at all? <br><br><h4>  2. Oversaturation of information on the main page. </h4><br>  After the logo and slogan, I translate a look at the design and interface.  And what do I see? <br><br>  Same as web studios.  I, as a copywriter, marketer, site developer, etc.  By whom I worked there, I think - at first there is a desire to buy some thing, and then a site is searched.  Not the other way around.  That is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the user, getting to the main page of the online store, already knows (or guesses) what particular product he needs.  Or at least a category.  In addition, many users (from the same Google and Yandex.Market) go directly to the product page, because the main page is not visited at all.  The exception is the New Year and holidays, when people choose gifts, but even here it can be limited to stocks and, for example, labels (below). <br><br>  But what do we see on the main page? <br><ul><li>  dollar rates (cash, non-cash, VAT, webmoney, etc.); </li><li>  site menu (delivery, contacts, etc.); </li><li>  category menu (TVs, refrigerators, etc.); </li><li>  block "Top sales" (the best-selling products from all categories); </li><li>  ‚ÄúSale‚Äù block (probably indicates sections in which a sharp decline in prices was noticed, but I didn‚Äôt understand anything so much); </li><li>  block "Shares" (pictures with stock descriptions that change each other); </li><li>  Block "Action" (text description of another one of any action); </li><li>  ‚ÄúProduct Search‚Äù block (search line); </li><li>  ‚ÄúQuick model selection‚Äù block (3 drop-down fields with huge tree-like lists); </li><li>  block "Recommended products" (apparently, those that need to be delivered most quickly); </li><li>  ‚ÄúNew Arrivals‚Äù block (the last items added to the database); </li><li>  ‚ÄúPromotional goods‚Äù block (probably, goods at reduced prices, visually this is not noticeable at all); </li><li>  block "Articles" (picture, sentence, link); </li></ul><br>  And that's not counting advertising banners.  I practically sweated while reading all this, and then listed.  Fear and horror. <br><br>  My version of how things really should have been: <br><ul><li>  site menu; </li><li>  categories menu; </li><li>  Block "Stocks" (changing pictures to clearly describe the stock); </li><li>  the block ‚ÄúSearch for goods‚Äù (active search line, which when entering the first 3 letters of the name immediately gives a drop-down list of relevant products); </li><li>  block ‚ÄúTop sales‚Äù (if everyone buys, then there is a great chance that this is interesting to the user, that is / can be used as ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù, no one forbids juggling); </li><li>  News block (to show that we are still alive); </li></ul><br>  True, the news can be thrown out if you back up the site with an online chat, and a prominent indication of contacts (with Skype and / or icq). <br><br>  Why did I exclude the remaining blocks?  First, I immediately removed those whose value I don‚Äôt understand at all (‚ÄúSale‚Äù, ‚ÄúAction‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuick model selection‚Äù).  Course bucks - why do I need to know him, if I have not even chosen a product, show when paying.  Articles - oh well, I did not come to read, but to buy, a detailed description with reviews was enough.  Promotional goods - why are they not in the ‚ÄúShares‚Äù block?  And if there are a lot of them, why not show them in the category itself? <br><br>  By the way, it's worth remembering about the New Year, as I promised above.  If the number of New Year discounts is too large to fit into one block "Promotions", then you can, of course, add the block "The Best New Year Gifts."  But, there is a better solution - labels.  That is, the user simply enters the desired category, and in the corner of the pictures of goods he sees various labels - either a 20% discount, or bells (‚ÄúBest New Year's Gift‚Äù), or coins (‚ÄúBest Price‚Äù), or something something else.  Nobody limits the scope of fantasy, but it will greatly simplify the lives of users.  Especially if you make a small filter for labels. <br><br><h4>  3. Indistinctness of internal pages of the goods </h4><br>  Having made my way through the interface jungle and after selecting the right product, I happily click on its heading and go to the internal page of the device.  But even here my torment does not end.  On the product page, be sure to: <br><ul><li>  internal product code; </li><li>  internal manufacturer code; </li><li>  product photo; </li><li>  a brief description of the product (listing characteristics); </li><li>  indication of the bonus to the product; </li><li>  data on the delivery of goods; </li><li>  phone number by which I can order the goods; </li><li>  price of goods (in two currencies); </li><li>  price of goods on credit; </li><li>  the button ‚ÄúTracking the price‚Äù (apparently, regularly sends to the mail me the statistics of price changes); </li><li>  ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù button; </li><li>  social buttons  Networks (‚ÄúShare‚Äù, ‚ÄúTell a Friend‚Äù, ‚ÄúPost It!‚Äù, Etc.); </li><li>  voting buttons for the product; </li><li>  a menu of product tabs (Description, Accessories, Modifications, Reviews, Reviews, Photos, Videos, etc., and the number 0 in most sections glows proudly); </li><li>  a complete description of the goods (ice cream + listing of characteristics); </li><li>  a list of similarly priced product categories; </li><li>  list of the most popular products of the category; </li></ul><br>  Firstly, the problem is the same as the main one - a lot of information, most of which are not really needed.  Secondly, some information is generally duplicated. <br><br>  The output is the most obvious - jQuery-buttons, with traveling (without rebooting) info.  Clicked on "Credit" - received info on credit for this product.  Clicked on the "Delivery" - got info about the nuances of delivery.  Etc.  Even if the block is useless, it will torture the user in the form of a button much less, because it will see a neat page with the name of the product, its photo, a brief description, price, and a small sweet line of buttons. <br><br>  In case you still prefer the tabs with a reboot, then make a simple feature - tabs in which 0 materials should not be displayed.  Then their number will decrease almost twice (on not the most popular products) and the user will be much more convenient. <br><br><h4>  4. Low response speed. </h4><br>  And so I (finally) chose the right product, I am ready to pay for it, but, as a reasonable person, I want to be sure that I will receive my order.  To do this, I go to the news (I look at the latest publication date), and / or write to a couple of managers in ICQ / Skype, and / or write to the built-in chat on the site.  Having made sure that the company works, everything is fine and I will receive my order, I pay the money. <br><br>  This is the perfect picture.  But in fact ... <br><ul><li>  Many online stores in fact there is no section "News", or something similar.  This is not critical, but it creates the feeling that the store has fallen asleep, closed, stopped in place, etc.  In addition, periodic updates of materials will only benefit both the brand and seo, </li><li>  Many online stores do not have icq / skype contacts of managers, and no chat is built in.  That is, if I want to verify the viability of the store, I have to call them in the office (spend my money), or write an e-mail (and how many times to wait for an answer).  Will I do it?  Hardly, rather go to another site. </li><li>  In more detail this question was described in the previous article .. </li></ul><br>  And often it turns out that the product is there, the price suits, and the store is silent like a fish.  We have to look for another, because the fear of throwing money to the wind has not been canceled. <br><br><h4>  5. Weak work with clients. </h4><br>  People love being cared for.  Especially if they do not expect it.  I recently ordered massage oil, and I was presented with a pack of good condoms.  Trifle, but nice.  And nowhere on the site about the gift was said.  And now I know exactly where I will order similar products in the future. <br><br>  Many shops ignore this factor.  Service, care, returns - in their opinion, this is something petty, not requiring attention.  But it is precisely because of these little things that the site can collapse. <br><br>  Therefore, firstly, do not be afraid to make your customers happy.  A small note of gratitude for the purchase, congratulations on the holiday, a small penny gift, the same minimum coupon or something else - all this will greatly increase the loyalty of your customers, and turn them into regular customers.  You just need to turn on the fantasy and catch fire with the desire :) <br><br>  Secondly, always pay attention to the service.  How sympathetic I am served by the store managers, and how clearly and clearly they will answer my questions, depends my sympathy (read, my desire to pay the store money).  If you think about it, the service can become your direct competitive advantage - do you know how many times I chose a technique at night?) On the other hand, boorish managers will forever spoil the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour store and cause shortfall in both my money and my friends / acquaintances. <br><br>  Thirdly, seriously work with the return processing service.  Yes, there is a marriage, drunk couriers, emergency, traffic jams, etc., but we are all human.  And if they solve my problem in the shortest possible time, apologize (and, maybe, give something small), then I will not only not be offended, but also increase my loyalty to the store at times.  After all, I will be sure that I will always get help.  In the opposite case (they‚Äôre freezing me for a long time), I‚Äôll not only forget about this store for all eternity, but in every way I can ruin his reputation through forums, friends, acquaintances, soc.  networks, etc.  And I will deliver this much more headache than if my problem was solved right away. <br><br>  ************************************************** ******************** <br><br>  On this, perhaps, everything.  I hope my advice will be useful to you. <br><br>  P.S.  If anyone has any ideas / topics / suggestions for the next article - welcome!) <br>  P.P.S.  If anyone needs advice on a topic, consultation, analytics or the like.  - welcome in PM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110478/</a></p>
