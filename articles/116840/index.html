Especially for them, we made a tariff plan, which for a modest fee allows any IT company to create its profile on Habr√©: you can tell about the field of activity, development stages, employees, vacancies and so on.  In the future, such a card will be easy to add a blog - just change the tariff plan. <br><br>  Additionally, you can customize widgets: social (Vkontakte, Facebook and Twitter) and informational (links and a block for broadcasting an arbitrary RSS feed). </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Appstorro.</b>  Tariff plan for those who develop applications or write about them often (reviews, digests, and so on).  If earlier publications of an advertising nature could be placed (according to the site rules) only in the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/i_am_advertising/">I am promoting</a> ‚Äù hub, then now owners of blogs with this tariff plan can have a full-fledged blog where they can talk about their (or not) products more freely. .  But please note that posting any other information in such a blog (event announcement, perforator review, etc.) is unacceptable - only that concerns applications.

      A feature of this tariff plan is the presence of the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù widget, in which you can beautifully decorate the necessary applications (for almost any platform). </li></ul><br>  Initially, there was another tariff plan <s>for the legalization of the black market</s> , ‚Äú <b>Obzverro</b> ‚Äù - so that the authors of reviews of glands did not write ‚Äúby the <i>way, this fifth tablet my friend my friend honestly bought for the mother-in-law <u>here,</u></i> ‚Äù and with a clear conscience they could indicate tests.  But after the influx of Chinese stores that could not link in Russian and the proposals, they decided to abandon this idea. <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/favicon.ico">  <b>New Widgets</b> <br>  Another innovation regarding companies.  First, we reworked the interface for adding widgets - now this process has become even simpler.  Secondly, the existing solutions for social networks Vkontakte and Facebook have been finalized.  Recently, Twitter support appeared - for broadcasting the necessary feed in the right column of the blog. <br><br>  New is the ‚Äú <b>Application</b> ‚Äù widget mentioned above.  Considering the fact that almost every company or project has at least one mobile (and even stationary) application, we decided to give an opportunity to talk about it in a prominent place, that is, in the right column of a corporate blog.  For the appearance of a new block, it is enough to add at least one application - we write the name and description of the program, load the image and add direct links for various platforms (mobile, stationary and web platforms are supported) - that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/785/1b9/f9c/7851b9f9c22ab7a3caa50e30bef8aed4.png"><br><br>  In the tariff plans, the allowable number of applications varies, but be that as it may, we advise all companies to fill out this block.  Well, users, accordingly, start paying attention to them;) You can see an example of a widget, for example, in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/">Evernote</a> company blog. <br><br>  For users, too, there are innovations - they are few, but they are sure that you will like them. <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/favicon.ico">  <b>Polls in posts</b> <br>  From today, the ability to create such type of publication as ‚ÄúPoll‚Äù (which were often minus, which is why there were few votes for statistics) was lost - now the poll can be created only as an addition to the publication, as in this post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/904/18e/8e6/90418e8e63e17ca94e84571950f7b60c.png"><br><br>  There can be several polls in the article, each can be with a choice of both one answer and several;  By default, all polls are not limited by voting time (to increase the number of votes over time), but the time limit function is provided.  If the publication uses the habrakat tag, then the poll will be only inside the post, if the post itself is small (without kata), then the poll will be right in the ribbon. <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/favicon.ico">  <b>Editing in Q &amp; A</b> <br>  Most recently, we made the opportunity to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154413/">edit our comments</a> (within 3 minutes after sending) - looking at your reaction, we decided to make the ability to edit in the Q &amp; A section: users can edit both the answers and the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5c/067/c68/a5c067c68cec045fb5a84f6b4688e866.png"><br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/favicon.ico">  <b>Authors Exchange</b> <br>  Some companies often have difficulty finding authors for their blog.  Those who would know all the subtleties of writing and design publications on the "Habr√©".  But at the same time, there are quite a few users on the site who in this case are ready to come to the rescue for the common good. <br><br>  Authors' exchange is a place for interaction between enthusiastic authors and companies.  The principle of operation is as simple as the world: the user (ready to write articles for corporate blogs on certain conditions) puts forward his candidacy, and the representatives of companies choose the appropriate author at their discretion (all users are sorted by rating).  All this can lead to mutually beneficial cooperation (both once and on a permanent basis) - all aspects of the party are negotiated independently in a convenient way for them.  Therefore, all interested users are encouraged to activate the corresponding setting on the post creation page.  The user page is available only to companies (inside the administration panel of your corporate blog). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c6/7e3/ee7/2c67e3ee7cf0ca40c2e198e02238edb8.png"><br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/favicon.ico">  <b>Error correction</b> <br>  Fixed a lot of errors that you reported to us through the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/feedback/">feedback form</a> . <br><br>  All the best and happy new year! <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116840/</a></p>
