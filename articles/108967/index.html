  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ethernet wiring, TP-Link router and OnLime provider</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> According to the laws of the genre, connecting to a new provider, it is customary to shower the old with something warm and foul-smelling.  Say, I was not given the speed, the connection was always breaking, the prices were badly scared, so I, unfortunate, and ran away.  I can‚Äôt say anything about Stream, which I spent six years on.  At the beginning of 2004, there were no alternatives to ADSL in my area, and, switching to it from dial-up, I kind of re-understood what the Internet is.  No, for six years, there have been glitches, and the lack of communication for several hours in a row, and dialing up to support service has infuriated.  But tell me, who has it wrong?  I remember that as an experiment I connected to one regional provider, and in a couple of months I gave it to my high speed and file archive, as it were.  Just because if ‚ÄúStream‚Äù had no internet for a couple of hours a month, then these vigorous guys - a couple of days a week, and without any explanation of the reasons. <br><br>  A year ago he moved to another apartment, he immediately connected Stream, and up to the present day there were no problems at all.  That is what it is.  But the phone was literally interrupted by all providers known in the capital.  Their specially trained girls convinced me that ADSL was an outdated technology, and I had to switch to progressive Ethernet.  In response, I proposed to look at the date of the invention of both of them in Wikipedia and kindly said goodbye. <br><br>  No, trying another technology was a passion as curious.  Moreover, the connection, as well as disconnection, is now free for all providers - at least check it out.  But between desire and its realization there were two serious obstacles. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The first is my own bungling.  During the repair of the current apartment, an electrician suggested that I do Ethernet wiring for rooms with a socket right near the entrance door.  A few dozen meters of cable in the walls, a simple switch, and no problems in the future.  But I, who decided to connect to the Stream, asked in bewilderment, but what for?  As a result, near my desktop, which, by chance, at the farthest point from the entrance, there was only a telephone jack.  Then I, of course, scolded myself, but it was too late.  The prospect of pulling the cable through the whole apartment on top of the repair was not entirely pleasing.  Just because it is impossible to quit it - or the child will stumble, or the wife will eat (not the cable - me).  Move furniture away, remove baseboards, drill walls - well, I‚Äôm not thinking, I will have a rest for three years from such things, I have been digging from my heart after moving.  Friends advised not to bathe and just put a WiFi access point at the entrance, and let all computers connect to it.  For many, I do not argue, this is a great option.  But my NAS is plowing around the clock, which accepts and gives you understand what.  The NAS is very cool (on the dual-core Intel Atom, <a href="http://vilianov.com/hard_upgrade/vse_protiv_nas/">it collected itself</a> ), but it has only Ethernet interface, and there is no place to put a standard PCI with WiFi.  On the USB NAS connect - without me, please.  It does not matter.  And if I find a low-profile card with WiFi, well, I don‚Äôt want ten-twenty megabits to be constantly occupied in an already not-too-thick wireless channel.  I have had WiFi separately for a long time, and a NAS connected by a cord to a router separately is good for everyone.  Beat me, minus, but I think the wired connection is optimal for home rocking servers. <br><br>  In general, I wrote a lot about the first obstacle, but I‚Äôll say briefly about the second one: ‚ÄúStream‚Äù worked fine, and did not want to seek good from good. <br><br>  But somewhere about a month ago, the Stream in our area (in Chertanovo) began to lag somehow.  I‚Äôm not a gamer, so I‚Äôm not particularly capricious, but when the pages start opening every other time, it‚Äôs not good at all.  At first I thought that the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/91007/">Netgear router</a> could not cope with the number of torrents, but no, disabling the rocking did not help.  I didn‚Äôt have a day to day, and sometimes everything flew, as they say, but sometimes ... And then a colleague gave me a set of two adapters for running the Internet through the wiring.  Their name is LevelOne PLI-2030. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17a/81e/8e0/17a81e8e0561b21f59e472b67d424cda.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have not heard anything about this company before, the model is not new, but it promises up to 200 megabits per second.  A colleague refused them, because he could not make friends with adapters with a provider using a VPN connection (which one I don‚Äôt remember, either Akado or Pchelain).  His connection to the router was torn, and even though you are cracking.  As far as I know, all such adapters have problems with VPN - who has more, who has less.  At LevelOne, that's not good at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/637/92c/b3c/63792cb3c36c4f1f59ef30c95ac2eec4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I tried to just drive the data on the wiring, sticking one adapter into the outlet near the router, and the second - in the kitchen.  They quickly found each other, and after a minute I downloaded the files from the NAS to the laptop and back.  Two hundred two hundred megabits, but sixty pumped without problems.  And it is stable like that, without interruption of the connection, without oddities ... And the idea got into my head: what if I connected via Ethernet, I had to carry the Internet from the door to the router through the wiring, and then everything was as usual?  After all, if it works out - you can save a lot of time and energy on the mess with the cable.  And if not, it will still be about what to write on Habr√© :) Said - done.  A survey of friends and neighbors showed that in our area without VPN only ‚ÄúOnLaym‚Äù is connected.  But this, they say, is not scary, because the provider is quite decent.  It may be so, but, to be honest, I was pretty pulled by the advertising of ‚ÄúOnlayma‚Äù wherever it was possible and impossible, and constant calls from their girls to my landline.  Like, connect, connect!  For a year, I was even somehow tired of coming up with interesting ways to send and just began to hang up.  But if there are no alternatives - ok, let's try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/831/d6b/12b/831d6b12bde813c7c94d6e73458514e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He left a request on the site, promised to call back.  I am waiting for an hour, two, three ... In general, that day no one contacted me, although the website promised to connect right next morning.  Okay, in the morning I called myself - they say, guys, but we will connect, or shall I go nafig?  The girl at the end of the wire promised that I would ... call back :) But this time I did not deceive, and after about forty minutes had already agreed on the details of the connection.  On weekdays, everything is not bad with free pools, but I haven‚Äôt got a job yet, so I have to work.  So we agreed on Saturday, because the next weekend was packed to capacity. <br><br>  Putting the phone down, I looked at my router more closely and suddenly I realized that it wouldn‚Äôt work out - well, I don‚Äôt know how to distribute Ethernet, only ADSL.  That is, I had suspected something like this before, but then I finally became convinced.  I had to borrow for a while a router with a long name <a href="http://www.tplink.com/products/productDetails.asp%3Fclass%3Dwlan%26pmodel%3DTL%252DWR1043ND">TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3e/2ed/139/e3e2ed13984b99abbf7f48e0e14dfcd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, I feel great tenderness for this brand, because in the old apartment for three years it has been plowing round the clock TP-Link TD-W8920G 108M Wireless.  I didn‚Äôt touch it as I set it up once - I updated the firmware only once, and at the same time not a single setting was lost.  Recently, however, I discovered that the people to whom I rented an apartment did something strange with an antenna.  She is healthy there, fat - either they punished their naughty cat, or they used it for some fun, but the wiring to the antenna was torn from the nest.  Signal while some remained, but very much weak.  Well, never mind - I attached the antenna from the Zyxel who died in the Bose, since the connectors are all standard, and the router continues to work to its full height.  I was still amused that, having bought a new Asus DSL-N13 apartment, I found exactly the same menu inside.  Well, right down to the smallest detail.  I don‚Äôt know if TP-Link is a secret brand of Asus, or it just coincided, but I don‚Äôt really believe in this kind of accident.  Moreover, knowing the love of Asus to sell about the same, but cheaper under other brands (remember mom Asrock). <br><br>  After Saturday, at the agreed time, a man came to me with a bag and a box of cable.  Something wisely with a shield on the floor, then began to wrestle with his head - how to drag a cable into an apartment.  Fortunately, nothing had to be drilled - a place was found in the channel for the TV aerial.  True, the box had to break a little, but oh well, behind the lid is not visible.  Next, the cable went straight to the LevelOne adapter, and I emerged under my desk, from where I crawled under the ceiling, to the router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/522/e65/01c/522e6501c98d3dca6a221bdefa7cb45b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>It is a pity that the USB port can only be used to share a flash drive or hard drive.</i>  <i>Print server would not hurt me at all ...</i> <br><br>  Internet earned immediately.  Well, that is, in general, no settings are needed.  Stuck - and rushed.  For the sake of justice, this is primarily the credit of OnLayma, and not of the router.  Perhaps, from the point of view of any security staff, the complete absence of passwords is not good, but for the user it is very, very convenient.  Checked by SpeedTest - there is an honest 13312/7680, as it should be for the selected tariff.  It costs 700 rubles, and at night (more precisely, from one o'clock to 11 am) 13 megabits turn ... no, not into a pumpkin, but into 20 megabits at both ends.  The response time is sensible, 5-8 ms.  Torrents immediately revived.  In due time, I largely started the NAS in order not to drive a computer with a quad-core processor inside for distribution.  Even with a narrow outgoing channel "Stream", if you give around the clock, the ratings are normal everywhere.  Well, and here ... It's just some kind of song.  During the day you give more than before in a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e1/59d/4cd/2e159d4cdcf805857e2711d2ac384205.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>The main configuration of the router :).</i>  <i>By the way, the menu for three years was different from the Asus.</i> <br><br>  I played a little more with the router.  There are three antennas and three levels of WiFi signal.  At the maximum he blasts me so that I walked straight from the communicator to the Internet through my home channel.  On average, it is caught only under the windows (I live on the fourth floor).  At the minimum under the windows, the signal becomes quite lousy, but everything is in order within the apartment.  He also set it up: I somehow don‚Äôt need to irrigate the surroundings with a wifi me from my hand, but nobody needs extra radiation at home. <br><br>  I also opened ports for utorrent in the menu, changed WiFi encryption to WPA2, and, in general, this is where our close communication with the router ended.  Seriously - it‚Äôs very boring to write about things that just do their job without any bugs.  There is nothing to catch on.  And, I still checked the speed.  So on Ethernet (gigabit, of course) with NAS it turns out to download about 45 megabytes per second, and this restriction is not a router, but a WD GreenPower hard drive.  Especially this is chosen so that it is quieter and colder.  Of course, it‚Äôs a pity that not all interface features are used, but oh well (back to NAS I rarely write, it usually acts as a data source).  Over the air (802.11n), 8-9 megabytes per second fly, also in the normal range.  So I will observe a little more, and if I find nothing pleasant, I will probably take the same one. <br>  Summing up this long post. <br><br>  1) With LevelOne adapters driving the Internet through the wiring, there was no problem at all for a week.  As the classic said, not a single gap.  For me, this is a pleasant surprise, because I was concerned with technology with subconscious disbelief.  It is suitable, of course, not for all operators and, probably, not for every electrical wiring, but in my case - the order, very satisfied.  The price of the issue, though too big - one such adapter costs from 1,400 rubles per piece.  But, on the other hand, you will pay more, just not to move the furniture and not to play with a puncher. <br><br>  2) TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND router is a quality machine with gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n, which just works.  For it, there are already a couple of alternative firmwares that turn the router into a fully-fledged NAS, but I don‚Äôt really need it, the benefit of the NAS is already there.  Plus, from what I have seen with similar characteristics, this is the cheapest option. <br><br>  3) The most probably the most important.  After a week on "OnLime" I decided on "Stream" not to return.  More precisely, I will keep it as a backup channel for every fireman, but I will absolutely refuse the expensive tariff plan with ADSL2 +.  Ethernet for the same price is a little faster at the input and MUCH faster at the output.  No, I have not ceased to believe that ADSL is good.  Just Ethernet is better, especially if it works well.  But I can seriously argue about the stability of OnLayma in a year, not earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/669/663/605/6696636050fff9c5a64e22c0f5f4eb8f.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108967/</a></p>
