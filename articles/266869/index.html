Now the <b>range of high-speed "plates" is</b> not inferior to the variation of the previous generation UniFi, which has won deafening popularity among builders of small WiFi-networks.  The cost of the lower dual-band 802.11ac now starts at $ 89, and all new dots support the Wireless uplink radio takeover technology.  General information about new points is presented in our quick-look-review. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Comparison of common parameters of new access points UniFi AC <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c40/d76/9b5/c40d769b544945349c0c8c7514112277.jpg"><br>  Naturally, there is no 802.11ac in the 2.4 GHz band, so the bandwidths of the 802.11n standard are indicated for this band.  The division of power standards between junior and senior points has already become customary, and this stick is about two ends: on the one hand, there is a remarkable opportunity for backward compatibility across the infrastructure, when existing UniFi APs can be replaced with something new without the cost of replacing injectors / switches with Passive PoE.  On the other hand, during the construction of new networks, it will again have to put up with the "non-standard" power of UniFi.  However, switches of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/236231/">EdgeSwitch</a> family <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/236231/">are</a> still able to power the points with that and with a different power standard.

      It is worth noting that we are not talking about Wave 2 in the new line, which means that there is no MU-MIMO either.  In the new points, the design was changed and several hardware and software features appeared.  Before considering each point separately, we will tell about the general features of the new products. <br><br>  Added new options for the radio channel: Spectral Analysis, Band Steering, and Airtime Fairness <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e4/2a5/d70/2e42a5d70aed403ea7f8c285481f740c.jpg"><br>  The purpose of each of these functions is clear from its name and manufacturer‚Äôs short description: <b>Spectral analysis</b> collects statistics on both WiFi bands and available channels (questions about whether non-protocol interference is collected, whether statistics are available without interrupting the service remain open). <br><br>  <b>Band steering</b> , depending on the settings, either works in its traditional application, ‚Äúpushing‚Äù clients able to operate in the 5 GHz range into it, or distributes clients between the ranges in a certain predetermined ratio. <br><br>  <b>Airtime Fairness</b> , in turn, is designed to solve the problem of a slow client, allocating under each of the clients working at a point the time during which he can transmit, which means that now a slow client will not be able to monopolize all the access point resources, since everyone will receive the same time data transfer (this is meant by the word Fairness, "honesty").  As can be seen from the descriptions, and from the names too, a lot of things intersect with the functionality of the ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù enterprise-solutions <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/264953/">Ruckus Wireless</a> . <br><br>  Android and iOS Easy Setup Mobile Application Support - and this is already a stone in the garden of the ‚Äúhands‚Äù Xclaim low cost solution.  In general terms and vague wording, the work of the points in this configuration mode without a controller is stated (there is no information about the maximum size of such a complex and about the functions supported by it).  In fact, here we are talking about the legalization of the system without a constantly running computer with a controller, however, the application is only ‚Äúavailable soon‚Äù for mobile operating systems.  The universality with which the integration of new points is positioned is interesting: if you want, the solution is controlled by the controller, and if you want, a small network of two or three points operating autonomously, but controlled centrally.  Anyway, it‚Äôs too early to talk about the way and quality of this function, but the concept itself is very encouraging. <br><br>  Changes, of course, touched and design.  Talking about his quality means to postulate very subjective statements: someone likes the rounded, familiar UniFi ‚Äúplates‚Äù, someone will miss the chopped forms of UAP AC, we, in turn, will better consider the functionality of each point in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Unifi AC Lite AP</b> <br><br>  UAP-AC-LITE-AP is the most budget-based (slightly more expensive than the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù UAP, significantly cheaper than the UAP PRO) and compact access point in the line under consideration. <br><br>  Compared to the ‚Äústandard‚Äù UniFi AP, the diameter of the UAP-AC-LITE is reduced by a quarter, and the maximum (declared) throughput is increased 5 times.  The 2x2 MIMO mode: 2 in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands provides the maximum bandwidth of 300 and 867 Mbps, respectively. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/128/25c/6d0/12825c6d039848618cb27b6a8fe4b775.jpg"><br>  A dual-band access point in an ultra compact design for <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/1ROW">less than $ 100</a> will be a suitable purchase for home use or for a small office. <br><br>  <b>UniFi AC LR AP</b> <br><br>  UniFi-AC-LR-AP - the best option for organizing WiFi in large rooms. <br>  Many probably faced the so-called ‚Äúasymmetric power problem‚Äù when the client device ‚Äúsees‚Äù the access point, but cannot ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù it.  For such cases, it is recommended to use the Long-Range model from the UniFi family.  The AC LR models are not only more powerful than ordinary access points, which is typical for the LR family, but also have an improved 5 GHz antenna system, which allows to improve the channel performance not only towards the client, but also in the opposite direction - new solutions in the design antennas provide a symmetric coverage area due to the increased antenna sensitivity coefficient (2.4 GHz: 3 dBi, 5 GHz: 6 dBi).  Look at how much more sophisticated and modern the Unifi antenna has become compared to the classic ones.  Of course, they are still far <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/243681/">from Ruckus adaptive antenna systems</a> , but there is no doubt progress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/948/e44/c53/948e44c532484c189c0a89a0ba4017b2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>UniFi AC Pro AP</b> <br><br>  UniFi-AC-Pro-AP - high performance 3x3 MIMO simultaneously in two bands, placed in an all-weather body powered by Passive PoE (48V) or 802.3af / 803.2at.  The Instant Upgrade feature allows you to install UAP-AC-PRO in place of a standard UAP using existing hardware, which greatly simplifies the work on upgrading your wireless network.  IMPORTANT: this is not an outdoor point, it is not positioned as suitable for outdoor use, now you can just make WiFi in a room with high humidity, for example, in a warehouse - the main thing is that it does not rain on top of the point.  Here is what the manufacturer says about this: <br><br>  <i>‚Ä¢ Mounting location should not be less than 60 cm (2 ft) from the edge of the ceiling.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Cable feed when wall-mounted.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Shielded Category 5 (or above) cabling should not be used.</i>  <i>For example, it is possible to ensure that you can use your computer.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/bdd/085/b11bdd0858ca4ed88189ba23933ddbbd.jpg"><br>  And AC Pro has an intriguing flavor on board - a usb-port for connecting some optional accessory with the ability to apply up to 11 watts of power to it.  It remains only to wait for the announcement of this accessory - while we can only speculate that it will be: Bluetooth low energy, 4G modem, something else?  Or will it just be a separate hands-free kit for upgrading the Pro to the EDU level? <br><br>  <b>UniFi AC EDU AP</b> <br><br>  UniFi-AC-EDU-AP - dual-band access point with MIMO 3x3 powered by Passive PoE or 803.2at.  A key feature of this model is the presence of a built-in speaker for organizing sound alerts in schools, hospitals, offices, shopping centers - in any place where such a need arises.  UAP-AC-EDU makes it possible to create sound announcements without the need to purchase additional (and expensive) equipment, while the system provides accurate voice reproduction.  Now you do not need to call the reception desk and ask to announce something over the speakerphone, everyone can do it from their smartphone (or from a <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/1JI6">UniFi phone</a> ).  You can create an audio notification from any smartphone and transfer it to the access point via WiFi via the application (it will appear in the App Store and Google Play soon).  UAP-AC-EDU makes it possible to create sound announcements without the need to purchase additional equipment, while the system provides accurate voice reproduction.  Questions about the integration of this solution with the already established alert systems are open and remain unanswered at this stage - we will wait, then we will test and see.  So far, the most logical way for such integration seems to us is the assignment of SIP telephone numbers to the entire alert system or its individual segments, which will allow linking it with any modern telephone exchange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2de/da8/f10/2deda8f102234dd7bb9f7452cb723313.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Control</b> <br><br>  The access points are managed and monitored using the fourth-generation free UniFi Controller software controller.  This controller is a single solution for managing UniFi devices: access points, VoIP phones, switches, and Security Gateway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/840/dd4/17b/840dd417b75241f2bf9633befc48c3c8.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, the UniFi AC family of points now consists of 6 models, which allows you to choose the most optimal equipment for a specific task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/046/229/fe4/046229fe41bf45a4945303f0796a40aa.jpg"><br><br>  Of the obvious drawbacks of new models, except for the doubts that were voiced above, it can be noted that the multipacks now do not include power injectors - however, such kits are usually purchased for large objects where it is logical to use PoE switches. <br><br>  Prices for the new line are already published on our <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/1ROW">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266869/</a></p>
