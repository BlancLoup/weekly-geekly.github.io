But first we will touch on problems and difficulties. <br><br><h5>  About the problem </h5><br><br>  Every day more and more online stores (and another business too, but in the future we‚Äôll talk about stores) come to Instagram and understand the importance of this channel of interaction with their customers.  Instagram is a story, first of all, about emotions and brand loyalty.  Satisfied customers happily subscribe to Instagram accounts of their favorite brands, expecting to see in the ribbon a piece of the company's internal work and beautiful photos of their favorite products.

      Today, Instagram cannot post links to products (links are displayed with text and cannot be followed).  It is also impossible to select and copy text from the application, so the stores do not publish links to products, limiting themselves only to indicating the address of the main page of the site in their profile, and upload photos and the name of the goods.  But what about a customer who likes the product in the photo, and he wants to order it? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If a client follows the link in the profile to the home page of the site, then how can he find exactly the product he saw on the Instagram photo?  If there are thousands of products in the store's assortment and the site is not adapted for mobile devices, finding the right product is a very difficult task, and customers quickly abandon this venture.  As a result, the client does what is easier for him - he writes in an Instagram comment ‚Äúhow to buy this product?‚Äù, In the hope that his problem will be solved and a link sent to purchase the product.  However, he does not leave any contact information, puzzling the already busy store manager.  But more often the client doesn‚Äôt write anything at all, puts likes without thinking about buying, because  it does not lead to this.  Conversion into sales of this approach is very low. <br><br>  In the screenshot is an example of a similar situation in a Lamoda store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4e/d30/372/b4ed303726df4e9e90984a07cda61370.png"><br><br>  How to solve this problem?  We in <a href="http://hashsales.ru/">HashSales</a> implemented two tools at once. <br><br>  <b>1. Creating a product ribbon from photos on Instagram</b> <br><br>  The product ribbon is a special mobile page-adapted intermediate page between your Instagram profile and your website.  The purpose of the product tape is to quickly direct a customer to the products that you post on your Instagram.  Clicking on the product image in the ribbon, the client gets to the product page on your website. <br><br>  You yourself note which publications from Instagram will be added to the product tape, indicating for each publication a link to the product.  The link to the tape is placed on your Bio profile.  With the help of the product tape, the client gets to the product page in 2 clicks, which significantly increases the conversion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/246/426/217/24642621712443848a4bc16d18039270.png"><br><br>  Such mechanics are used in their Instagram by such world brands as GAP, Forever21, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/c34/247/a7cc34247a644ae8b044b6a9a9bddce9.png"><br><br>  <b>2. Sending a link to the product to the customer's email when writing a comment.</b> <br><br>  To get a link to the product, the customer needs to leave a comment with the hashtag "# want to buy" and your email.  A direct link to the purchase of the goods will automatically be sent to the specified email.  All information about the product is filled in your account on our website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/082/ce8/240/082ce8240b8c40c9b343b26daea23ea4.png"><br><br>  Any of these methods increases the conversion to purchases, smoothing the client‚Äôs obstacles to the order.  In the following articles we will talk more about building the correct content strategy for your Instagram account.  If you have questions, we will be happy to answer them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293278/</a></p>
