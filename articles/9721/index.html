You are deeply mistaken if you think that an idea is worth something.  In our information world, the price of an idea is equated to zero.  Generally, what is the idea?  This is when you come up with something that is unique. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When an idea is in your head, it can seem fantastic, super profitable.  But you can not sell it.  The idea is worth nothing.  You can only tell her to someone, write.  Maybe you will refuse her at all, especially if your friend says that this is ‚Äúcomplete mess.‚Äù

      But, if you can implement an idea into a product, then your main asset will be no longer an idea, but your product that needs to be sold. <br>  And what is needed for this? <br>  Of course, this requires advertising and marketing.  And the more people learn about your product, the greater the likelihood that a buyer will appear.  And if indeed, your product is so unique, and nothing like this on the market does not exist, then buyers will appear.  But at the same time, other manufacturers of similar products will learn about it. <br>  And as soon as your product starts to be in demand, a competitor will immediately have an analogue.  Your idea will be simply copied.  And nothing can be done about it.  On the contrary, it will give you more confidence that you are on the right track. <br><br>  Any business seeks a monopoly, and your proposal was at the beginning a monopoly, unique.  But only the first time, while others did not understand that they could also earn money with this.  The fact that you came up with this idea first gave you only a temporary "handicap".  A small reserve in time to have time to implement it. <br>  It‚Äôs not a fact that at this very moment, the same idea did not come to another person, moreover, completely independently of you.  Or maybe he already sat down to realize it, and you are only thinking about it.  Who has the advantage now? <br><br>  The idea is nothing!  In antiquity, it was possible to own the secret technology of steel production, and remove from this "cream" for several decades.  Now it is impossible.  As soon as the latest technology appears, it is immediately copied by competitors.  The speed of dissemination of information has increased to unimaginable values.  Today you can write in a blog, tomorrow the whole world will know about it (of course, if you lived next to a fallen meteorite).  As soon as you put your product on the market, competitors will already know about it tomorrow, or tomorrow the competitors themselves will appear. <br><br>  The only thing you can do is use your ‚Äúhandicap‚Äù.  You must constantly increase the functionality of your product.  Constantly - this means every day, every hour, every minute.  Remember, with Lewes Carroll, you need to run to stay in place, and to move forward a little, you have to run twice as fast.  So you should work on your product.  When you get up in the morning, eat, take a shower, you think over it, when you read an article, you think about the application written in your product, when you go to bed, you think about the product, and only in a dream you are not working.  But remember that maybe your competitor is not sleeping now, but is developing his own product. <br><br>  If you paraphrase the famous classic, then your motto should be: "Not a day without a line of code."  Even if you have corrected the button icon today, this is progress.  You are always one step ahead, your product is always better.  You must ensure that competitors do not even have the desire to compete with you, when they see your product, they must get a knockout, after which it will be difficult for them to collect their thoughts, and start working on an analogue.  Remember that over the past year, Hewlett-Packard earned 70% of its income on something that did not exist a year ago.  You can remain a monopolist only if you are always the best. <br><br>  And the idea?  The idea is nothing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9721/</a></p>
