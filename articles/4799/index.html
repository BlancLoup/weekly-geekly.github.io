  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programmers "attacked" unidentified law enforcement agencies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Wednesday early in the morning, law enforcement officers, accompanied by riot police, began searches in the Moscow office of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ru">IBM</a> at Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment.  Similar events were held at the offices of one of the largest Russian system integrators <a href="http://www.lanit.ru/">‚ÄúLanit‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://www.softlab.ru/">R-Style Softlab</a> company, which is part of the <a href="http://www.r-style.ru/">R-Style</a> group.  From the employees of these companies they demanded to leave the workplaces, in addition, they were selected mobile phones. <br><br>  Searches continued for almost the entire working day, but no official comments from law enforcement agencies about what was happening nevertheless did not follow.  The source of the information about what is happening was the Internet blogs of employees of the above IT companies.  ‚ÄúI came to work, and here the riot policemen, the tax service, people with machine guns and masks in the building, run along,‚Äù <a href="http://katya538.livejournal.com/87224.html">writes an employee of one of these companies,</a> <a href="http://katya538.livejournal.com/">Katya538</a> .  ‚ÄúEveryone was kicked out of our floor half an hour ago, told to leave my cell phone and leave the room.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne minibus arrived and people from OBEP (I cannot vouch for them) and riot police (it‚Äôs written on the bus) went to the floors,‚Äù <a href="http://itblogs.ru/blogs/events/archive/2006/12/06/10267.aspx">writes her colleague ‚Äúin misfortune‚Äù</a> <a href="http://itblogs.ru/blogs/elashkin/default.aspx">Mikhail Elashkin</a> .  -.  One person with AK on the floor, without masks, they say, everything is extremely correct.  Work do not give.  If the beech is on, you cannot turn it off; if it is off, you cannot turn it on.  You can't talk on local phones, cell phones, too, but everyone uses them.  At the exit of the passport photocopier.  That is, to go out, as I understood, there were no big problems.  The laptop can also be pulled out, but at the same time it is checked by a technical person from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  I can not imagine how.  I did not see any precedents for exiting with a laptop ... "

      All last day, the media tried to understand which of the security agencies was behind what was happening.  Representatives of the latter, in turn, unanimously denied their participation in searches.  ‚ÄúIf there were people in camouflage, then they are definitely not ours,‚Äù the Federal Customs Service said.  ‚ÄúWe have 4 deputy heads of the department for combating economic crimes, I talked to all of them, they are not related to these searches,‚Äù said Yevgeny Gildeyev, a representative of the Directorate for Combating Economic Crimes of the Department of Internal Affairs of Moscow. <br><br>  In the Directorate ‚ÄúK‚Äù, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which deals with the fight against crimes in the sphere of high technologies, did not give any comments at all.  But in the Department of Economic Security of the Ministry of the Interior it was reported that what is happening in IT companies "should be legally more literally called seizures, not searches," but they also rejected their involvement in this. <br><br>  Meanwhile, on Wednesday, searches were also conducted in the offices of the head of the State <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/">Pension Fund of</a> Russia Gennady Batanov and the executive director of the same fund, Pavel Averin.  This prompted observers to the idea that searches in IT companies and the Pension Fund are related to each other.  Unknown law enforcement officials can investigate violations related to the delivery of IBM computer hardware to Lanitom and R-Style.  In the evening, this information was confirmed in "Lanita" and R-Style Softlab company, which is part of the R-Style group.  True, <a href="http://www.softlab.ru/about/news/%3FID%3D1379">representatives of the latter assured</a> that they, in fact, have no contractual relations with the Pension Fund, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company's activity is banking software.  But contracts with the fund are related to the company <a href="http://www.r-style.com/">R-Style</a> , the scope of which is just the system integration and the supply of computer equipment.  Apparently, the law enforcement agencies confused two legal entities. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mk.ru/numbers/2499/article87886.htm">Representatives of the fund itself in an interview with Moskovsky Komsomolets</a> confirmed the connection between searches in their organization and in the offices of IT companies.  We are talking about alleged violations in the implementation of the management of the fund purchases of computers.  The investigation takes place on the line of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which estimates the amount of damage at 300 million rubles.  The figure of the case, in addition to R-Style and "Lanit", is also a certain company "Evra-ziya." <br><br>  At the same time, the Pension Fund categorically reject accusations.  ‚ÄúAccording to the results of our competition for the supply of computers, seven winners were determined, including the companies mentioned,‚Äù the fund explained.  - Each of the contractors supplied us with approximately the same number of computers and office equipment: somewhere for 120 million rubles.  It turns out that these three companies from 360 million stole 300 million?  This simply can not be. " <br><br>  For the ongoing searches, experts see increased state pressure on the IT industry.  ‚ÄúThe Pension Fund is just an excuse, exactly the same as tax claims at one time became an excuse to fight Yukos,‚Äù said Anatoly Levenchuk, coordinator of <a href="http://www.libertarium.ru/">the Moscow Libertarium project</a> .  - In fact, we are talking about the fact that the state now considers information technology to be as strategically important as oil and gas.  This means that the industry is waiting for new requisitions, the fight against "gray" supplies and other official obstacles.  As a result, computers, despite numerous statements by statesmen, will become more expensive and less accessible. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4799/</a></p>
