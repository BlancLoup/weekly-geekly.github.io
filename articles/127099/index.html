  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Symbian and Nokia - what awaits us in the future?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more often there are rumors that Nokia is closing the Symbian Foundation department and this popular OS will not be supported anymore.  I would like to understand this and make sure that these are just rumors.  I know that the vice presidents refute these rumors, but I don‚Äôt trust them much.  Therefore, in this article I will cite only real facts and analyze them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with disturbing news from Sony Ericsson and Samsung.  The representative of Sony Ericsson Aldo Liguri (Aldo Liguori) reported that the Japanese-Swedish company decided not to use the Symbian operating system in its smartphones.  From now on, the smart phones of this manufacturer will be based on the Android OS.  Then it became known that the company Samsung, whose portfolio contains more than one smartphone running Symbian, is ready to abandon this OS.  Within a month, she will completely abandon the support of this OS.  On October 25, I appointed the closure of the virtual laboratory Symbian Lab.dev, where you could test Symbian applications.  By the end of the year, all content intended for Symbian OS smartphones will be removed from the Samsung website and the Developer Forum will be closed. <br><br>  Now, if we take and analyze this situation: why are the two large companies developing smartphones almost at the same time rejecting this version of the operating system?  I do not believe that because of one reason, called Android, they could so sharply turn away from the OS, which faithfully served us all these years.  Or did the company just simply forget some rumors?  But let it be so, let's say they were afraid of rumors or the Android blocked the air for Symbian.  Well, how do you explain the further resignation of the company's executive director, Lee Williams, of your own free will?  Tim Holbrow, who had previously served as the company's financial director, was urgently appointed to replace him.  Is Tim Holbrow only needed to close the department with minimal damage to the company's finances?  It would seem that everyone forgot our Symbian, the rats flee from the ship and so on.  In this case, very much believe in the closure of the department.

      But here comes the "prince on a white horse" and announces that nothing had happened and was not going to be.  Statements such as ‚Äúmost employees will be dismissed‚Äù and ‚Äúthe organization itself will be closed‚Äù have not been officially confirmed.  So, Nokia Vice President Niklas Savander (Niklas Savander) in an interview with CNet said that the Symbian Foundation will not be closed due to the refusal of the use of this platform by Sony Ericsson and Samsung.  As he stated: ‚ÄúI see no reason to close the Symbian Foundation.  What is the point of doing this?  Symbian is an open platform and everyone decides for himself whether he wants to use it or not, whether he remains a member of the organization or leaves it, ‚Äùsays Nokia Nicklas.  Also in an interview, the company's vice-president noted that in the future, the Symbian operating system will be used in Nokia smartphones of the average price category, and high end devices will work under the control of MeeGo. The questions are still being tormented: what if Nokia wants to close the department quietly and quietly, so everyone is reassured that these are rumors? If the information is confirmed that they are closing the department, then this made a stir among buyers, because most smartphones work exactly  About this OS. The company would simply lose a lot of ‚Äúcustomers", but who needs it, right? So they decided to lie that everything was chocolate. They even started updating firmware and developing new versions of Symbian, such as Anna and Belle. took such a leap of updates? If six months our Symbian ^ 1 did not even remember? Maybe they want to please us for the last time and close? Like, here are your updates, calm down, right? <br><br>  In Russia and Ukraine, the atmosphere of Symbian-based smartphones is still hovering and they are buying on the basis of them.  Everything seems to be fine, but let's look at the states, but what about the situation there?  Apparently, Nokia will withdraw its Series 40-based phones from the US market, as well as smartphones based on the Symbian operating system, when the first Windows Phone devices appear on it.  This became known from the interview given by the head of the North American division of the company Chris Weber, who worked at Microsoft for 16 years.  ‚ÄúWhen we introduce smartphones running Windows Phone, we will significantly move away from Symbian devices, S40 phones, etc.  Attention will be paid to WP-smartphones, as well as accessories for them.  The reality is that if we are not waiting for success with Windows Phone, it will not matter what we are doing somewhere else, ‚Äùhe said.  Let me remind you that Nokia and Microsoft have planned some kind of Windows Phone event, which will take place next week in Cologne.  Perhaps on it the Finnish manufacturer will officially present its first WP-device, thereby throwing off sales and development of Symbian-platforms in a dark corner. <br><br>  In general, the situation I have developed in such a way that I am skeptical about the assurances of Nokia.  All this talk about the fact that the department will not be closed is complete nonsense.  Most facts point to this.  America will no longer use Symbian platforms, department directors will quit, companies will abandon this platform.  Still waiting for her dark future.  I tried to record the course of my thoughts about this situation.  What thoughts come to you?  What do you think about the current situation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127099/</a></p>
