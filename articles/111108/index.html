  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Browser usage statistics for December 2010 according to StatCounter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Summing up the past year, I would like to look at the statistics of browser usage in the Russian Federation according to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> and compare it with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/80073/">situation a year ago</a> . <br><br>  The first good news - Firefox and Opera continue to hold the leading position.  And the share of Firefox has grown by about 2% compared with December 2009, and now it occupies the first place (33.22%).  The share of Opera has not changed and amounted to 31.51%. <br><br>  The second is even more pleasant news - the share of IE fell by almost 9%, mainly due to the popularity of Google Chrome.  Now the total share of all versions of IE is only 21.81%.  And the share of Chrome increased by more than 2 times and amounted to 11.33%.

        </script>
      <br>
      With other browsers, the situation is also very interesting: the share of Safari increased slightly - from 1.3% to 1.56%, while the total share of alternative browsers decreased by more than 2 times and now stands at only 0.56%.  In my opinion, this is a very interesting fact, indicating that Chrome was able to lure even the majority of users of alternative browsers, who, as a rule, are very committed to their choice. <br><br>  Continuation and graphics under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/36/b8/36b83c4e5a85ec63822a78fe8f13509f.jpg" alt="Browser Usage Statistics for December 2010"><br><br>  According to statistics for some versions except Firefox 3.6 leadership (27.81%) and indicative of a quick transition from Opera 10.6 to Opera 11, I would like to note that Chrome 8 (8.54%) confidently bypassed IE 7 (5.08%) and took the honorable fourth place.  By the way, the share of IE 6 was only 2.67%, so if you are still thinking about which versions of IE to support in your new projects, then think about IE 7 (whether to support it or not), and you should refuse to support IE 6 without thinking, if your project is not aimed specifically at users of IE 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a8/b3/a8b36f7a6393cc642960c159acfd7b75.jpg" alt="Browser Version Usage Statistics for December 2010"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> I wish everyone in the New Year to quickly update their favorite browser to the latest version. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Do not forget that any statistics show data only for a certain sample of sites.  And the data for the target audience of your sites may be slightly different.  In this case, the sample includes not only Russian-language sites.  What in my opinion is a big plus, because  Many Russians constantly visit foreign sites, but this is absolutely not taken into account in Russian statistical aggregators. <br>  However, the most important is the trends that somehow manifest themselves on any aggregators of statistics and on any central Asian.  The main trend is the fall in the share of IE and Microsoft should do something extraordinary to stop this fall.  In the meantime, MS solutions are only to the detriment of IE, for example, the decision not to release IE 9 under Win XP, whose share is still substantially more than 50%, will lead to the fact that another part of IE 8 users will switch to other browsers.  So it is likely that the total share of IE by the end of 2011 will be less than 15% to the overall joy of web developers. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> For ardent fans of LiveInternet, I explain: the share of users from the Russian Federation in LiveInternet statistics to which you refer is only <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/ru/countries.html%3Fdate%3D2010-12-31%3Bperiod%3Dmonth">62.5%</a> , and mobile browsers are mixed with desktop ones, but despite this, all the main trends described in the article are also viewed in the data LiveInternet, albeit with a slight delay. <br>  I also note that StatCounter data is much better consistent with the averaged data from Google Analytics on my sites, although for each specific site the distribution is different, so do not focus on the numbers, but pick up the trends instead of killing in karma just because analyzed data is not your favorite aggregator. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111108/</a></p>
