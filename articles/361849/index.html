Recording "Music on the ribs", movie camera and TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is inspired by the publication <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/224357/">"Children of the Present and Gadgets of the Past"</a> in the <a href="http:">Mail.Ru Group</a> blog.  I propose to plunge into the era of the USSR and see how our parents copied music without torrents, recorded video without smartphones and watched TV. <br><br>  <b>The first device - the recording device "Music on the edges"</b> <br>  1950-1980 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/669/157/9a3/6691579a3a9a88078aa71940d4526073.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first, Western music came to the USSR on gramophone records brought from abroad.  But there were very few such records, and as the Soviet Union more and more fenced off from the Western world in the thirties, they became even smaller.  Something changed immediately after the war, when soldiers and officers who reached Germany, brought with them, among all sorts of trophies, also gramophone records.  But it was still a drop in the ocean: there were much more people who looked at the ‚ÄúSerenade of the Sunny Valley‚Äù and wanted to listen to such music in the USSR than the records brought from Europe.  And then a unique musical medium appeared in the USSR: records made from old X-rays.  They were called records on ‚Äúbones‚Äù, on ‚Äúribs‚Äù, simply ‚Äúribs‚Äù or even ‚Äúmy grandmother's skeleton‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd0/6f8/d44/cd06f8d44595adb0c125774174677292.jpg" alt="image">

      Such ‚Äúrecords‚Äù creaked, hissed, but at least in some form allowed to hear Western music in a situation when real European and American records were not sold in the USSR, and brought from abroad were very rare. <br><br>  These were the real X-rays: they showed chest cells, spines, joints.  In the middle a small round hole was made, the edges were slightly rounded off with scissors - and such a record could be listened to on a regular gramophone (gramophone).  Why for the manufacture of flexible plates chose X-rays?  Radiographs were the cheapest and most accessible material.  They could be cheap to buy, or even get free at clinics and hospitals. <br><br>  Since the first post-war years in the major cities of the USSR - especially in Moscow and Leningrad - a whole ‚Äúindustry‚Äù has been created for the manufacture and sale of plates on the ‚Äúbones‚Äù. <br><br>  For several years the industry of music on the ‚Äúbones‚Äù existed, avoiding repression by the authorities, but in the mid-fifties retribution finally came, and many manufacturers of radiogram plates went to camps.  But some continued to manufacture them. <br><br>  And only by the end of the fifties, when the reel-to-reel tape recorders that had become available for sale finally became publicly available, the records on the ‚Äúbones‚Äù went into oblivion. <br><br>  But the mere fact of the existence of the underground ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, producing records on the ‚Äúedges‚Äù and reproducing virtually any music in this way, meant quite a lot.  Duplication of records inaccessible in Soviet stores continued with the help of tape recorders all the sixties, seventies and eighties, until the performers got the opportunity to legally replicate their records on records and compact discs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/801/e6b/ace/801e6baced2ede7a40c68b20138eb323.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fda/ad5/cad/fdaad5cada9ee7c4b6e3916198fe2b83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Video</b> : <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3FsYn5iwMI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhisF_A-adNgiQaBt4Mne3WoOxMK4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Movie Camera "Kiev-16U"</b> <br>  1950-1980 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0f/10a/3f6/d0f10a3f6e4d98be2eee4d8e176377ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Kiev factory of automation them.  GI Petrovsky (in some movie cameras, the manufacturer was designated as ‚ÄúTochpribor Plant‚Äù) from the second half of the 1950s to the 1980s, inclusively produced 16 mm movie cameras used mainly for professional purposes. <br><br>  Filming machine "Kiev-16U", designed for shooting movies on various topics and in a variety of conditions.  Designed to work with 16 mm film with single-sided or double-sided perforation wound on a reel.  Reel capacity - 30 m of film. <br><br>  The camera is equipped with three lenses on the rotary turret: "Vega-7" (2/20 mm), "World-11" (2 / 12.5 mm) and "Tair-41" (2/50 mm).  Camera viewer - through;  focusing through the working lens, mirror obturator and a frosted collective lens.  End-to-end parallax sighting allows you to shoot objects from short distances, visually assess the depth of field and express each scene more expressively. <br><br>  Spring-loaded drive, when fully wound, draws 4.5 m of film. <br><br>  Shooting frequency of 12, 16, 24, 32, 48 and 64 frames / s, single-frame shooting, meter footage, showing the number of films shot, as well as a large set of different accessories greatly expand the capabilities of a movie camera. <br><br>  <b>Video</b> : <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXYGk7qMcGs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPHNXUeKoubLLpMT1_NZTWLDM4kA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Televisions "Temp-6" and "Temp-7"</b> <br>  1960-1961 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61e/546/e8f/61e546e8f23bc79f7c972cc84ab309ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Televisions of the new generation ‚ÄúTemp-6‚Äù and ‚ÄúTemp-7‚Äù have embodied all the latest achievements of domestic and foreign television equipment of the early sixties.  They were in no way inferior to the best foreign models, and exceeded them by many parameters.  Both TVs are made in the design bureau of the Moscow Radio Works, under the direction of the chief designer D.S. Heifetz.  Both models are 17 tube 12 channel television receivers.  The difference in the applied kinescopes and external design. <br><br>  In the TV ‚ÄúTemp-7‚Äù with a larger case and an improved speaker system, where one loudspeaker is located in the bottom of the case and the other on the side, the range of reproduced sound frequencies is 80 ... 8000 Hz, the TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTemp-6‚Äù ‚Äúit is equal to 100 ... 7000 Hz. Two loudspeakers also work in the AU here, but they are located on the front panel.  The rated output power of the sound channel of both models is 1W. <br><br>  On the front panel under the kinescope there is a switch with rectangular buttons, used as a ton register (‚ÄúSpeech‚Äù, ‚ÄúConcert‚Äù, ‚ÄúBass‚Äù), and also giving the opportunity to turn the power on and off and switch from one kind of work to another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/788/886/3ed/7888863edbf9a17b13c971ad24c7de3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left side of the pushbutton switch is located the index of the number of the switched on television channel, and on the right side - the scale of tuning on the VHF FM station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f25/5c2/80a/f255c280ab396d1f28c907ed91ddf741.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the flip cover, there are knobs for adjusting clarity, contrast, adjusting the volume of the line frequency and frame rate.  The scheme of the device includes: automatic high-speed gain control, automatic brightness control, automatic adjustment of the image size vertically and horizontally, inertial synchronization system and noise-resistant selector. <br><br>  Dimensions of TV "Temp-6" - 444x562x338 mm.  Weight 28 kg. <br>  Dimensions of the TV "Temp-7" 544x610x442 mm.  Weight 43 kg. <br>  Power consumption, when receiving a TV - 175 watts, when receiving a radio 60 watts. <br>  Televisions have been successfully exported to many countries in Europe and America. <br><br>  <b>Video</b> : <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfjKNVEKnZg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgaBQfTNN5-Ia3fkcleP1n3KcYIg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the frame Serdyukov Gennady Fedorovich, associate professor, Khakass State University.
