      It is thanks to this design that space is saved inside the telecommunications cabinet, the number of wires is reduced, which means that the reliability and maintainability of the system increases and the labor costs for its installation and maintenance are reduced. <br><br><h3>  BUT, LET'S FIRST, FIRST ... </h3><br>  Setting the task came to us from our special area - telecommunications and communications.  For several years now, we have been manufacturing low-cost controllers for lockers that provide broadband Internet access using the Optics to the Home (FTTB) technology.  FTTB is one of the most common and efficient technologies that allows a provider to quickly ‚Äúreach‚Äù a client quickly and without large capital investments. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in some cases, the simplicity of the implementation of technical means turns into a certain simplification when the equipment is assembled ‚Äúfrom the pine forest‚Äù, mounted in a suitable iron box - and it is ready. <br><br>  In fairness it should be noted that in fact there is no equipment on the market that is required by the operator of this service.  Such a bleak picture is explained simply: until recently, no one has developed a technique specifically for this task. <br><br> <a href=""><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b8/64b/b01/8b864bb015ed9d57c039e81e55a5db07.png"></a>  Indeed, what is the modern FTTB terminal equipment located in residential buildings?  In the ‚Äúascetic‚Äù version it is more or less a vandal-proof iron box of the 19 ‚Äùconstructive box, which includes an optical cross, a media converter, a switch (one or several), a‚Äú patch panel ‚Äùfrom which UTP 5 cables go to subscribers.  And that's it (see fig. 1). <br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>1.</strong> "Austere" version of the layout of the cabinet FTTB <br><br> <a href=""><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/dfe/218/e6ddfe218c821a463a5e1d22998559ed.png"></a>  In the ‚Äúrich‚Äù version they are cabinets, which are completed (including, with our participation as a manufacturer of monitoring tools) additional components (see Fig. 2).  Here, in addition to the mandatory telecommunications equipment, there are three components that ensure the vital activity of the cabinet: an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), an input-distribution device (ASU) and a microprocessor controller (MK). <br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>2.</strong> ‚ÄúRich‚Äù version of FTTB cabinet layout <br><br>  Thus, all the tasks of life support of the FTTB cabinet are solved by three dissimilar devices manufactured by three different manufacturers.  And what if you combine all these functions in one block?  This simple and logical thought formed the basis of the new solution of Technotronix technical specialists - a device called the Power and Control Panel - PPU. <br><br><h3>  POWER SUPPLY AND CONTROL PANEL (PPU) - THREE IN ONE! </h3><br>  So, PPU really combines in itself the functions of UPS, VSU and MK (see fig. 3). <img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d1/9e4/281/1d19e4281b93a691557ce748a09ff352.png">  The ‚Äúsynergistic effect‚Äù (a buzzword!) Of such a combination is obvious.  The number of individual blocks is reduced, space in the cabinet is saved (at least for a couple of ‚Äúunits‚Äù), communications are minimized, etc.  Ultimately, the reliability of the functions performed increases dramatically.  And there is an opportunity to improve their quality and "depth." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e6/284/890/6e6284890a56c1ff2ab56c0498972672.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>3.</strong> Structural diagram of PUF <br><br><h3>  MODIFICATIONS DEVICES </h3><br>  Two device modifications are available: <br>  PPU without block for installation of electricity meter.  This modification of the device involves the installation of an external electricity meter either in the same FTTB cabinet or in a separate panel located next to the main cabinet; <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/6a5/cf5/32e6a5cf5d35154d8b1e8ddcbcab20ec.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>4.</strong> Appearance of PPU <br><br>  PPU-S with a unit for installing an electricity meter.  In the case of the device there is a special compartment in which the RCD and the electricity meter are mounted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c5/ea2/ce3/6c5ea2ce3203387048ac0fc70c4b9359.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>5.</strong> Appearance of PPU-C <br><br><h3>  STRUCTURE OF THE DEVICE </h3><br><ul><li>  Uninterruptible power supply for switches; </li><li>  The unit of measurement of the main parameters: the presence of input voltage, its magnitude and frequency, battery charge level, temperature inside the cabinet; </li><li>  Climate control unit with the ability to control an external heater and / or air conditioner to maintain the operating temperature of the equipment; </li><li>  Access control unit, which allows you to install surveillance FTTB cabinet, and in the case of unauthorized access to take the necessary measures; </li><li>  Audible alarm in case of unauthorized access to the object; </li><li>  The unit ‚Äúlife support‚Äù of equipment that performs continuous diagnostics of the communication channel using PING requests and in the case of no response performs a restart of the switches to restore functionality; </li><li>  The block of collecting indications from the electric power meter; </li><li>  Built-in electricity meter (in the modification of the device PPU-S). </li></ul><br><table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">  Specifications </td></tr><tr><td>  Housing </td><td>  Constructive allows all connections without opening the device </td></tr><tr><td>  Power supply, V </td><td>  230 ¬± 10 </td></tr><tr><td>  Power consumption, not more, W </td><td>  45 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total power consumption of the load, not more, W </td><td>  150 </td></tr><tr><td>  Average service life, years </td><td>  not &lt;10 </td></tr><tr><td>  MTBF, h </td><td>  not &lt;50.000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Overall dimensions, not more, mm </td><td>  438x278x88 </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight, not more, kg </td><td>  6 </td></tr><tr><td>  External interfaces </td><td>  Ethernet </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  INTEGRATED OPPORTUNITIES OF PPU </h3><br>  We describe the work of the new device in terms familiar to us, the developers: ‚Äúsetting the task - implementing the function‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>1. PROTECTION.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Needless to say about the modern orgy of theft and vandalism ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bba/f5d/c08/bbaf5dc08241f06cf85b0072dcd4b764.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Function implementation:</strong> In addition to the cabinet door opening and impact (vibration) sensors, the device has an access authorization node (CHIP reader) and an alarm sounder (siren).  The siren turns on automatically when the shock sensor triggers or when the cabinet door is opened and the authorization is not executed by the subject.  The intensity of the sound pressure developed by the siren is very high - at the level of the pain threshold.  Due to the presence of the UPS node, the siren will work even if the cabinet is completely de-energized, the communication channel is broken, etc.  As a result, the cabinet acquires the function of self-active protection against theft (vandalism). <br>  In addition, PUF allows you to control the cross-access copper cable.  To put the cable under protection, you need to select a free pair in the cable, short it at the opposite end and plug it into the gap of the door sensor.  It is done. <br><br>  <strong>2. CLIMATIC MODES AND FIRE SAFETY.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Task setting:</strong> As you know, FTTB cabinets are often placed in attics and basements of residential buildings, where they are ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù in winter and overheated in summer.  And there and close to the fire. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/412/c9c/25b/412c9c25bfe7db2a36542dce3d65bbb2.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Function realization: The</strong> PUF is completed with a digital temperature sensor with a plug connector and a flexible wiring connector 50 cm long. This design allows the sensor to be placed directly at the point of possible maximum heating.  The digital value of the measured temperature is transmitted to the center.  In addition, the PUF contains a special ‚Äúclimatic‚Äù controlled outlet of ~ 220 volts, into which either electric fans (cooling) or heating elements (heating) can be included.  The threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãof temperatures, upon reaching which heating or ventilation is automatically turned on, can be set and changed by the user from the DC.  Thus, the PUF is able to independently regulate the temperature inside the cabinet, preventing overheating or overcooling of the equipment. <br><br>  <strong>3. ORGANIZATION OF QUALITY POWER SUPPLY WITH RESERVATION.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Problem Statement: The</strong> state of electrical power inputs in residential buildings is well known.  As a rule, they are designed according to the standards of the 60s and do not withstand the stresses created by modern household appliances.  As a result - throws and dips in the power supply network supplying the cabinet.  And the corresponding quality of the Internet is low, far from reaching the stated speeds.  Or its complete (Internet) disappearance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/f7f/212/68bf7f212f1810c63d10bb74b1e187ac.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Implementation of the function:</strong> The function of organizing power supply with redundancy is performed by the UPS node built into the PUF.  This node is built specifically for specific consumers, which are Fast Ethernet router switches.  It is devoid of the disadvantages of a UPS designed for other purposes: <br><ul><li>  The output form of our UPS does not create interference that can reduce the speed of data exchange.  At the same time, UPSs that are not specialized for working with switches, have an output signal in the form of a so-called ‚Äúmodified sine wave‚Äù.  Under this beautiful name hides the fact that the device, in fact, is a generator of rectangular pulses with an amplitude of 220 volts and a frequency of 50 Hz.  The proximity of such a source of interference with Ethernet is highly undesirable, since no one knows in what spectrum and with what amplitude pickups appear that can seriously reduce the speed of data exchange; </li><li>  All parameters of our UPS node are measured and transmitted to the Dispatch Center (DC) in the general signaling package, that is, no interface conversion is required in this case.  Non-specialized UPSs, as a rule, work under the RS232 protocol, therefore, an additional ‚Äúintermediary‚Äù is necessary for exchange with DC over Ethernet. </li><li>  the presence of a sufficient number of sockets for connecting all reserved and non-reserved consumers.  In the UPS, not designed specifically for the cabinet FTTB, just do not have enough power outlets. </li></ul><br>  This UPS is designed taking into account the features of the object and is devoid of the disadvantages of the UPS, created for other purposes.  When using standard UPS, switching to battery power occurs with a voltage drop, the duration of which is approximately 20-60 ms - this is enough to disrupt the operation of the switch.  UPS technology "Tehnotroniks" has a significant advantage - the transition to backup power occurs without the "dips" voltage, which eliminates the possibility of "hang" switches (also see this in the <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dnews220">VIDEO</a> ). <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/946/a9c/984/946a9c984541c3a119f744fcdcec50e0.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>6.</strong> PPU is designed specifically for FTTB cabinets, so its output signal does not interfere with the operation of switches <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90f/a2d/361/90fa2d361d481339b988ef7f6fcc7b7d.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>7.</strong> Display of data on the operation of the UPS in the software "KUB-Ttkh" <br><br>  <strong>4. STRUGGLE AGAINST THE "DEPENDENCE" OF ELECTRONIC "FILLING" OF A CABINET.</strong>  <strong>DISTANCE AND AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF SWITCHES.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Task setting: The</strong> ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù of the equipment and, as a result, the temporary loss of its working capacity is partly due to the poor quality of the power supply, and partly to its design flaws.  After all, it is not a secret that the main criterion for choosing a specific type of devices is price.  And this does not contribute to their reliable operation.  The method of "treating" this disease is also well known - short-term withdrawal of the power supply followed by re-feeding.  If a visit is required for such a procedure, the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù is expensive.  And for the period of waiting for "resuscitator" all subscribers are left without a service.  Thus, it is highly desirable to do a power reboot remotely (if the equipment has not lost the ability to perceive commands) or automatic (if the switches can only be restarted ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd5/dfa/891/dd5dfa891995242ff9697fcd119270df.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Function implementation:</strong> PUF is capable of performing both listed types of switch power restarting - both external (remote) and internal.  As part of the PUF there are controlled sockets ~ 220 Volts, providing the physical implementation of the break / power supply.  Switches are included in these sockets.  No more external switching elements are required. <br><br>  <strong>5. REMOTE READING OF INDICATIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER ACCOUNT DEVICES.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Task setting:</strong> The usefulness of this function does not require special comments.  It is clear that monthly to go around all the houses and entrances where FTTB cabinets are installed and to manually write off the meter readings is unpleasant and troublesome.  On the other hand, not to set the counter at all and blindly pay the bills issued by the HOA and the management companies means to repeatedly overpay for invalid figures. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38b/dbd/478/38bdbd478b0743c4353881c94b2a016a.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Function implementation:</strong> There is a separate modification of the device under the name PPU-S, which contains a built-in electricity meter.  The data from the pulse (telemetric) input of the counter are summed up, stored and transmitted in a general packet to the DC.  If according to the Customer‚Äôs Specifications, it is required to install a separate external meter, then in this case it is also possible to take readings from it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/2bc/09d/8422bc09d701178106a6b7632573ebb3.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Photo 8.</strong> FTTB cabinet for two switches with PPU <br><br><h3>  IN THIS WAY‚Ä¶. </h3><br><br>  Due to the above, a unique monitoring system based on PU foam allows: <br><ul><li>  perform a range of important functions: <br><ul><li>  quality power supply organization with redundancy, </li><li>  FTTB security, </li><li>  fire safety, temperature control and regulation, </li><li>  restart hung network equipment </li><li>  taking readings from an electric meter, </li><li> <a href=""><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e58/952/baa/e58952baa26d28a396e421a894aed014.png"></a>  access cable control, </li><li>  monitoring of telecommunication cabinets of server rooms; </li></ul></li><li>  minimize the number of individual blocks and connecting wires, and thus ensure order and save space in the closet for at least a couple of "units"; </li><li>  drastically increase the reliability of the security and monitoring system of the FTTB cabinet, simplify its installation and operation. </li></ul><br>  In March 2013, the system based on the PPU panel received a patent.
