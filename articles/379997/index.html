  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Give two!" Or about the benefits and dangers of multimonitor configuration</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of using the multi-monitor configuration is far from new: ordinary users have already managed to write about the convenience of separating working screens, describing their experience and manufacturers.  The latter even lead various studies with output data showing an increase in productivity during the transition to at least two monitors. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/251262/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bc/189/de3/5bc189de34444b00bf89a4cff3cad82d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Despite all this, most often the change of the standard configuration occurs after an unnecessary screen is at hand.  Experiments on the physical separation after a couple of days is so successful that only a display with a giant diagonal can contribute to the return.  However, if you believe the research, this alternative is unlikely to be appropriate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Performance or health?</font> </h2><br>  All studies regarding the increase in labor productivity after the introduction of a multimonitor configuration, one way or another boil down to the fact that the user does not spend time setting up window sizes and transitions between them.  Instead of trying to fit several programs on one working screen, with several monitors it will be possible to keep everything in front of your eyes without unnecessary manipulations.

      Dell in its <a href="https://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/monitors/en/dual_monitors_boost_productivity_whitepaper.pdf">study</a> calls for ‚Äúdoing more in less time,‚Äù where, along with a comparison of the productivity of using one and two monitors, diagonal displays are taken into account.  The conditional problem when using two monitors with a diagonal of 22 inches is solved on average 2 minutes faster, and in a working day you can save up to 40 minutes. <br><br>  The same effect can be achieved by replacing the monitor with an increased diagonal.  For example, when switching from a 22-inch monitor to a 26-inch, you can expect a 20% increase in productivity.  This also applies to the transition between the "younger" diagonals.  More interesting results are obtained in a <a href="http://ru.scribd.com/doc/34875662/NEC-Productivity-Study-0208">study</a> by NEC, which says that when switching to a 30-inch display after a 26-inch increase in performance begins to work in the opposite direction.  If you believe the research data, we can assume that two screens of up to 30 inches in diagonal will be effective.  At the same time, attempts to replace two monitors with one large one will fail. <br><br>  The effect of using multiple monitors on health, unfortunately, <a href="http://goo.gl/c5KIo9">can</a> be negative.  First of all, it threatens with neck problems, as the user performs more head rotations between monitors distant from each other.  In this regard, the problem is solved either by one large monitor (perhaps even curved, such as the <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/1004144">Samsung S34E790C</a> ), or by changing the location of the multi-monitor configuration in the direction of <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/1004144">getting the</a> screens closer to each other and removing the structure from the user at a convenient distance.  By the way, this problem has a place to be outside the context of this topic, as <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/40kilogramsofpersimmon/" class="user_link">40kilogramsofpersimmon</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250808/">told</a> about it not so long ago. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Connection options for multimonitor configuration</font> </h2><br>  The easiest and most common way to create a multi-monitor configuration is to connect as many monitors to a laptop as DVI, HDMI and VGA outputs allow.  As a rule, experiments end on one external monitor, as a more dimensional configuration leads to a lack of performance of the laptop‚Äôs video system or rests on the number of available output connectors.  Yes, and the laptop in this case is most often in the closed state (for various reasons: different scaling, so-so color reproduction or just an inconvenient location / angle of the laptop), as a result, not much different from the desktop PC. <br><br>  In the case of the desktop, everything is usually much simpler, since discrete video cards allow you to connect at least two monitors.  To increase the number of monitors, you can purchase a more advanced adapter model, or install several video cards.  It is also worth mentioning about the well-known technology AMD Eyefinity, which allows you to connect from 3 to 6 displays to a single video card thanks to special chips, but it involves working with DisplayPort or DVI-D, so if something happens, you have to fork out for adapters.  However, even without this system, it is more than realistic to make <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/232957/">Tony Stark's workplace</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/183/561/d5a/183561d5a0724932b125a8bad9fcfbcc.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, at least three output modes become available.  The most common is DualView, in which the monitors are completely autonomous, but, at the same time, are connected to each other.  So, it will turn out on monitors to display various programs and easily drag a window from one display to another.  Span-mode allows you to expand the image to multiple monitors at once, which, in fact, allows you to simulate one large monitor.  Finally, the duplication of screens is not the most convenient for work, but indispensable for the demonstration mode. <br><br>  Multi-monitor configuration is also realistic to get, not only using multiple displays, but also machines.  If computers with different monitors are on the same network, then special programs like <a href="http://synergy-project.org/">Synergy</a> for switching input devices will make management common. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">What can manufacturers offer?</font> </h2><br>  The trend towards the use of multi-monitor configurations could not be ignored by the monitor manufacturers.  For example, not so long ago, LG at the CES 2015 exhibition showed a 34-inch monitor <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/commercial/21-9-ultrawide-monitors/lg-34UC87M-B">34UC87M</a> .  Besides the fact that the screen has an aspect ratio of 21: 9, the surface itself has a rounded shape for a better viewing angle.  The company also offers to combine two or four monitors into one design with the help of special holders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/ad8/ab9/3a4ad8ab98d44e398a5b0204aa2645f4.jpg"><br><br>  Also, the company Philips last year introduced the Two-in-One Monitor - two 19-inch monitors with separate VGA ports and 3.5-mm display frames.  The screens are mounted on a single design, which allows you to form a panoramic picture, or to separate the monitors by tilting inwards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af7/28e/f6c/af728ef6c89b4fe7b9a87eedc10affc1.jpg"><br><br>  The problem of dividing the working space between multiple screens is also solved by monitors from Dell and in particular the Ultrasharp series.  The relatively thin frame of the display reduces the distance between the two monitors, and the standard mounting design allows the monitor to be rotated 90 degrees.  Also, in the case of the <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/665201">Dell UltraSharp U2414H</a> , it is proposed to use an additional stand for two monitors at once, which makes the design look like a Philips model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/62a/712/33662a712fb64dcda8787c69057279c8.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, the market in the near future with a high degree of probability will acquire a new niche of products aimed at multi-monitor solutions.  To understand that such a need exists, just look at any IT office, where almost every employee has at least two screens - a laptop and an external monitor.  Surely this is not a discovery for you, so in the comments we will be waiting for you to experience using multi-screen systems: what scenarios do you use, what programs do you use? <br><br>  All productive work week! <br><br>  <b>Health geek:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/251050/">Health Geek: Coffeeman right</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250808/">How not to sour to old age</a> <br><br>  <b>Computer health:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/251026/">Proper nutrition</a> <br><br>  <b>Our reviews:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/248110/">Connect original gamepads to PC</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247942/">Razer Abyssus: the most affordable Razer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247626/">Nikon 1 S2: one-button mirrorless</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/246340/">Lenovo Miix 3-1030 Review</a> <br>  <b>¬ªWe</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245854/">understand the art-chaos of the company Wacom</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245646/">ASUS ZenFone 5, LG L90, HTC Desire 601 - a two-part war for the consumer, part 1</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245210/">ASUS Transformer Pad</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/379997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/379997/</a></p>
