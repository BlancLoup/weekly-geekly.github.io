And now, when only a week is left before the conference, we are going to tell about the reports that can be heard on it: from the story of the multiplatform use of Kotlin to the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù keynout of Jonathan Levin.  If you still have not decided whether to go - this is what will help to decide! </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Cross-platform reports </h2><br><p>  Like the whole world of mobile development, Mobius is divided into iOS and Android: usually each report belongs to one of these platforms.  But there are those that will be useful to both parties, and we will start with them: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/or/ld/iu/orldiucnqcj4oqkndi4wihfr-4o.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/5scrjaz2ieoyw2ikwwawek/">Multi-platform architecture on Kotlin for iOS and Android</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  While many perceive Kotlin as a ‚Äúlanguage for Android‚Äù, in fact, its creators have much more ambitious plans.  They are for cross-platform development in the same language, and a year ago, they called iOS one of the target platforms of their project Kotlin / Native.  So far, this is all in an experimental mode, but it is even more interesting: it‚Äôs already written on each fence about using Kotlin on Android, but for the time being you need to look for cross-platform nuances to look for a day with fire.  And on Mobius these can be found: the topic will be opened by <b>Roman Yatsyna</b> and <b>Ivan Vazhnov</b> (Revolut). </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/7j/a6/wc7ja6l12z8j_bcp579x5sr-1pc.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/2ls3qk7264cowsigqa80kk/">A / B testing that you enjoy</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  It would seem that difficult in A / B testing?  A and B were sitting on the bag, which showed themselves better - something remained on the bag.  But in fact, in 2018, such testing continues to be confused with phased rolling, its results are not always correctly analyzed, and topics like support for unit testing, regardless of the A / B options, continue to raise questions.  On Mobius, they will find the answers. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8j/dq/n8/8jdqn8l3nfn4fd4xuksa9awwynk.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/9tzgoqy9ziemomygog24u/">Multi-module project architecture</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  There is a half a joke that Android applications would be very beneficial if Google obliged everyone to support Instant Apps: since this requires the application to modularize, it would have to ‚Äúunravel spaghetti‚Äù all willy-nilly, and the quality of the code would increase dramatically.  And if you don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúpointer from above‚Äù in order to think about improving the quality, then <b>Evgeny Suvorov</b> ‚Äôs experience from Avito may be useful: he will tell you about the modularization of projects with 400 thousand lines of code for both iOS and Android. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/6n/qw/ub6nqwytvmxktj_qowjnho57bea.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/3vfanjlqwui6qysycgimmu/">Avito Mobile App Releases</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  Continuing the topic of mobile development in Avito: <b>Alexey Shpirko</b> will tell you how the process of release of mobile applications is arranged there, what steps in the process automate, how they reduce the amount of manual testing before release and how they are sure that nothing is broken. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/e0/08/ale008olllivf81phlsxeq_yb3s.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/6g5bfsrzxiaqwi2is48owm/">Reverse Engineering Mobile Apps: How, why, and what now?</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  Billions of dollars are invested in mobile startups - and investors would like no one to take the result of their investments.  But at the same time, resources are often not allocated for protection against reverse engineering.  One may be surprised at this sad paradox, and one can make a feasible contribution to correcting it: visit the report and find out exactly how to defend oneself. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/92/_3/pi92_3yqnrdlxj0qzfxegtre2j8.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/3jqdk59seu8kkc0iwoem4c/">What Mom Never Told You About Multi-threading</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  Admittedly, <b>Fernando Tsehasa</b> (IBM) has the background in Android, and in the multi-threading report he will start from this background, but iOS developers should also be interested.  In the end, the very topic of multithreading is much broader than any particular platform.  And you can listen about this topic forever, there would be a good speaker.  And in Fernando no doubt: he had already spoken at Mobius before and fell in love with the public.  You should not wait for a superhardcore, but it will help many people to refresh knowledge. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/u8/pe/tbu8pe8y34ls2dv0ohjpmip_zam.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/11nvrg9eueiuscgmqesa42/">The epic battle: iOS vs.</a></strong>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/11nvrg9eueiuscgmqesa42/">Android</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  We admit honestly: we ourselves do not know in all details what exactly to expect from the speech of <b>Jonathan Levin</b> , who will close the conference.  But last time, at the closing, Jonathan also gave an unpredictable show, but in the end everyone liked it.  So here it is worth knowing just ‚Äúthe Android and iOS battle is planned‚Äù and expect that it won't be boring, and let the implementation details be a surprise. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2>  iOS </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/22/gc/op/22gcop_otqmzluf3txv6jzdkczw.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/4ikpo5fpvwuewcyaowyemc/">Trusting iOS SDKs</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  <b>Felix Krause</b> many people know from the fastlane tool.

But his interests are not limited to this; security issues in the world of iOS development are also important to him.

One of the variants of such a development of events is the identification of persons.  <b>Nikolai Ashanin</b> will consider what the identification of persons is and whether it is realistic to solve this problem on a mobile device.

Yandex was one of the first to do this by making on-screen hints for walking routes: now even those who have always been afraid of maps can find the way to the right house.

The examples will be focused on the iOS platform and the Swift language, but the technique is quite suitable for Android. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/uh/pc/_xuhpc6x2djuc69bfi_97l8qpgm.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/6ma0dejs2wqaewg4cco0e2/">Secure application: disassemble mobile banking</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  If you ask people "what the application requires special security," one of the main answers will be "money."  Banking has always required greater security than the conditional application for applying photo filters.  And the name of the CFT company means ‚ÄúCenter for Financial Technologies‚Äù - it is not surprising that its employees <b>Kirill Zuev</b> and <b>Artem Logutov</b> will talk about biometric authentication, Keychain, SSL pinning and the like. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/iy/qj/bdiyqjg1bilprc2fonnb4jiuoe8.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/2ie8oi8sreycuecsaq6qeg/">We are preparing the application in the Playgrounds</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  <b>Denis Kirillov</b> and <b>Konstantin Yurichev</b> , inspired by the experience of using Playground-Driven Development, will tell about their experience of using this methodology in commercial development on iOS: ‚ÄúA year ago, at the Mamba team, we collected all the crutches we knew and ran with them through a field full of rakes, to meet the bright a future in which you can debug a mobile application while it is being encoded.

Mobius will be able to speak <b>Andrei Breslav</b> , who heads the development of Kotlin, about how it influenced the features of other languages.  And, which is no less valuable, after the report there will be an opportunity to ask Andrey his question - not necessarily about the connection between Kotlin and other languages. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/2d/cd/nc2dcdbxohfr-hekwerpn4a9slc.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/2kbomfvosgmyma0cw26cic/">Profiling in examples: looking for a bottleneck</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  In the latest version of Android Studio profiler improved, learning to follow and native code.  But having a profiler is not enough - they need to be able to use it. </p><br><p>  The report is a technical case.  There is an application that works.  There is a feeling that it does not work fast enough.  First, <b>Arthur Badretdinov</b> will figure out how true this feeling is, with the help of more precise tools than intuition.  Then we ‚Äúdissect‚Äù this application, using several tools one by one, along the way introducing optimization.  Not every optimization is worth its effort, so we will track the results of each of them.  Finally, we will look at several tools that allow you to monitor how well the application works from assembly to assembly. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eh/me/xz/ehmexzcng3wpwlaqpyma-vapytg.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/mt2eecqokiosqguiooouu/">The violinist is not needed: we refuse RxJava in favor of Korutin in Kotlin</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  65% of developers, starting a project at Kotlin, choose RxJava 2 as a tool for background work.  But how justified is this choice?  Korutin in Kotlin can be a powerful replacement for RxJava.  In the report, <b>Vladimir Ivanov</b> compares both approaches, considers their pros and cons, and looks at when it is more convenient to use Korutina, and in which it is impossible to do without Rx.  It will become clear how to test the code written using both approaches, and how far they can coexist. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/tp/dw/bttpdw-0kkhauykgi81cbgdls9c.png" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/1drnrhowzy20scawmkwgyo/">The hard way to JobScheduler and back</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  By November 2018, we will all be forced to switch to targetSdk 26+, which means that almost every application will explicitly or implicitly use the platform JobScheduler.  However, this component is far from ideal, it has many problems that you would not expect to see and that you may not encounter until it reaches your users.  In the report, <b>Artur Vasilov</b> (Yandex) will consider all such problems, discuss errors in the Android code and figure out how to switch to JobScheduler as painlessly as possible. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/jb/lc/pcjblc-jjtxhu1calzlvyphooys.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/7ydxrub4nucyauwkqgsysq/">Birth, life and death, or What happens to the application in the system</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  Android is a very complex system where many different things happen that are very well hidden from ordinary developers.  In the report, <b>Anton Dudakov</b> (Yandex) will analyze: <br>  - how Android launches itself, launches applications; <br>  - who, why, through what mechanisms and what methods it causes in the launched application components; <br>  - where do requests for access rights to certain resources go, on the basis of which the system decides whether to issue rights or not; <br>  - how the application eventually dies: what can be killed, what will happen if you kill yourself. </p><br><p><br clear="all"></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/bf/cm/hzbfcmvgjvtqrtctlyyhcrim5mg.jpeg" align="left"><br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/4obtjok9zi62ke0wsaiqm0/">Upload to Odnoklassniki</a></strong> </blockquote><p>  In the Android application Odnoklassniki, the user can download a lot of different content.

In addition, the likelihood that the content, for various reasons, will be lost, is reduced.  So the task of speeding up the upload manager appeared.
