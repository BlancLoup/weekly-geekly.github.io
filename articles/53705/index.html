      <b>Practical significance.</b>  The paper presents the solution of the actual applied problem, giving a significant economic effect. <br>  <b>Approbation of work</b> .  The solution has been tested in the <i>Institute of cats nutrition</i> and is successfully used in <i>its own hamster nursery</i> . <br><br>  <b>The scientific novelty of the</b> proposed work is as follows: <br>  - for the first time, <i>physical exercise was</i> used to <i>improve the quality of meat and reduce the time it takes to form reproductive function</i> ; <br>  - A new model of <i>quality of life for an animal has been</i> proposed and methods for <i>quantitative measurement of its indicators have been considered</i> [2] [3]; <br>  - a new draft of the <i>industrial unit for running hamsters of the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù type</i> , which differs from the known <i>constructive solutions and low cost of ownership</i> , for which the RF patent <i>No. 29902-33 / X was</i> received, was <i>developed</i> . <br><br>  // introduction <br>  At present, in the food industry, the actual task of <i>controlling weight gain in hamsters during fattening</i> .  This task has been known since <i>ancient times</i> , when <i>primitive people, sitting by the fire, dreamed of a delicious hamster</i> .  Later <i>, such scientists as F. Bacon (1820), Louis le Fauches (1929), and Russian researchers A.V. were engaged in the</i> theoretical and applied elaboration of the <i>tasks of feeding hamsters.</i>  <i>Myasoedov (1950) and A.I. Supets (1985)</i> , which proves the relevance of research topics. <br><br>  // overview <br>  To date, the <i>process of weight gain in small rodents (see K. Babakov‚Äôs monograph [Babakov 1980])</i> has been well studied <i>,</i> <i>optimal feeding patterns</i> have been developed, and the theory of <i>vitamin supplements to food has been</i> developed <i>[A.V. Ascorbin 1992]</i> . <br><br>  // need or paragraph "however ..." <br>  However, the existing theory of <i>fattening</i> and <i>weight management</i> methods do not solve a number of tasks: <br>  Task 1 - <i>management and quality control of animal meat while shortening the fattening period (analytical report [Koshkin, Mouse 2002])</i> . <br>  Task 2 - <i>preservation of the breeding ability of hamsters in meat breeds when forcing weight gain by optimizing nutritional patterns (FBI report 2008, Food Safety section, volume 4)</i> . <br><br>  // what solutions are known, why they are bad <br>  At the present time, <i>at the enterprises, handicraft methods are used to solve these problems, which increase the cost of maintaining animals by an amount from 50% to 70% [Zhrunkin 2005].</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Reducing costs in solving problems 1 and 2</i> is an actual applied task and can provide a significant economic effect. <br><br>  // our offers - overview <br>  In this paper, we propose a method for <i>controlling meat quality and preserving reproductive function (solving problems 1 and 2)</i> by applying <i>physical load on fattened animals</i> .  It proves the effectiveness of this method and justifies the economic feasibility of its use. <br><br>  // factors and criteria for evaluating the result <br>  According to the results of the research conducted by the author [1], the following reasons for the <i>decline in meat quality and reproductive function were</i> revealed <i>:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- deviations of the diet from the natural (Graph 1)</i> <i><br></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://mkvad.ru/var/fck/image/g1.PNG"></div><br>  - reduction of the life expectancy of the fattened animal at the slowing down of puberty due to the violation of the food composition (Figure 2) <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://mkvad.ru/var/fck/image/g2.PNG"></div>  <i>According to the World Association for Healthy Nutrition, the minimum acceptable value of the meat quality criterion according to Z. Zubu is 69%.</i>  <i>The Academy of Rodents in [2] indicates that the quality of the minimum individuals giving offspring is 40%.</i> <br><br>  // essence of the sentence <br>  The author suggests the following method: <br>  when <i>equipping cells with shells of the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù type and using the exercises 15 minutes per hour (which entails an increase in expenses for keeping animals by 7% to 22%), the meat quality and the level of reproductive function</i> take acceptable values ‚Äã‚Äã[4]. <br><br>  // approbation and confirmation <br>  A series of experiments was carried out, during which the effect of <i>physical exercises on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Tooth criterion and reproductive function was</i> investigated.
