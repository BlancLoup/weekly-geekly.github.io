So while there are many options for how to spend it: that is, decide exactly where to read Habra - at home, on the beach or at work. <br>  But there is another option that you will surely like if you are tired of such a holiday and want to devote time to your development and future career. <br><br>  In July - August 2012 in the development centers p.  Intel's Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk will host Summer Internship Schools (LS).  More than 50 participants will be able to practice their programming skills and gain invaluable experience in real projects of the company. <br>  The tasks that the LS participants are invited to work on in this, 0x7DC, year are so interesting that even if for some reason you cannot take part in the LS (sorry, sorry), then you should get to know them better.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Tasks </h5><br>  In total, Intel engineers formulated about fifty tasks that they would have enjoyed working on themselves, if they had <s>n‚Äôt spent their time on formulating these tasks,</s> they were not engaged in other, no less interesting tasks. <br>  Tasks cover virtually all areas of programming, from low-level (for example, <b>Static Analysis of Program Code Efficiency through Binary Code Analysis</b> or Instrument for Analyzing Executable Code Size) to web programming (for example, <b>Web Service for Visualizing Data Collected by Intel Inspector XE</b> "or" <b>Website development for monitoring the performance of a web portal using the capabilities of HTML 5 and CSS3</b> "). <br>  There are tasks for both Windows and Linux ... and even for Android (" <b>Useful, smart and responsive mobile application for a tablet or phone, actively using the resources of the central and graphics processors</b> "). <br>  <b>.NET and C #?</b>  And there are such tasks too. <br>  Of course, many tasks are connected with parallel programming technologies - <b>OpenMP, TBB, Cilk</b> and <b>OpenCL</b> . <br>  Are you afraid of the word "Intrinsic"?  Then we suggest ‚Äú <b>Optimize the OpenCV library using the compiler's intrinsic functions</b> ‚Äù or explore the ‚Äú <b>Compatibility of intrinsics for Intel / GCC / Microsoft compilers</b> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Mathematics lovers (for example, " <b>Mathematical resource planning and testing tasks</b> ") and computer vision (examples below) are also not deprived of tasks. <br><br>  <b>The full list of tasks is available as a pdf file</b> <a href="http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/49/96/499621_499621.pdf">here</a> . <br>  But the most interesting (in my, subjective opinion) of his representatives: <br><br>  <b>Task 15. Recognizing the shape and rotation of objects</b> <br>  The purpose of the development is to create a human-machine interface, within which the user controls the operation of a program using different objects of a simple form (cube, sphere, pencil).  To do this, it is necessary to determine the fact of movement / rotation of the object, having at the input data from a unified shell over various input devices - cameras.  It is proposed to take a color video stream as a basis, but if the implementation requires the availability of 3D data, then a depth map will be available through the same interface.  To simplify the task, consider the edges of an object painted in a different color.  Offer your version of working with the sphere. <br><br>  <b>Task 3. Improve the work capture algorithm in the OpenMP / Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) libraries</b> <br>  Investigate the possibilities of improving the performance of the work capture algorithm in the OpenMP / Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) libraries for unstructured tasks, taking into account information about binding threads to processors, machine topology, and library limitations. <br><br>  <b>Task 21. Development of a decision-making algorithm based on unstable input data from the camera</b> <br>  Develop and implement a decision block based on data received after processing from ‚ÄúKinect for Windows‚Äù cameras. <br>  The project consists of three parts: <br>  1. Preparation of a review of technologies used in computer games for working with a 3D camera <br>  2. A prototype of using a web or 3D camera to form remote control commands (straight, back, left, right, stop) a ‚Äútoy‚Äù car in a graphical application that simulates the movement of a car over rough terrain.  The application is written in C ++ using the D3D 10 library. <br>  3. Virtual scene control (rotation, movement, zoom) using gestures based on information received from the camera Depth <br><br>  <b>Task 26. Applied implementation of the ideas of Continuous Delivery</b> <br>  Continuous Delivery (http://continuousdelivery.com) is an ultra-innovative and rapidly gaining in popularity idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontinuous software delivery to end users.  Each time a programmer integrates his changes into a central code repository, a new version of the system is delivered to end users.  The implementation of a similar approach to the delivery of software in practice puts the development team before a long list of calls: <br>  Fully automatically make sure that the changes made do not affect the performance of the system. <br>  Download the new version of the system to the server without interrupting users. <br>  After the shipment of the new version of the system, it is possible to automatically detect possible failures caused by the latest changes. <br>  Roll back the system to the previous version in case of problems identified and notify the author of the changes about the problem. <br>  Develop a set of rules, following which it will be possible to achieve simultaneous parallel execution of different versions of the system. <br><br>  <b>Task 7. Emulation of interaction with a mobile device</b> <br>  Description of the task.  Development of a set of tools that allow you to emulate accelerometer, GPS, video camera, microphone and other mobile device sensors.  Implement a universal driver that allows you to record and play back events. <br><br><h4>  Are you still in doubt - true or false? </h4><br>  Then we add that in addition to working on the tasks, for two months, leading engineers from Intel and teachers at Russian universities will hold special lectures, seminars and trainings for you.  In addition, you will have the opportunity to receive a certificate in one of the areas in the field of Intel Programming Professional, as well as take part in the U.M.N.I.K. program. <br><br>  In addition, the summer school is also a good opportunity to make money.  During the internship, a remuneration is paid, and non-resident interns are given a grant to travel from the place of study to the place of internship and back, plus free accommodation in a student dormitory. <br><br>  The school is being held for the 13th time, and, as a last resort, to eliminate your doubts, I can advise <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/92059/">an excellent post-announcement on one of the past schools</a> , in which there are links to a story about past schools (no, this is not recursion). <br><br>  By the way, since then the Intel office in Nizhny Novgorod has been modernized, especially the canteen, and right in front of the office, the cable car through the Volga has started to work. <br><h4>  I'm interested.  How to become a "schoolboy"? </h4><br>  To take part in the internship you need <br><ul><li>  Read <a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/471955.htm">the full terms of participation in the LS</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/49/92/499251_499251.pdf">Download and fill in the application form</a> </li><li>  Make a rough plan for solving your chosen problem from <a href="http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/49/96/499621_499621.pdf">the above full list</a> .  Since programmers are creative people, we do not have strict requirements for the description of an idea. </li></ul><br>  When the questionnaire is filled out, and your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe solution is written in a text editor, send all materials to us at <b>innl-schools@intel.com</b> <br><br>  And do not hesitate - there are just a few days left until the end of the application!  ( <a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/471955.htm">See LS website</a> ) <br><br>  If you still have questions, they will be answered by phone +7 (831) 296-94-91. <br>  UPD.  Applications are accepted until 6:00 pm May 10th. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143228/</a></p>
