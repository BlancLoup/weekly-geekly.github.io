The collected data were published in a special <a href="https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/kubernetes">e-book</a> on Kubernetes, and key findings were published as separate news on the resource.  <a href="https://thenewstack.io/week-numbers-kubernetes-implementations-good-bad-ugly/">The last</a> of them was devoted to the introduction of Kubernetes, and this is what the numbers say ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Barriers to implementation </h2><br>  It is unlikely that anyone will be surprised by the fact that the main obstacle slowing the start of Kubernetes application is the <b>complexity of the configuration and</b> product <b>support</b> - 36% of the respondents clearly (not using K8s in production) unequivocally agree, 39% agree to some extent that in total gives <b>75%</b> . 
      <br>

      However, it should be noted and the closest pursuer among the answers to this question - the presence of other projects with high priority - which in total was supported by 60%.  Apparently, the need for these respondents to implement K8s is not yet so high due to the specific infrastructure or lack of confidence about the applicability, the available capabilities and / or the proven reliability of Kubernetes. <br><br>  Of the other results that Kubernetes still hinders adaptation, almost half of the respondents (43%) use other solutions to one degree or another, and 27% think that manual orchestration is more or less sufficient.  However, both of these arguments are no longer very significant for the vast majority of respondents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e5/7c/59e57c81546b6428446123.png"><br><br><h2>  Implementation deadlines </h2><br>  The time spent on implementing Kubernetes was in <b>line with expectations</b> (or even less) <b>in 56% of cases</b> , but more than a third of respondents (38%) had this process delayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e5/7f/59e57f9e47471953365483.png"><br><br>  The initial phase of implementation is the most time-consuming: only 50% of users surveyed at this stage had a time out prediction.  At the same time, the full implementation met the deadline for 63% of respondents. <br><br>  One of the representatives of small businesses noted that the implementation took longer because of poor documentation on Kubernetes as of a year ago, but "today everything is much simpler."  Similar criticism of the project has been heard from other companies that implemented Kubernetes a year or two ago - for example, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/flant/blog/334770/">Concur</a> (later absorbed by SAP).  According to the results of their project on putting K8s into production in 2016, Concur experts called the insufficiently detailed / detailed documentation the main problem of the young Open Source-project.  And by 2017, they fell in love with CoreOS products, explaining their choice as ‚Äúthe best documentation for Kubernetes‚Äù. <br><br>  78% of respondents were involved in the implementation of their own, 12% assigned this task to another team within the company, and 9% - to third-party professionals involved in Kubernetes and DevOps.  For cases of Kubernetes implementation with the help of contractors, 20% of the respondents did not meet the deadlines, which is almost <b>twice as good as the</b> general indicator, when the implementation was mainly carried out on its own. <br><br><h2>  Results of implementation and conclusions </h2><br>  According to data from 173 users of Kubernetes in production, this system fully or partially meets their needs <b>in 99% of cases</b> .  At the same time, users of large-scale Kubernetes implementations are more fully satisfied with the system - they have this indicator one third higher than those who are at the initial stage of operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e5/84/59e584a2604c1076969531.png"><br><br>  As noted in The New Stack, ‚Äúthough a little less than half of the users who have implemented Kubernetes on a large scale, are completely satisfied with the result, remember that at its 2-year-old Kubernetes ecosystem (or market) for <b>another year before</b> some analytical firms could consider its as a developed, established market. " <br><br>  Another conclusion is that <b>at the implementation stage of Kubernetes it requires significant human resources, but over time they pay for themselves</b> (due to the fact that the deployment is accelerated, the management of the infrastructure is simplified, its scaling, etc.). <br><br>  What conclusions are made regarding the market?  With a high probability, many companies will look for orchestration solutions <b>integrated into larger platforms</b> that are already used by them one way or another (for which they have gained sufficient expertise, experience, and confidence).  In addition, the complexity and duration of the implementation of Kubernetes means good <b>opportunities for new companies</b> able to solve these problems for their customers (using their products and services). <br><br><h2>  Other information about the respondents </h2><br>  You can get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe users surveyed in The New Stack using the additional statistics published in the mentioned <a href="https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/kubernetes">e-book</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  <b>62% use Kubernetes in production</b> (fully or at the initial stage), 22% use or try K8s; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e5/88/59e588784a848829790376.png"></li><li>  Kubernetes is most widely used by large organizations: in production (at the initial stage or elsewhere), it is used by 72% of companies with more than 1,000 employees <i>(for comparison, companies with 2‚Äì100 and 101‚Äì1,000 employees - 57% and 54 % respectively)</i> ; </li><li>  The most popular workloads launched in Kubernetes are the application development cycle, including CI / CD, testing, and so on.  (65%), as well as web services and ecommerce (53%), specialized industrial applications (37%);  <i>for mobile applications and services - 30%, for business applications (ERP, CRM ...) - 24%;</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e5/8d/59e58dc351e70125377717.png"></li><li>  the number of deployed clusters among users who actively use Kubernetes in production is 2 (22%), 6-10 (20%), 3 (16%);  <i>one cluster in 8% of respondents, and more than 50 clusters - in 5%;</i> </li><li>  <b>74% of respondents use the Kubernetes community editorial board</b> , and 45% of the various options from the vendors (some also use different K8s distributions); </li><li>  among other solutions for orchestration tasks, at least partially used by respondents, are Docker Engine / Swarm (29%), own utilities and scripts (16%), Amazon ECS (12%), Apache Mesos / Mesosphere and OpenStack Magnum (9%) ); </li><li>  The main factors that act as mandatory requirements for container orchestration tools are scalability (71%), flexibility (58%), simple manageability (56%), security (51%), resource optimization (45%); </li><li>  Popular reasons for choosing Kubernetes are community strength, a high level of support from well-known companies like Google and Red Hat, technical excellence. </li></ul><br>  And below is attached a <b>poll</b> , which aims to find out how many Habra users have already implemented Kubernetes or are just going to do it.
