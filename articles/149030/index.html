  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steve Wozniak patrolled a US Secret Service agent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Steve Wozniak published an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148040/">inventory of the</a> contents of his backpack, which he constantly takes on trips.  Among dozens of gadgets, Woz mentioned sheets of two-dollar bills, which he also carries with him all the time.  Some readers have a logical question: why do we need sheets? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6c/122/166/b6c12216658ebc1f5624529fbd92c980.jpg"><br><br>  Note: Few people know about this, but the American <a href="http://www.moneyfactory.gov/">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a> , a manufacturer of ordinary banknotes for the Federal Reserve, <a href="http://www.moneyfactorystore.gov/uncutcurrency.aspx">sells</a> uncut sheets with 4.16 or 32 banknotes.  Sheets are sold to collectors, and the banknotes here are one and a half to two times more expensive than the nominal.  Woz specially makes them perforated by the printer in order to conveniently tear off the banknotes, taking a large sheet from his pocket. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The answer to the question of why Voz carries with him sheets of two-dollar bills can be found in the archives of his personal website: this <a href="http://archive.woz.org/letters/general/78.html">story</a> occurred several years ago in Las Vegas, where Wozniak and his wife brought their daughter to perform in regional gymnastics competitions.

      To entertain himself, Steve went to the casino and, as usual, started joking with his two-dollar bills.  He took out a sheet, tore off one bill from him - and gave the waitress a tip.  Traditionally, it caused a lot of positive emotions.  For some reason, everyone is very fond of two-dollar bills, not to mention the impression that a whole sheet produces on the average person, from which such a bill is torn off.  Wozniak says that every two-dollar bill costs him three dollars, but they give so many jokes in life that they pay for themselves completely. <br><br>  However, the story in the casino is not over.  After some time, an absolutely imperturbable casino security manager approached Wauz and calmly sat down beside him.  He slowly started talking about two-dollar bills.  Steve began to troll him, saying that he had bought notes from some guy on the street and thought they were real.  The guard said they checked them with a portable scanner - the notes turned out to be real.  After that, Steve showed the manager a sheet with perforations, driving him to a stupor for a minute.  Then Steve drew his attention that the numbers on the sheets of the sheet do not go in a row, there are the same first and last numbers, while the numbers in the middle change.  This drove him into a stupor for a minute, but he did not lose his imperturbable appearance, although his jaw dropped slightly. <br><br>  After trolling the security manager, Wozniak faced a more difficult task.  When Steve Wozniak went to freshen up and came back - a young man in a suit was waiting for him, it was the US Secret Service agent.  Steve Wozniak sat down next to him.  The agent looked around and said that he needed to find a quiet place.  They found such a room, and the agent closed the door behind him.  When he read Steve's rights, including the right to remain silent and so on, he understood that the matter would be delayed, and he might be late for his daughter's performance in gymnastics. <br><br>  The agent asked for proof of identity, and Woz thought.  The fact is that he constantly carries with him a set of fake IDs for different occasions.  For example, his favorite ID was made 20 years ago, when color thermosublimation printers first appeared.  There is a real name and a picture of Wozniak, but the position is ‚Äúa laser safety officer‚Äù, and he himself is depicted with an eye patch.  There is also a seal of the Ministry of Defense, but the Department of Defiance is written on it (instead of the Department of Defense).  Steve almost always shows this ID when checking in for flights, he likes it so much.  But is it possible to take a chance now, when talking with a Secret Service officer, after all, it can even go to the criminal case for forging documents?  In the end, Woz made a decision - such a situation only happens once in a lifetime, and he got a fake ID. <br><br>  The Secret Service agent rewrote the name and ID number to himself in a notebook - and returned it back.  Woz was amazed to the core.  The secret service accepted the certificate of a ‚Äúlaser safety officer‚Äù with eye patch! <br><br>  He says that when he tells this story to other people, many people stop believing him at this particular moment. <br><br>  Then there was a detailed interview in which Steve was asked for the passport number, driver's license number, all credit card numbers, family names, school and university names, where he studied, and so on.  Then it came to listing the names of all the friends with phone numbers, because Steve had already started trolling and said he did not remember which friend had given him these sheets of banknotes.  That's it over. <br><br>  When the agent had already said goodbye, Steve still poured him a little bit about the fact that his 12-year-old daughter won $ 7,500 in the lottery keno, but all this money will go to the US government.  The fact is that only the parent can get the winnings, after which he will give almost half of this amount in the form of income tax, and the second half - in the form of a gift tax, because he transfers money to his daughter (every US citizen has an annual limit, how much he has the right to give gifts to relatives without paying tax, Steve has already chosen the limit that year). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJ1TIYxm1vM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-L2JEcgqWDSWlKc2uOnH9AUqmpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149030/</a></p>
