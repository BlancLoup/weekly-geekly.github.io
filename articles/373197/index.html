  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xiaomi nishtyak: the new Redmi Note 4X and something else</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  With you the next issue of "Xiaomi Herald".  Actually, no, just a Chinese company, beloved by many, announced new interesting devices that deserve our attention.  And at the same time tell about some of its other devices, if you suddenly missed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/048/936/685/04893668520a3c66116cf338782eca89.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, about updates - in early February on the official website of Xiaomi appeared information about the smartphone Redmi Note 4X.  There were a lot of rumors, and almost all of them were confirmed: the novelty was another version of the smartphone Redmi Note 4 with an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. In some countries, the device will come with a Snapdragon 653 chip and MediaTek Helio X20. <br><br>  The smartphone is equipped with a 5.5-inch IPS-display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. According to the already established tradition, Xiaomi offers three versions of the device: 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of built-in, 3 GB and 32 GB, and 4 GB and 64 GB, respectively.  All models support microSD memory cards.

The front camera is the traditional for many manufacturers resolution of 5 megapixels.  Under the flash is a fingerprint scanner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/451/97b/bab/45197bbabde9dfacf2da59c0100c7960.jpg"><br><br>  Nugi fans will have to wait - Redmi Note 4X is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with a proprietary MIUI 8 shell. The battery capacity is an impressive 4,100 mAh (you will still have to charge, so you can immediately get a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/plugs-sockets/pp_609502.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">useful accessory</a> ) cards (if the slot for a microSD memory card is not used).  3.5 mm audio jack in place, and thanks for that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/361/59c/b7a/36159cb7ad158aa6e871292c6da44849.jpg"><br><br>  The colors of Xiaomi have come off really: in addition to gold, matte black, silver and cherry pink, the company will release a limited edition smartphone in a green package (Hatsune Miku Edition), to the Japanese (and not only) for joy. <br><br>  And now to the point: sales of Redmi Note 4X started only at the end of last week, but now you can <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_613146.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">pre-order</a> a smartphone in silver with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash memory and get one of the first devices. <br><br><blockquote>  The first 100 people who manage to order Redmi Note 4X with <b>Note4XAB</b> coupon will be able to snatch it for $ 189.99! </blockquote><br><h2>  Mi TV Bar - to all soundbars soundbar </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/941/631/01e/94163101eb06f6b730174ba27ba90288.jpg"><br><br>  When in 1925 the world showed the first TV, it was difficult to imagine that in 90 years we will see sound bars - and not just speakers for the TV, but with its own processor, outputs and features.  Now the web is full of ‚Äústicks‚Äù for TV, but Xiaomi Mi TV Bar is quite another matter.  Under the exterior of the usual soundbar hides the MStar 6A928 processor. <br><br>  The device not only looks stylish, but also has an enviable "stuffing": three HDMI inputs, one for VGA, AV, DTMB, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0.  All this works under control of a 4-core 1.4 GHz Cortex A17 processor with a Mali-T760MP4 graphic core.  As befits an independent device, Mi TV Bar has 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal memory.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d97/27f/e9a/d9727fe9ae8a9ceb47de4d63a814a290.jpg"><br><br>  It is enough to connect the device to the TV in order to get access to the MIUI TV platform, the Xiaomi proprietary Android-based TV platform.  Although the soundbar is primarily designed to work with Mi TVs via a special Mi Port connector, you can buy it separately and use it with any TV or monitor via HDMI or VGA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9f/251/0f2/b9f2510f2d807ffe7482806c921d1853.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of sound.  For him in Mi TV Bar meet four 2.5-inch speakers with two tweeters.  In addition, there is a subwoofer output, which can significantly improve the sound characteristics of the device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2be/58a/ec3/2be58aec387f34a3c44e1ebac368579a.png"></div><br>  In fact, at the price of an ordinary soundbar, you can get not only a decent soundtrack, but also ‚Äúbrains‚Äù for your TV with full-fledged Android and full stuffing.  It is Mi TV Bar that is the cherry on the cake that makes Xiaomi TVs smarter.  You can rotate it <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_597313.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">with your home TV</a> , the main thing is not to forget the <b>GBMIBAR</b> coupon for a sooo good discount. <br><br><h2>  We control everything: IP-camera from Xiaomi </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf6/925/15c/bf692515ce7a7b0dd2b4d20e593b10cf.jpg"><br><br>  IP cameras are a painful issue for many.  The range is large, and from which to choose - it is not clear.  Xiaomi has helped with this issue with its IP-camera with magnetic mount, microphone and speaker. <br><br>  The device has an interesting cubic shape, shoots at 1080p, has a CMOS matrix (1 / 2.7), 8x digital zoom and ... yes, the possibility of night shooting.  On the back of the camera are USB and micro USB connectors, a work indicator light;  on the lower inner side there is a microSD memory card slot.  Foldable adjustable foot provides installation where it is convenient, with a rotation angle of 180 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62b/fa5/8bc/62bfa58bc0238c433cf130a7c65222e7.jpg"><br><br>  A powerful magnet is built into the base of the leg, which is able to hold it even on a vertical or ceiling surface - if, of course, the latter is metal.  Rubber linings eliminate slipping, and a cable length of 1.75 meters will allow you to install the camera in any accessible place. <br><br>  The picture is clear and understandable - yet the resolution of 1080p and the aperture of F 2.0 make themselves felt.  A wide-angle lens makes it possible to view at 110 degrees, and in the night (up to 9 meters) the camera can ‚Äúsee‚Äù with the help of an IR sensor.  Home video is better not to shoot, what if someone looks at the application on the smartphone?  Joke. <br><br>  By the way, this camera is still equipped with a smoke and carbon monoxide sensor: as soon as it reaches gas or smoke, it will automatically send a warning to the smartphone.  You can also use it as a baby monitor: you always know what is happening with the child (thanks to the sensor), and you can immediately calm him down with the help of the built-in speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0a/879/de3/f0a879de3e2995d0f46631c7fb765442.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  The solution is already budget (but very functional), and the camera <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_607361.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">can be bought for only $ 26.99</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  Xiaomi Headphones?  Give two pairs! </h2><br>  For a short time, Xiaomi managed to announce itself on the headphone market by launching a whole line - from 1More and Piston to full-size headphones.  The latter are a stylish wired model with a microphone, which is located on the cable with a length of 1.4 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b6/0a8/a24/2b60a8a24248c04be88a419df49309b9.png"><br><br>  Headphone sensitivity is 107 dB, the impedance is 32 Ohms, the frequency range is from 20 Hz to 40 kHz.  The plastic case, ear cushions and headband are covered with eco-leather, due to which the headphones are not only comfortable, but also pleasant.  Although the ears can sweat a little with prolonged use - there is no getting away from it. <br><br>  The main feature of full-size headphones from Xiaomi is the touch panel on the right cup, with which you can answer a call, stop playback, switch to the previous or next track. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bac/bef/014/bacbef0140dac21e88a31a5dc2087813.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  The sound, of course, is not Audio-Technica or Fostex, but also the corresponding price, which with the <b>OXIAOM</b> promo code <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/earbud-headphones/pp_604486.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">will drop to $ 39.99</a> .  As a home or office headphone, ‚Äúevery day‚Äù will do, but do not even think about connecting AK380 from Astell &amp; Kern to them </blockquote><br>
<h2>  Mi TV Box - and Apple TV is not needed </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bf/ac2/700/5bfac2700cae4b7d202e1161ad5aec33.jpg"><br>  Xiaomi Mi TV Box is a special console that is equipped with the function of watching online TV, a variety of multimedia content, all of which is controlled by the Android operating system.  It connects to YouTube, Google Play Movies, Netflix and a dozen more video services and comes with a Bluetooth remote with a microphone (which is also a joystick). <br><br>  Externally, the console remotely resembles Apple TV - the same smoothed corners, black, although a comparison with a sea stone here is perhaps more appropriate.  The rubberized pedestal allows the gadget to remain stable on the surface, even if you connect a massive external drive to the Mi TV Box.  For the beauty, however, will have to pay: because of the semi-matt plastic prints this box collects with a bang;  however, you are unlikely to touch it often. <br><br>  The rear panel houses the power connector, HDMI, USB and a 3.5 mm audio output. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ff/f78/2b5/8fff782b5f7e292552f6841893ed7937.jpg"><br><br>  The console is comfortable and ergonomic, with a circular joystick, five buttons and a central one, performing the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù command. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/224/10e/544/22410e5448cc26e606a4162a2adb1521.jpg"><br>  As for hardware, here we are met by the AMlogic S905 chipset - a 64-bit 4-core Cortex-A53 processor with a frequency of 2 GHz, a 28-nm process technology, and a Mali-450 graphics chip.  2 GB of RAM for everyday tasks and launch applications from Google Play is enough for the eyes, even serious games "go" on the minimum settings.  Of the 8 GB of internal memory, only 5 GB is available, but this is quite enough.  Yet this is not a smartphone, but a stationary device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8aa/606/ab2/8aa606ab27f5e28a370ef885b61ef502.jpg"><br><br>  Video support VP9 Profile-2 up to 4K x 2K @ 60fps copes with most formats, you can connect the console to Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n / ac, including 5 GHz, from wireless interfaces - Bluetooth 4.0.  In general, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãcool and convenient for viewing video content, for your money, this is almost the best solution on the market. <br><br><blockquote>  You <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_426056.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">can</a> buy <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_426056.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">here</a> , well, and about the coupon <b>GBMIBOX2</b> do not forget, who refuses to discount? </blockquote><br><h2>  More Light - Yeelight Smart LED Ceiling Light </h2><br>  Old lamps and floor lamps are best left to the grandmother when Xiaomi offers its own lamp with adjustable brightness and color temperature.  This is a ceiling lamp designed for a room ranging from 15 to 20 square meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/459/7ba/d6f/4597bad6fb7e66ff28e91f30023071ac.jpg"><br><br>  Using a mobile application and Bluetooth, you can set a comfortable brightness level - from 0.1 lumen to 2,000 lumens.  The color shades of illumination are as much as 240. 95 Osram LEDs meet the light in the Xiaomi Yeelight, the rated power of the ceiling lamp is 28 W.  The internal components of the lamp are well protected from insects, dust and small particles - it‚Äôs not for nothing that its body meets the IP60 standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/5f0/12a/43c5f012a87ae72ed440b9c8bdf65e4e.jpg"><br><blockquote>  In general, a cool thing that fits into any interior.

All this time they are forced to breathe harmful gases, so the air purifier inside the car is unlikely to be superfluous, especially if children are often transported.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-car-gadgets/pp_600854.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Car Air Cleaner</a> can easily be taken on the road - it is even equipped with a special mount for fixing the cleaner on the headrest. <br><br>  The cleaner can filter PM2.5 fine particles, the smallest droplets of liquids up to 2.5 microns in size.  Two fans provide performance up to 60 cubic meters per hour, while they can operate in low noise emission mode.  A few minutes - and 99.9% of PM2.5 particles will be defeated, and the air will become comfortable to breathe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c1/fbd/bf8/8c1fbdbf8df093802cf2efc856331a63.jpg"><br><br>  If you often transport children in a car or travel with them over long distances, such a device would not be superfluous in a car.  Moreover, a lot of space does not take, and the coupon <b>UEOA is</b> now <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-car-gadgets/pp_600854.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">available</a> for the cleaner <b>-</b> apply it and get your discount. <br><br><h2>  It's only the beginning </h2><br>  Two more months from 2017 have not passed, and Xiaomi has already managed to make several announcements, including she spoke at CES 2017 (how exactly - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/284644/">we told</a> ).  There is a drawback in this approach - due to the abundance of presentations and the rapid emergence of new devices, you can definitely miss something.  We will closely monitor this and make you aware of all the news of the Chinese company. <br><br>  Have a good weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373197/</a></p>
