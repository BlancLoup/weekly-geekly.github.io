This time he announced the release of a chilling smartphone called Alpha Ice.  Is that just ‚Äúice‚Äù?  Or is it "no ice"? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9da/c38/892/9dac388929f86c3cb4aa8251807c7583.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We read the release, already the first phrases plunge into shock and wild horror!  <i>‚ÄúThe novelty is one of the first Highscreen models in which the emphasis is not on characteristics [did Highscreen once emphasize on characteristics?‚Äù</i>  <i>I did not know, did not know ...] (although everything is fine with them), but on design.</i>  <i>In fact, the iPhone 5 is offered with the Android operating system ‚Äî no more and no less! ‚Äù</i>  Tremble, Apple Highscreen has attacked the holy of holies, product number 1!  Tim Cook after these statements "killed himself up the wall," and Johnny Ive applied for emigration to Russia after Snowden, will now learn design from us.  But let's leave all the bile in the lines above, and look at Alpha Ice impartially.

For the sake of fairness, I must say that the iPhone is one of the best role models in terms of appearance (I am not an apple, if that).  In my opinion, it would be much worse to take for the standard of the exterior smartphones of the same Samsung, which are, well, completely inexpressive.  But many take: on the market there are a number of products from local brands with a characteristic button under the screen - like SGSIII / SGS4. <br><br>  The fact that the Alpha Ice package includes two back covers - black and white, is good, in this respect, Apple does not leave a choice.  On the other hand, customizing an iPhone is easier than a steamed turnip, and then on Alpha Ice you can then try to find at least a film on the screen.  Or cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4b/25c/547/e4b25c5473bfd67cb89be872fba845eb.jpg"><br><br>  We assume that we have dealt with the appearance, go to the characteristics.  To be honest, here, too, there is nothing ‚Äúone's own,‚Äù there is no bright thing.  Yes, there is an IPS screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches, but its resolution is almost standard - 1280 x 720 pixels.  RAM by today's standards is small - only 1 GB, the same with flash memory, which is only 4 GB.  Well, is it really so difficult for the Chinese to install modules of at least 8 GB each, I‚Äôm not even talking about 16?  The hardware platform Alpha Ice - quad MediaTek MT6589.  I have no complaints about him, the tests have a very good SoC.  But why not use its "turbo" version of MediaTek MT6589T?  The question hung in the air ... <br><br>  Although, it seems, I know the answer: the battery capacity is only 2,000 mAh.  With this ‚Äúpotential‚Äù, autonomy when using a turbo version of the processor would be lower, it would have to be charged more often. <br><br>  What else on the Highscreen Alpha Ice asset?  It seems like quite good cameras for 3 and 13 megapixels (I would still like to check their quality), support for microSDHC and two SIM-cards, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and Android OS 4.2.1.  In short, all that is now in a typical mid-level Chinese smartphone.  The price tag of the smartphone, in my opinion, is quite digestible - Alpha Ice is already available in retail for 10,990 rubles. <br><br>  What is the result?  Obviously, the deliberate comparison of Highscreen Alpha Ice with the iPhone 5 is just a PR move that promotes the smartphone in the domestic market.  That's when the iPhone will become similar to the Highscreen, then you can beat your chest, but for now we have what we have: Alpha Ice is another medium-sized device with a ‚Äúthoroughbred American design‚Äù and a good price tag.  And nothing more. <br><br>  PS Remotely received a pair of "live" photos of the device.  As you can see, there is a black cover with a matte plastic and a white one - glossy.  Comrades claim that the smartphone is very light, but the build quality is not ice.  They complain that the black cap is brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/721/e92/7b2/721e927b2a462f59e02e52d7bdcc227d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c8/5af/333/4c85af333f2fc9ea2e5994abace5e0cc.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191118/</a></p>
