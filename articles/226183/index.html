Today we have some freshly baked CG, and we want to tell you about the development of the cinematics "Enduring" for the strategy "Sparta: War of Empires."  In the first part of the article about creating this video, the head of the Plarium Cinematics Team Vyacheslav Lisovsky will talk about the work on animation and VFX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/525/42d/41252542db7e481aaa265ff913d75a09.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/74iNfuaUruc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiT10rgiZD7xs2bXJlpl1QHcLR9Ug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      When creating sinyatics, our team is given complete creative freedom.  Unlike short promotional videos, which are used for marketing purposes, the trailer is produced rather for existing fans of the game, as well as to attract those who may be interested in such topics. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hiyk4SCY7gg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2LGXQgri9HGwumaMQPO61cTGe-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Like all videos, this sinematics began with an idea.  Since our new game is dedicated to Ancient Sparta, we decided to show a beautiful battle between the Spartans and Persians.  After the tempo, plot and highlights were defined, we created a visual concept video and approved it with our art director. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a4/897/476/5a4897476bf2562ab638b13a412ee16e.jpg"><br><br>  One of the important points when working with the concept is the absence of pity.  If in the process it turns out that some frame does not make the proper impression, it is allowed under the knife, and the vacant space is distributed to other, more interesting scenes.  After the approval of the original concept, we turn to the animatics, a primitive disc of the plot, which in combination is the frame of the future movie.  At this stage, even more weak frames are eliminated, and additional changes are made to the remaining ones.  For example, at the animatics stage, we had to flip a frame with two armies, since the army attacking from the right created not exactly the effect that was needed.  At this stage, the main rhythm of the video is already visible, and the video takes on its final shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39e/9d5/dc4/39e9d5dc4904aa17d1f19aa2c0db63c5.png"><br><br>  About three months our animation team worked on creating animation.  All the animation in the video was created manually in Autodesk Maya.  In this sinyatics, we managed to achieve the realism we wanted, but we are thinking about using motion-capture technology in the future. <br><br>  The difficult moment we encountered was the fighting scenes with an abundance of clothing.  To create it, we chose the Marvelous Designer package, which has proven itself in many projects, including the work of the AAA class.  By itself, the miscalculation of clothing could be implemented in other editors, but the Marvelous Designer is a specialized package for this purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16e/844/5b3/16e8445b31cacdd612958dc1358376fd.jpg"><br><br>  Another difficult moment was the final massive shot.  We did it in parallel with the rest of the scenes throughout the project;  implementation was done by our animator Alexander Varzhainov.  The primary task here was to create a large-scale and impressive scene with the participation of two armies.  For this, Alexander wrote a script that was responsible for both the movements of the soldiers and their appearance.  As for the landscape of the final scene, the vegetation was created using V-Ray Multiscatter, and all the large elements, such as rocks, stones and even ships in the background, are full-fledged 3D models. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4KMX27bz4I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKShPidcnlNxRJf9eTbysPYTM4vw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúEnduring‚Äù is the second video created by our team.  Looking back, I understand that changing the subject of the video and trying to implement some new scenes for us helped the whole team grow professionally.  If in our past sinyatik "Victory is worthy of death," we could still "close by a nuclear explosion" some flaw, here we had to show the battle of real living people and every little thing was important.  We set a high bar for ourselves, but learned a lot in these three months.  Love your job, do not be afraid of big and complex tasks, and you will succeed! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226183/</a></p>
