Today I will tell you how we assembled these kits in sets of 25 pieces and increased sales by more than <b>one million rubles</b> at the expense of parental committees in schools and kindergartens. <br><br>  So, parental committees.  Who is it? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  The target audience </h2><br>  These are mothers (very rarely fathers), who occupy an active life position.  Their children are from 6 to 12 years old.  These people are able, in some miraculous way, to make a decision for all parents from the class where their child is studying.  I understand that this sounds strange and even outrageous, but, if we reject subjectivity and face the truth ... I am sure you will agree with me.  They make decisions.  I have a son, and I know what I'm saying.

      Below I will call these moms (less often - dads) simply ‚Äúparent committee‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Identify the problem </h2><br>  The Parents' Committee faces several problems throughout the year, one of which is the choice and purchase of <b>gifts for the whole class</b> .  Here are 4 periods in the year when they have a ‚Äúheadache‚Äù about this: <br><br><ul><li>  September 1; </li><li>  New Year; </li><li>  February 23 and March 8; </li><li>  end of the school year. </li></ul><br>  So, who are these people - we know.  What is their problem (need) - we know.  When it arises - we know. <br><br><h2>  Solution to their problem </h2><br>  What can they buy for gifts?  Well, in the New Year - candy.  At the beginning and end of the school year - books (in childhood I never liked their approach)).  But if they give a child something that he likes (and not parents), and at the cost it will be feasible for parents of all children from the class, their problem is solved by 5 plus. <br><br><h3>  Affordable price </h3><br>  Let's begin, perhaps, with the most important criterion, with the price.  As I wrote above, if the parents of all children from the class have a financial opportunity to ‚Äúthrow off‚Äù on gifts without any problems, the parent committee will avoid additional troubles with settling this issue. <br><br>  Our sets " <a href="https://shop.simplescience.ru/collection/experiment-in-box%3Futm_source%3DHabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Drodkomitet%26utm_campaign%3D15dec2016">Experiment in a box</a> " in retail cost <b>195 rubles</b> .  With a clear conscience I declare - this is the lowest price for a similar product on the market.  But the parent committee will buy not one set, but a class, and therefore have the right to also count on a discount. <br><br> <a href="https://shop.simplescience.ru/collection/experiment-in-box%3Futm_source%3DHabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Drodkomitet%26utm_campaign%3D15dec2016"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/e1f/479/3a4e1f4799f144a59ef2a26ac6d36885.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It is also profitable for us to sell this kit cheaper: for one set it turns out 150 rubles, instead of 195 rubles.  The reason is simple: one customer - one chain of actions, three customers - three chains. <br><br><ul><li>  order approval (letter and / or call); </li><li>  payment tracking; </li><li>  packing each package separately; </li><li>  sending track numbers for tracking. </li></ul><br>  And this is not to mention the primary correspondence, because many people require additional consultations when choosing. <br><br>  By the way, it may seem that there is not much difference between the price of 150 rubles.  and, for example, 390 rub.  Here you can argue or refer to the facts.  Previously, we sold <a href="http://shop.simplescience.ru/blogs/news/school_may">books</a> for parent committees <a href="http://shop.simplescience.ru/blogs/news/school_may">,</a> and when purchasing a class one book cost them 390 rubles.  And what do you think?  Most parent committees could not collect this money from their parents.  And when we offered them the goods more than two times cheaper, this problem disappeared by itself. <br><br><h3>  Choice by age </h3><br>  Parenting committees are particularly active in elementary school and kindergarten, where children aged 6 - 10 years.  And since we have five sets for the age of 6+ and five sets for 12+, then we will not be able to choose what we need. <br><br>  In the online store, we divided them into two different catalogs: <br><br> <a href="https://shop.simplescience.ru/collection/for-group%3Futm_source%3DHabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Drodkomitet%26utm_campaign%3D15dec2016"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/066/54f/04106654f43c47c0bfdebdf1bbe73e0d.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Correct dimensions </h3><br>  If you have ever bought anything in large quantities, then faced with the problem of size during transportation.  We did not put the air in the package, but instead removed it from there.  This has reduced the amount of packaging to a minimum. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/556/8da/e2e/5568dae2e32d422585b2f7b56dfeee2e.jpg"><br><h3>  Reliable transportation </h3><br>  I think that it is not worth describing what can happen with the goods when they are sent, say, through the ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù.  Specially for these kits was made technological packaging, which, among other things, saves the boxes from any "mail-disaster."  The box itself is made of 3 mm cardboard, and inside there are 5 compartments with 5 sets in each.  In the packaged form, it resembles a brick. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93d/2cd/24c/93d2cd24c15d4837a2e36fabbcea14b5.jpg"><br><h3>  Certificates </h3><br>  The parent committee always requests certificates, it is important for them.  So it is necessary that all kits pass the certification process.  In one of the past <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gtv/blog/306778/">posts</a> I described the process of certification of our kits, I will not re-describe who I want, you can read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/6fc/aab/4c46fcaab4e84a6291267ebd52f0afa2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Dry residue </h2><br>  It remains for us to report the availability of these kits to parental committees, and the trick is in the bag.  What we did.  How it was done, I would not want to describe.  I have on the nose on February 23, March 8 and the end of the year ... <br><br>  I will report only the results.  It was sold: <br><br><ul><li>  164 sets in November; </li><li>  192 sets in December (to date) </li></ul><br>  So the truth is, it‚Äôs enough to solve the client‚Äôs problem for him and he‚Äôs yours. <br><br><h2>  Minute advertising </h2><br>  And, taking this opportunity, I want to appeal to you personally. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>If you are the person</b> who makes the decision for the whole class, let's be friends!  Write to me in a personal message and with me add.  a discount!  ) </li><li>  <b>If you are familiar with such people</b> , please send them a link to this post.  I am sure this information will be useful to them. </li><li>  And finally, <b>if you do not need a solution for a class</b> , but you need an individual <b>New Year's gift</b> , then, according to tradition, a coupon for a habrahabr discount on <a href="https://shop.simplescience.ru/collection/yaplakal%3Futm_source%3DHabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Drodkomitet%26utm_campaign%3D15dec2016">these</a> kits. </li></ul><br> <a href="https://shop.simplescience.ru/collection/yaplakal%3Futm_source%3DHabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Drodkomitet%26utm_campaign%3D15dec2016"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2b/ad1/8ea/c2bad18ea3cf481482e411c2604929a9.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317648/</a></p>
