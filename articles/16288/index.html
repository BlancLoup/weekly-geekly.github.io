And so you want not only to preserve, but also to multiply.  And once again multiply and again. <br>  For several months now I have been looking at where to invest money, but there is really nothing to invest, then the profitability does not suit, then the toolkit fails.  I was looking for an option to invest money for a period of 6-9 months with maximum benefit.  As part of my earnings in electronic money, I was looking for an opportunity to invest them, without getting up from my chair. <br>  Earn online ways hundreds, but this is work.  And what opportunities to invest money?  There are actually not so many options. <br><br>  <b>Mutual funds</b> <br>  In the spring - at the beginning of the summer I was planning to invest exactly mutual funds, but at that moment there was no money.  Looking at the statistics for the previous 2-3 years, I came to the conclusion that this particular financial instrument can bring the greatest profitability.  The most successful showed up to 60-80% per annum!  In the total mass of mutual funds gave not less than 20-40% per annum.  There were of course exceptions that went into the minus, but such a minority. <br>  For the purchase and sale of shares usually take about 1.5%, depending on how long your share is on hand.  The longer - the lower the percentage when selling.  About 3% for unit service.  Immediately deduct 13% of income tax (But this, of course, if the UIF brings revenue). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nevertheless, I expected to increase my capital by at least 30 percent.  But it was not there.  In summer, mutual funds slowed down, and then the mortgage crisis broke out in the United States, which affected the global economy and mutual funds profitability.  In general, many of them began to play in a minus or at best zero.  Those in which I was going to invest - KIT Russian electric power industry and Keith Russian oil definitely did not please.  And only in October, mutual funds with the market began to grow upwards. <br>  Buy shares online can be.  Only documents will have to be sent by regular mail or personal delivery.  The same with money - either a bank payment or cash.  Webmoney, alas, do not take. <br>  It is profitable to buy shares via the Internet to those who live far from the mutual fund representative office, otherwise it is still more convenient to get to the office.

      Pros: Specialists take care of multiplying funds.  Passive earnings.  The percentage is usually higher than that of banks. <br>  Cons: There are chances not to multiply, and partially lose money.  The percentage of input and output. <br>  Risk: Medium. <br><br>  <b>Promotions (online trading)</b> <br>  Buying stocks yourself is much more interesting than giving money to a mutual fund.  More interesting, but also more risky.  Yet in the mutual funds financiers buy, and here you have to play in yourself an investor.  But on the other hand, it is free to acquire any shares, in any combination, which the UIF will not allow.  Therefore, if you guess, the yield may be higher. <br>  Following the precepts of the financial genius of Warren Buffet, I immediately decided not to play on the daily fluctuations of the stock price.  I was interested in the prospect of at least six months: I bought it - I sold it in 6-9 months. <br>  For those who want to bid on a daily basis, online trading is ideal.  Buying and selling stocks without getting up from the chair seemed tempting.  To do this, you must install a special program to make the sale and purchase.  Some traders have the opportunity to work through the web-interface.  Next, you need to obtain a digital signature and send (bring) a lot of documents to Moscow. <br>  The problem of obtaining EDS seemed to me a bit burdensome.  In addition, as in the case of mutual funds, electronic money is not accepted. <br>  Another point why I did not buy the shares was the general decline of the market (for the same reason, mutual funds sank).  Yes, and I just did not know what to buy.  Having read different articles head went round.  There was an idea to buy shares in Cement Plants - they are building more and more each year, cement is snapped up.  But cement is a more long-term investment than 6-9 months and some of the plants are working on old technologies, therefore, in the near future they will face large costs of modernization, which is unlikely to have a positive impact on production volumes and, therefore, the value of shares.  In addition, in my heart I cherished the hope of receiving dividends.  And what dividends, if the profit goes to the new equipment. <br>  Oil companies were questionable - the price of oil is already too high.  Many analysts predicted a fall.  (By the way, the oil didn‚Äôt guess that it‚Äôs growing again.) The blue chips are Gazprom, Sberbank, etc.  the previous few years had grown too well (MP Kerimov became a billionaire solely on the shares of Gazprom and Sberbank), can't they grow forever, should there be a recession?  I looked closely at KAMAZ, but he, too, had grown too well in the previous two years.  I thought about the shares of second-tier companies, but I know almost nothing about them, they write little about them, it would be a purchase at random. <br>  As a result, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãonline trading, while left.  But I hope to come back to her sometime. <br><br>  Pros: Freedom of choice.  You can earn more than in mutual funds. <br>  Cons: requires market knowledge, a relatively complex procedure to start work. <br>  Risk: Medium. <br><br>  <b>Forex (currency exchange)</b> <br>  Once upon a time I indulged in Forex, but fortunately in demo mode.  According to statistics, 95% of forex players lose their money.  Again, if you do, it requires serious knowledge and endurance.  In Forex, for some reason, no one makes a long-term investment, everyone plays on the differences in the course with an interval of an hour or a day or two or three.  And in the end lose, to the delight of the owners of forex sites.  Advertising on every corner says - Forex is simple, enter the money and earn.  In fact, in Forex a lot of nuances that you need to know. <br>  Surprisingly, near the stock exchanges there is no such a rush, as around Forex. <br>  With more time spent turning into work. <br><br>  Pros: Independence in decision making. <br>  Cons: Requires serious knowledge, takes a lot of time. <br>  Risk: High. <br><br>  <b>Webmoney credit exchange (credit.webmoney.ru), private lending</b> <br>  A very interesting financial instrument that I discovered recently.  Essence - one private person credits another e-currency WebMoney through a special exchange or directly (after talking on the forum, for example). <br>  Many people are engaged in online lending is already on a professional basis.  Interest rates for which loans are simply gigantic when compared with banks: 5-15% per month !!!  Long-term loans (6 months and more usually do not issue).  But the risks of the lender are very high.  A person who does not return the loan in the webmoney to an individual is almost impossible to get.  Therefore, the lender considers the candidacy no less carefully than the bank‚Äôs security service.  First of all, they look at the credit history (such is, if the credit is taken through the webmoney exchange), secondly, on the business level of the wallet and the availability of a personal certificate Webmoney. <br>  I had the idea to issue 1-2 loans.  But to be honest, I was afraid.  The risk of no return is very high.  You can lose everything if you make a mistake with the credited.  And minimizing the risks - giving out more loans, but for smaller amounts, is also not an option - it is too dreary to give out $ 10-20, to check who you are giving out.  And on the average amount to lend - the total amount of money should be considerable.  The amount should be such that the non-repayment of 2-4 credits does not affect the general state of affairs.  Those who are seriously engaged in this, operate with fairly large budgets, issuing loans from 5 to several thousand dollars.  And no taxes!  The legislation of the Russian Federation does not recognize electronic money at all; we do not have a law about them. <br>  For reference - the largest online loan WebMoney was issued in the amount of $ 50,000.  And <a href="http://owebmoney.ru/club/user.php%3F217">this man</a> betrayed him <br>  An example of <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D134204">private lending</a> on the forum Searchengines.ru. <br>  I do not discard this tool completely, somehow I will try. <br><br>  Pros: High yield, no taxation. <br>  Cons: It takes a lot of time with a large number of credits, webmoney transfer commission (0.8%) <br>  Risk: Very high (not for professional lenders). <br><br>  <b>The pyramids</b> <br>  Yes, the pyramids are still alive, who would have thought.  MMM on the Internet.  Interest from 1.3 to 26 <b>per day!</b>  The minimum contribution amount is 1 dollar.  Money is paid by new customers.  Maybe even worth playing the king of the mountain, if not for one thing.  Half of the pyramids are scammers.  That is, they do not even think to return your money.  Site to collect webmoney and disappear.  Or they are thinking of returning, but new investors are fewer than old ones and the shop quickly closes. <br>  An example of a pyramid: <a href="http://sitiinvestment.biz/">sitiinvestment.biz</a> <br><br>  Pros: Chance to get rich quickly. <br>  Cons: No guarantees of return.  High risk of running into fraudsters. <br>  Risk: Very high. <br><br>  <b>Electronic currency bank</b> <br>  New for Russia financial instrument.  So far I know only about the existence of one such bank - <a href="http://www.probanc.ru/">www.probanc.ru</a> .  Accept webmoney for a period of 1 month with the possibility of prolongation.  The scheme is quite transparent.  The company takes money under% from individuals and credits it online to other individuals.  That is, they work almost like a regular bank, but without paper delays.  On the other hand, the lack of papers is a big minus.  You invest money solely on parole and reputation of the company.  There are no contracts, even an offer contract.  The only at least some theoretical chance to return the money in case of a conflict situation is to solve the problem through Webmoney arbitration. <br>  Rate 0.1% per day.  Or 3% per month.  36.5% per year!  It should, however, take into account the commission WebMoney 0.8% when transferring funds.  If you invest for a month - you get 2.2%.  But recently there was a possibility of prolongation and now you can leave money every time for another month.  Consequently, the second and subsequent months will be already under 3% monthly. <br>  Big plus - money can be taken at any time.  The interest rate will be 0.07% per day for the time that the money was in the system. <br>  I risked investing in this financial instrument.  For me, online banking is convenient, as it accumulates electronic money.  If funds are specially entered into the webmoney for this service, it will be unprofitable, the commission will eat a lot when depositing money and then withdrawing it back into cash. <br><br>  Pros: Sufficiently high yield.  Efficiency of the contribution.  The ability to take money at any time. <br>  Cons: No contract, money is given "on parole".  Difficulties in the event of a dispute. <br>  Risk: Medium. <br><br>  What other opportunities are there on the Internet to increase funds? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16288/</a></p>
