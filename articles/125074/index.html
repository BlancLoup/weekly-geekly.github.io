  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manage contacts in Android (import, export, transfer, setup)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When buying a new phone always raises the question of transferring contacts from the old to the new.  Everything is easier if the transfer is made with phones of the same brand (because most manufacturers have provided for this simple task) or if they were originally stored on the SIM card.  But you often get a new phone from another manufacturer or do not use the SIM card memory at all, since the number of phones or other necessary information exceeded the capabilities of SIM cards. <br><br><h4>  The article will be reviewed: </h4><ul><li>  Contact storage options </li><li>  Getting a copy of contacts from Nokia S40, S60 phones </li><li>  Contact Sync </li><li>  Grouping contacts in the phone book </li><li>  Setting birthday notifications </li><li>  Backward synchronization with S40, S60 </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Contact storage options </h5><br>  Contacts can be stored in three places: SIM card (last century), in the phone‚Äôs memory and in the Gmail profile.  I think the first option can be skipped, since in our time, all people have 2-3 numbers, not counting the home numbers, and the SIM card memory is simply not enough.  Storing contacts in your Android phone is no different from other mobile phones.  The last option is interesting for its capabilities.  Before continuing, you should decide on the choice of memory for contacts.  I personally chose the storage option in my Gmail profile as the most productive. <br>  Memory selection: Contacts -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Save contacts -&gt; Here you need to select a memory (I recommend the Gmail profile).  Since account setup is beyond the scope of this article, it is not considered here in its entirety, but only in terms of account synchronization. <br><br><h5>  Getting a copy of contacts from Nokia S40, S60 phones </h5><br>  There are several options for this operation.  Consider the most simple.

      <b>The first</b> and easiest is to use only the phone and Bluetooth: <br>  Select all contacts.  Go to Contacts -&gt; [Options] -&gt; Mark / Unmark -&gt; Mark All <br>  Then send them via Bluetooth [Options] -&gt; Send -&gt; Via Bluetooth <br>  At this time, turn on Bluetooth on our new phone.  Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Wireless Networks -&gt; Bluetooth Settings -&gt; Enable, and here it is Open <br>  On Nokia, select the second phone and give it contacts. <br><br>  It remains only to wait for the transfer to end.  After the transfer, the contacts immediately fall into the notebook.  It remains only to clear the list of notifications [Menu] -&gt; Clear list <br>  The disadvantage of this option is that if notes were made in contacts in Russian, there may be problems with writing.  Most likely, such contacts will simply hang in the temporary directory / sdcard / bluetooth.  They will have to be added separately.  If you chose to store in your Gmail profile, you can add them by example in the next step. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> option will be needed if your old phone does not have Bluetooth installed, as well as for all other options. <br>  In this case, you need to use Nokia PC Suite. <br>  Open Nokia PC Suite -&gt; Contacts -&gt; Press Ctr + A -&gt; File -&gt; Export -&gt; Select the csv file format -&gt; Select the path and save. <br>  All contacts will be saved in one file. <br>  Next, go to <a href="http://gmail.com/">http://gmail.com</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/contacts">http://www.google.com/contacts</a> and log in with your Google / Gmail account. <br>  Selecting [Additional Actions] (Button in Gmail. The following link is immediately available from the second link) -&gt; Import -&gt; Overview -&gt; Select your csv file with contacts -&gt; Import <br><br>  According to the results, in the first case, your contacts are stored on the phone (and wait for synchronization with the server if the Gmail profile is selected), in the second, contacts are stored in the profile and wait for synchronization with the phone. <br><br><h5>  Contact Sync </h5><br>  In order for our contacts to be in perfect order, you need to synchronize.  I emphasize that the contacts stored in the phone's memory are not synchronized. <br>  We connect the synchronization: Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Check the item ‚ÄúBackground data‚Äù and ‚ÄúAuto sync‚Äù -&gt; Next, at the bottom, select the account and check if contact synchronization is enabled (by default everything is on).  The choice of the remaining items is yours.  After that, after a short period of time, contacts imported into Gmail should appear in the contacts on your phone.  Saved contacts on the phone (when choosing a Gmail memory) will have to be displayed in the contacts in the mail. <br><br><h5>  Grouping contacts in the phone book </h5><br>  Now all our contacts should be visible both in the phone and in the contacts of the Gmail profile.  The priority of synchronization when changing is given to the latest edition. <br>  If the phone's memory was chosen, then creating groups is quite simple: Contacts -&gt; Groups -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; Set the name and melody of the group at will. <br>  To add a contact to the group, go to it and click on the icon of the silhouette of a person with a '+' sign near the search field.  The choice will be possible only from contacts stored in the phone's memory. <br>  If Gmail profile memory is used, then creating groups becomes a bit more complicated, as for inexplicable reasons creating groups for a profile is not available (I hope this will be fixed soon, I think, will be a shortcoming).  Contact cataloging can also be done from Gmail.  But you can on the phone.  To do this, you need the aContacts application.  You can find it in the Market, has a Russian interface in the settings.  It can also be assigned to standard use when dialing or making calls.  But personally, I recommend using it only to create groups. <br>  Go to the application: [Groups] -&gt; [New group] -&gt; Enter the name of the new group. <br>  To add to the group: Select a contact (hold) -&gt; Group -&gt; Add to group -&gt; Select the desired group. <br>  After synchronization, groups will be created in Gmail. <br><br><h5>  Setting birthday notifications </h5><br>  It is quite convenient when the birthdays of relatives or colleagues are displayed in advance in the calendar.  By default, this feature is not provided. <br>  You can set a reminder widget.  The most simple and not overloaded ‚ÄúBirthday Countdown‚Äù.  You can find it in the Market.  Almost no settings required. <br>  You can also make it so that birthdays are displayed on the calendar.  If your contacts are stored in your Gmail profile: Log in under the account you need in <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">http://www.google.com/calendar</a> -&gt; Settings -&gt; Settings Calendar -&gt; Calendars -&gt; View interesting calendars -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Select ‚ÄúContacts and birthdays ¬ªAnd click Subscribe <br>  After that, you need to synchronize the calendar there in the settings menu synchronization.  Upon completion, birthdays will have to be displayed in the calendar. <br><br><h5>  Backward synchronization with S40, S60 </h5><br>  For a long time in phones synchronization function is incorporated.  But for objective reasons, it is not used often.  Google completely turned it over to a state of necessity and convenience using its technology.  But still for those who have several phones and SIM cards, you can also synchronize contacts with your old device using SyncML technology.  The minus of this synchronization is the transfer of the main fields of the contact, such as phone numbers, name, photo.  Therefore, it is better to synchronize from the server to the phone.  I think all the information on the second phone is not so relevant.  After all, the most important is still the phone number and name.  And it is very convenient if they are updated on time.  Therefore, this technology should be quite enough.  In general, it is worth updating contacts only in the direction from the server to the mobile phone. <br><br>  To configure the S60 go: Menu -&gt; Communication -&gt; Sync.  (Sync) -&gt; [Options] -&gt; New.  prof.  sync <br>  To configure S40, go to: Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Personal Conf. Conf.  -&gt; Add new "Sync" <br><br>  Next, enter the following settings: <br>  Profile Name: any_name <br>  Data Channel: Internet <br>  Access Point: gprs_point <br>  Server Address: <a href="https://m.google.com/syncml">https://m.google.com/syncml</a> <br>  Port: 443 <br>  Username: login_ot_gmail <br>  Password: your_password <br><br>  Next, go to the second tab.  We will only sync contacts (the rest can be switched to &lt;No&gt;) <br>  Choose: Contacts -&gt; Yes <br>  We expose the settings: <br>  Remote database: contacts <br>  Sync type: Update the phone (i.e. set the sync direction, as mentioned earlier) <br><br>  Everything.  Setup complete.  We make a backup of contacts, delete contacts from the Nokia notebook and try to start synchronization.  If everything started successfully, then there will be a normal window with the status and upon completion of the operation we will be notified. <br>  You can also send contacts back via Bluetooth.  But agree, why go back in the last century? <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Android is a child of two entities that were created on the network and became important parts of it itself - it is Linux and Google.  The full potential of Android is revealed only with full work with the network.  The constant power of the development of Google binds and at the same time gives a huge potential for an Android device. <br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br>  <a href="http://info.mobilux.info/">http://info.mobilux.info</a> <br>  <a href="http://anit.az/entry.php%3F4-SyncML-gmail.com-(android-symbian)">http://anit.az/entry.php?4-SyncML-gmail.com-(android-symbian)</a> <br>  <a href="http://andro1d.com/blog/info/1185.html">http://andro1d.com/blog/info/1185.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://shoguevara.livejournal.com/8566.html">http://shoguevara.livejournal.com/8566.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://m0sia.ru/node/82">http://m0sia.ru/node/82</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125074/</a></p>
