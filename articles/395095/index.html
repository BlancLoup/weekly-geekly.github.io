Even on your birthday in China, a gift or congratulation is accepted to respond with a gift.  This habit is rooted in the custom, according to which the birthday is the celebration of the parents and the children on this day should be symbolically thanked for their gift.  And even on your birthday, it is customary to wear a crown - and even pandas in the zoo do this. <br><br>  But it's not just our birthday that is approaching, but the birthday of our store in Russia - for almost a year now we have been close to Russian buyers.  So, it‚Äôs time to mix Russian enthusiasm, Chinese generosity, add a bit of technology and celebrate the holiday in a big way.  We invite you - discounts and gifts, as it should be, in the package.  Well, that is, under the cut. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/888/73e/145/88873e1459b7f47271683a73ae33293c.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">We will not darken - everything is simple</font> </h2><br>  June 8, 2016 JD.ru launches the sales series <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/D7sUWnqC2H8iM1Vw.html%3Futm_source%3Dsocial%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_term%3Ditmedia%26utm_campaign%3D20160608geektimes"><b>‚ÄúBirthday JD.ru‚Äù</b></a> , dedicated to the celebration of the first anniversary of the company in the Russian market.
