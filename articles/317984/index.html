Not an advertisement.  :) <br><br>  It was August.  Until the 2nd year of student Vasily Zaderganov (personal data changed), there were a few days left.  He was pleased with the summer Internet from MTS at the MTS Connect-4 tariff for the MTS-Tablet service - 4 GB of traffic per month.  And there was the last day of the service and the last unscaled gigabyte. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEh, I download the film, and I‚Äôm going to rock the nature for the last few days!‚Äù Thought Vasily calmly.  He had everything counted.  He knew stories <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/usedesk/blog/301052/">about ridden amateur cyclists</a> , who, because of an unclosed bicycle lock, massively write off a thousand rubles at the box office.  He knew that they would return the money only to the elect, who would write about it well and beautifully and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/usedesk/blog/317210/">glorify the service to the whole country</a> .  But this is not his way.  He did everything to not suffer.  He is a strategist.

      1) in advance for the Internet started a separate SIM card; <br>  2) left only 20 unspent rubles in the account for the vile crumbling in advance;  and could less;  but he believed them that they would scorn such a trifle; <br>  3) in the Personal Area I turned off the options of a legitimate scam - automatic payment for over-limit traffic at a higher rate; <br>  4) in the same place I disabled the option ‚Äútransmit traffic on the service over the limit‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Do you understand what reinsurance?</i>  <i>This is not a tractor driver Fedya, whom you <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc/3118750">shod on advertising</a> this season.</i>  Someone would have calmed down on disabling the first option, and here to him - the second, not automatic.  Vasya is not like that. <br><br>  ... Until the end of his SIM card there were a couple of hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>To MTS workers: do not solve the question of Vasily Zaderganov as a complaint on the pages of Habr or in drugs, remember that ‚ÄúHabr is not a complaint book‚Äù, and you have your own website.</i>  <i>Just through Habr, we will finally find specialists, developers, working for you, who will solve your problem (if they are not stopped).</i>  <i>Through technical support, it has not been resolved for 4 months, despite 5 messages from Vasily to her on the company's only feedback form info@mts.ru.</i>  <i>Vasily will have to contact the specialists directly and talk about your mistakes in the software.</i>  <i>Give him the word.</i> <br><br>  - Externally, the problem is simple: MTS counted the debt on the basis of traffic accounting, I indicated to them an error (a shift in traffic accounting time by 2 hours), they refused to recognize it.  If it was an objectively calculated traffic, there is no problem to pay.  In fact, the "debt" was formed as a result of errors of their accounting system.  It would seem easy to check.  But why do they not ‚Äúscratch‚Äù? <br><br>  <b><i>How, right so immediately and refused, without understanding?</i></b> <br><br>  - No, well, as soon as.  The first letter from them, and the last, not from the robot, came in 1 (one!) Month and 5 days!  During this time I managed to write 3 letters to them. <br><br>  <b><i>Only 3 letters in a month?</i></b>  <b><i>Is it not enough?</i></b> <br><br>  - But I didn‚Äôt write anything new, I repeated the same essence with different words: you have a mistake, you have disconnected my sim card for no reason.  I tried to convey the idea in different ways.  But in response - not a word, only the answer of the robot: ‚ÄúThank you for using our service!‚Äù.  I was ready to write more, but not to the robot, from whom it is not clear what their problem is, what they need to clarify. <br><br>  <b><i>Probably, the answer is that the "minus" is not counted in their pocket, therefore, "it does not itch ..."</i></b> <br><br>  - But I, as a user, received: <br><br>  1) debiting from the account of those 20 rubles, more than which I prudently did not leave (that‚Äôs the crumb payload!); <br>  2) telephone hooliganism in the form of sending SMS about ‚Äúdebt‚Äù; <br>  3) SIM card blocking, almost 4 months already (this problem will be more serious for me as a user); <br>  4) distribution of false information about me as a ‚Äúdebtor‚Äù (for the time being in the framework of SMS, but I doubt that it is not enough); <br>  5) the impossibility of all time (4 months!) To resolve the issue through technical support, despite repeated requests. <br><br>  Probably, for me personally, there is also a lot of inconvenience, but so far I see no reason to resolve their technical issue (in fact, to help them organize their service) at the expense of their time or through the courts.  I hope that after solving their problems, they will appreciate my help and make compensation not only for the inconveniences brought, but also for participating in testing, for the very fact of creating a test case for this error. <br><br>  Plus, at the end I would like to know how many people managed to help: how many users suffered financially as a result of the same error (a shift in traffic accounting time by 2 hours)? <br><br>  <b><i>Could you, Vasily, describe the details of the problem and why do you think this is a mistake of their software?</i></b> <br><br>  - With readiness. <br><br><h2>  How it was? </h2><br>  I will describe the occurrence of the error in as much detail as possible, in order to give maximum chances for the technical specialists of MTS to understand the problem.  Indeed, despite my explanations 5 times the same, I only once (after the third appeal!) Received a formal response of the form: ‚ÄúAt 16:57 the system counted such a sum, you owe us.‚Äù (The same ‚Äúdebt ").  Well, I already know from the report that at 16:57 the system counted.  The fact that this is a mistake is how to break through the consciousness of that specialist on duty and failed.  And the second time he did not answer.  Although I wrote from the very first that it was their systems that were in error. <br><br>  Before using the MTS Connect tariff (MTS-Tablet service), all the possibilities of the ‚Äúlegal scam‚Äù were blocked (everyone understands that this is, but those who are interested will see the explanations below): <br><br>  0) in general, a separate SIM card is entered; <br>  1) the option of automatic payment for over-limit traffic is disabled; <br>  2) the option ‚Äútransmit traffic to the service over the limit‚Äù is disabled; <br>  3) a small amount was left on the account - about 20 rubles - so that no twists of operator logic would lead to an unexpected loss of money. <br><br>  The service was used to access the Internet. <br><br>  And yet, the MTS were "trickier."  They found (I am sure that they did it absolutely accidentally), how to count, using the error of their automation - traffic accounting software.  If this error did not exist, there would be no problems created by them to me. <br><br><h2>  The essence of the error </h2><br>  Those who are interested in traffic accounting on file hosting servers, for sure, know about this possible problem.  I met her in discussions of traffic accounting either in file-sharing networks, or in torrents.  It was a long time ago and I cannot provide links to examples.  But the essence is that the file distribution server (or distribution accounting) in some cases was difficult to tune to an exact record of the end of the download moment.  Accounting for some reason shifted arbitrarily for a time of about 40 minutes - an hour or a little more.  In the case of free networks, this only hinders the accuracy of statistics, and in the case of commercial accounting, as in MTS, you understand. <br><br>  And here, as soon as I learned that they suddenly miscalculated the traffic, there was no doubt - this is their technical error, many times known to experts from the experience of using similar systems. <br><br>  I had this procedure for downloading: <br><br>  1) I looked in the control panel, what was left is about 950 MB of traffic within the paid service, which expired tomorrow; <br>  2) decided that you can download a file (movie) of 700 MB in size, and then close the service so that it will not automatically continue tomorrow; <br>  3) set the download and completely legally spent the traffic on it; <br>  4) after 5-10 minutes after that, seeing that there will be problems with communication from the countryside tomorrow, I decided to turn off the service in advance;  disabled the service;  ATTENTION: at this moment the file has already been fully downloaded, saved on disk, so that later it can be safely used. <br>  5) there were no other actions with the Internet or with the download of the file;  The file has already been downloaded (I repeat, but in this fact is the essence). <br><br>  What happened to them with the accounting system? <br><br>  Days after 15, I suddenly found that these guys are not so simple.  If they block all the possibilities to ‚Äúfool‚Äù the user, they will find this opportunity out of the ground.  (Just kidding.) Yes, they blocked the account with 20 rubles.  Cause? <br><br>  The reason - "debt on more than 1000 rubles." <br><br>  From where  It turned out that their accounting system was not at all within the framework of the contract, it ‚Äúshifted‚Äù the file accounting for an hour or two.  Two thirds of the file was calculated downloaded about 2 hours later than it actually was.  (This can be estimated based on the fact that the file was downloaded for 3 hours.) In total, the traffic, as expected, is less than 4 GB for the entire month.  And some of them are so elegantly shifted, generating a ‚Äúdebt‚Äù.  How to prove it, first of all, for them, that the file was downloaded ‚Äúat the right time‚Äù during the service validity period? <br><br>  It's very simple, guys.  I wrote to you about this in technical support 5 times in a row, about once a week, with different text, but always with a statement of substance.  For some reason, during this time, no one followed up to check my arguments. <br><br>  1) assume that your accounting system was wrong, as I say (maybe this item turned out to be impassable by you?); <br>  2) check what hours I was connected to your network.  Obviously, the file could only be downloaded at the time when I was connected to the network; <br>  3) check when I turned off the service - it is recorded in the report (those same 16:57), which no one exposes to doubt; <br>  4) make sure that I was connected to the network mainly up to this point (then there was an electric train, an unsure connection, and the Internet was not connected at all); <br>  5) now the most important thing is, hold on, who did not believe - check at what time traffic was charged for more than 1000 rubles?  It turns out that about an hour or two later. <br><br>  Now answer the simple question: if the accounting system works correctly, then could I WITHOUT an internet connection download 500 MB of traffic on a 3G phone? <br><br>  The conclusion would be quite obvious - the accounting system is mistaken and shifts traffic 1-2 hours later.  And takes it into account later. <br><br>  But even here, if the system worked correctly, it would not have allowed the balance to fall below zero.  After all, this tariff has an advance payment system.  And in general, I would not let 500 MB of traffic be downloaded.  But they gave the same?  Why?  Because it was downloaded during the service "MTS-Tablet", and therefore, should be free!  (Paid in advance.) So, here we see not one, but two accounting errors. <br><br>  That's what I wrote about this 5 times in a row for a month, in response to their every automatic SMS ‚Äúabout debt‚Äù.  Why such a simple analysis of the question was not made?  Who will answer for 4 months delay? <br><br>  <b><i>Thank you, Vasily, for a detailed description!</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>But maybe 1000 rubles is such a trifle that you shouldn‚Äôt bother a huge and respected telecom operator?</i></b>  <b><i>He does not get rich for 1000 rubles, and you - not poorer?</i></b>  <b><i>He has no time to deal with such small things!</i></b>  <b><i>He has the same equipment - hundreds of millions of dollars.</i></b> <br><br>  - If it would benefit the development of the network, I would not mind.  But why did they take my 20 rubles?  And the account is blocked?  They do not believe that they are 20 rubles - a little.  Why should I assume that for me - 1000 rubles - is not enough? <br><br>  <b><i>If you were not a student, but a pensioner, and you would need a telephone connection, which they blocked, could you not get it?</i></b> <br><br>  If you think, then yes, no way.  Or go to the city to pay (remember, I was in the village when they turned off), or ask neighbors or bystanders. <br><br>  <b><i>Does this look like extortion through blocking cellular communication?</i></b> <br><br>  - I have described the picture, and you can draw conclusions yourself.  For myself, I made the following conclusions: <br><br><h2>  Conclusions about MTS in terms of solving technical issues of its services </h2><br><ol><li>  Technical support in MTS is problematic.  It is impossible to fix the appeal and get the number, the page address to it, to be referred to later. <br></li><li>  In response, only the answer of the robot comes, without a number and reference.  The answer from the person came about 3 weeks after my first letter, did not solve the problem, and there was no link in it either.  Term - extremely unacceptable.  (And if I would need a SIM card tomorrow? Who will pay the cost of buying a new one?) <br></li><li>  Looking for a way to fix the appeal or complaint to the company - apparently, you need to contact the office of the company or the government, which would be completely strange for minor technical issues.  (Or, according to the method of inventors, to write a registered letter. I doubt that the company‚Äôs office will be given, at my request, a compromising statement with a signature and stamp.) <br></li><li>  The company does not create grounds for applying to it to the court - it does not publicly declare debt.  However, in the case of SMS, this is debatable. <br></li><li>  At the same time, the company hasn‚Äôt been solving an obvious question for months, which is completely unacceptable if there were no alternatives to buy another SIM card. <br></li><li>  Long non-resolution of a question by a company has the consequence of long non-use of a telephone number, which may, according to the rules, lead to deletion of a number from a subscriber.  The user loses due to the company's fault, the cost of purchasing the tariff plan is lost along with the balance of the account.  Therefore, over time, the user is forced to solve the issue to save the number.  But - see the heading - what to do if the company does not want to resolve the issue? </li></ol><br><h2>  About the term "legal scam" </h2><br>  Why a scam?  Because the options for increased pay for excess traffic are enabled by default.  And usually the seller must ask if the client needs such a service. <br><br>  In order not to be unsubstantiated and not to prove the obvious, I refer only to the recent article by the famous blogger " <a href="http://fritzmorgen.livejournal.com/963603.html">Inattention Tax</a> ".  Such a "scam" is widely used by all telecom operators.  For this article, it is important that I tried to bypass all the cheating deductions from the account, and if it were not for the mistake of their accounting system, there would be no write-off. <br><br>  <b><i>Under paragraph 5</i></b> , if anyone is interested, what will happen if you do not use the phone for 5 months?  The tariff "Connect-4" spelled out: <br><br>  In case of non-use of communication services (including free) and no payments for 150 days (5 months), communication services will be charged in accordance with the terms of the Basic 092013 tariff plan. <br><br>  What is this fare?  We read: <a href="http://howtocalls.ru/mts/tarif-bazovyiy-mts">howtocalls.ru/mts/tarif-bazovyiy-mts</a> "Few people have heard about the MTS base rate, since its cost is clearly overestimated and almost no one uses it. ... the cost of calls within the home region to any numbers is 5.08 rubles per minute ... ", from another place quote:" The <b>daily</b> fee at a rate of <b>3 rubles</b> . ". <br><br>  That is, delaying the solution of its absolutely technical problem ‚Äúpushes‚Äù the subscriber also to a disadvantageous tariff.  And everything seems to be absolutely ‚Äúlegal‚Äù - it is written in the contract.  And then "absolutely legal" will begin to write off money for 3 rubles a day, if they remained in the account. <br><br>  So who benefits from delaying the solution of a technical problem in MTS? <br><br>  <u><b>UPD</b> : the next day at 13 o'clock.</u> <br><br>  I will collect all the useful messages for the first half-night discussion of the topic.  Many thanks to the commentators <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yizraor/" class="user_link">yizraor</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/oxoron/" class="user_link">Oxoron</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dom1n1k/" class="user_link">dom1n1k</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nizametdinov/" class="user_link">Nizametdinov</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/anei/" class="user_link">Anei</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kravtsov_dim/" class="user_link">kravtsov_dim</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/goodwinnew/" class="user_link">Goodwinnew</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/sixel/" class="user_link">sixeL</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/napobo3/" class="user_link">nApoBo3</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bravo-ej/" class="user_link">bravo-ej</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/shurupkirov/" class="user_link">shurupkirov</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ak_il/" class="user_link">ak_il</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/virtual77/" class="user_link">Virtual77</a> for similar stories and suggestions for solving the problem. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/oxoron/" class="user_link">Oxoron</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/virtual77/" class="user_link">Virtual77 have</a> suggested that the problem could have arisen simply because of the correct time zone on the server for file traffic or the Internet.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ak_il/" class="user_link">ak_il</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/napobo3/" class="user_link">nApoBo3</a> said that a certificate previously obtained for accounting equipment is of great importance for convincing Roskomnadzor. <br><br>  The <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/napobo3/" class="user_link">nApoBo3 comment</a> is so important that I bring it here, highlighting, in my opinion, the most important places. <br><blockquote>  I suppose the problem is somewhat broader than the subscriber‚Äôs view. <br>  MTS is a tightly bureaucratic company, which is most likely inevitable when dealing with a company of this size, in which many employees must solve problems related directly to the subscriber account. <br><br>  A system that counts money, billing is <b>certified / certified</b> , most likely undergoes periodic checks, etc. <br><br>  If we assume that services are incorrectly calculated to the subscriber, it follows that either billing (as a complex, including registration, storage and accounting systems) is not relevant, or there is a problem with the documents that accompany this process.  In this case, the company has two options: return the money to the subscriber and close your eyes to it ( <b>after which, resolve the issue quietly</b> during the planned billing update, without acknowledging the problem) or face the situation of recognizing possible incorrectness of charges on all subscribers during a period of time subject to the problem with billing (documentary or technical). <br><br>  I think at the level where the problem is (now) is - there are no people who are ready and have the right to make such a decision.  Those.  if the money is returned to the subscriber, there <b>should be an internal process that will explain the return</b> and launch additional problem solving processes, but this process will clearly contradict the law (since the fact of the incorrect operation of the billing system), i.e.  someone will have to take and make a charge to the subscriber 1000 rubles for no apparent apparent reason and any document support, <b>and then contact the supplier of the bill quietly</b> , solve the problem and update the billing.  <b>Or</b> the same someone has <b>to recognize the presence of a jamb</b> in the billing in <b>front of the subscriber</b> and start the corresponding processes in the company.  I'm afraid this ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù is just not there. <br><br>  So, the only possible behavior of MTS in this situation is <b>to refer to certified billing</b> and its not infallibility and send the subscriber, which is regrettable, although it happens regularly, especially with paid tricky extras.  services. </blockquote><br>  From this, I think, and should proceed from all victims.  There will be "the inclusion of a fool" ((C) A. Raikin), forgeries, false approvals.  And the same delay, which is not necessarily now spent on an urgent solution to a technical problem. <br><br>  And also <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lex_infohunter/" class="user_link">lex_infohunter</a> : <br><blockquote>  ... The month of correspondence on Twitter and via e-mail did not solve the problem.  After stating to the RKN and Rospotrebnadzor, everyone adjusted.  We connected some kind of service that disables the automatic renewal service.  Yes, yes, such an intricate function came out.  Traffic is now almost always displayed correctly.  Sometimes in the morning it crashes and shows with mythical gigabytes.  Therefore, I made a conclusion for myself: <b>with the support of MTS, I didn‚Äôt have long conversations, and after the first refusal - to use the tools of state coercion.</b>  It's a shame and unpleasant to do it, but alas, <b>other options</b> in our country do <b>not work well</b> . </blockquote><br><h2>  What are the conclusions from the article? </h2><br>  What would you do on the spot student Vasily Zaderganov (personal data changed)?  On the one hand, it is indecent to ignore the MTS, on the other - it seems to be petty tinker, someone will not pay attention.  With one, sending SMS about debt is already spreading false information, if Vasiliy is right, on the other, who will prove it?  On the one hand, it‚Äôs outraged by the sluggishness of the company (4 months to detain), on the other, it is not known whether Vasily did everything to defend his honor.  Maybe he himself let them mock him? <br><br>  And let's charge the survey and we wish Vasily ... no, all such Basil, who within months cannot get an answer from MTS, find a solution to the question.  It will be interesting how he will decide.  I personally got used to the fact that an Internet company resolves communication issues in half an hour, an hour, but not in months.  Does a company really have many such problems, not just MTS?  For my part I will keep in touch. <br><br>  <i>(The survey, of course, is not completely correct. Someone may donate a number, but someone, I think many, for 1000 rubles does not. But let him show the real position of the subscriber before the company‚Äôs action. The more calculating action will be shown more eloquently "Borrowed" - how many thousands they could pomyogogat here.)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317984/</a></p>
