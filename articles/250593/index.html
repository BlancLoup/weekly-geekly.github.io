In this lecture, Kirill Markin, a student at the Moscow State Technical University.  Baumana, will share his experience in creating a small company ‚ÄúDiafentis‚Äù, which is engaged in the implementation of various software systems.

We exist for more than three years, the annual turnover is several tens of millions of rubles.  We work with a profit, both on a year scale and monthly.  All these three years we are growing, and I hope that soon we will grow beyond the concept of "small business".

      What is "Diafentis"?  Now it is a company that deals with the implementation of CRM and ERP systems, mainly we work with Microsoft products.  We take their platforms, agree with specific companies that want to implement them, and implement them.  That's it, an uncomplicated business idea. <br><br>  There are many big players in this market.  I believe that big companies can not do enough cool, fast and cheap, as we do - small players.  And therefore a certain circle of customers, including large ones, comes to us, to the ‚Äútrifles‚Äù.  When they come to a large company, they say: ‚ÄúHello!  We want an introduction, ‚Äùand in response:‚Äú Well done.  Month - approval of TZ.  Another month - the introduction, and the price tag of 10 million for any department.  So customers start looking around for other contractors.  They come to us, to me and similar companies.  We agree to a smaller price tag, for shorter periods, and thus get our market share.  Of course, the client has more risks at the same time, because they work with a small company that can go bankrupt while they implement it.  There is a process of implementation there for half a year, but many try to save and take risks.  Who are our customers?  These are distribution, banking, non-profit organizations, training organizations (schools, various courses, this is the direction). <br><br>  There is a fundamental difference between those who have their own business and those who are going to create.  It is exactly the same as between business owners and hired employees.  That is, the desire to create a business does not make you a businessman.  It is possible that in other countries business management is being taught, but we are rather sad with this direction.  It is possible to teach some managerial functions, and it is very difficult to teach management as such, especially to own a company.  After all, how to teach the one who owns?  Strange, if we teach him, then why don't we own it?  In the end, it turns out that the most important thing is just ‚Äúflying hours‚Äù.  No matter what to manage.  For example, a team of students that makes a course project and does not know at all whether it will receive a profit, but which calls itself ‚Äúcompany‚Äù, is already flying time.  Therefore, there, if you want to create your own company, the way out is very simple and elementary - you need to create one.  Burn or not burn - this is the little things.  Only the flying hours are important.  As when obtaining a pilot's license, one cannot simply come and learn to fly.  It is necessary to fly some hours in order to get a training card.  Here is the same. <br><br><h1>  Biography </h1><br>  First, briefly tell you what I have done all these 21 long year. <br><br>  8 years.  The first program hello word.  How it was.  I found somewhere a basic textbook and just reprinted functions from there.  I did not know what they meant; I did not understand these difficult words that were in the book.  That is, from the book I was reproducing the procedures, functions, and then of them I compiled some programs at a higher level.  Without going into how it is done, how it works. <br><br>  In 10 years, went to work.  "Mom, Dad, I want a typewriter."  "Make Money."  Became a cleaner.  4 hours on weekdays had to work.  In the first week it was fun, then tired.  Terribly boring!  I just hated those 600 rubles a month that they paid me. <br><br>  Further until the age of 14, I simply increased the amount of work and the number of areas in which I worked.  These are 5 different positions, 5 different bosses, in two companies.  Bosses in the same company did not overlap.  There began terrible problems with time.  Around there are a lot of people who want to shove their work on you, but they are not your superiors.  I am 14 years old - generally a tasty morsel, also works almost around the clock.  That is, I had a certain amount of work, I understood that my bosses were dissatisfied, I had to find a solution.  I reread all the books of Gleb Arkhangelsky.  Something is being introduced, something is not, and it turns out to be done somehow so that I will not be fired immediately from five jobs. <br><br>  At the age of 15, I decided that five jobs was somehow a lot, I had to concentrate, and became a personal assistant.  This is such a very peculiar work, they can call at one in the morning, and you are mainly engaged in shifting papers.  But a lot of books and information for my supervisor passed through me.  Then I just read the same thing as he, watched the same thing, listened to the same thing.  Enough everything.  He worked as a personal assistant in several companies. <br><br>  At 16 years old - project manager.  It was something spontaneous, like ‚ÄúWe need virtual tours of these five objects, but there are no resources to do them.  There is such a sum for these same tours.  If you do, i.e.  if they hang on the site by such a date, your money.  Do not do - no money.  I am contacting the guys from the Physics and Technology Institute, something we have there is funny fun.  I made virtual tours, the first project was completed.  I had 1 person there in the project and 3 on outsourcing.  By the time I tried a bunch of classes, worked with 10 years.  I didn‚Äôt go to school mostly, I gave it up somehow.  And at 16, I realized that the topic of management had hooked me. <br><br><h1>  Own company </h1><br>  In 17 years, I understand that I want my company and that I can only work with technicians.  I did not have normal relations with any of the humanities with whom I tried to work together.  Having fallen in love with techies, having fallen in love with IT, being a geek since childhood, he began to go around technical universities.  The building of Moscow State University did not like at all.  I later found out that programmers and mathematicians are studying in another building. <br><br>  I finished school with a gold medal, until the EGE was 3 months.  All is well, passed the test, the exam on the "excellent".  It was 3 months, I worked and did not work at all.  I passed all EGE for 60 points and wrote exams.  It turned out too little, they never took it anywhere.  Entered a paid department in Baumanka, to first find a partner, and then a team for his company. <br><br>  In the first year I was looking for a partner.  I thought it would be logical to make up just a file for each of my classmates, and choose the best one.  Won a wonderful man Konstantin Ershov.  In the second year, we started a company with him.  From the age of 17 I understood what my company should be, I developed everything related to its creation. <br><br>  We had a consulting business, we took the training system that exists within the client organization.  If it was not, we developed it.  And trained on this system, new employees.  In the first month we had a turnover of 10,000 rubles.  They were ill-sawed, i.e.  we left nothing for the development of the company.  We decided that the first money should be taken away. <br><br>  In the second month of work, we hired the first employee for 50 rubles per hour.  Our salary with a partner was about 500 rubles per month, the amount of work was about 40 hours per week.  4 month - change of the company's course, went into the development of the database, completely abandoning consulting.  5 month - the first purchase for the company, a laptop.  7 month - reached the turnover of 50 000 rubles. <br><br>  For more than six months, we worked to get 50,000 rubles for two.  Given that I had experience with 10 years, if I began to work for hire, I would get much more.  Then our salary was 2,000 per person, everything else remained in the company. <br>  9 month - there was a jump, we already have 7 employees.  The average salary is 120 rubles per hour.  It's not an IT level, we pay, and it works fine.  Growing up. <br><br>  11 month - we realized that we can grow further only if we attract investments.  The first investments were small, several hundred thousand rubles.  But they allowed us to make a new breakthrough.  It turned out that nothing.  We had to reduce three employees, because the funds we had borrowed, which cost us a share in the company, were completely wrong. <br><br>  At 13 months, we finally develop business cards and a logo.  The company has existed without them for more than a year, and no particular problems.  I do not agree with those who believe that design is paramount, which is very important to start from the very beginning with business cards, brochures, booklets, etc.  All this is nice, but I disagree.  Suppose your corporate identity will cost you 50,000 rubles.  Even if you save and hire the worst designer, then 10 times you have to redo it.  Or good - once.  50 000 rubles you just go to the corporate identity.  And we have all revolving in the seventh month was 50,000. <br><br>  Please note - growth is very slow.  Unfortunately, I did not know how to do the company.  And so there was a very slow growth.  Now, in the third year, we have a turnover of several tens of millions a year.  It is very small.  These are terrible indicators for the third year of business life.  They are only good that I learn.  Having created new companies, I will develop them faster. <br><br>  15 month - 13 employees, turnover of 300,000 rubles per month.  Now we have the same number of employees, only the turnover is several times more.  At that time, we worked inefficiently, many things could not be done, something was not optimized, etc.  Constantly hired people, fired. <br><br><h1>  How were the investments attracted? </h1><br>  If someone has money, you can attract it.  In most cases, you need to somehow convince a potential investor in the success and profitability of your scheme.  Show that it is better to invest in your project than if the money will just lie on the account.  If he, having invested in you, does not receive anything in return, then you are engaged in charity.  Do whatever you like, but not in business. <br><br>  The first investments of almost all companies are parents.  Just: "Mom, Dad, give 100,000."  If the parents are smart, then they are forced to compile a package of documents.  Then calculate the return on investment, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">ROI</a> count everything, everything is very harsh.  If mom and dad are simpler people, they can just give money.  The point is that whoever gives you money, always consider that they are taken in some bank that will take everything away from you if you do not return. <br><br>  Friends, relatives ... you can almost always collect a million.  Just walk through the hostel.  You only need to convince people with the help of graphs, tsiferok, and not with the help of "I am a beautiful boy."  It will work on three girls, and you need guys who have money. <br><br><h1>  Where to get the first client </h1><br>  Use connections, relatives, friends, colleagues.  Ask, who have any friends who need, for example, a site?  Nobody needs?  Okay.  After a week you go again.  Who needs a website? <br><br>  There is such a thing as active direct sales.  Choose a market and start to get there.  Your agents walk, talk, use marketing, mailings, etc.  This is the active stage.  You have no money.  You have just created a company, you have a balance - 0. Yes, my company was created with a zero balance.  At the start there was no cash investment.  My partner and I invested time.  When you start, you do not have the money to actively seek customers.  Look the other way around.  Look for liabilities.  Just go through a bunch of your friends.  Browse the phone book, ring up and ask - who needs a website? <br><br>  You need to get the order with minimal cost.  The minimum costs are acquaintances, friends who may need your services.  For example, I need to make a course project website.  You want to build websites for huge companies, and you are told that ‚Äúmake a course project for 5,000 rubles‚Äù.  Cool!  You have the first order for 5 000 rubles in cash.  Gorgeous!  We take.  That is, the first customers - from their surroundings. <br><br><h1>  Legal issues </h1><br>  I will tell about it through the prism of my understanding of business and company.  I can not strongly advise him to follow.  My understanding is this: customers have needs that need to be met.  They need this very site, they need this introduction, they need to remove the floors, it does not matter.  This need must be met and get money.  This is primary.  And legal registration, taxes, deductions and other - are not important.  I by no means call for illegal business, no.  I say only that it is less important than the client.  If the client is comfortable to give you cash - do not show off.  It is necessary to do as convenient for the client. <br><br>  When a company is just born, you do not have a lawyer.  And there is no money for it.  It is desirable that everything is correct from the point of view of accounting, jurisprudence, etc.  Be sure to collect all the data about suppliers, they need to know.  It is necessary to officially arrange yourself for your job.  There are a lot of nuances.  And they need to be solved when you have enough money so that you do not mess with your customers.  I do not urge to refuse white bookkeeping.  But for me it‚Äôs more important that I have clients and I work for them.  Everything else is distracting.  There are clients who want their problem to be solved, and there is a state that wants to squeeze in some way: ‚ÄúGuys, maybe you will pay us too?‚Äù.  We will pay.  If we have money, then consider how much we should pay you. <br><br>  I will come back to this later, but it should be understood that the legal entity is IP, LLC, etc.  - it's just a fiction.  The company exists from the moment you decide that it exists.  For example, many chain stores open three LLCs for the project.  They are presented in the framework of one store, some have one, others have it.  You go in there - who, where, whose?  It is not clear, and this is not accidental.  You and I live with such wonderful laws and rules that if you can see who you are, then you can always be seated. <br><br>  The legal question of the first transaction disappears.  The first transaction - 10 000 rubles.  Seriously.  If a tax inspector comes to me and says: ‚ÄúDid you pay your tax?‚Äù I will say: ‚ÄúThe first transaction is 10 000 rubles‚Äù.  He will say: "Oh, well."  And leave, because it is not interesting to anyone.  For 10,000 rubles, no one will land. <br><br><h1>  Key mistakes </h1><br>  There were two of them.  The first is the feeling that I am a fool.  As if somewhere, someone knows something, but I just now created a company.  Nothing like this!  If you are 12 years old, you have just created a company that sells strawberries on the road, then you know best for the next 10 kilometers how to sell strawberries on the road.  And no one can advise you anything normally.  Not because they are all fools, but because they do not understand anything in the sale of strawberries.  If it seems that something needs to be done - it is necessary to do it.  If it seems that a person needs to be fired - dismiss!  Do not make a mistake and do not begin to doubt that you are right. <br><br>  And the second mistake was not able to steal algorithms.  Not ideas, namely algorithms.  I am not a startup.  Probably, with startups somehow different.  I can‚Äôt explain to myself in 35 years why I earned minus 2 billion dollars.  I need to have a positive balance.  I need to know how much money I made, how much useful services I have made, how much I have improved in this world.  I am a streaming businessman, there are a billion of such projects, such companies.  And here it is very important to be able to steal algorithms.  Find out how a neighbor does.  Go to the next room of the hostel, which is someone's office, and eavesdrop, and how is he doing?  And then implement it yourself.  Steal, improve, steal, improve, steal, improve.  This applies to all algorithms. <br><br>  When we create a company whose business model has already been invented before us, then we have to steal everything, and then improve it.  Because if from the very beginning we want to build everything beautifully, without stealing, then there simply won't be enough time.  We will have more time to develop from the very beginning.  Therefore, we must be able to steal cool algorithms.  Very many guys give them away with pleasure.  Seriously.  Stealing is a very big word.  In fact, everyone is happy to tell.  Like me now. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  These conclusions are only mine, they may be wrong. <br><br>  The system approach is a very simple thing.  You need to be big from the start.  When you create a company, how does this happen?  You say: ‚ÄúGuys, I want my company.  That's it, tomorrow I'll go look for orders. ‚Äù  The first order appeared a week later, ‚ÄúWe need to find one guy now, I‚Äôm not able to cope alone.  I‚Äôll find one guy, and since I‚Äôll be constantly looking for orders, in principle, I‚Äôll leave him, let him work.  Well, I'll take the project for the first time, and then we'll see. ‚Äù  In a month you have this guy, you close the order, get the money.  And here it is very important to stop telling your friends and customers how big you are and instantly become so.  If your customer knows that he is very important to you and brings the main profit, he will crush you at a price.  This is logical.  Therefore, in no case should any customer know that he is your saving order.  Let the company be closed if you do not receive this order now, but this infection should not know that this is so. <br><br>  To become big you need to do only two things.  The first is to close the information on the composition of the owners and turnover.  Turnaround can talk.  Remember, as I said at the very beginning, that I have several tens of millions.  How many?  Unclear.  I can calculate a turn in ten different ways, I will get different indicators.  I'm lying to my customers.  I tell them another number.  It is necessary to instantly give out the information that your customers want to hear. <br><br>  Sales is a very dirty topic.  You have to understand that if you are engaged in sales (and if you own a company, you are obliged to deal with them), be prepared that you will have to lie, looking people in the eye.  Nothing bad will happen, everyone is doing it.  It is necessary for good sales.  IT companies do not happen to thousands of employees, but never talk about the true number.  And if you are talking with a native of the officials, who measures the volume of the company employees?  Everything, you are in the span.  You have to look like a big player, and do it cheaper.  And you can do cheaper, because you are small, you can take less margin.  But the big ones can not. <br><br>  It is very important to immediately build the right system.  Do not stop at something small, momentary, otherwise you will not have development.  If your algorithm is supposed to work, think how to scale.  We need to think from the very beginning how you are capturing your market piece.  If you do not do this, then you can simply stay with your little piece, turn into a freelancers collector: there are three of us, when there is no money - only one, and when there is -10.  Not that!  We need a systematic approach to constantly grow. <br><br>  Every year I have increased rates of turnover and profits, I have to beat them.  It is important for me to take a piece of the market.  I am not interested in a freelance company that is "torn about" on projects.  I need a steady stream of projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/56e/623/6c656e62378c4c7daec7df1a0dd74fe0.jpg"><br><br>  The first conclusion.  Functional.  We have a company, and there are functions.  This is just one example of how to break the company's functionality.  You can do it in any other way.  Imagine that you need to model a company.  That you have any classics, some employees, their own characteristics.  And now you are writing code for these classics and characteristics.  Moreover, these employees, under whom you write code, they are also a kind of ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù for you.  And in the end, you have a set of bio-bots and resources, some external sources.  And you need to write code.  This is one of the main tasks of the entire management. <br><br>  I will give a very simple example.  Most often, in the first month of work you are the only employee of your company; you must receive a salary, which must be calculated not by one line in Excel (‚ÄúI am wonderful and beautiful, 5,000 rubles‚Äù), but ten different.  Because you get paid as a general, as an accountant, as a salesman, as a security man, etc.  The salary is small, miserable, but you need to find yourself in different lines.  It is very important.  If you count in people, then you will have a kind of family business.  You accept people, you love them very much, appreciate, grieve for them.  Look, what a great guy that ran.  Let's give him such a job.  The fact that the work is useless and the company is not needed is not interested.  In order not to hit like this, first make the functional, and then the people.  First, decide what needs to be done for the company, and then you will figure out by whom to "plug the holes."  Most often at the start of the company enough 1-2 people.  Two is enough to close all the functionality of the company.  Why?  Because we have no legal and accounting functionality because of the lack of money for them. <br><br>  When you start growing, you simply transfer these functions to other people.  Position as such should be tied to the functional.  It is clear that the accountant is engaged in accounting.  But only when you have money for an accountant.  And initially you play this role. <br><br><h1>  Basic rules of standardization </h1><br>  So, how to paint functions.  The rules are very similar to writing code.  Only that there are not so many functions, otherwise we will not understand later.  We should have as few variables as possible.  That is, we have a set of rules used in conventional software development.  We have to write this ‚Äúcode‚Äù in the optimal form, and this optimal type is different at different stages of the company's development.  You will rewrite classes, functions, responsibilities, get rid of whole classes, i.e.  fire people.  Reduction is not when you fired an employee, because he is a fool, but when you realize that you do not need this function. <br><br><h1>  Laziness </h1><br>  This is one of the main things.  To sign functions in a company you have to be very, very lazy.  Well, for example, how did I create a technical support department in my company?  I was then the project manager, and one of the users of my clients wrote to me.  Something like ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt work for me here, it‚Äôs something there, I don‚Äôt know which button to press.‚Äù  I'm so lazy a bastard that I am ready to work 60 hours a week so that I don‚Äôt have to respond to this letter.  Do you understand the logic? <br><br>  When we talk about this technical support, you need to be lazy, do not want to answer those same letters yourself and create a functional in which technical support will respond to the flow of such letters. <br><br><h1>  Standards </h1><br>  It is very important not to turn standardization into bureaucracy.  For example, when you have too many incomprehensible standards, in which it is written that your analyst should come to the client, you must call your boss on the fact of your arrival, but in fact no one is following.  It turns out that the standard requires doing so, and we will do as we like, and then we will do it.  That such standardization is not needed.  It is useless. <br><br>  When you create a standard, you need to become familiar with the way employees perform it.  If they really reduce it somewhere, then this is usually a kind of optimization.  They are so lazy that they improve your standard.  Observe how they work and change the standard.  Because when new employees arrive, they do not need to reinvent the bicycle.  They should take advantage of what your employees have invented before them.  I, for example, slang, mate and jokes are allowed in the standards. <br><br>  One more example.  This is a developer workflow.  We have our own project accounting system, and it says here how to work with these or other tasks.  We use a phased, detailed explanation so that even a beginner can figure it out.  Standards should be written for idiots, but not because your employees are idiots. <br><br>  Be sure to paint the functionality of not only your employees, but yours too.  You are the CEO.  What does the CEO do?  For example, he receives 50 000 rubles, we write out his tasks.  It turns out that he looks at one report once a month.  Why then 50 000 rubles?  For viewing the report and making one decision?  Break the functional, because when you hire another CEO, you need to know what this person will do.  Same here. <br><br>  Look for great, best employees, geniuses, and create a system of your company with them.  And these cool guys along with you, too cool, should create a system with standards for idiots.  For example, you went on vacation, and your personnel officer hired an idiot, well, sometimes, you yourself can accidentally hire an idiot, this also happens.  And you have built a whole system of training, but, unfortunately, this is not possible by standards alone, we need hired trainers, either outsourced or within the company. <br><br><h1>  Your company doesn't care what you want to do. </h1><br>  When you create a business, you think that you can do whatever you want.  This is not true.  The manager is just a laborer.  The higher the position, the more he is a laborer.  This is the most decent of words.  In fact, it would be more correct to call "whore."  The higher your position in the company, the more holes you must plug if they form under you.  The CEO must become a courier if he does not go to work.  The courier should not become anyone unless someone did something.  Therefore, the higher you get in the company, and possession is the highest, higher there is simply no place - the more you become a laborer in your company, and she doesn‚Äôt care what you want to do.  You will do what the company wanted.  Well, your porter did not go to work today.  Forward!  The guy who had to go to the meeting with the client did not come out today.  And you can not send anyone to a meeting with a client, you have no options.  If you do, you will not have orders.  And we are with you in IT, we have with you B2B orders, everything starts from 50 000 rubles.  And you lose them if you do not get up right now and go to the client.  The person you take on a managerial position should know this.  And you yourself just have no options.  You must do this.  And if you do not, then lose money. <br><br>  There is the concept of "agreement".  It is primary, and a legal contract is a secondary thing.  What is the arrangement?  When representatives of the two companies have agreed on who and what will do and what will happen if each of them does something.  Punishments are not mandatory, they can be excluded.  Punishments can even be used for self-stimulation.  For example, if you need guarantees that you will do the work, then include in the contract a punishment for yourself for non-fulfillment. <br><br>  If you reach an agreement with a client, then you have a classic option further - you can legally secure this agreement.  How do all the arrangements at the top level, the most expensive, for example, the sale of the company?  Companies with a price tag of several million are sold on a napkin in a cafe, not because they write so much better, pathetic, and so in magazines, but because this is the easiest way.  You don't care.  You agreed, and then simply exchanged phone numbers of lawyers.  Everything.  They will understand.  It doesn't matter how it will be shaped, what will be done with it.  You need to specify the price tag and basic conditions on each side.  If they are specified on a napkin, then everything else is clear. <br><br>  After that, lawyers of both companies discuss and draw up an agreement, give their bosses, and they approve it.  Bosses do not finish on the napkin.  They agreed on it, and then approve a piece of paper, read.  But they do not make it up.  Then the lawyer puts them on the table and shows the risks, you need to press on such a parameter, and there will be so many losses, maybe then ... If you don‚Äôt like it, the bosses try to talk back. <br><br>  Violate the agreement with your client can not be.  If you fail to fulfill the agreement - call, cancel this agreement and create a new one.  To postpone the order is a change in the terms of the agreement, you do not violate it, you offer: ‚ÄúAnd let me do it not tomorrow, but in 2 days,‚Äù and if they say, ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù you have not violated any agreement.  If they say to you: ‚ÄúNo, do not give it,‚Äù and you did not do it tomorrow, then you violated the agreement.  The initial agreement must be fulfilled, but you can try to change the conditions.  As I said, the legal registration of the agreement is not necessary.         . <br><br><h1>    </h1><br>    , ‚Äî , , , ‚Äî     .

When you arrange it, you call business owners and give some useful information.  This is the so-called two-step sales. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Why don't you love startups? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> I really love startups.  They are cool guys!  I just don't know how they do it.  There risks some mad.  We are in an empty market, there are not enough such companies in Russia, there is no glut.  To make a streaming company that makes money, you just need to borrow a business model and improve it.  This is very difficult to do, in fact.  You have to be very stubborn, be an entrepreneur, work very hard to do this, but it is possible.  And startups have a very risky field.  I admire them, I love them.  But just do not understand. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> How to find your market, your niche? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> To be honest, I believe that there are no niches of their own.  There is an entrepreneur as such, and what to do is not so important.  Need competence in this area, and that's all. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> We are entering the market, where there are already players? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> We enter the Russian market.  No matter how many players, consider them not.  There is no competition.  That is, you can search for niches, and the most profitable are quite accessible.  How to search - I do not know.  It seems to me that we are now in such a market that, whatever you do, there are free clients to whom you can provide services. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Have you heard of Business Youth?  What do you think about him? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> Very bad opinion.  I am not in favor of such a sectarian approach.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how many years a business has been open, you don‚Äôt need to equate companies with this indicator, it can‚Äôt be an indicator at all.  In addition, I am not a supporter of consulting.  I take consultants only if very adequate.  I don‚Äôt like it when someone is being clever ... I don‚Äôt know ... I don‚Äôt like Business Youth simply because of their reputation.  I think I didn‚Äôt understand much about the question, I‚Äôm sure that they have useful content, 100% are there.  Well, there is no useless content when there is so much noise.  That is, useless content happens, but not in the case of such a popularity of a resource or company.  They have normal performance.  Overpriced, but nonetheless. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> And what about the functionality of the CEO, who receives 50,000 per month and makes decisions? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> No, we just cut costs, why should he pay 50,000? <br><br>  <b>Question: Does</b> he know what decision to take? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> If this solution is worth it, then yes, you can pay.  If you just look at the position, you do not know how to pay.  And if you look at a specific solution, then maybe it is worth it. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> He knows, the whole company will follow this decision. <br>  <b>Answer:</b> You can not hire Gender at the start.  At the start, only you can decide.  There is no one smarter.  There is no adviser.  There is no smart employee to come and set up.  The option of all IT is to do it yourself, so at the start you yourself are the CEO.  You need to set the market price, including yourself, if you want more money - get it out of business.  Do not give out salary in any case, otherwise you pollute the scheme.  You do not know how much you earn. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Is there any fear not to discourage investment?  As usual in such cases come? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> There is a little fear.  This is not a startup, everything is clear.  There are planned targets, they do not increase abruptly.  You are loading yourself and your company more and more.  For example, if last month you reached a turnover of 1 million, then this month you simply write to yourself ‚ÄúI want to achieve a turnover of 1 million 100 000 rubles‚Äù.  I don't care how I do it.  You set yourself such a task and went to work.  And gradually increase and increase while you can.  If you can't, then the numbers go down.  Of course, nowhere from fear you will not get.  But if rested, like a ram, work, work, work very much, then everything is solved.  There is nothing difficult in management, there is nothing difficult in development and programming.  You just have to sit down and program for many, many years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250593/</a></p>
