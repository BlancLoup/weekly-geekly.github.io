    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Windows Mobile 6.5 - a powerful platform for creating an attractive and functional interface in your mobile applications </h4><br>  <a href="http://msplatforma.ru/materials/platform_Windows_Mobile_6.5.aspx">The report</a> talked about the UI Framework, the Gesture API for creating interactive applications, and how to create Widgets for Windows Mobile 6.5. <br><br>  Widgets is a small application developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that implements some logic, for example, a widget for currency conversion, weather display, etc. <br><br>  The widget should consist of the following files: <br>  * HTML file with your logic <br>  * manifest file in XML format <br>  * icon of your widget (if not, the standard one will be used) <br><br>  After that, you need to create a * .zip archive and rename the permission to * .widget.  Then you can install on a device running on Windows Mobile 6.5.  More details about this can be found <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1494.html">in the video report on the website techdays.ru</a> or read <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/resources/en-us/Application%2520Submission%2520Guidelines.pdf">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  ASP.NET 4.0, MVC Framework 2.0 and Visual Studio 2010 </h4><br>  This was probably the most interesting report for me from the point of view of professional activity.  But, besides, it was necessary to go to him at least in order to listen to Gaidar Magdanorov.  Despite the fact that a similar report was already present earlier, I learned a lot about ASP.NET.  For developers of web applications "must see", or download the presentation, where all the innovations of technology are collected. <br><br>  I wrote a lot about innovations earlier, so I will not duplicate it - a little later everything can be seen personally from the report or presentation. <br><br><h4>  Development of modern Windows applications - Windows Presentation Foundation 4.0 </h4><br>  The report was devoted to new technology WPF 4.0.  Little emphasis was placed on Microsoft‚Äôs own projects written in WPF (Expression, Visual Studio, players, etc.).  Improved WPF editor in Visual Studio, while Expression was able to work with TFS. <br><br>  The new version has improved font rendering at low resolutions, the new WPF also supports all new features of Windows 7. But most of all I liked the multitouch support (you can <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/MultitouchWPF4Beta1/">watch the video on channel9</a> ), and read how it looks programmatically - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/archive/2009/11/04/introduction-to-wpf-4-multitouch.aspx">here</a> .  I liked the fact that for this you do not need to write a lot of code. <br><br><h4>  Visual Studio 2010 - a new generation of tools for accelerated application development </h4><br>  A good <a href="http://msplatforma.ru/materials/Visual_Studio_2010_new_generation.aspx">report</a> as a matter of fact - reports for managers, UML diagrams, improved application testing capabilities and much more.  Who is not engaged in how much development, and project management, watch necessarily. <br><br><h4>  Silverlight 3. Comprehensive Platform Overview </h4><br>  In the report, Mikhail Chernomordikov spoke about the possibility of working outside the browser, Smooth Streaming technology, working with 3D and creating business applications.  But most of all, this report was remembered by a large number of demonstrations, especially the one where Firefox, Opera, Ghrome and Safari browsers made friends with Silverlight.  4 browsers were built according to the principle: two above and two below, each of them contained the same Silverlight application, inside which balls randomly ran.  The whole joke is that the balloon that flew out of the limits in one browser appeared in another from the place where it flew out from the previous one.  Thus, the illusion was created that all 4 browsers work as one window.  This was made possible thanks to the ability to communicate with Silverlight applications. <br><br>  Silverlight performance in comparison with other technologies is available at <a href="http://bubblemark.com/">http://bubblemark.com/</a> . <br><br><h4>  Programming Models and Microsoft .NET 4.0 Platform </h4><br>  Very interesting and useful report, talked about: <br>  * transition from the imperative principle of development to the declarative one (lambda expressions, LINQ, attributes) <br>  * <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef">parallel programming</a> (PLINQ, Parallel Extensions) <br>  * <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/">Code Contracts</a> <br>  * <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef">Managed Extensibility Framework</a> <br><br>  Very high-quality examples, although the latter is not so clear from the first time.  Developers are highly recommended for viewing and study. <br><br><h4>  The final </h4><br>  At the very end, among the participants of the conference certificates for the purchase of licensed software from the site <a href="http://allsoft.ru/">http://allsoft.ru/</a> were drawn.  I want to reassure everyone who could not win the certificate, because on the site torrents.ru you are waiting for much more discounts and promotions :) Jokes with jokes, but the final was very funny and memorable. <br><br>  In the end, I would like to thank the organizers and speakers for two great days called ‚ÄúPlatform - 2010‚Äù! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75251/</a></p>
