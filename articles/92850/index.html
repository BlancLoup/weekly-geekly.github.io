Everything is 100% original as pumpkin-flavored orbits.  By pathos this doesn‚Äôt compare with the technology of cooking pizza from a pack of melted dumplings, but it will be interesting, the cap ensures that.  Ahead of the creative mix of the technical and organizational, plus some personal observations.  I'll tell you how it all began, a little about WPF, a few words about how I hired programmers, about experiments in the construction of work and the dual nature of man.  About all a little bit, because, all at once, as always does not fit.  About sleepless nights and hungry student years, too, did not fit. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The project itself is a contract designer.  A good base of templates for all occasions and the Wizard for them, which helps to conveniently fill in the right places, pulling some pre-stored data. <br>  From what started - 5 years ago I had the opportunity to work with a huge package of documents for the reorganization of a group of companies from 10 legal entities, between which it was necessary to spend dozens of inventory flows.  And the enterprises were active, so when I worked on the second half, the first half was already outdated in numbers and last names.  I almost lost my mind, even started inventing change management registries, a little more and I would create my PMBOK bike (PMBOK - project management guide from PMI).  The project was successfully completed by connecting a few more people to help, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautomating it all sat down.  And every time I got out, when I heard a joke about the fact that the computational power of modern gryzryzryz is able to control the orbital constellation of satellites, and if not for Windows ... <br><br>  For five years, the thought has turned and turned around faces of varying degrees of clarity, but somehow the hands did not reach.  But recently there was a call from an old friend: <br>  - Arthur, can you tell me where you can invest money? <br>  ‚ÄúRemember, I told you a couple of years ago about one useful program ...‚Äù <br>  - Yeah, right, only then I did not attach importance. <br>  - Well, well, it is quite relevant. <br>  - Ok, let's take a week to think it over, but I agree beforehand. <br><br>  Needless to say, somehow half a year before I tried to look for investors, I sent out about 300 letters, there were a dozen answers and only two offers of a meeting. <br><br>  Immediately the minds began to seethe in my head.  At first I thought about choosing a development platform.  The main thing that seemed necessary to me was to provide work on a cloud platform.  I had agonizing thoughts between Java on Google App Engine and C # on Windows Azure.  On the other hand, I wanted to implement it not only as a web service, but also as a desktop application.  In fact, the choice here was predetermined - this is the .Net platform. <br><br>  In .Net there is an awesome WPF technology, although it is far from new (however, it is still not used so far).  I saw only two implementations - the <a href="http://seesmic.com/">seesmic.com</a> twitter client (yes, kavaino) and the Russian program for traders <a href="http://www.tslab.ru/">www.TSLab.ru</a> (yes, it slows down a bit).  The only negative is the speed of work, but I think it will not be relevant in a couple of years.  But WPF's advantages, even with a shovel, are unlimited cascading nesting of controls, vectoriality, shaders, freedom in design.  On the one hand, I was lucky that I didn‚Äôt have a chance to work with WinForms, on the other hand I‚Äôm somewhat uncomfortable, because in books almost every second paragraph begins with the words "Unlike WinForms ..." <br><br>  Further, programmers - about them I have enough stories for three posts.  Almost all polls require TK, apparently afraid to take responsibility, although I can explain everything well on my fingers.  At the same time, some offered to make a turnkey project for a week, others promised me to do the same for the same week and the same price.  As a result, TK took more than a month of brainstorming.  The document turned out not so much detailed as describing cunning approaches and concepts.  Well, I think now there is a TK, but it was not there that - it turns out that they almost need to be written down to the comma.  Thank you, I think, but I don‚Äôt want to do much of the work for you. <br><br>  Work decided to build remotely.  I picked up a simple forum on the <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">www.phpbb.com</a> engine, scored about 30 people from freelancing and similar sites.  Paid separately for useful ideas, code samples, sentences.  A good brainstorm of this kind turned out, although not all expressed themselves (people are somehow afraid, I don‚Äôt even know why).  About what I have invented, I will tell you.  So, out of these 30 people, after 2 weeks, only three active are left - in fact this is a good figure, the personnel officers will agree with me.  Well, what to do, I began to take in bulk, I scored another 100, and of them in a month there was not a single one left.  I did not touch them, showed the front of work, provided freedom of action, and 90% anyway sat and waited for instructions.  Apparently, it is necessary to work more closely with people.  In the American management theory there are two incompatible approaches: Theory X, which says that workers should be skinned, and Theory Y, which says that a person acts out of his creative motives.  In general, a person is also such an all-out of himself as a wave-particle duality.  I do not like to kick, I have to invent something else.  I, of course, can also be angry, but emotions are not transmitted on the Internet, and instead of tone, they get something else.  I do not know, I have to think. <br><br>  I liked to present something, I even have to struggle with the desire for conciseness.  Well, in conclusion, I can not break the tradition - I took the VPS 512MB, so far I hung up a simple version of the site, so that I could feel with my hands which project I was talking about.  I don‚Äôt know how many hits / hosts will survive, most interesting.  In short, I invite you to take part in habrozabava "popular effect" at this address <a href="http://shablonarium.ru/">shablonarium.ru</a> <br><br>  I apologize for spelling - spring, vitamin deficiency, confusion with the Russian school teacher, etc.  In general, to new meetings. <br><br>  PS: I also decided to do a social network in Silverlight, I also invented all sorts of tricks, who are interested in participating - write to shablonarium@tigrest.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92850/</a></p>
