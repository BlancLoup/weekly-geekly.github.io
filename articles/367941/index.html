Personally, I have been looking for different solutions for sports for a very long time: mainly for running and cycling.  It is clear that to run, and even more so to ride a bike with overhead headphones is somehow inconvenient, to say the least.  Therefore, you have to choose only from the plug-in.  For a long time I had Shure on the foam, kept in the ear perfectly, but after a while the spot classes still fall out.  Although it must be admitted drop out an order of magnitude less than silicone ear cushions.  But their main disadvantage was that if you have to remove, for example, while skiing, their reverse donning was terribly annoying. <br><br>  After Shure significantly reduced its depreciation cost, I decided to switch to headphones with silicone ear cushions, realizing that I would have to experiment with different types of fasteners. <br>  My next sports headphones were the Monster iSport Livestrong, which has an innovative petal mount that fits inside the auricle in the spacer.  I admit, bought into a powerful PR brand Monster.  As a result, the sound is normal, and the mount is not stuck with me, and at the cost of the headphones, even the average budget can not be called. <br>  And so, when we started distributing Monoprais in Russia, I was looking forward to the first batch because of Monoprice Sport headphones.

      <b>Packing and equipment:</b> <br>  Headphones Monoprice Sport, as I wrote above to the disgrace, are simple and inexpensive, so the box in which they are delivered is just as simple: mini size 7x7x2 cm and thin cardboard. <br>  There is nothing in the set except the headphones themselves.  It is strange why the manufacturer does not pack them with standard additional ear cushions of two sizes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/179/d06/0d2/179d060d22ad4b2cad6b2a1af04d126b.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Appearance and materials:</b> <br>  As I understand it, the developers had a simple task - to pack a good sound into a very light body so that they could run and ride.  All elements of the body are plastic, even the front chrome ‚Äúcover‚Äù of the body is an imitation for steel.  The nozzle (air duct), on which the ear cushions are held, is molded with the body and covered with a protective grille. <br>  The ear hook is made of very soft plastic, therefore over time it adapts to the size of the user's ear.  In cold weather, the bristle material will not freeze and dangle like wood on the ear. <br>  I also liked the cord, which is also covered with an unusually soft rubber sheath.  Perhaps this is also due to the fact that the cord does not harden in cold weather.  Attention!  When severe frost is not experienced.  Although the cable is round, it doesn‚Äôt get confused at all, I don‚Äôt know why. <br>  The plug is straight; it is very convenient to pull the phone or player out of your pocket, especially when playing sports.  It has a gold plating, which significantly increases the corrosion resistance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/341/cd5/509/341cd55098ad47d195a62fb74fd53985.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sound:</b> <br>  The sound of the headphones Monoprice Sport is quite powerful and clean due to 9 mm drivers.  At this price, I don‚Äôt understand how this is achieved, although I‚Äôm already used to the sound that all Monoprice headphones are perfect.  Great bass, if of course the ear cushions fit tightly in the ear canal.  Headphones are loud, still 100 dB. <br>  The manufacturer set the resistance to 16 ohms, if you do not go into radio engineering, you can say the following: the lower the resistance, the less powerful source is needed for headphones and the greater the influence of the source itself on the sound.  In other words, a small resistance indicates that the developers made headphones for small players and phones. <br>  The frequency range here is somewhat trimmed - 20Hz-16000 Hz with an output power of 10mW. <br><br>  <b>Price and warranty period:</b> <br>  You can always find out by the availability and buy Monoprice Sport headphones with a ear hook on our website at the <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">Mobile Sound Store ‚ÄúSOUND4YOU‚Äù</a> or <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product/12451483%3Fhid%3D90555%26nid%3D56179%26text%3DMonoprice%2520Sport%26srnum%3D3">from our partners on Yandex.Market</a> . <br>  On all Monoprice models, we provide a manufacturer's warranty of 12 months. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  Headphones Monoprice Sport is really a very good solution for those who, when playing sports, prefer music.  The ear hook is very simple and reliable at the same time, the sound is excellent, like all the other Monoprice headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/044/88c/c94/04488cc9480148c7b30aa1592d91fa60.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps the only drawback for me was the fact that the kit does not have additional, interchangeable silicone ear cushions.  And that on the headphones themselves constantly fell out of the ear: either the size did not fit, or the silicone is of lower quality.  The issue was finally resolved by replacing the ear cushions from any other Monoprice plug-in headphones and more. <br><br>  You can also buy separate ear pads in the color and size of your choice from us at the <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">‚ÄúSOUND4YOU Mobile Sound Store‚Äù</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/462/20f/404/46220f40497649aa9309b58804fdf8ec.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367941/</a></p>
