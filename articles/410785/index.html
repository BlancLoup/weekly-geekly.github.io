  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blockchain is an ancient Russian invention</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - Cool blockchain stuff!  - said Zhorik. <br>  - And then!  - I immediately confirmed.  - Great, our ancestors tried. <br>  - Our ancestors??? <br>  - Do you not know that blockchain is an ancient Russian invention? <br>  ‚ÄúIt is not known,‚Äù Zhorik admitted and blushed. <br>  This young man always blushed, being caught on ignorance of elementary scientific facts. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù I sighed, and prepared for explanations.  - What is the blockchain, in your opinion? <br>  ‚ÄúWell, this is ...‚Äù Zhorik hesitated.  - When each link in the chain refers to the previous link.  In this way, data continuity is ensured. <br>  - What is your middle name? <br>  - Petrovich ... And what is the middle name? <br>  - With that, Georgiy Petrovich.  Your, like any other person, the genealogical line is a chain in which each successive link refers to the previous one.  Middle name is a link to the previous link.  Or not? <br>  - It seems yes ... <br>  Zhorik thought, then scratched his head, then again thought. <br>  - But this is ... Links are not enough, you need encryption.  The links are hashed in the blockchain, ‚Äùhe finished and looked at me triumphantly. <br>  - And if you think? <br>  The triumphant smile on Zhorik's lips faded away. <br>  - Is patronymic hash?  The young man asked, starting vaguely to suspect something. <br>  - Do they give complete information about the previous link to which they refer?  - I asked in response.  - Is it possible to identify a father by patronymic Petrovich?  There may be millions of people named Peter, how can I tell which of them is your father? <br>  - How to find out?  - repeated Zhorik meekly. <br>  - Decrypt hash code! <br>  Zhorik said nothing.  He clearly did not have time for the flight of my thoughts. <br>  ‚ÄúOkay, I'll explain now,‚Äù I said pity on the youngster.  ‚ÄúYou must point a finger at a Peter and say:‚Äú This is my father. ‚Äù  This is the key to the hash code needed to decrypt the previous link.  Blockchain exactly repeats this technology.  Nothing new, as you can see. <br>  From an excess of thoughts Zhorik sat on a chair. <br>  - So after all ... With the blockchain, copies of the database are stored on multiple computers. <br>  ‚ÄúIsn't full information about ancestors present in the genes of every single person?‚Äù  In any case, the method of storing information through multiple backups was not invented by the Japanese. <br>  Zhorik was silent for a long time, then hesitantly said: <br>  - There is mining in the blockchain! <br>  - Right, and what is he? <br>  - Create a new link in the chain. <br>  As a student on the exam, stumbled upon a familiar topic, he perked up and began to boldly list: <br>  - First, mining equipment is required.  Secondly, it is necessary to mine a certain time, and nobody will give guarantees at what moment a new link is formed; this happens in a stochastic way.  If you are lucky enough to make a link, consider, made a profit in the form of a certain amount of Satoshi. <br>  - And when creating a link on the family tree, isn‚Äôt it? <br>  - How is it going? <br>  - You must have working equipment, without it you will not create anything worthwhile.  You put the equipment into the slot and mine.  That is, in the blockchain, this process is called mining, and when creating a new link on the family tree, the coitus.  Minor terminological differences, no more.  Both processes are long, energy costs and, by and large, unpredictable.  From time to time, if lucky, a new link in the form of one or several satoshi joins the chain of ancestors ... <br>  - Why satoshi? <br>  - What is the name of a newborn or call, the meaning is one.  Please note that it is not possible to immediately profit from a completed transaction.  After successful mining, you need to wait about 20 hours, after successful coitus - about 20 years, for reliability.  But technology, and the numbers are identical in both cases, do not you think? <br>  The young man did not know how to parry. <br>  ‚ÄúSo this is not a Japanese invention?‚Äù <br>  - You yourself think what you say?  Coitus was invented by the Japanese, who would have thought! <br>  - I meant the blockchain. <br>  - Even funnier, blockchain invented by the Japanese!  - I cried, losing my patience from Zhorikova stupidity.  - Yes, in Japan, to date, we have not learned to use middle names!  Inventors, their mother ... <br>  The young man was finally crushed and buried under my reinforced concrete arguments.  Still squeaked: <br>  - Let not the Japanese, but why are they necessarily Russians? <br>  - Which people have the most intellectual products being stolen? <br>  ‚ÄúEverybody knows the Russians,‚Äù Zhorik sighed. <br>  - And the first mention of the patronymic in Russia refers to 945 AD, see Wikipedia.  So blockchain is an ancient Russian invention.  Considering that the blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, only clinical idiots can, you have to think about it with your own head sometimes! <br>  - Got it, - Zhorik puzzled. <br>  ‚ÄúWell done,‚Äù I said.  And winked. </div>
