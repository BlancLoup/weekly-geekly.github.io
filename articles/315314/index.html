    <h2>  Is it possible to use technical equipment in outer space and on other planets? </h2><br>  Under the conditions of the ISS, there are a lot of gadgets, but they often break, for example, one of the most common problems is the breakage of screens, which is associated with high pressure or simply too long work. <br><br>  In conditions of open space, many more <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-all-my-electronics-gadgets-like-smart-phone-stop-working-in-outer-space-I-mean-will-current-flow-in-outer-space-and-make-my-device-work/answer/Joseph-Reinemann">factors</a> will influence the technology, therefore, when developing such equipment, radiation protection, reliability (durability) and a cooling system should be considered. <br><br>  Higher levels of radiation in space will eventually cause damage to the integrated circuit.  In addition, during solar storms, the electromagnetic field of the planet sometimes reflects radiation.  Conventional consumer-class equipment is unlikely to survive such an impact without breakdowns. <br><br>  And on the moon, ordinary terrestrial equipment will be exposed to cosmic and solar radiation and will not be able to function normally, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-challenges-of-building-servers-on-the-moon/answer/Jack-Benn">says</a> Quora user, referring to NASA <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/08sep_radioactivemoon">material</a> .  Even the very reliable Omega Speedmaster watch, which with the consent of NASA is provided to all astronauts, did not survive the walk on the Moon.  During the second launch, one of the watch's crystals broke and astronaut Dave Scott had to put on his spare Bulova watch.  The real reason for the breakdown is unknown (it could be just an accident), but this once again proves that not every earthly device will withstand being in space. <br><br>  But of course, equipment designed specifically for space exploration can withstand even more severe conditions.  Annually, NASA selects promising <a href="http://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/gadget-master/gadget-in-extremis/gadget-extremis-gadgets-space-nasa-chooses-2014-06/">projects</a> as part of Innovative Advanced Concepts. <br><br>  In 2014, support was received, including Steven Oleson from the NASA research center in Cleveland.  He believes that the unique hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn‚Äôs satellite Titan need to be explored with the help of a ‚Äúsubmarine‚Äù boat, since the most interesting things can be hidden at depth.  But compared to earthly submarines, the apparatus on Titan will have at least one advantage - it will not have to float to the surface to reach the connection, because, unlike water, the hydrocarbon transmits radio waves.  Send such a boat on Titan plan in the 2040s. <br><br>  In 2016, among the selected projects, there are still several <a href="http://newatlas.com/nasa-niac-2016/42766/">vehicles</a> capable of working effectively in space.  For example, a multipurpose lightweight planetary probe for extreme reconnaissance and locomotion conditions (Javid Bayandor from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute) and a powerful research probe for use on Venus (Ratnakumar Bugga) from NASA's Pasadena laboratory.  A complete list of all funded projects can be found <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/NIAC_funded_studies.html">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3f/2ea/142/f3f2ea142ae44930b55052376d8b0369.jpg"><br>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ideonexus/">ryan somma</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Is there interplanetary internet? </h2><br>  The interplanetary communications system was established: for example, in 2013 we received about 25 TB of data from one of the satellites in Mars orbit (MRO).  But the data transfer rate is 5.2 MB / s, so sending scientific information takes 7.5 hours, and one shot from the HiRISE camera takes 1.5 hours.  That, in principle, by space standards is not so bad.  (See ‚ÄúData Dilemma‚Äù in the <a href="http://eu.mouser.com/applications/communications-deep-space/">source</a> ).  But as you know, there is no limit to perfection. <br><br>  The Russian side carried out <a href="http://www.roscosmos.ru/19038/">tests</a> of a laser communication system (SLS) for transmitting data from the Earth to the Russian segment of the ISS and back in 2012.  The system consisted of an onboard laser communication terminal (BTLS) on the ISS and a ground-based laser terminal (NLT) at the Arkhyz station in the North Caucasus. <br><br>  It was possible to achieve a speed of 125 MB / s and transfer 2.8 GB of data.  However, nothing is known about the results of the study and the planned second stage: the data was either classified or the experiment was suspended, the authors of CosmoBlog said.  (For more information about the laser communication system, read <a href="http://www.kosmos4you.ru/texnika/kosmicheskie-korabli/novye-texnologii/sistema-kosmicheskoj-lazernoj-svyazi.html">here</a> in the chapter "Experiments on the implementation of space laser communication"). <br><br>  Perhaps for this reason, the network is much less materials about Russian research and development, especially in the field of communication in space.  But, perhaps, Roskosmos sets other priorities for itself (a list of which can be found <a href="http://ruxpert.ru/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581">here</a> ).  By the way, the development of interstellar communication is listed there only in the section ‚ÄúRemote prospects of cosmonautics‚Äù. <br><br>  In 2013, successful <a href="http://inhabitat.com/why-wi-fi-is-faster-on-the-moon-than-at-your-local-coffee-shop/">tests</a> of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) two-way laser communication system were carried out on the moon.  Data is transmitted using a short-pulse laser and satellites.  At the ground station in New Mexico are 4 telescopes, each of which transmits the encrypted data by infrared pulses.  A satellite in the lunar orbit receives signals and transmits them to the moon using optical and electrical impulses. <br><br>  At the same time, NASA scientists managed to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/llcdfactsheet.final_.web_.pdf">increase</a> data transfer speed 4800 times (compared to the previous similar project) - it was 622 Mbit / s.  The speed of the return signal from the ground station was 20 Mbit / s, which is also quite good, considering the distance at which the device is located - 385,000 km from the Earth‚Äôs surface.  This technology has increased the quality of transmitted images and 3D broadcasts from outer space, regardless of weather conditions. <br><br>  The success of laser technology has contributed to the development of research on communication capabilities in outer space.  So, the NASA team plans to manufacture and fully test a laser communication device prototype by the end of 2017, which will be used in the Discovery mission in 2020. <br><br>  The DSOC optical communication system in deep space can function from asteroids close to Earth to Jupiter, the data transfer rate from a distance of 63 million kilometers (from Mars) will be 250 Mb / s, and the weight of the device will be only 25 kg with a power of 75 W.  The weight of today's system on the lunar orbital probe is 60 kg with a power of 120 watts.  (See ‚ÄúLasers to deep space and beyond‚Äù at <a href="http://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_27/may_2016/features/space-based_laser_communications_break_threshold/">source</a> ). <br><br>  Data transmission today is carried out at even greater distances: for example, <a href="http://eu.mouser.com/applications/communications-deep-space/">Voyagers</a> , launched back in 1977, continue to send images to Earth, being from it at a distance of 193 billion kilometers.  Receipt of these signals is possible thanks to NASA's remote space communications network (DSN).  But modern technologies will bring the exchange of data between objects in space to a completely different level: it is possible that the connection speed will actually become space and we will be able to get online access to the cameras on the Mars rovers and vehicles exploring other planets. <br><br>  <i>What else do we write in the first blog about corporate IaaS:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-iaas-%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">Cloud services: experience of using IaaS by Russian companies</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/x-as-a-services-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3">X-as-a-services: how not to get bogged down in the abbreviations of cloud services</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585-2016-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D1%258E%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">At the 2016 Olympics using cloud technology</a> </li></ul><br>  <i>And in our blog on Habr√©:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/315310/">How cloud technologies change the world of sports</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/314592/">‚ÄúA bit about platforms‚Äù: Backend-as-a-Service</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/312044/">IaaS Digest: Introducing Virtual Infrastructure</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315314/</a></p>
