  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Network in law</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The concept of "Internet" will soon appear in the basic law of the Russian Federation.  More precisely, it has already appeared - in the bill on Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information adopted by the State Duma on June 28.  This bill will replace the current federal law ‚ÄúOn Information, Informatization and Protection of Information‚Äù, which was introduced in 1995. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLaws in the information sphere were adopted in the second half of the 1990s and no longer correspond to the current state of the information society,‚Äù State Duma Speaker Boris Gryzlov comments on the adoption of the bill.  - In addition, the current law in some matters is in conflict with the later legislative acts, including the Civil Code of the Russian Federation.  Together with the name of the law, where the term ‚Äúinformatization‚Äù is replaced by the well-established term ‚Äúinformation technologies,‚Äù its essence has changed to a large extent. ‚Äù <br><br>  Boris Gryzlov noted the need to develop the Russian-speaking segment of the Network for the successful entry of the country into the global information space: "Therefore, the new edition of the law provides for the creation of conditions for the effective use of the Internet and other information and telecommunication networks."

      At the same time, the Chairman of the State Duma drew attention to the importance of developing information technologies for the implementation of national projects: ‚ÄúThus, one of the tasks of the priority national project‚Äú Education ‚Äùis to provide all Russian schools with access to the Internet.‚Äù <br>  The problems of modern electronic documentation are also reflected in the new version of the law: ‚ÄúThe electronic document and the digital signature are introduced in the legal field and will be recognized as equivalent in civil law relations to a handwritten signature and document exchange,‚Äù said Boris Gryzlov. <br><br>  The law is promised before the end of the current session.  Of the 213 amendments proposed by the profile committee, 90 were adopted in the second reading. In particular, it provoked a lively discussion, but the proposal to impose a ban on the use of foreign computer programs at strategically important state-owned enterprises was not approved.  ‚ÄúLeonid Reiman warned the legislators that the complete rejection of imported software could lead to disruption of the systems used in government agencies, the Emergencies Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs,‚Äù <a href="http://www.abnews.ru/open_news.php%3Fnews_id%3D33260">reports</a> Business News Agency.  - Deputies had to agree, but the developers of the law went to meet them.  The minister promised that the government will return to this issue in the fall.  Following the meeting in the Duma, it was decided to create an ad hoc committee that will work out a detailed study of the distribution of foreign programs. ‚Äù <br><br>  On the other hand, the state information systems themselves after the final adoption of the law will have to work both in Russian and in the national languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the subjects of the federation.  Citizens will be able to access information on the activities of federal and local authorities free of charge and without explanation. <br><br>  It seems important to be the provision of the bill, according to which the access providers and hosting providers are removed the responsibility for the storage and distribution of prohibited information by their clients. <br><br>  At the same time, the draft law provides for mandatory identification of persons using information networks in business activities.  The recipient of electronic messages in the Russian Federation has the right to make a check to identify the sender.  The sender itself is obliged to provide the recipient of the opportunity to refuse information sent to them.  Thus, spamming, according to the bill, is officially beyond the scope of legitimate activities. <br><br>  In general, for the information technology sector, whose growth in the past few years is no less than 30% per year, the new law will be favorable - this is the opinion of Leonid Reiman, the Minister of Information Technology and Communications of the Russian Federation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4119/</a></p>
