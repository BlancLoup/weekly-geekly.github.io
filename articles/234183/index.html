But the Landing owner‚Äôs view is often ‚Äúblurred‚Äù, and he does not notice the elementary mistakes and shortcomings of his brainchild, at such moments constructive criticism is necessary.  Therefore, we decided to share the material of Amanda Durepos, where dozens of landing pages are subjected to merciless analysis by independent experts. <br><br>  There is no doubt that the effective criticism of landing pages - targeted selling pages - these are harsh comments that do not spare the pride of the landing page creators.  But a little bit of ‚Äúpain‚Äù for the benefit - for the sake of efficiency of the selling page - on the part of optimization experts <b>can give more than long hours of A / B testing and marketing research</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Below - many applicants for the title of the worst landing month. <br><br>  For all the 400 brave men who sent their landings to the harsh and merciless review of the recent release of the fighting club of critics of the landing pages <a href="http://www.pagefights.com/">Page Fights</a> , a small dose of public flogging is in the order of things.  As judges of the most unforgettable round of the battle landings - Joanna Vib, Oli Gardner and Pip Laya.

      Many participants for the slightest flaws in their landing pages were smashed to smithereens, but they left with a huge load of invaluable experience in optimizing conversion.  A video of ruthless criticism can be viewed here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qSHh0ya53M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh5zmxkPJMooTUwAeYA82Ig7w5mPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Below we have collected concentrated wisdom from Joanna, Pipa and Oli so that you can <b>compare your own landing page with the participants of the battle and draw conclusions.</b> <br><br>  Before you push your own child into the ring in the next episode, make sure that you have not made the mistakes listed below that kill your conversion. <br><br>  <u><b>5 conversion killers, due to which your landing page will be disqualified</b></u> <br><br>  <b>1. The subscription form is the cause of the conflict.</b> <br><br>  Although the design of the <a href="http://www.snapagency.com/seo-minneapolis/">Snap Agency Landing</a> is quite <a href="http://www.snapagency.com/seo-minneapolis/">trendy</a> , every judge did not fail to throw a stone in their subscription form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/094/7c4/125/0947c41258414760aeeb16501217faed.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ To begin with, Pip said that he did not see the connection between the page proposal and the call to action.  The subtitle promises more traffic and revenue, and the button encourages visitors to send a request for SEO optimization.  This discrepancy can <b>confuse potential customers</b> and reduce the chances that they fill out the form. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Oli added that the title of the form, if read it separately, is also confusing: ‚ÄúWe are not your supplier, we are your partner.  Find out if we are suitable for each other. ‚Äù  You must explain to people the purpose of the form before asking to fill it out.  " <b>Your form should be such that it could be left at all the only element on the page, and it would still work,</b> " - concluded the judge. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Joanna asked why the form has two fields, if one of them is optional: ‚ÄúForms can be useful to find out something about a potential client, but <b>if half the fields of the form are optional, you need to seriously consider whether they are all on this page</b> ‚Äù . <br><br>  Styler also had a <a href="http://quotes.styler.co.uk/">‚Äúlicked‚Äù landing page</a> , but Oli thought that their registration form was too florid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d9/f51/aa3/2d9f51aa39344153b342fe69d3972142.jpg"><br><br>  Oli noticed that ‚ÄúFill out the form in 30 seconds‚Äù is written below, but there is no such form.  He also criticized Styler's decision to segment his customers immediately on the selling page - all the more so since the background depicts a man.  He explained that this <b>adds an extra step when filling out the form,</b> and it may seem to women that they did not go there. <br><br>  Oli suggested an option that can increase conversion: <br><br>  ‚ÄúRemove user filter by gender from landing page.  Better use segmentation in advertising. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2. Social approval has the opposite effect.</b> <br><br>  Although posting positive user feedback or company recommendation as an expression of social approval is considered normal practice for high conversion sales pages, many contestants were not able to implement this element effectively. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.crengland.me/company-over-the-road/">CR England Landing</a> contained a note that the real photos of their employees were not used in the design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/98d/881/b0098d88130b4de9a076cbfb00445ea2.png"><br><br>  The note is placed in the upper right corner and reads: "Recommendations are PRESENT, but the photos are replaced to protect the privacy of customers."  According to Pip, it sows doubts about the reality of the recommendations: ‚ÄúIf an employee is proud of his work in his company, he will not hide his face‚Äù. <br><br>  For Joanna, the recommendations seemed unconvincing.  And together with fake photos, it seems to her, it <b>will be strange if they do not lead to a negative social effect for the page.</b> <br><br>  In the new version of the landing, there are no notes anymore: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/4a2/ca6/c344a2ca643c4df099066a0eaf5f8aa2.jpg"><br><br>  Another example of dubious recommendations was found on the Styler landing page, where some mysterious award was said: ‚ÄúBecome stylish with the award-winning client service Tailor‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70a/f6e/b20/70af6eb2094b4208879268821fc47a61.png"><br><br>  For judges, this slogan raised doubts about the legitimacy of the award, as well as the suspicion whether it was not an invention, and the phrase was invented in a desperate attempt to earn the respect of society. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWho rewarded them?  Mom? ‚ÄùOlivia Roat is interested. <br><br>  And finally, Snap Agency.  They have some ambiguous badges drawn on the landing page, about which it is not said anywhere why they are needed. <br><br>  Speaking of the badge above the inscription Google Analytics (picture below), Oli said: "They, like, certified something, but it is impossible to read what it is."  The judges agreed that, out of context, <b>incomprehensible badges only occupy a valuable landing area and only further undermine the credibility of the page.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a7/224/81d/5a722481dc4048d6b551c35620150c67.png"><br><br>  Which brings us to the next conversion killer ... <br><br>  <b>3. This page is not credible.</b> <br><br>  You can go all out in an attempt to create a landing page with a beautiful design, all of which is conversion-oriented, but only one element to which you have not paid attention can seriously harm how much your page will be trusted.  Fortunately for contestants, most of these ‚Äútrust killers‚Äù can be quickly fixed. <br><br>  Landing <a href="http://www.gopaisa.com/free-flipkart-paytm-v1">Go Paisa</a> has a cumbersome registration form, at the end of it is placed a simple arithmetic task, which should protect against spam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/542/bd7/839/542bd78392d2458588568e10ab85619c.png"><br><br>  This caused questions for two reasons: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ An additional step reduces the likelihood that a potential customer will fill out a form. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Captchas and other anti-test tests <b>drive thoughts of spam into the heads of your potential customers and reduce the level of trust in your proposal ... and, in the end, annoy people.</b> <br><br>  And that's it. <br><br>  Full version of landing page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40b/1af/33c/40b1af33c424410eb3b59c6d4e5243f5.jpg"><br><br>  Looking at the <a href="http://magento2.eboundhost.com/free-special-for-magento-go-customers/">eBoundHost landing page</a> , Joanna noticed that the location of the logo at the junction of the blue and black backgrounds creates the feeling that the design has gone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/391/a5a/fb8/391a5afb83d44ff9a047abb4caacc6e7.png"><br><br>  Trying to be as tactful as possible, Joanna explained that <b>little things can play a big role when it comes to the negative impact on page credibility and conversion.</b>  One of the viewers commented thinly: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI liked the point of view of how design creates and destroys trust ... If your site looks bad or as if it's broken, you won‚Äôt trust you.‚Äù <br><br>  Landing in the full version looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ee/ca2/b98/6eeca2b98e0f4994b4cfcdafd6ce7d42.jpg"><br><br>  Approximately the same emotion causes <a href="http://marketing.tagteamdesign.com/1499-website-design-lp/">Landing Tag Team Design.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85b/343/0e1/85b3430e1cbf4bbf8179e5c5d6cebb71.png"><br><br>  For a company that specializes in web design, this page, according to the judge, is not credible, the effect is approximately the same as in the case of a shoemaker without shoes: if this is the design of their own page, what will the design of their client page be?  And <b>without a portfolio in which one could see their various versions of page designs, the service does not look very solid and authoritative.</b> <br><br>  The website design of a company that designs for other websites should not be bad. <br><br>  And Pip poured cold water on them like that: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI made my very first website in 1994.  He was like this.  Any $ 30 theme from Themeforest looks better. ‚Äù <br><br>  To top it all, Page Fights, the producer of fighting club of critics of landings, said that although the company advertises responsive web design, it is far from this level on their own website. <br><br>  <b>4. Call to Action (CTA) does not inspire any action.</b> <br><br>  Although Oli praised the <a href="http://www.qcmakeupacademy.com/free-brochure/">QC Makeup Academy Landing</a> , saying that here is the best title of all the judges have seen so far, but let the guys down from heaven to earth, saying that <b>their call to action is lost in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãother possible actions.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20e/f41/a24/20ef41a2458a45159e28bdb826b69518.png"><br><br>  Oli estimated the attraction ratio at least as 60: 1 and suggested removing navigation and the ‚Äúbasement‚Äù altogether in order to raise this ratio closer to the ideal 1: 1. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe ratio of what you can do to what you have to do is too large,‚Äù is an excellent explanation of the meaning of the call to action! <br><br>  Peep, however, said that the call to action at Myagi landing inspired even less.  By itself, the inscription on the button ‚ÄúTrain 50 employees now and for free‚Äù is not so terrible.  The problem is that this <b>call did not coincide with the heading</b> "Increase sales with the help of more educated employees." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/122/649/a90/122649a90c84476bb7f24ba63071f94f.png"><br><br>  It seemed to Pip that the push that gave the headline died after the visitor saw the call-to-action button that promised to ‚Äútrain the staff‚Äù.  This call to action is not at all impressive and does not make potential customers want to press a button. <br><br>  The new <a href="https://myagi.com/">Myagi landing page</a> looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8e/a97/5d4/c8ea975d4202444a932a007ca26a21b4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. The unique value proposition is not clearly expressed.</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that this unique value proposition is one of the five main elements of a high conversion landing page, fuzzy UVP pops up on the pages of the battle participants constantly. <br><br>  For example, it seems to Pip that Snap Agency's unique value proposition is lost in the stream of keywords: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI read this text and say that it is not written for people.  He is full of keywords, ‚Äùthe judge said. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/945/619/318/945619318e1044fa836e215783fe23c4.jpg"><br><br>  Joanna agrees and pays attention to the headline: ‚ÄúSEO Services in Minneapolis: Get traffic.  Increase profits.  Although it is meaningful (and, most likely, SEO-optimized), Joanna believes that it doesn‚Äôt say at all about how Snap Agency stands out from the rest: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe title may be somewhat meaningful, but the rest of the text does not reveal it.  It doesn‚Äôt say anything more and doesn‚Äôt convince you that you‚Äôre the best SEO service in Minneapolis, ‚ÄùJoanna <br><br>  In her opinion, the <b>title and the disclosing text should clearly express the unique value proposition of</b> Snap Agency. <br><br>  One should not underestimate clarity, the message should be clear. <br><br>  Similarly, the <a href="http://get.opentopic.com/whatiscontentmarketing/">Open Topic Landing</a> lacks clarity as to who their service is aimed at: Peep immediately asked, ‚ÄúWhat do they offer at all?‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a25/808/1c9/a258081c98f4473286d0c7c0e1b21218.png"><br><br>  Joanna supported: ‚ÄúIf I create content, why should I be interested in‚Äú What is content marketing? ‚Äù  I already know that. ‚Äù  She believes that the Open Topic page does not convince her of the need to get acquainted with the proposed materials, and it is very likely that potential clients do too. <br><br>  Landing Myagi jury did not find a unique value proposition at all, although it may be hidden somewhere in the video.  Pip cited data that only 10% of users watch videos on landings, so this is a serious problem for those who choose video as the main carrier of UVP. <br><br>  Pip believes that any landing should clearly and clearly speak about the usefulness of the product or service, even if the visitor does not watch the video.  Of course, you should always test what your audience will perceive better, and the video should complement the landing page text. <br><br>  <b><i>"Only 10% of users watch videos on landings, so the text on your page should speak for themselves."</i></b> <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/15-unforgiving-landing-page-critiques-joanna-wiebe/">http://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/15-unforgiving-landing-page-critiques-joanna-wiebe/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234183/</a></p>
