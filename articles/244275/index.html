His mentions have already met on Habr√©.  Immediately give the link - the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/kivalin.net/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0As1joqDAfz6UdHhhQ3lMZ0oyZXZRRGFQZXdHTGZEYnc%26usp%3Ddrive_web">document</a> . <br><br><h4>  History of creation </h4><br>  In March 2013, I had a prototype of a single mobile game that I wanted to show publishers.  A quick search showed that if any lists of publishers can still be found, then the real feedback on cooperation - the cat cried.  Well, since no one has done this yet, why not me?  With such thoughts, I began to knock on all familiar developers who worked with a particular publisher, asking me to comment on the collaboration.  Many agreed only on anonymous terms (which is understandable, because the contracts were still in full swing).  After collecting the first few reviews, it was decided to open the document to anyone interested in editing and try to popularize it.  This brought some success, now in the document reviews on cooperation with almost 50 publishers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Editing close </h4><br>  At some point, the document was lit up on dtf.ru, which gave rise to turbulent turbulence in the comments.  Up to the fact that they called the specific names of producers with very impartial characteristics.  Went a total war in the comments, reviews were deleted, edited by other people, and so on.  I had to make a volitional decision - to close the possibility of editing, and roll back the document a day ago. <br><br><h4>  Reviews through comments </h4><br>  It is clear that without development any knowledge base will quickly become obsolete.  Especially in such a rapidly developing area as mobile games.  Instead of open editing, a mechanism has been proposed for adding new reviews and publishers through comments.  This saved the accumulated data, but the flip side of the coin was that the appearance of new information in the document dropped to almost zero.  Honestly, I still do not understand what it is connected with.

    <h4>  New attempt </h4><br>  The document now has 3 tabs: <br><ul><li>  Publishers </li><li>  Samizdat </li><li>  Reviewers </li></ul><br>  Sites with reviews added personally, after the day spent on parsing all sorts of lists.  312 revisers, the information was collected six months ago, but, in general, the list is quite complete. <br><br>  Publishers, as I said, have added about 50. Also very good.  But, I am sure that there are still a lot of people in Habr√© who can replenish the base. <br><br>  But with the section "samizdat" complete trouble.  And for me now, and for the majority of indie who could not get close to a good publisher, this is the most important information.  Actually, I am now launching my new application - sex forfeits, and for the first time I decided to invest some money in promotion.  And where to invest most effectively a small amount of information is practically absent.  Therefore, I suggest that all those who independently launch their products on mobile OSs, while having modest budgets, share information.  How much did the publication cost on such a resource, how many installations did it bring, etc. <br><br><h4>  Access is open </h4><br>  I rediscovered the opportunity for anyone to edit a document.  I hope that this will bring much more benefit than harm.  Of course, ideally, bring all this to the wiki format.  If anyone wants to arrange it - feel free to pick up all the information and transfer it to the normal version. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244275/</a></p>
