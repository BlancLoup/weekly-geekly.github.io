  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rospechat sponsors alternative VIM and RIF?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2006, the Federal Law <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2005/07/28/goszakaz.html">‚ÄúOn placing orders for the supply of goods, performance of works, and provision of services for state and municipal needs‚Äù has</a> been in effect in our country.  Reading this law, as well as entering its name on the first attempt, is not an easy job, so I‚Äôll formulate the main idea here: the state‚Äôs procurement process of goods and services for its needs should be open so that all potentially interested suppliers can offer their goods, but State - choose the best offer with the best price. <br><br>  Even an event as significant for Runet as the <a href="http://www.internetmarafon.ru/">All-Russian Internet Marathon 2010</a> cannot avoid a competitive fate if the state decides to shed golden rain from the budget (that is, ours with you) money on its organizers. <br><br>  The state, represented by Rospechat, decided that the marathon could not be avoided, the <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D683061">competition for the right to prepare and conduct it</a> was announced on February 11 with the deadline for accepting applications on March 16.  But on February 17, Rospechat did not withstand the intrigue and <a href="http://www.fapmc.ru/news/agency/2010/02/item9247.html">announced</a> (the text was removed from the Rospechat website, but the <a href="http://74.125.77.132/search%3Fq%3Dcache:1oTJLhb1ctAJ:www.fapmc.ru/print/news/agency/2010/02/item9247.html%2B%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%2B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%2B%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%2B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25A0%25D0%259E%25D0%25A6%25D0%2598%25D0%25A2%2B%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%258F%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%2B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%2B%2522%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%2B%2522%2Bsite:fapmc.ru%26cd%3D1%26hl%3Dru%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dru">copy remained in the search engines archives</a> ): the marathon with the support of Rospechat is held by ROCIT.

      The competition for state support continued, as it were, suggesting two scenarios: <br>  - In March, it will be officially announced who won the Rospechat competition for organizing a marathon organized by ROCIT; <br>  - someone (not ROCIT) will win the Rospechat competition, and we will have a holiday - just two All-Russian Internet marathons in 2010. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, let's fantasize which scenario is more likely?  More boldly, the correct answer is already known, but you will not have anything for the wrong assumption, the budget money will still go off the budget, is it all the same, whose jacket has that pocket sewn on? <br><br>  I suspect that most of you, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ifap_ru/81625.html">like myself</a> , have not guessed the right answer.  Three applications from organizations that are fiercely fighting for the right to receive support for the marathon were submitted to the competition: RAEC, ROCITA and ArtStyle Media LLC.  So what if the legal address is the same for everyone, and the names of the managers coincide ‚Äúup to the third decimal place‚Äù, no one said that three heads of the Serpent Gorynych cannot participate in the competition, each as an independent participant. <br><br>  You will laugh, but it was not ROCIT that was named the winner of the competition at all, but not even an LLC, which now, apparently, will have to organize a second marathon, but Rospechat to announce that both are being held with its support: one with a financial one, the second with just the support like blessing. <br><br>  If you are not yet tired of reading about the entertaining adventures of the budget money allocated by Rospechat for the benefit of Runet, there is a no less entertaining story connected not with the All-Russian Internet marathon, but with the Russian Internet Forum. <br><br>  Rospechat also <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D686723">by competition</a> (and how else), in which the same three independent participants took fierce participation, allocated funds for RIF-2010, about which every runet is already known: ROCIT has organized it for many years in a row.  But - surprise - the same LLC became the winner of the Rospechat contest. <br><br>  There is one more small, but very piquant detail in the RIF story: the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ifap_ru/75689.html">condition for the relevant competition</a> (and, accordingly, the receipt of the state book) was free access to the forum, and ROCIT announced that from this year its participants will have to buy admission tickets. <br><br>  Of course, we understand that there is no ugly collision here: you will need to purchase tickets to the forum according to ROCIT, and to the forum with the same name, according to Artstayl Media LLC - in no case. <br><br>  There is, however, a third scenario, which I did not mention earlier: a large-caliber device will be placed on all the existing inconsistencies and our suspicions about them, the VIM and RIF will traditionally be held in a single copy, and next year they will announce new ‚Äúcontests "With a previously known result. <br><br>  Let's fantasize again, and imagine that we are not satisfied with this treatment of our money.  Not just not satisfied, but we are ready to do something to prevent this from happening, and moreover it does not happen year after year.  What will be fantasies? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88505/</a></p>
