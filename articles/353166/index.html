Agree, being a student is one of the craziest moments in the life of each of us.  It was then that we meet the most loyal friends, believe in incredible ideas and are confident that to become the second Bill Gates is just to spit.  Every year we support all these ideas and hold one of the brightest student events around the world - the <a href="http://imaginecup.ru/">Imagine Cup</a> ! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nb/t1/xc/nbt1xck4_rpyxcy_uzo9m63myvq.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Under the cut, you will be able to recharge ideas and learn about the projects that are presented this year, as well as about the very astronaut who makes incredibly beautiful pictures from the ISS.  In addition to student teams, the event will feature many interesting people, one way or another connected with technology.  To participate, <a href="https://www.microsoftevents.com/profile/form/index.cfm%3FPKformID%3D0x3908282abcd">do not forget to register</a> (the number of places is limited), and if you can not come - see <a href="https://aka.ms/imcup2018_live">online translation</a> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Small preface </h2><br><p>  Almost every year, our teams win prizes in various categories at the international finals, and, importantly, continue to develop their projects after participating in the competition.  Among the participants of the past years, you will find successful businessmen who open accelerators and enter the Chinese market, create their own game development studios, help the visually impaired to navigate in space, get into Forbes and tops of mobile app stores (like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OVIVOgame/">OVIVO</a> , recently released on mobile platforms, winner of the Imagine Cup 2015. </p><br><h2>  What will be interesting? </h2><br><ul><li>  Presentations of the 16 best student projects, including homemade HoloLens, made by students from Nizhny Novgorod, a virtual physics laboratory from Moscow State University, music in VR and much more. </li><li>  Fascinating inspirational lectures from people like Sergey Ryazantsev (hero of Russia, pilot-cosmonaut), Dmitry Shostko (MTS), Alexander Lukichev (DVR), Alexander Baulin (Forbes), Maxim Karakulov (Habrahabr), Sergey Tsyss (Mechanium) and many others. </li><li>  The exhibition, in which, for example, a non-anthropomorphic robot "astronaut pillow" from the Mechanium company will be presented for the first time. </li><li>  Free Azure Certification </li></ul><br><h2>  The teams you will see this year </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/fs/ka/nffskaixfrxewtvmki-_mtxga2g.jpeg" align="left" width="120">  <strong>Team ‚ÄúBUTTON Team‚Äù // MIREA, Moscow // Project: ‚ÄúBUTTON‚Äù</strong> </p><br><p>  BUTTON Team - the team is developing a b2b &amp; b2c platform that allows companies to easily integrate Blockchain into their products for the market.

The guys collected an experimental setup, which allows to obtain the reflection and transmission spectra of coffee.  Analyzing spectra using machine learning approaches, they are able to determine the acidity, bitterness, strength and density of coffee.  With the help of their sensor and advisory system, the barista can make the perfect cup of coffee for everyone. </blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nu/av/ve/nuavvewgf7pm21hqlvmc5nbkm7k.jpeg" align="left" width="120">  <strong>The ‚ÄúEasy Talk‚Äù team // IST FGBOU IN "RGUTIS" / ITA SFedU / ƒåVUT, Moscow, Taganrog, Prague // Project: "Easy Talk"</strong> </p><br><p>  The project is a real-time sign language interpreter application.

But, as a rule, such knowledge is theoretical, and when we face a problem in real life, we are nervous and panic.  This arises from the fact that we lack some kind of life experience, moreover, such situations are dangerous: they can lead to the most diverse psychological and physical disorders and even pose a danger to life, ours or someone else's.  Therefore, I had the idea to create a psychological simulator where people can put their knowledge into practice, learn about their weaknesses and peculiarities, analyze their mistakes and face their fears. </blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/h3/ex/xeh3exxuwch0dlspkletpcrjcrw.jpeg" align="left" width="120">  <strong>Team "Heavy Geeks" // MAI / HSE, Moscow // Project: "Imagine Travel"</strong> </p><br><p>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is to create a complete copy of the real world and transfer it to virtual reality.  A duet of students transferred the complete map of our planet with all countries, cities, streets and sights.  For an example of using this idea, the team implements a learning and gaming application in the style of Minecraft, to study countries, cities and sights, which will help children learn geography in their familiar surroundings.  And no, this is not just another analogue of Google Maps placed in VR.  The world here is represented by a full three-dimensional map of our planet.  Using this project, you can walk through the streets of Paris, travel from Moscow to Hong Kong, stroll around the Microsoft office in Redmond, look at the sights and much more. </p><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0m/5z/m1/0m5zm1widtjfqd5w6jvftkhkhda.jpeg" align="left" width="120">  <strong>Team "ITSS" // MAI, Moscow // Project: "Medical Assistant"</strong>

HoloAd can be embedded by third-party developers in your application or work on the device in the background.
