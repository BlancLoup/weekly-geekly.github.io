For employers and job brokers, some services are also free, some are billed.  The cost of tariffs depends on the amount of work on recruitment, which makes high-tech and high-quality JobsMarket services available even to small companies-employers and private recruiters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4246/</a></p>
