  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Massage and IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every week we give lectures on work-related topics in the office.  We invite to meet an interesting person who can tell us about something and drink tea with him, talk.  The first meeting was devoted to harm from the office lifestyle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our guest was visited by a very interesting character - freelancer Eugene.  IT guy, whose hobby is massage. <br><br>  Eugene all his adult life was fond of physiology, anatomy and other similar disciplines.  We didn‚Äôt specify all the details of him, because the goal of our meeting was to find out about massage and to understand why a person with a technical mindset suddenly finished a massage therapist in Thailand, and now this is his second salary in his <a href="http://massagegirl.org/">MG</a> salon. <br><br>  Eugene began his conversation with the fact that as a teenager he was fond of sports and programming.  And if the first passion was regarded by him as a standard for young men, the second later became for him a source of income and professional activity.  Over time, Eugene noticed that a sedentary lifestyle brings its own adjustments to your sense of self - when you are sitting at a computer in an office (or at home), the body begins to experience discomfort.  Permanent fatigue, spasms of the back, constant tension and swelling of the neck.

      Digging deeper into this topic, it became clear that this is a simple anatomy.  The back muscles, as it turned out, bear the brunt of the whole body - they can work even when a person is sleeping (if you assume the wrong position)!  As a result of rabid loads (without a change of activity) a person develops osteochandrosis - in other words, a hernia between vertebrae and nerves.  After these conclusions, Evgeny stopped believing the doctors in this question, who talked about the consequences of stress, depression, poor ecology, unhealthy diet and the like. <br><br>  Around this time, he became interested in massage, and now he helps people prevent spinal disease. <br><br>  Key thoughts from our meeting: <br><br><ul><li>  With a sedentary lifestyle, you can cripple yourself even in 25 years. </li><li>  Osteochondrosis can be the cause of bleeding in the brain. </li><li>  Back massage relaxes the muscles, and as a result, eliminates the prerequisites for osteochondrosis. </li><li>  It is advisable not to sleep on the featherbed, but on a firmer surface so that the muscles can rest.  On a soft surface, they do not feel the support and remain strained. </li><li>  It is difficult to choose a massage therapist - there are many people on the market who pretend to be masters.  The only way to check is to look like courses, and if the result will be in a few sessions, you are a good masseuse. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246727/</a></p>
