I have not seen a single phone that could be compared with him for convenience.  Unfortunately, this model has not been produced for a long time, and the development trends according to the principle ‚Äúmore megapixels, more megahertz‚Äù do not inspire hope for the appearance of such a model on the market. <br><br>  I decided to try my luck and write to Nokia CEO Stephen Elop to convey to him the idea that there is no happiness in megahertz.  It is unlikely that there will be some reason for the letter, but suddenly my soul cry will be heard? <br><br>  Under the cut - the text of the letter in Russian and English, as well as a survey on the topic ‚Äúyou would buy a Nokia 3310‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  Dear Stephen Elop.

      <br>
      Recently, a fashion has gone to chase after numbers: more pixels, more megapixels, more megahertz.  But for some reason everyone forgot that the phone (especially in the low price category) is used as a <b>tool</b> and most of the functions with which the manufacturer equips the device, only to the detriment of its usability. <br><br>  My dad has been using the Nokia 3310 for more than 10 years. I‚Äôm afraid that if the phone breaks down or he loses it, I‚Äôll have nothing to offer him in return - there are <b>no</b> phones on the market, the functionality of which would be at least as good as the 3310 functionality. Now I will explain what I'm talking about. <br><br>  I‚Äôll make a reservation right away: I‚Äôm talking only about low-end phone models designed primarily for calls and SMS.  Smartphones, which are more correctly called pocket computers, are devices of a completely different class, and I don‚Äôt consider them here. <br><br>  So.  A telephone is a tool.  The owner of the phone uses it as a phone book for storing numbers, phone calls to these numbers, as well as a clock and an alarm clock.  These are the basic functions that any device must cope with.  Please note, the 3310 has all this functionality.  And now I will show why modern models cope with these tasks <b>worse</b> than the 3310 does. <br><br>  First, the 3310 has an excellent monochrome TN-LCD display with a mirror substrate.  This means that it can not be lit in the sun - the sunlight will only enhance its contrast.  The sun does not even need to turn on the backlight.  Now look at modern phones: they all have a color TFT-LCD display without a mirror substrate, and they need a backlight to display the picture.  In the sun, the contrast drops so much that it is almost impossible to see something on a bright sunny day.  And the 3310 allows you to do this without problems, moreover, you can even watch time on it without touching the unlock keys!  Please note, the color display appeared in the budget phone only because of fashion and marketing.  It does not carry <b>any</b> functional load and only interferes.  But fashion dictates: "there must be a color display."  The result: the Nokia 105 display is worse than the 3310, released many years ago. <br><br>  Secondly, the 3310 has only 4 control keys (not counting the numbers): a soft key, a C key (back / erase), and two arrow keys to select menu items.  The off key at the end of the phone is rarely used and does not interfere.  Now let's take a look at the Nokia 105, this model has as many as 8 keys: two soft keys, ‚Äúpick up the phone‚Äù, ‚Äúhang up‚Äù and 4 navigation keys.  Some models also have a central (middle) soft-key, for a total of 9 keys.  Do you think so many keys are really useful?  Not.  Take a look at the picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d7/391/4aa/2d73914aa6048176922bdcddb75e8afe.png"><br><br>  - Two arrows <b>enough</b> to navigate the menu.  Pressing them is much more convenient than trying to get into the rim of the 4-position rectangle of the Nokia 105 (and in the case of the Nokia 206 the task is complicated - you need not to touch the central soft-key). <br>  - One soft-keys <b>missing</b> .  The user does not have to think about which soft key to press to select a menu item.  One softkey always means either ‚ÄúChoice‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue to do what I did.‚Äù  There is no need to read and be aware of what is written above it.  And when the soft keys are two or three, you have to read the inscriptions and peer at the screen to understand what they are doing.  Believe me, when typing SMS it is much more convenient several times in a row without looking to press a single soft key, than to think which of the three soft keys to press to send. <br>  - There is no need for the keys "Pick up" / "Hang up".  The answer to the incoming call can still be carried out with one soft key, and exit from the menu with the "C" key.  Thus, the presence of the "pick up" and "hang up" keys not only does not increase usability, but, on the contrary, loads up the interface and makes the user think more about which key to press. <br><br>  Just think: a modern phone makes it necessary to use more actions than was required several years ago for the same operation.  And you call it progress? <br><br>  Thus, it turns out that there is not a single phone that would be able to replace the 3310. Yes, they have something useful (for example, a calendar), but the absence of a monochrome display that does not require illumination and the inconvenient jumble of control keys is too serious a flaw due to which any phone will lose 3310. <br><br>  Therefore, I suggest you think about creating a phone-successor 3310. So to say, ‚Äú3310 Reloaded‚Äù or something like that.  In the era of quad-core smartphones with FullHD-screens, the release of the updated 3310 may seem strange, but in its class of devices it will be able to overshadow almost all competitors, since it will be much more convenient to use such a phone, and the legend of the original can play a significant role in popularizing the device. <br><br>  Since the updated Nokia 3310 will be used mainly by smart people who value their time and do not pursue fashion, the design of the updated model 3310 should most likely be strict, as in Nokia X2, Nokia X6.  This is a telephone for those who understand and can explain why he needs one.  This is not a toy.  Therefore, it should look appropriate, inspire the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe serious intentions of the owner. <br><br>  A mandatory element that is not in the original device is Bluetooth for connecting a headset.  This is one of the few really useful things that progress has given us.  Bluetooth must be in every phone. <br><br>  As for the other functions (flashlight, MP3 player, IR port for remote control, etc.), their implementation is appropriate only if it does not affect the convenience of using the phone and does not destroy the very essence of the revival of the Nokia 3310 model. This, I recall, in the following: <br>  - control of four keys: one soft-key, key "C" and two arrows. <br>  - monochrome TN-LCD display with a mirror substrate.  No color TFT displays.  Alternatively, you can consider a monochrome E-Ink display, but only if the response time is sufficient for comfortable use. <br><br>  We have long been living in a world ruled by marketers, not common sense.  I think it's time to take the first step to correct the situation. <br><br>  I hope I am available to conveyed to you my thought.  If you want to clarify something or ask a question - write to my email address.  I am pleased to take part in the conversation. <br><br>  - Roman Shuvalov. </blockquote><br><br>  The same in English.  Translated, as managed, do not judge strictly.  For comments on grammar (in PM) I will be grateful. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Common sense versus marketeers.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Reviving of Nokia 3310</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote> Subject: Common sense versus marketeers.  Reviving of Nokia 3310 <br><br>  Dear Stephen Elop. <br><br>  In recent years we have seen more fashion, more megapixels, more megahertz.  But it wasn‚Äôt the phone, but it wasn‚Äôt the phone. <br><br>  My father uses Nokia 3310 for more than 10 years.  At this moment there is no need for a Nokia 3310. what i'm talking about. <br><br>  Note: I consider only phone calls and sending / receiving short messages.  I don't consider smartphones here, because they are completely different category of mobile devices. <br><br>  So.  Phone is a tool.  Phone for phone storing phone numbers, phone clock, alarm clock.  This is a phone that must have.  Note that Nokia 3310 can provide this functionality to WORSE than 3310 can do it. <br><br>  First.  3310 has a great monochrome TN-LCD screen with reflective substrate.  Cannot be blinded in the sun.  There is no need for the backlight in the sun.  Now look at modern phones.  TFT-LCD screen.  It is impossible to make it out.  And the 3310 doesn‚Äôt have the keys!  It‚Äôs not a problem.  But fashion dictates: ‚Äúphones must have color screen‚Äù.  As a result, the Nokia 105 has been worse. <br><br>  Second.  3310 has only 4 control keys (apart from the number keys): softkey, "C" key (back / erase) and two arrows.  It is used rarely and doesn‚Äôt disturb.  Now look at the Nokia 105, it has as many keys as two keys: two softkeys, ‚Äúanswer call‚Äù, ‚Äúhang up‚Äù and 4 navigational keys.  Some phones (Nokia 206 and many others) have one more softkey at the center, 9 keys total.  What is really useful?  No.  Look at the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17f/248/0fc/17f2480fc0eda15c234e3c9ba602b7fc.png"><br><br>  - Two arrows are ENOUGH to navigate the menu.  With the Nokia 206, it‚Äôs even more convenient to use the pad. <br>  - One softkey is ENOUGH.  He should press.  One softkey always mean ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue doing that I'm doing‚Äù.  There is no need to read the label above this key.  This is a list of softkeys.  Believe me, after typing ‚ÄúI should press‚Äù. <br>  - There is absolutely NO NEED for ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù and ‚ÄúHang up‚Äù / ‚ÄúReject‚Äù keys.  The 3310's softkey is a softkey, and there is a 3310-s "C" key.  The ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù and ‚ÄúHang Up‚Äù keys don't increase usability, but you can‚Äôt use it. <br><br>  For more than a couple of years ago, it‚Äôs not a problem.  And you call it "the progress"? <br><br>  However, it is not a phone for the Nokia 3310. phone loses the 3310. <br><br>  That's why I‚Äôm looking for a Nokia 3310. ‚Äú3310 Reloaded‚Äù or something like that.  In the age of 4-core FullHD, it‚Äôs not a problem.  In addition, the fabulosity of the original phone can take a significant part of making the phone popular. <br><br>  The Revival Nokia 3310 will be the smart fashion.  The appearance of the new 3310 should be strict, like the Nokia X2 or Nokia X6.  You can understand one thing.  It's not a toy.  That's why it must be elegant. <br><br>  3310 is a interface that is missing from the interface.  Unlike a mobile phone. <br><br>  If you‚Äôre not happy, you‚Äôll find out what you‚Äôre looking for. essence: <br>  - 4-keys control: one softkey, "C" key and two arrows. <br>  - monochrome TN-LCD screen with reflective substrate.  No TFT screens.  As an alternative, it can be used for comfort using. <br><br>  We live in a world controlled by marketeers, not common sense.  I think it‚Äôs a situation. <br><br>  I hope I described the idea good enough.  If you want to contact me at [email].  I will answer with pleasure. <br><br>  - Roman Shuvalov </blockquote></div></div><br><br>  Email sent to Stephen Elop.
