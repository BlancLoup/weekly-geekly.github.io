  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QIWI Wallet: the results of the first quarter of 2011</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first results of 2011 demonstrate that QIWI Wallet accelerates the pace of development.  The company's financial turnover in the first quarter of 2011 increased by 154% compared with the first quarter of last year, reaching 11.56 billion rubles.  The average payment grew by 63%, reaching 423 rubles, and the average replenishment - by 104%.  The number of registered users is close to 40 million, active - to 7 million. <br>  The number of Internet projects that accept payment via QIWI Wallet has reached 1,370 - an increase of more than 2.5 times.  The turnover of Internet projects has grown more than five times, exceeding 1.5 billion rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Popular Services </h5><br>  The growth leaders in the first quarter of 2011 were payment of fines and duties (Wallet users pay over 1000 traffic police fines every day in at least 77 regions of Russia), payment for purchases in online stores, repayment of loans and payments with virtual cards, remittances.  The total turnover of money transfers made by users of the Wallet in the first quarter of the year exceeded 290 million rubles. <br>  In January 2011, one of the most awaited new products appeared in QIWI Wallet - the QIWI Wallet card.  QIWI Visa Card (QVC), existing in the form of details and valid for 1 year, allows you to make purchases and payments on the Internet worldwide directly from the QIWI Wallet account.  Users appreciated the convenience of QVC: card turnover amounted to 48.6 million rubles: 12,000 cards were opened in 2 months. <br>  As for the QIWI Visa Virtual virtual card, it is also very popular among users: by the period under review, the turnover amounted to 390 million rubles. <br><br><h5>  Popular Interfaces </h5><br>  The fastest growth in turnover was demonstrated by payment applications for social networks (426%), web-site (279%) and applications for mobile platforms (210%). <br>  In early 2011, applications for the most popular Android and iPhone platforms caused the maximum interest among users.  In March, QIWI Wallet ranked first in the Android Market ranking in the ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù category.  Given the growing popularity of mobile applications, QIWI Wallet is constantly expanding their functionality and adding new features. <br>  SMS commands for simple and fast Wallet management, as well as USSD commands that allow you to top up your mobile account, even if there are no funds, are also popular among users: turnover in these categories has grown 11 times. <br><br><h5>  QIWI Wallet: more convenient </h5><br>  In the first quarter of 2011, QIWI Wallet offered users a variety of new replenishment methods, including through the Internet banking systems of Sberbank of Russia, Bank Saint Petersburg, Bank AGROPROMCREDIT, Svyaznoy Bank CJSC, ROSEVROBANK, PromServiceBank. <br>  For owners of online stores, QIWI Wallet also has some good news.  Now QIWI Wallet is integrated into ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Site Management‚Äù, OpenCart and other popular platforms.

    <h5>  QIWI Wallet: even more profitable </h5><br>  In the first quarter, commissions were reduced when paying for goods and services with bank cards of all banks.  In addition, in order to ensure the maximum security of such payments, 3DSecure technology was introduced.  The payment commission for the virtual QIWI Visa Virtual card, the millionth copy of which was released in March, has been reduced. <br>  Transfers between users' wallets are now also made without commission.  To perform the operation, you can use not only the Wallet site, mobile applications and social networking applications, but also a simple SMS command: it is enough to specify the recipient's Wallet number and the transfer amount. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117412/</a></p>
