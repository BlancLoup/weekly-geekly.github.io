I will tell you about how the elevator is designed, and you will analyze it. <br><br>  Pictures, of course, will not, they are completely unnecessary here, all technically literate people should have abstract thinking. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So.  In the 21-storey building a little less than 200 rooms.  The architecture of the building is quite complicated, so the entrance and the exit are the first three floors (the exits lead to the street, to the above-ground parking and to the adjacent shopping and entertainment center). <br>  The building is served by three elevators that have a common control unit.  And now comes the joyful moment for the geeks: <br>  On each floor there is a touch-sensitive graphic display, approaching which the passenger chooses where to go.  After the selection, the screen shows which elevator the passenger will take when the elevator arrives.  Two of the three elevators have no floor selection buttons.  There are only buttons to close the doors (to go a couple of seconds earlier), a button to hold the doors if there was a hitch with landing-landing and a button to call for help (if the first two buttons did not allow to achieve the desired result).  Of course, inside each elevator there is a floor indicator to make it clear whether it is time to exit. <br>  In the third elevator there is a full-fledged keypad, but as long as the elevator works in automatic mode, it is locked.  By entering a special code from any touch panel, you can call this elevator in service mode when it is controlled by buttons.  Usually this mode is used to transport goods when intermediate stops do not make sense. <br><br>  Not exactly sure, but it seems that the elevator is watching people boarding by changing the weight of the cabin.  If you call the elevator and do not enter it, it will stand for quite a long time, but if you enter it, the doors close in 2-3 seconds.  At the same time, if a lot of people enter the elevator, the elevator will wait until passengers ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù. <br><br>  If from the touch panel on the same floor twice to call the same elevator, then (according to my observations) the system always sends to the same elevator.  I do not know if there is a prediction of the number of passengers.  It is either not, or I could not catch the loading of the elevator for the full mass or number of people. <br><br>  Perhaps, engineering and operational system is almost perfect.  I don‚Äôt know how much this system cost and how expensive it is for systems with simpler control. <br><br>  UPD # 1: Speaking of usability and user experience.  I don‚Äôt know a single person (including myself) who could drive in this elevator for the first time in his life without help.  Whenever a person enters this building for the first time, either the person who invited him or the administrator helps him. <br>  We here now know that the screen is touch-sensitive and is waiting for a touch on it, and not, say, a tray of a magnetic keychain.  In addition, due to the <s>anti</s> - <s>vandal</s> wear-resistant design, touch screens are not very sensitive and require tangible pressure. <br><br>  UPD # 2: I do not know by what criteria the system is trying to optimize the movement of elevators.  Theoretically, this could be the waiting time of the elevator ¬± the trip time in the elevator, energy saving, saving of the elevator's resource, etc.  It would be interesting to know, but there is nobody to ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120976/</a></p>
