  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Glamor KREMLYADI" - delete</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On June 2, the publicist Dmitry Olshansky updated his personal blog on Livejournal.com (LJ) with a <a href="http://olshansky.livejournal.com/882124.html">record</a> informing him of his dismissal from <a href="http://www.russ.ru/">Russky Zhurnal</a> , an online publication highly respected among liberal intellectuals.  It was precisely “dismissal” that the incident was not named, but many have concluded that it happened.  The cause of the incident is given by Olshansky in the same place, in LiveJournal - his article “Glamor KREMLYADI”, hastily removed from the pages of the publication by the RJ leadership. <br><br>  “Glamor KREMLYADI” - emotional, even nervous pamphlet;  It tells about professional tactics and personal qualities of government political consultants.  The text contains the names of real people, but not the “villains” themselves, who the author “burns with the verb” in the first place, are named - the mentioned persons have a different role, but this specifics adds a little sharpness to the material.  In this regard, the questions: was the article filmed for censorship reasons, and its author was dismissed from “RJ” as “objectionable”? <br><br>  Clarifying the situation, we received a number of interesting opinions about what had happened, so it was decided to simply “log”, setting out the information in the order it was received.

      So, the publicist Dmitry Olshansky, referring to the removal of the article, said that “the radical decision of the leadership is connected with the fact that the text directly touched all sorts of partners and friends of this very leadership, albeit in a symbolic and not literal-surname form, and looked as a declaration of intra-administrative war. ”  On yesterday’s Radio Liberty, Olshansky announced that he was a guest columnist at RJ, that is, there was no dismissal as such. <br><br>  The publisher, Gleb Pavlovsky, to the question of “Habrakhabr” about the reason for the dismissal of Olshansky, said that he “did not dismiss”: “I took off his column with rude attacks on my friends and RJ.  He left". <br><br>  Journalist Maxim Kononenko, now the creator and author of <a href="http://www.idiot.ru/">the Idiot</a> blog, told us that the article was taken off by the head of the policy department at the request of the editor-in-chief: “I agree with the decision of the editor-in-chief — the article is simply bad.  I would not even have published this, wrapping up the author with a puzzled question: “what are you?”.  Kononenko stressed that we are not talking about any censorship - just “Olshansky once again fired”. <br><br>  Anton Nosik, the editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/">MosNews.com</a> and <a href="http://www.gazeta.kg/">Gazeta.Kg</a> , adheres to a different opinion on the article itself: “I <a href="http://www.gazeta.kg/">’ll</a> say that the author clearly owns the topic better than me.  And this insider should "cling" to the defendants of the text.  If we talk about general principles, about business "for the money to love the Motherland", about the record of those who are engaged in this business today, and about the current list of the "enemies of the people" declared by them, then I didn’t learn anything new.  Mitya gracefully left behind the narrative a hilarious episode of the struggle against the “extremists” Gusinsky, Berezovsky and Nevzlin - obviously, he did not want to look like a defender of the oligarchy.  Nevertheless, without this fresh episode, the list of bogeys, with whom the kremlyad fights for the "conventional units of patriotism", looks incomplete. " <br><br>  The situation with the “dismissal” of Dmitry Olshansky was finally clarified by <a href="http://another-kashin.livejournal.com/">Oleg Kashin</a> , the editor of the RJ policy department, who, in his own words, click the “delete” button under “Glamor kremlyadyu” and pressed: “Dmitry Olshansky was not fired and could not be fired from“ RJ ”if only because he did not work for a minute in this edition, being invited by a columnist who received a fee according to an agreement with the editors.  The Olshansky edition did not refuse the services, he himself did not declare that he stops writing for us, so I see no reason to talk about his departure from RJ. <br><br>  “The article“ Glamor kremlyad, ”continues Kashin,“ was removed from the site on the basis of a consolidated decision of the editorial board.  Technically, the “delete” button was pressed by me, and I am responsible for this decision.  The article was indeed written in an unacceptable boorish tone, and its publication was my editorial mistake.  I want to emphasize - editorial, not political. " <br><br>  “I consider the case with the article of Olshansky an extra confirmation of the democratic nature and uncensibility of the RJ - in most liberal publications, including online ones, like (to put it bluntly, the anti-Lew text in <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/">Gazeta.ru</a> ) <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/">flies</a> to the basket long before publication.” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4127/</a></p>
