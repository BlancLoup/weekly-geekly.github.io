The vacation period is over, so we are joining the work.  We work and write, you read and work too (we hope, with our help too).  Today we want to share one more case - we will tell about our cooperation with Robot Vera.  This company helps to recruit staff for those who need new personnel.  Partial (and effective) automation of the recruiting process does not negate the need to make a lot of calls.  Here we come to the aid of Vera - at Voximplant, the company automates telephone dialing to candidates. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What does automatics do in HR? </h3><br>  Robot Vera is a real assistant to the hr-manager.  It all starts with the client's task - to find a specialist in a certain area that meets a number of criteria (there is nothing unusual here - region, education, level of English, flexibility of schedule, work experience, age, gender).  Clients are provided with a cozy and minimalist office (of course, a virtual one), where a task is formed.  As soon as the order is ready, the order is given to the robot, and the search process begins. <br><br>  Vera (the voice of a woman, the name - the same, so the text below - "she") is looking for a resume on the largest sites for work.  Then it automatically processes the data on applicants whose forms are posted on such resources. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Having processed the base of the summary, Robot Vera proceeds to call.  If the call fails for some reason (the phone is disconnected, busy, a network failure), then it tries to ‚Äúget through‚Äù through other channels - for example, email.  At the discretion of the employer, the letter may contain, in addition to the job description, a link for the response, a link for the video interview and a phone number. <br><br>  As the team of Vera told us, they receive 50% of the vacancies by phone.  The remaining 50 are distributed through the remaining channels of attracting candidates - the lead-generating webpage, email.  Let's take a look at how the most efficient recruiting channel works. <br><br><h3>  <s>Winter</s> Singularity is near! </h3><br>  So, Vera calls the applicant.  If the receiver is picked up at that end, she presents herself and asks if the candidate for the vacancy wishes to receive information about the job.  If the answer is yes, the robot briefly talks about the conditions (salary, work time, the presence of cookies in the buffet) and again asks if this job is interesting to the interlocutor.  If the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù again, then Vera informs that the person-manager will call back the applicant for a detailed discussion of the conditions.  And this is just one way to talk on the phone, the easiest one.  A big plus of the system is that the question-answer algorithm can be changed, complicated or simplified. <br><br>  Spam, by the way, no.  If the candidate says that he is not looking for work, they will not call. <br><br>  During the call, Voximplant technology is involved.  Vera analyzes the call and provides a report to its customers. <br><br>  The entire telephone system of the robot is the task of Voximplant.  At the same time, the company can do whatever it wants with calls: Voximplant cloud scripts are written in JavaScript and any web developer can do complex telephony in a couple of hours.  In the team, the Faiths experiment and spin their ‚Äúown‚Äù voice synthesis.  Modularity is always good, truth is true.  Any programmer can add or remove something to the main Voximplant platform. <br><br>  With regard to voice recognition by faith, there are problems here that cannot blame either us or her.  Virtually any modern system that is engaged in speech recognition cannot cope with strong outside noises.  Driving cars, talking colleagues during a call sounds - all this is very disturbing.  So, out of 100% of calls, about 80% are successful, and 20% have problems.  In case of detection of a problem call, email-mailing comes to the rescue. <br><br>  The positive thing is that potential candidates who for some reason were not in touch during the phone call of Vera or did not see the e-mail, can contact her later, and the employer will see a response. <br><br>  And one more thing (no less positive) - with the help of Voximplant, our partner set up the processing of incoming calls in such a way that when a candidate calls back, his number is recognized and Vera tells him exactly what is intended for this person who is interested in a particular job. <br><br>  A very simplified example of how to do this: <br><br><div class="oembed"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1db862249363329df4be8b91c4f65551.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/gist-embed-b3b573358bfc66d89e1e95dbf8319c09.css"><div id="gist80387088" class="gist">

</div><br>  Synthesis of speech in Faith - your own.  If desired, the client can indicate to the robot to communicate with potential applicants with a voice with neutral intonations, there is still positive intonation, kind and joyful. <br><br>  In addition to Vera, the robot Zakhar is now working with clients - that is, a male voice has been added.  Vera and Zakhar only have different voices, the essence is the same. <br><br><h3>  Why Voximplant, not Asterisk? </h3><br>  We love it when everything works like a clock - and without false modesty we can say that this is how it is with Voximplant.  Cooperation with Vera has been going on for several months already, and during this time the company has not had problems and failures. <br><br>  The robot team began working with us after it had integrated Asterisk into its platform.  Why?  He worked, but often something happened to the platform.  We had to call an Asterisk specialist to solve small and large problems, including the absence of calls.  Problems were frequent, and a specialist could be absent, ill, he could be busy.  Needless to say, customers didn‚Äôt like idle time and worsened overall performance.  With the Voximplant guys nothing has happened so far, and we hope that it will not happen.  In any case, we do everything for this. <br><br>  The second reason that prompted us to contact us is the ability to work with JavaScript.  If a problem arises, you need to add, change or remove something, then you do not need to call a specialist from somewhere, everything can be done on your own. <br><br>  The transition from Asterisk was carried out in stages, so that there was nothing like ‚Äúinto the pool with the head‚Äù.  At first, the guys added calls from the browser - in just one evening the corresponding functionality was added.  After this function showed itself well, other stages of integration followed. <br><br><h3>  Faith, go ahead!  Champion results of the robot </h3><br>  Faith (and Zakhar, yes) work very effectively.  About the process of their work longer to write than everything happens in reality.  Calling applicants Faith on the instructions of a particular client, that is, formed in the office of the application, is completed in just an hour and a half.  The average conversion rate for the search for candidates is 15%.  That is, out of 100 people who were found by the robot, 15 remain that meet all the criteria and are interested in cooperation themselves. <br><br>  Now robot Vera makes 10 times more calls per day than a professional recruiter.  This confirms not only our own experience, but also feedback from customers. <br><br>  At the same time, the Robot telephoned tens of thousands of people.  On the day, the number of calls reaches 30-50 thousand.  Since the beginning of her work, Vera has conducted 2,300 interviews with candidates for different positions, made 440,000 calls to applicants, processed millions of questionnaires on work sites. <br><br>  The effectiveness of the robot can be judged by the results obtained by MTS after the formation of the order to find employees.  The company received 5,000 responses per month.  Vera made more than 40,000 calls, sent 37,000 e-mails, more than 100 candidates underwent video interviews. <br><br>  In general, Vera and I had an excellent symbiosis of technologies, which included voice recognition, calls, speech synthesis, work with Big Data and much more.  Determining where Voximplant ends and the robot begins is for an uninitiated person really difficult.  And most importantly - it all works! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338660/</a></p>
