But after in 1966 the spacecraft Lunar Orbiter II, flying over this place, took a photograph of Reiner Gamma, it became clear that this was anything but a crater.

      It was an education that was not related to the topology of the surface (that is, there are no dips or elevations in this place), a light color with good reflectivity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/736/40a/f11/73640af1150cfafb837cde5bed618942.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, two more twists were discovered, which seemed to be centrally symmetrical with respect to two large craters, the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRains and the East Sea, for good reason. <br><br>  The riddle intensified in 1972, when NASA satellites studying the magnetic field of the moon, accidentally discovered that there was a strong magnetic field around turbulence - at the surface level it was about 100 times weaker than the earth one. <br><br>  One of the scientists who studied the moon, Bob Ling from the University of California at Berkeley, even <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/26jun_lunarswirls/">suggested</a> that after a large asteroid hit the moon in those ancient times when it had a strong magnetic field, the dust that forms the plasma ( a conductive cloud of small particles), went round the whole planet and settled on the side opposite from the impact, while maintaining the magnetization. <br><br>  But instead of this rather exotic hypothesis, Peter Schulz, who has been studying the moon for more than 40 years, offers a simpler one.  Schultz said that when he was an amateur astronomer, he was very fond of viewing through the Reiner Gamma telescope.  And when he thought about the reasons for the origin of this phenomenon, he drew attention to the traces of the lunar module landings.  ‚ÄúYou can observe how the surface around the lunar modules becomes bright and smooth, because the gas from the engines clears it,‚Äù says Schultz.  ‚ÄúThat is why I began to reflect on the fact that a comet could leave such an imprint.‚Äù <br><br>  Comets have their own gas cloud called ‚Äúcoma‚Äù.  Schultz decided that when falling onto the surface of the moon, the cometary gas could disperse the lunar dust, and the trail from this would resemble the traces of the landing of the lunar modules. <br><br>  Back in 1980, he and a colleague <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v284/n5751/full/284022a0.html">published a paper</a> in which he suggested that these mysterious traces on the moon remain from strikes on her comets.  And now, with the help of modern computers, he was able to simulate this situation. <br><br>  The simulation showed a strong resemblance to reality.  The trail from the fall of a comet can stretch for hundreds of kilometers and have a wavy shape.  In addition, such a fall should melt fine dust particles.  And the iron-rich particles, which were heated and then cooled, retain the magnetic field that was present during this process. <br><br>  It is known that comets have a strong magnetic field - small particles in their ‚Äútail‚Äù interact with the solar wind.  And when colliding with the Moon, this magnetic field is amplified and stored in the molten particles of the lunar surface.  According to calculations, the magnetic field shortly after the impact of a comet may exceed the earth's by 4 orders of magnitude.  Such a theory explains well both the shape of the turbulence and the presence of appreciable magnetic fields. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367311/</a></p>
