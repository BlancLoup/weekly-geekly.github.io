I found a designer who drew an ugly hat and redrawn the elements of a standard design for $ 50.  And he asked his old fellow programmer to work with the ‚Äúfile‚Äù ‚Äîa bit to change the template so that we like the look of the store.  It cost 50 bucks.  By our standards, it turned out quite well.

      We were smart guys, so we understood that it would be impossible to work with a limited range of confiscated goods.  And they began to look for suppliers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, how to search: sites online stores of perfume, message boards, yellow pages.  We found one supplier among the sites, they agreed to sell us piece-by-piece perfumes and provided a price.  For us, then the range was hefty.  Two more suppliers were found on the bulletin boards.  One was called Sebastian, I remember his email dragon@***.net and some Igor.  All those whom we found can be called suppliers only to the extent that retailers of goods can be called suppliers) <br><br>  The owner of an online store, a man of about 45, is the director of the Eurostar company, quite well known in the circle of online commerce.  It has two stores: bt.kiev.ua and bt-parfum.com.ua.  I met him personally, how he turned out to be a ‚Äúbug‚Äù: arrogant, important, made a big director of himself, began to question me, what for did I move here at all, but gave the go-ahead.  We talked with the other two suppliers later. <br><br>  It was the middle of April. <br><br>  First I had to add the product.  We took the price online store.  I did this, through the admin panel, hard and tedious.  Photos and descriptions tyril from other sites.  Adding a product is a sickening affair.  The monotonous work caused nausea, and since I am a restless person, nausea attacks were intersected by watching movies and going to the fridge.  But!  I worked as a slaughter.  The fire was burning in the eyes, and worked until night. <br><br>  My companion, meanwhile, designed CDMA phones so that we could receive calls for a couple. <br><br>  It came to the May holidays, when the KPI holidays from 1 to 10. It was then that I got the remnants of the directory.  At the same time, and walked well, before opening the store. <br><br>  Needless to say, we had no idea about the vision of the business, about e-commerce and in general about sales.  There was only a desire to learn, intelligent brains and ambitions. <br><br>  <i>This is where the first serious error awaited us.</i>  <i>It is necessary to start the project on sales on the threshold of a season.</i>  <i>We launched the project in the off-season - summer, when people save money for repairs, rest and children's fees to school.</i> <br><br>  But then we did not even know about it.  And it was not a mistake for us - we didn‚Äôt care. <br><br>  As I remember the first order ... Givenchy only, which we had among the confiscated goods, I took to Volgogradskaya street.  I gave the woman a window that lived on the first floor) <br><br>  The session began, running around the offices, handing over tails, etc.) The calls were received on pairs.  Because  I was already in the 4th year, and my partner was at 3, then naturally we scored on many pairs and took turns running on orders.  Well, in general, as befits students: and pan, and courier, and receive calls. <br><br>  I remember the noisy corridor, I press the phone to my ear with all my strength, write down the phone and the name on my knee, try to shout something in response.  In general, laughter and only) <br><br>  Orders were scrapped by pieces of paper, square fillers for tableware.  Notice, not even in a notebook !!!  Then with these papers, they ran around the city.  Only 6 months later we began to write in a notebook))) <br><br>  In the summer, when the session was surrendered, the first advertising began and the first serious thoughts and desires ... read next time) <br><br>  2006 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59464/</a></p>
