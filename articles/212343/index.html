E-bike, flying along the avenue at a speed of 80km \ h, tearing the patterns of neighbors downstream once and for all.  But it is purely utilitarian trips that do not differ special autonomy.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa country trip might seem absurd.  First of all, the thought - "Where on the road to look for sockets?".  But about everything in order.  Although the laziest can immediately watch the last movie. <br>  The typical range of a homemade electric bike does not exceed 50km (serial models with lead batteries are not even considered).  Lithium and only lithium.  On average, you need about 1 kW of electricity to overcome the above distance at 50km / h.  The proverb ‚Äúgo slower - you will continue‚Äù is more relevant than ever.  For long-distance hauls, it is required to cover 100-150km, hence the requirement for an onboard capacity of 2.5 + kWh.  This is quite a serious capacity, so the first step was to replace the battery with a more ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù one.  This is how the project ‚ÄúCrimean Suitcase‚Äù appeared, 240 elements of 18650 Li-ion LG D1: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/a0f/628/1baa0f62888e0c0a3e8be3c24d38c26c.jpg"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I will not describe in detail the order, assembly and soldering of elements, I will show only the final result (one of two blocks, 8018, total, respectively, 8036 ~ 2600Wh): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/d1d/c01/604d1dc01163f07f7b5c199922cb9c5f.jpg"></div><br><br>  Next, a typical set of a traveler is assembled, such as a tent, a sleeping bag, an inflatable foam, soap-ryl accessories, etc., which you already know about, once you read this opus.  Plus, the minimum set of specific parts (soldering irons, transistors, capacitors, spare controllers) that can not be found anywhere. <br>  At 9 am "x", the battery is fully charged, balanced, installed in its place and connected.  Everything is last checked and ready to ship: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c90/0d4/e69/c900d4e694e8deb031edae5ab1fdc5e1.jpg"></div><br><br>  We climb into the saddle, and go ... to the horticultural embankment, to the charging station "Revolta" to meet the rest.  Yes, yes, there were as many as 5 people like these crazy dorks :) Total involved in the adventure: two typical electric bicycles, two ligherades (lying) and one electric motorcycle (oh, he drank to us later). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af8/c5a/cfe/af8c5acfe32b15d67f6d315ed2edde6b.jpg"></div><br><br>  The route was worked out taking into account the need for outlets every 150km and overnight offers from members of the forum.  As it turns out, honest 2000km. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/659/e44/bcf/659e44bcfff26c4e64a59c07078922cd.jpg"></div><br><br>  Let us return to the question of sockets mentioned at the very beginning.  It is solved easier than it seems.  How is the day: wake up, have breakfast, go first weave.  When the charge level begins to approach 20%, we begin to look for a cafe or a tire service, or even all at once.  I will explain why.  Each ebike has a 2.5kw electric power reserve (except for a motorcycle, everything is 4 there, but about it a bit later).  Accordingly, in order to ‚Äúfill‚Äù such energy consumption in a reasonable time (an hour and a half), an appropriate charging power is necessary.  Any, 1500W each.  If you include one, it's nothing like a kettle.  Two - already serious.  And all 5 times give a load of 7500W.  In the first intermediate recharging in Chekhov, in Sergei (Ils), we all stuck at once, and the voltage sank to 185v under a load of 35A.  This is a rare case when the supply quality, but in most cases the network does not stand up.  Therefore, two connection points are searched for in place.  For example, two cafes - we go in them, and the dialogue is as follows: <br><blockquote>  - Do you have a socket? <br>  - Yes, why do you need it? <br>  - Bikes charge. <br>  - Will you eat at our place? <br>  - Required! </blockquote><br>  It is still easier with tire fittings \ auto services - they give the outlet right away, though you have to conduct an educational program on basic issues :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ec/7f9/fa2/8ec7f9fa2156cf1e4813dd764df21092.jpg"></div><br><br>  In general, we feed ourselves and horses, then we go to the next hundred, in the same way we have dinner \ charge and go to bed (in a tent / motel or at a hospitable forumchanin).  Special mention deserves Zadonsk.  We arrived there already at midnight, and it was too late to look for a cafe.  But while we were going to the store, a local kid stuck around our equipment and suggested that there is a scene in the main square of the city.  And on this stage, they say that?  Right, the outlet.  We went there.  Socket really found, right under the distribution panel.  Submarine wires and automatons at 32A were also nothing, and inspired hope.  But summed up the outlet itself.  Its quality did not withstand any criticism - it was wildly heated even from two charges.  Therefore, we quietly added a more substantial chip there - a model XT60 with 6mm¬≤ wires, and a previously prepared adapter was inserted into it - initially it is needed to connect an electric kettle to the boils, quickly boil water and drink tea in the forest;). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/cfd/26c/55dcfd26c0e474310be42775573be30c.jpg"></div><br><br>  According to the plan, we decided to leave him until the morning, and in the morning add the remnants and take with us.  Imagine our surprise when, returning after him in the morning, we found a festival and a local ensemble on the stage in the center of the city.  I had to leave them a ‚Äúchpok‚Äù as a keepsake.  I don‚Äôt know how long the local electricians then wondered what it was, where it came from and why it was needed :).  The rest of the way lay in Gubkin, where Igor (Licc) lived, who had assembled an electrocavory with his own hands.  To go to the south, and not to visit him would be a blasphemy.  Especially since we were persistently invited. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d52/3a1/a31/d523a1a313061b08b75c80afb2f55f71.jpg"></div><br><br>  There, we even lingered for one day, washed, showered, checked my battery (one element died), diagnosed the condition of the gear motor of Andrei‚Äôs League (everything is OK), and generally rested and gathered our strength. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9829/43441103.19/0_9bf7d_b0388f41_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc7/29e/279/dc729e279f2a5142044504444a2e2f8e.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  The next nezhdanchik overtook us directly on the Russian-Ukrainian border, when one of ours was not allowed because of problems with the passport.  From now on, we drove the four of us, two fagans, a motorcycle and me.  Kharkiv motel is remembered by goats in the parking lot and the annoying offer of local ‚Äúgrelochek‚Äù for the night :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9818/43441103.19/0_9bf7e_bdfe028e_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/941/5d3/add/9415d3add62a65e5bdc7121404a450fa.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  The next adventure overtook us closer to Dnepropetrovsk, when one of the motors (on the League) was partially covered due to the fact that we were rinsed with rain all the way from Gubkin to Kharkov.  He swallowed water, and while charging a leakage of current through the water through the body, shunned the sensors.  Could go, but noisy and not fast.  He was promptly repaired in the garage of Alexei (alex dnepr) in Dnepropetrovsk. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9895/43441103.19/0_9bf7f_e09a83f0_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/342/84e/cb6/34284ecb62646b65f759d1e3bef7719c.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  In Melitopol, we temporarily docked with the participant of the Ukrainian <a href="http://electricmobile.org.ua/forum/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D32687">electric car</a> at the same time - Vyacheslav and his electric fame.  Temporarily - because it was only for 20km and 15 minutes, it took so much time to ‚Äúbluff‚Äù to Akimivka by 75 ... 90km / h.  An excellent splash turned out against the background of already pretty annoying energy savings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9748/43441103.19/0_9bf80_9154a3a6_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/d6e/319/773d6e319475ed30a4ae9aa35010fe51.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  After that, I didn‚Äôt want to go slowly, but quickly it was impossible (not very economical).  The decision came naturally when, during dinner, we saw slender rows of trucks.  It was on the Akimovka-Dzhankoy stretch (160km) that the idea to drive quickly and for the first time did not become expensive.  Before that, it arose and was realized in inconsistency and when, how.  Having started the movement and saw three identical trucks, we sucked behind them one after another.  By walkie-talkie passed the following dialogue: <br><blockquote>  - This is Alex, I'm for a wagon, as you heard? <br>  - Accepted.  This is Lev, I'm here with Andrew in the "second car". <br>  - Got it.  Amaranthus, where are you? <br>  - I'm in the "third"! </blockquote><br>  So, periodically changing donors, we have reached the suburb of Dzhankoy in 3 hours.  Although not all.  Remember, I previously mentioned about 4KWh a motorcyclist?  The first thought that arises automatically is that the power reserve is twice as large.  Everybody thought so.  But it turned out ... that its consumption is one and a half times higher than the average per group.  Those.  with a more capacious battery, he drove even a little less than all the others.  At the same time on pit stops him and wait, respectively, had the longest.  With the duration of the charge, we learned to fight then, simply by connecting the first freed charge in parallel.  But the increased consumption led to the fact that he did not drive on that stretch a dozen kilometers.  Fortunately, before pushing mots to a gas station after a couple of kilometers, he found an outlet there and was able to smoke. <br>  Then our path lay in Feodosia, where, after spending the night with tents on Klementyev Mountain, we said goodbye to the motorcyclist (Feodosia went to Kerch, the ferry and to Anapa).  his vacation time has come to an end.  The views from the mountain are certainly gorgeous there: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9162/43441103.19/0_9bf81_db4ed5f_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08d/d2e/afd/08dd2eafda27f4867b5c713070ac4f16.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  Although these types meant a new exam for vehicles - serpentines in the Theodosia-Alushta segment. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9895/43441103.19/0_9bf82_fb5a64bd_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/38b/f26/8f938bf26d88738a0925ecb5b7dcc48e.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  Of the three of us left to this moment, I was not the only one who had problems with overheating of the motor.  Both ligherada suffered from it in full, because  one already had a decently fried motor from Moscow traffic jams (which obviously did not contribute to the improvement of efficiency), while the second had the motor itself small and not very fast (the same one that flooded near Kharkov).  The first tried to deal with it, increasing the speed in lifting, the second was actively pedaling :).  However, it only added humor to the situation, since  one of the found means of solving this problem (here‚Äôs a paradox) is to pour water inside, for which Lekhin motor got the nickname ‚Äústeam generator‚Äù.  Periodically we stopped and let the motors cool.  At the same time fotkali themselves and technology.  My device: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9758/43441103.19/0_9bf83_b409dfa4_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/92f/f5c/98b92ff5c9fa2d3b3ae52e4c13c74923.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  Alexei near his camp: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9474/43441103.16/0_92a75_59e73773_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80d/2a6/64c/80d2a664c1b8f8d3a81899381e105db9.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  Actively pedaling Andrew: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9255/43441103.16/0_92a72_971e55bc_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0b/e1a/cf3/b0be1acf31e05a339a51a5e8c31bcb84.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  After Alushta, we went to the government highway, and the problem of overheating was no longer so urgent, because  slopes there do not exceed 10%.  Yes, and the distance between cities less than 100km, which allowed to burn the entire trigger.  Sevastopol was as close as ever: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9162/43441103.19/0_9bf84_9831c9fb_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b2/80c/152/6b280c152dd2af96b92010383f572fd0.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  Having settled in with friends and having hanged in the city for a week, it was decided to merge home by train.  Then the last ambush was waiting for us - as the correct users of the XXI century, we issued tickets online on the Russian Railways website.  As it turned out, nothing.  Since  in Ukraine, they simply have nowhere to print.  There is no such terminal at the station, and that's it.  I had to urgently cancel the purchase and go buy manually.  On the same day, we managed once again to intersect with the Ukrainian electric vehicle, in full force. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9584/43441103.16/0_92e93_8d8b2559_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c7/3ae/1e0/7c73ae1e053f0b1d5bc3f70d2385a4fc.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  However, the evening rebus ‚Äúhow to load three bikes in one compartment so that you can sleep and there were no extra questions at customs‚Äù turned out to be the most delicious.  The solution to this rebus looked like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9114/43441103.19/0_9bf85_6828409a_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffc/3df/507/ffc3df507f6c0b105a669fe708d63928.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  My bike was placed on my own shelf, Andrei‚Äôs legion on the next one, and Aleksey‚Äôs legion was disassembled into two parts, one of which lay under the table, and the second in the gap for the mattresses :).  Customs tried to find fault, but could not find arguments on the bicycle clearance up to 25kg (so with a slight movement of the Lechin pen, the footer lost 50 pounds).  In Moscow, we were already 24 hours later, where a clip based on this adventure was assembled: <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td width="400"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gwVfi7aGGE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLjuemANCNVsz7p3FvSoE2UAAb8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  oh yeah, some dry statistics: the total travel time (minus the time spent on "hanging out" in Gubkin and Sevastopol) is 10 days.
