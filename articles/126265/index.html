  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Euclideon responds to Unlimited Detail criticism, shows a new demo and answers questions in a 40-minute interview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, the Internet thundered news from the Australian company Euclideon, which claims to have created a new type of graphics engine that supports "unlimited detail" (Unlimited Detail).  The original video is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D00gAbgBu8R4">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/3d_graphics/125482/">here</a> . <br><br>  After the video was released, many became fans of the company, anticipating a total revolution in the world of 3d graphics, but many were also skeptical about the news, rightly noting that this technology should have problems with animation, shadows, the size of files in which the level should be maintained, and etc. These people included such notorious personalities as Notch (the creator of minecraft) (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/02/notch-vs-unlimited-detail/), and John Carmack (http : //nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2011/08/is-the-future-of-immersive-3d-in-atoms-euclideoncom.html) <br><br>  In his new video, Euclideon is trying to respond including to their concerns: <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://player.vimeo.com/27522131&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgT6P8hJQMlRuRn7PgxxTw9MD5Arg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The director of Euclideon claims that their renderer runs entirely on the processor (although they are going to use the GPU in the future), but the algorithm has nothing to do with raytracing.  One of the other technologies to which all the beauty of the Unlimited Detail demo was attributed was tesselation, a new feature of graphics cards in which textures with height maps are converted to real polygons at the right approximation.  However, Euclideon, denies the use of this technology, even showing specific examples on the video why their demo cannot use tesselation. <br><br>  According to Euclideon, their technology allows you to quickly find the right atom for each pixel on the screen, and since there are not so many pixels (compared to the number of polygons in an average game), and since they draw only 1 atom per pixel, then this It turns out in real time to draw completely on the processor. <br><br>  The interview dispels some concerns about animation, although not as much as we would like.  Euclideon show a seven-year-old demo in which the animation is really visible, but the quality of the picture doesn‚Äôt come close to the much-acclaimed first video.  The director explains this by saying that their new engine is not yet fully ready, and they do not want to show it, and the old demo was simply shown to assure the public that they are working on animation. <br><br>  But even if it is still hard to believe in real animation, at least the interview dispels all doubts that Unlimited Detail is just fake, vaporware, showing a realtime demo in which the interviewer flies around the island from the first video and without Any brakes are rendered on a regular gaming laptop. <br><br>  What is particularly interesting, the company adds that they have already received all the necessary funding, including a considerable grant from the Australian government, and are not looking for new investors at the moment.  This fact leaves good hopes that Euclideon has really come up with something fundamentally new in the world of 3D graphics and not just a beautiful hack designed to attract investor money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126265/</a></p>
