No one expected success from a niche device, but sales of the first Note were staggering.  Of course, that other manufacturers simply could not ignore this market segment and began to release their solutions.  Practice has shown that not only size, but also other characteristics are important for users.  And for the characteristics you have to pay, which is why such devices are quite expensive for the average user.  But here, Chinese manufacturers help out by releasing clones of popular models or quality counterparts at low prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/531/757/6be5317575ed161e1a586d16a6ab05fe.jpg"><br><br>  On one of these analogs just go today.  Thin Chinese smartphone POMP C6S boasts, first of all, a large display, its own filling, as well as an attractive appearance, but first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  POMP C6S is a 5.5-inch smartphone with an FHD OGS display, which is based on an 8-core MT6592 processor with a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  Video chip Mali 450 MP4 has 8 cores operating at 700 MHz and possessing 512 Kbytes of the second level cache.  The amount of RAM was 2 GB, built-in - 32 GB.  In addition, the device was equipped with a 13 megapixel camera from Sony, two SIM slots, a 3000 mAh battery, MHL, OTG, NFC functions, and the DUI interface based on Android 4.2.2 is responsible for the work.  Separately, it is worth noting the dimensions of the new items, which are distinguished by narrow frames and a thin body, the thickness of which is only 7.7 mm.  It is sold in three colors - black, white and yellow.

In the center is the company logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/919/548/691/9195486913f36d402c94a6ed0b804157.jpg"><br><br>  The lid of the box due to its configuration was not shot the first time.  Immediately below it, the device itself occupies the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe package.  Under it in a separate box are instructions and a needle of the SIM card lock.  At the bottom are the headphones, USB-cable and charger, the Chinese standard size, but with an adapter.  You can also find the case of a thin translucent plastic.  The accessory fits perfectly on the smartphone and almost does not increase its size.  But the material is fragile, so it‚Äôs better to be careful with it, otherwise it will inadvertently burst. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82f/3d1/84b/82f3d184bd302e8949ec8be742a79aa1.jpg"><br><br>  The sound in the headphones is pretty good, but there are no extra liner sizes for them.  The charger has an output current of 1.5A, which allows you to charge the battery in just two hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  POMP C6S should be called a classic ‚Äúblack bar‚Äù (in our case black and white) if it were not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - a small thickness and narrow frames.  Nevertheless, the POMP C6S design draws attention.  Most of the plane is occupied by a 5.5-inch screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13c/36d/461/13c36d461093c4f2bc969cf1fc14c6d2.jpg"><br><br>  In appearance, the device turned out to be a very interesting and pretty device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/1f3/69b/37a1f369b5550687c4c3bc6f6ed5aaa3.jpg"><br><br>  On the front panel of the device are the speaker, microphone, light sensor and 8 MP camera.  Unfortunately, there is no notification indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/459/7fa/085/4597fa085e52e1bd39f06f458cc7d479.jpg"><br><br>  Control buttons - touch.  Their lights are only active at the time of use.  The buttons are conveniently spaced, pressing the wrong direction and misses are rare. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bf/f3e/e1f/7bff3ee1f8e88db114ae3985bf1b6862.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side are the power buttons and cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/99f/080/de999f0801378b5bef402d1bed7cfb91.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, one of the main features of the device is fast shooting.  If you hold the camera button, you can take a picture in just a few seconds.  Full size 13 megapixel autofocus image.  Let me remind you that almost none of the manufacturers of Android-smartphones put a separate camera button, citing the high cost, the need to rework the case, and so on.  The keys are camouflaged in color under the body, and almost invisible.  Pressing soft, however, is not always noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/649/810/2326498100e8e3a903e073333ce53862.jpg"><br><br>  The left side is only half occupied.  On it tightly placed the volume keys and a slot for SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38c/efe/bec/38cefebec5e2a1a8f3afac70722449c7.jpg"><br><br>  The latter consists of two branches on a micro-SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a04/091/ef9/a04091ef9eaf814aaed800cb84a25756.jpg"><br><br>  The headphone jack is lonely on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59d/6f0/768/59d6f0768144e1375e90f910388305d5.jpg"><br><br>  Below is a microphone and a microUSB connector for charging, connecting to a PC, as well as an OTG or MHL cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/822/eb9/33b/822eb933b189d8f677c6da0f1bac94cc.jpg"><br><br>  The back of the POMP C6S is glossy and slightly slippery.  But the plastic of the back panel is pleasant to the touch and is not very worn on, especially on the white color version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a29/945/372/a2994537282b18b2f69be2d3cbcfa702.jpg"><br><br>  On the rear side of the flat pyramid located the camera at 13 MP, flash and microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/e2a/247/6ede2a24750cb44162bd6cf98d5d5d8f.jpg"><br><br>  Towards the middle, the brand of the smartphone proudly flaunts, and below is the speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e21/ac5/f1f/e21ac5f1f494f0926d138e995acb5e75.jpg"><br><br>  The case is made monolithically, so it is very difficult to disassemble it without certain tools.  As for convenience, then the dimensions take their own.  Touching to the upper left corner is very difficult. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The screen is represented by LG IPS matrix with FullHD-resolution.  Screen size - 5.5 inches, with a density - 401PPI.  This density makes the individual pixels almost indistinguishable.  Of course, such a resolution makes the image truly clear and detailed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f22/1fb/0d7/f221fb0d77e3fce68ac3a9d68fb13cd6.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the IPS-matrix, the screen always maintains image clarity, even outdoors in clear weather.  The display brightness can be set manually, or you can use the automatic adjustment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d70/17b/053/d7017b0533255ec4d5c4163c91f4b138.jpg"><br><br>  The picture on the screen is very clear, with excellent color reproduction and maximum viewing angles.  The screen is pleasant to the touch, the finger gently slides, and the response is quick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dea/c2f/ccc/deac2fccc64e573dea04029fc19d117a.jpg"><br><br>  Multitouch technology allows you to process up to 5 touch points simultaneously.  The proximity sensor is also installed, which allows you to avoid accidental key presses during a call. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  Both cameras have a fairly high resolution.  The front is represented by a sensor at 8 MP, the rear - by 13. Due to this resolution, even the smallest details of the photo will be visible.  However summed up the color rendition.  Colors are not always natural.  Night landscapes, alas, are beyond the control of this sensor.  But the location of the lens is very good.  In the corner it is unlikely that touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb3/ebb/f4a/fb3ebbf4a10eddb2a62903d256ee7d4f.jpg"><br><br>  The choice of ISO is limited to 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. At the latter, with a strong increase, noises appear.  There is a continuous shooting of up to 40 photos, as well as HDR mode.  From the settings of the photo, the function "Shooting when a smile is detected" surprised. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/989/0f8/92b/9890f892b9d82dd6d7568b1af82176b3.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to it, the camera can shoot panoramas at 270 degrees, and makes good macro shots from a distance of 10 centimeters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/cba/554/3dbcba554633c37314f3f96114a74b5f.jpg"><br><br>  The lack of manual focus and, sometimes, a long wait for the response of the automation made me very upset.  However, in general, the camera is quite good in comparison with other mobile devices. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  The first thing that catches the eye inside the OS is the lock screen.  On it in the upper part the time and date are neatly arranged, and in the lower part there is an improvised virtual lock and key.  To unlock them you need to combine.  The lock graphically shows the battery charge.  The main screen accommodates up to 20 icons + another bottom row of 4 frequently used applications.  All icons are stylized as a single design in the form of rounded squares. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a2/c2d/343/1a2c2d343d09da173c40cec96c249e0c.jpg"><br><br>  The DUI shell is pretty pretty.  There are no extra Chinese applications.  It should also be noted that the smartphone works under the operating system Google Android version 4.2.2.  Chinese manufacturers have already started to release software updates for their devices, I am sure that POMP will not be ignored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/265/b93/bad265b93535bdc49c580d0c3a8342e0.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúFlashlight‚Äù, ‚ÄúFile Manager‚Äù, ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù were added to the usual set of programs from Google. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/926/cd6/a4b/926cd6a4b3146dc1202d0f3b7d19a6e4.jpg"><br><br>  You can enable gestures in the program shell.  The add-in works, you can scroll through desktops, photos and pages in the menu.  I did not find more use, but it looks very cool. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone is designed to work with two SIM cards, both of them work in 2G and 3G communication standards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbc/ae2/ac5/dbcae2ac5e0f84d929bc5a97ad75c519.jpg"><br><br>  Also, there are WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 quality modules, which are at a high level.  The navigation system of the smartphone is represented only by the GPS module.  Its accuracy is not always high, especially in light of recent events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e1/e02/9a1/7e1e029a1447a0f9459b0ad4e81825b2.jpg"><br><br>  There is support for NFC close interaction technology, the module works stably.  Despite its high performance, the processor does not support LTE.  However, Mediatek will soon launch mobile 64-bit processors with support for this communication standard. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  In general, the smartphone POMP C6S showed really very high results, when compared with any other rivals for the price.  But if you compare the results of the smartphone with the market leaders, the lag behind the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800/801 is still noticeable, although not much.  If you rely on the figures of the popular AnTuTu benchmark, it looks like this: 29 thousand points for POMP C6S with a frequency of 1.7 GHz cores and about 35 thousand for top smartphones such as LG G2, Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC M8 and others on a hardware platform Qualcomm Snapdragon 800/801.  The smartphone has managed to get very close to the leading solutions on Qualcomm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/158/54d/35c/15854d35cf3aaef0b18b5c4df1094dbe.jpg"><br><br>  On such hardware, the smartphone easily copes with high-quality 1080 / 50p video, including such popular formats as avi, mpeg and even mkv.  In addition, he is able to do most modern 3D games, for example: GTA: San Andreas or Deus Ex: The Fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f0/ddb/dcc/4f0ddbdcced9c31de79ccd50d66cb29c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00c/26c/335/00c26c335cc5b96e86fbec89bbd2c066.png"><br><br>  The shell works smartly, the most resource-intensive applications are quickly executed, demanding 3D games run smoothly and sagging FPS.  FullHD movies smartphone turns easy.  Offhand it is even difficult to name a situation where the power will be clearly small. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  One of the main advantages of the smartphone POMP C6S, I would call the battery life.  For this parameter, the novelty, if not the leader, then at least among the leaders.  This is clearly shown as benchmarks, and the actual use. <br><br>  Let's start with benchmarks.  AnTuTu Tester, loading the CPU device up to 100%, was able to discharge the battery in about five hours.  This is a very good indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/471/082/0fb/4710820fb251df46cf6689c6c4f637ba.png"><br><br>  When playing a video file with a screen brightness set to maximum, the smartphone worked for almost 10 hours!  The result of the playback of videos from YouTube is also pleased.  We used a Wi-Fi connection, the screen brightness was set to maximum.  In this mode, the smartphone lasted about eight hours, which is very cool. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  The market for Chinese technology has changed a lot lately.  The word "Chinese" has ceased to mean something cheap and not working.  This smartphone has shown that the Asian technology market is not inferior to branded items.  It is possible that for someone this device will not work because of the screen size, because it creates more inconvenience than gives advantages, while others believe that this class of devices has the right to life and find it quite comfortable and versatile.  The smartphone is made very high quality, stuffing worked out to the smallest detail.  There are such innovations as NFC, MHL, OTG, but LTE is badly lacking.  For such a modest price, I think that the model is very worthy. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Fast iron <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality display <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Good build <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Gesture support <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Large memory and microSD slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Availability of various communications (OTG, MHL, NFC) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Long autonomous work <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Low price <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No support for LTE networks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No notification indicator <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Mediocre image quality <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  Buy <a href="http://ru.coolicool.com/pomp-c6-mtk6592-octa-core-17ghz-android-42-55-3g-g-2880">POMP C6S</a> can be in the store CooliCool.
