      Ok, let's go! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first photo shows the entrance to our office.  We are located on the seventh floor of a building built around the 1920s of the last century.  To get to our office, you must follow the inconspicuous stairs.  Earlier on the site of our office held tear-off party at a late hour.  One guy from France was having private parties here after 2am, which gathered long lines at the door.  People paid $ 20 for admission and $ 20 for each cocktail.  When we were looking for an office, one of our project managers came across this place on Rofo.com, which, by coincidence, was our previous startup that we had grown.  Welcome to our office! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/e3e/92e/22be3e92e9ae445741556dbbecf397c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next slide is our conference room.  On the wall there is a plasma, with the help of which we show presentations to our guests.  Our company practices the rules to serve coffee, tea, soft drink or ice cream for our visitors.  Oh yeah, we also offer breakfasts if the guests are early. <br><br>  On the wall you can see a series of clocks showing different times - San Francisco, London, Kiev, Mumbai and Tokyo.  We often work deep into the night by conducting online conferences with partners from different countries and we believe that it is very important for every person in our team to navigate perfectly in geography and time zones.  Overnight, we can have time to talk with people from Tokyo, Beijing, Mumbai, Moscow, Berlin, London and some of our employees finish their working ‚Äúday‚Äù late at night.  Of course, those guys who work at night can come to the office the next day at any time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/306/d0b/e42/306d0be424cbb8267c21028b99683843.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In our work we put emphasis on creativity.  The third slide shows how we use walls as a whiteboard for marking with a special marker.  The Sputnik chandelier, which personifies the ‚Äúexplosion of ideas‚Äù deserves special attention.  It seems to us that this reflects our Russian essence and, at the same time, the birth of new ideas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0df/a57/b7d/0dfa57b7da7ab0d0dd9eca739aaf19e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Through the windows of our office you can see the skyscrapers of the financial district of the city of San Francisco.  Perhaps our building was one of the tallest at the time when it was built, but now, it is naturally inferior to the huge modern giants in which the offices of Citibank, Visa, Federal Reserve Bank and many other financial institutions are located.  This is a clear sign for us, indicating the right direction of our path. <br><br>  We also have an interesting display with a unique interface.  This display shows transaction images online and displays the payment method, the country from which the payment was made, as well as the amount of payment and currency.  It is interesting to observe how the display shows the different countries and the amounts paid for services in games and on dating sites that we help to monetize.  Countries wake up and end their day, and we see waves of activity from different regions and time zones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd3/9c0/718/cd39c0718c045dbffba821681eb30338.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following photo is our rooftop terrace.  We began our journey in terrible conditions, worked in a windowless room for the last two years, and finally realized that we can afford something more.  We chose this office and believe that we have found a decent office for our team, we have created comfortable conditions for our children, having gone through a thorny path.  During lunch, our guys gather around the table and eat national dishes prepared by members of our international team.  And when it comes time to relax and the weather contributes to this, we settle down under the tent and enjoy our terrace and sunny day.  It is particularly interesting to observe the reaction of Citibank employees, who look at us with envy at these moments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/085/b30/c6f/085b30c6f8bbf3b4bbf15c1718c454a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following slide offers views of several skyscrapers overlooking Market Street. <br><br><img src="http://www.paymentwall.com/images/offices/6.jpg?1" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, slide the main part of the office and bar kitchen.  Design office selected in Japanese style.  Our CEO is located in the back, where the DJ area was previously, and the bar of the former nightclub now serves as our kitchen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/813/1af/e6d/8131afe6d69189542ff2dd67b9d29390.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, this week we are celebrating the launch of our new product - 2-Click Payments!  We are having a German style party, where we will serve the famous Bavarian sausages and glorious German beer.  Everyone is welcome who has the opportunity to visit our office in San Francisco this Friday.  Detailed information can be found <a href="http://www.paymentwall.com/sausagefest">here</a> .  We will definitely show the photos from the party to all readers of Habr in our next post. <br><br>  Our team will also be at E3 in Los Angeles.  This event is the largest in the game industry and we will ask our colleagues to capture a few photos to publish them exclusively for Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120489/</a></p>
