Unfortunately, this often passes by, and the person, accidentally later, having learned about the already completed event, is upset that he did not take part in it.  By the way, participation in Intel contests often leads to the fact that the participant himself then finds himself in Intel.  Already a couple of times he observed such a picture.  At one meeting, a man came for the prize, and the next year - once, and already with the badge "Employee Intel".  So keep in mind.  :) <br><br>  However, to get attention from Intel, it is not necessary to fight in the Olympiad, there are other interesting and useful ways.  For example, you can become a member of the Intel Software Network (ISN) community and automatically start participating in the Programming Wizard competition.  It was about this program that I wanted to tell a little. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-black-belt-software-developers-faqs/">The Intel Software Network</a> is a community of software developers.  These are blogs and articles from community members or Intel employees, a forum, news about new events, contests, and more.  It is important and interesting that in the forums or in the comments to the articles you can ask questions directly to Intel employees.  And you can answer yourself, publish interesting materials, in general, be an active and useful community.  That is what will be appreciated when selecting candidates for the title of "Programming Wizard, Intel Black Belt". <br><br>  Here's how the Intel site is determined to wear this title: <br><br>  <i>This rank is assigned to a community member who demonstrates an exceptional level of knowledge of Intel technology and contributes to our communities through regular sharing of knowledge and experience, providing help and support in discussion forums, providing informational materials such as articles, and participating in community activities.</i>  <i>It is a kind of recognition of leadership and contribution to community activities.</i> <br><br>  In the process of approaching perfection, belts of different colors will be assigned to you.  More information about the program, conditions and benefits can be found here in these notes: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/blackbelt/">Intel Programming Wizard</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-brown-belt-software-developer-and-intel-green-belt-software-developer-faqs/">The statuses 'Intel Programming Wizard, Brown Belt' and 'Intel Programming Wizard, Green Belt' - questions and answers</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-black-belt-software-developers-faqs/">"Intel Black Belt Programming Wizard" - frequently asked questions</a> . </li></ul><br>  And I am writing this post for joy and gratitude.  The fact is that this year the status of Intel Programming Wizard was assigned to me.  It was very nice to hear congratulations at the meeting of the ISN-community and get a wonderful high-performance laptop. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ea/f55/ab7/6eaf55ab76240e808f3ef2563fe577a7.png" alt="Andrey Karpov black belt"><br>  As a prize, I was awarded a Sony VAIO based on Intel Core i7, with 4 cores, with 6 gigabytes of memory, Blu-ray drive and other buns.  This is not all gifts, and all the more far from all the advantages that this status gives.  For example, I became the owner of the software Intel Parallel Studio XE 2011. <br><br>  What you need to be appreciated?  Nothing magical.  You need to be an active member of the community, write articles and maintain contacts.  For example, I did not count on a black belt at all and did not think about it.  To be honest, I was more concerned with the discussions related to <a href="http://www.viva64.com/ru/a/0077/">PVS-Studio</a> .  Therefore, it was very unexpected and pleasant to receive an award for interesting articles and contributions to the life of ISN. <br><br>  Thanks to all.  I will try to continue to please the reader with interesting notes and unicorns. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134452/</a></p>
