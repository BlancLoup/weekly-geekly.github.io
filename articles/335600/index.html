  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet bicycles - how IT helps to lead a healthy lifestyle and reduce harmful emissions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The problem of environmental pollution has long been well known to residents of large cities.  For example, in China, more than a third of all deaths are somehow related to smog, and in London, the World Health Organization's approved standards for annual air pollution are violated in the first days of January.  Given the continuing trend of urbanization - and according to forecasts, by 2030 about 60% of the world's population will live in cities - mankind should develop and implement policies that would minimize the negative impact it has on the environment.  And this is necessary not only for the well-being of the planet, but simply so that we can safely move around the city without risking our health. <br><br>  City planners around the world are trying to imagine and create a world where all this would be possible.  And the creation of environmentally friendly transport is one of those areas on which special hopes are pinned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8ca/de0/373/8cade0373b58439297c00d6f75fedc25.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In many ways, this optimism comes from the likelihood that people will abandon private cars in favor of public transport, and this, in turn, can contribute to a real improvement in the situation.  In the same row is the development of urban public bicycle rental, which is increasingly being used in many cities.

      Including, in Russia, the municipal authorities establish bicycle rental centers in the cities, which anyone can use.  Implementing these projects, they made a mini-revolution, while the popularity of this service showed the willingness of citizens to change their habits.  However, since rental points where you can pick up or rent a bike are tied to a certain point, this to a certain extent limits the potential of this service and does not allow you to fully change the preferences of citizens when moving around the city.  In addition, it increases the initial costs and increases the difficulty of launching such a scheme. <br><br>  And here technology comes to the rescue - for example, the Chinese company Mobike helps to develop bicycle transport in cities by using the Internet of Things (IoT).  The company offered the world's first bicycle rental system without stationary rental points, where cash is not required to pay for the service, and which uses proprietary bicycles equipped with intelligent bicycle locks and a GPS tracker.  A special mobile application not only displays the location of bicycles available for rental, but also allows you to build a walking route to these points.  Thus, the application provides users with an additional level of convenience. <br><br>  Gemalto provides a secure network connection for the entire Mobike bike park, using the built-in Cinterion M2M modules and the Machine Identification Module on the bikes.  This solution allows you to remotely unlock the bikes and manage the entire bike park in real time.  Moreover, it even allows you to evaluate the current technical condition of each bike.  IoT modules have been certified to work with all major mobile operators around the world, that is, any other company can use them to implement their own Internet of Things services. <br><br>  In China, Mobike has brought more than a million bicycles to the streets of 33 cities, and intends to triple that number in the near future.  Bicycles are somewhat different from what we are used to seeing - they use airless tires to increase reliability, and they are equipped with solar panels to power the electronics. <br><br>  In addition, Mobike recently launched a new project in the UK, in Manchester, and today the company is already recording up to 25 million daily trips.  Thus, a huge number of people no longer use their own cars or taxi services. <br><br>  Of course, one person who chooses a bicycle as a vehicle does not make the weather, but let's turn to the CDC statistics collected in the USA: ‚ÄúAbout half of American schoolchildren in a school are brought by drivers in a family car.  If at least 20% of those who live within a radius of three kilometers from the school, would use a bicycle or go to school on foot, this would save about 7 million kilometers of trips per day.  For the year, this would prevent the release of 356 thousand tons of carbon dioxide and 21.5 thousand other pollutants. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to the Copenhagen <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/world-best-cycling-cities-copenhagenize/">City Bicycle Cycling</a> Index (Copenhagenize Bicycle Friendly Cities Index) for 2017, most cities adapted for bicycle enthusiasts are located in Europe, and the bicycle transport connected to the Internet has great potential for the realization of new ideas.  The ability to track the location of network-connected devices on the map in real time, while ensuring secure access to them, will significantly improve the user experience.  The same technology can be applied in car-sharing schemes, which can save on owning a private car and can provide another inexpensive and most environmentally friendly form of transport for the city, for example, for an electric vehicle park.  Who knows, perhaps one of the new ideas will be presented at <a href="http://www.innovationworldcup.com/iot-wt/">the</a> IoT / WT Innovation World Cup, a global <a href="http://www.innovationworldcup.com/iot-wt/">innovation competition of</a> this year, applications for which are accepted until November. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335600/</a></p>
