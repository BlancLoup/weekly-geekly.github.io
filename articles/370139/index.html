At that time, I had problems with listening and opening podcasts helped me a lot to develop listening to the level of understanding films and audio books without any subtitles. <br><br>  Podcasts are audio audio files in the style of radio programs on the Internet. As a rule, podcasts have a certain theme and frequency of publication.  Every person who has a smartphone can listen to podcasts.  To listen to the podcasts, Apple owners have a native application called ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù.  Android users can use the Podcast Addict application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately it should be explained that podcasts greatly develop an understanding of English speech, especially if you listen to podcasts of different genres and different levels of complexity.  If you listen to podcasts regularly, the brain gets used to English speech =&gt; it becomes easier to understand the context of the sentence =&gt; your progress in learning English becomes greater.

      From myself I will add that the best progress is obtained when you drive yourself into a stressful situation.  For our brain, a stressful situation is when more time is needed to solve a problem than our brain expected or a situation has arisen suddenly and requires the immediate solution of this task.  So, what am I doing this for?  I mean, you need to listen to those podcasts that you are NOT comfortable listening to, I mean, those podcasts, listening to which, an understanding of the material is LESS than 70 percent.  In this case, you will strain, for you it will be a kind of challenge, you will grow and this will be more confusing than listening to something that does not cause you tension. <br><habracut><br>  For myself, I identified two options for listening to podcasts: <br><br>  1) Target listening.  You allocate time specially, write out incomprehensible words, enter them into the dictionary, and analyze them.  You concentrate only on the material you are listening to.  For this option, those podcasts are very suitable, understanding of which makes it difficult for you. <br><br>  2) You listen to podcasts and at the same time do some work, such as driving to work, cooking, or studying in a gym.  You listen to what is being said, but do not concentrate fully on speech.  Of course, there is less sense from this option than from the previous one, but it is there.  Your brain, regardless of you, fixes words and expressions, and when you meet these words in any text, they will seem familiar to you.  For this option, suitable podcasts that you enjoy listening. <br><br>  At first it seemed strange and unusual to me - to learn English without departing from the usual listening methods.  It was a bit unusual, as if you were listening to the radio ... It seems that you are doing a serious job, it seems like entertainment.  Anyway.  It became interesting to me, I was involved and, here is the result, I am ready to give a detailed description of my favorite podcasts. <br><br>  I will begin to describe podcasts based on their level of complexity, that is, let's go from easy to complex. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>1.</b> The easiest podcast in my opinion - grammar girl <br>  <b>Description:</b> In this podcast, you can hear different stories, small lectures on grammar, animals, how to do something.
