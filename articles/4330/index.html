  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Million Dollar House</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To be honest, it is very interesting for me to follow the absurd ideas that millions of people bring to their authors.  It is pleasant to think that while I am here writing moderately nice little articles, someone at the other side of the world earns a lot of money on nothing, deriving pleasure from it. <br><br>  As you have probably already guessed, I was guided by the next realization of the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlex Tew, about which you have heard more than once.  But I‚Äôm happy to tell you again if someone has forgotten, or has just returned from a two-year expedition to Pluto, having discovered that this is not a planet at all, but merely a figment of the imaginations of scientists. <br><br>  This British student made <a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com/">a Million Dollar Page</a> ‚Äùand sold over a million advertising pixels on it, taking a dollar for each.  As you know, he needed money to study at an expensive British college.  And then, after just a couple of days, clone sites began to appear in all countries of the world, selling advertising space pixels for a dollar, a cent, a euro, and even a ruble for one point.

      Almost a year has passed already, but the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlex Tew does not give rest to many bright minds.  For example, in January of this year, enterprising girl Natasha from St. Petersburg decided to use her body as an advertising platform.  And you can advertise both on <a href="http://isellbody.com/">her website</a> , and to disfigure her real body with your logo.  For example, one hundred square millimeters will cost you a hundred dollars, respectively. <br><br>  And today it became known about a <a href="http://sandberg.nl:16080/artvertising/">huge house</a> in the notorious Dutch city, where everyone can place their logo on 20 (actually 19.99, but we know that this is a common marketing move) dollars for one tile (approximately 35 √ó 29 centimeters).  The entire surface of the building is divided into three zones - one, two and three stars.  Apparently from the photo, Apple, Google, <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> , Mercedes and many other excellent organizations have already noted there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a16/9f8/efe/a169f8efe08a7a9390c5c690f30b6c23.jpg"><br><br>  But is it necessary to say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe notorious British student has already lost all charm.  And the building, and special equipment costs money, and, presumably, decent (this is not a ten-dollar domain and hosting).  Moreover, the creators of Million Dollar Homes do not pursue any beautiful goals: they didn‚Äôt even have enough imagination to pretend to be poor single mothers, as this was done by most of the clone site owners from all countries (most of whom, by the way, failed to collect and two bucks). <br><br>  That is, in general, an absurd idea that brings money, turned into a big business with good contributions and a calculation of payback, which is not at all interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4330/</a></p>
