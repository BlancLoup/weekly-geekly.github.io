      <b>3.8 billion years BC</b> - The beginning of life on Earth.  It is believed that the first cell originated from self-replicating RNA, which later developed in DNA.  DNA is a repository of biological data, genetic information that allows all modern living creatures to function, grow and reproduce themselves.  Or in a different way, we are a backup of our parents.  Hello to the therapist from me. <br><br>  <b>65 million years BC</b> - Dinosaurs, the backup was not made. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52c/479/5fa/52c4795faf244a888b0934c72ff449b0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3200 years BC</b> - The invention of writing.  In order not to forget different things, the ancient Sumerians began to write them down.  Books give a good indication of a recovery point [RPO] (if you have a good chronicler), but the recovery time [RTO] is terrible: the average adult reads at 300 words <b>per minute</b> , too slow. <br><br>  <b>552 years BC</b> - Cyrus the Great remembered the names of all the soldiers of his army, about 10,000 Persians.  An impressive achievement for human memory, but also a bitter lesson about a single point-of-failure.  He was killed in 530 BC, and the information disappeared with him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b67/3bf/fca/b673bffca3984f0d94a0425220a8f9d8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>48 years BC</b> - Fire in the Alexandrian Library.  Among other books from the ‚Äúlist of the 10 most remarkable lost books of all time‚Äù, Aristotle‚Äôs second volume of poetics turned into smoke, and humanity suspected a significant miscalculation in its cunning backup plan: paper is very easily combustible. <br><br>  <b>1347</b> - The first insurance contract known to us was signed in Italian Genoa.  It was great for those who bought and sold goods, as well as owned the property.  But it is difficult to measure the value of information; most people would prefer to return their data instead of receiving compensation for their loss. <br><br>  <b>1436</b> - Johannes Gutenberg, a former jeweler, created the first printing press in Germany.  He used his metalworking skills to make letters from metal, wet them in ink and create a copy on paper.  This greatly accelerated the creation of copies, a serious step towards data recovery. <br><br>  <b>1539</b> - Image-based copying, first steps.  Henry VIII, the king of England, in order to decide who to marry next time, sent the artist Hans Holbein to make a reliable copy of what European princesses look on from his list.  On the basis of the images obtained, Heinrich made a choice and proposed marriage to Anna Klevskoy, but when he saw her personally, he realized that he represented her in a completely different way.  Invalid / corrupted copy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa5/cf4/224/aa5cf4224d5540d3a6d2e4def236778f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>1937</b> - The invention of a photocopier machine.  Successfully and accurately copies documents from the beginning of the 20th century.  Hey, what are these gray spots on paper?  And what about disaster recovery in tropical forests? <br><br>  <b>1949</b> - ‚ÄúManchester Mark I‚Äù opened the era of computers with the program stored in the RAM, the forests of the Amazon basin got a chance to survive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb5/2ec/534/bb52ec534ed44a4981039a2b4b1abd21.jpg"><br><br>  <b>1964</b> - Computers enter the mass market.  At the World Fair in New York, the computer was shown the computer "Programma 101".  One of these computers was used on the Apollo 11, and was, in fact ... a calculator.  "One small step ..." (at the time!) <br><br>  <b>1972</b> - Mainframes make applications and fast data processing accessible to hundreds of people, built-in hardware redundancy provides outstanding recovery performance (RPO and RTO).  The ancient Sumerians would have liked it wildly. <br><br>  <b>1990</b> - Arcserve 1.0 released by Cheyenne software.  The era of distributed computing is on the rise, the main thing is not to forget about backing up to these small rectangular things, called "tapes". <br><br>  <b>1998</b> - VMware was founded in Palo Alto, California.  Although the concept of hypervisors dates back to the 1960s, it was VMware that brought virtualization to the mainstream market.  Virtualization will reverse the backup and disaster recovery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51b/d2c/606/51bd2c6064e34ab4915ca7af8b1be683.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2006</b> - XOsoft's WANsync technology is integrated into Arcserve.  For the first time in the market for medium-sized companies, a single solution appeared for backup and instant switching to a backup system. <br><br>  <b>2008</b> - Microsoft releases a competing product with VMware and calls it Hyper-V.  If you have not been virtualized, then now you will.  Specific software for backup of virtual systems exists, but is poorly integrated with physical servers, copying to tape and is not cross-platform for Microsoft / Linux. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/089/f68/da3089f684354c33a06ee334a621b47f.png"><br><br>  <b>2014</b> - Product Unified Data Protection (UDP) released by Arcserve.  It was specifically designed for virtual environments, VMware, Hyper V and Xen, while remaining comfortable and functional on physical servers.  UDP provides the ability to copy disk images and files, to replicate application data and hot swap to a backup server.  UDP provides enhanced functionality when working with tapes;  compatible with Windows and Linux, physical and virtual;  copies and performs disaster recovery from disks, tapes and from the cloud using a single console;  RPO = 0. RTO = 0. <br><br>  <b>2015</b> - Arcserve UDP wins three awards at VMWorld 2015, including the ‚ÄúGold Disaster Recovery Award and Backup in Virtualized Environments‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest Disaster Recovery Project‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest on Show‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c19/6cc/4bc/c196cc4bc628470dbd394088e3ad0df7.png"><br><br>  <b>2016</b> - You are here. <br><br>  NASA's ‚ÄúCuriosity‚Äù rover confirms the existence of an ancient civilization on Mars: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/phTSKmdFtno%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjphZeP83-V9OmFriVNAnBGyCpxYg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302952/</a></p>
