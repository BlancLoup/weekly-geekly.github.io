Interactivity, access to a large number of applications, large touch screens - all this makes modern smartphones full-fledged workrooms or gaming clubs.  But today, more about the displays.  More precisely, about the material from which they are made.  One of the most durable materials recognized by smartphone makers is Gorilla Glass from Corning Specialty Materials. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of the company began approximately when radio and television were invented.  At the same time, cooperation with electronics manufacturers began.  The development of high-strength materials ahead of its time by several decades: Gorilla Glass became the crown of development.  The process of its implementation stretched as much as 50 years, but the breakthrough was swift and widespread.  It is used by about 20 world-famous manufacturers in more than four hundred models of mobile devices: phones, tablets, laptops, etc.  To date, more than 300 million gadgets equipped with Gorilla Glass have been sold.

Corning experts test not only their own products, but also third-party gadgets to find the best option with the manufacturer. for each individual device.  Such a unified approach gives the owner of the gadget the opportunity to beat him, throw, scratch and destroy in every way, which some of our guests tried with pleasure at the Galaxy S II and Galaxy Tab presentations. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaNWuGtAaxM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYK4OvR-pToBKwr_p3Drr8MbpuTg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  From the video, we understand that deliberate or accidental damage to the screen (within reasonable limits, of course) does not fix it.  As, however, and the device as a whole.  Thus, hitherto, the most vulnerable part of the smartphone has become, practically, a bulletproof vest. <br><br><h5>  How does this work? </h5><br>  Gorilla Glass is made on the basis of aluminosilicate.  The process is based on the effect of high pressure, as a result of which the atoms of glass are ‚Äúpressed‚Äù and acquire the hardness of armor.  The glass is immersed in a bath of molten salt at a temperature of about 400 ¬∞ C.  Sodium ions evaporate, they are replaced by potassium ions.  They are larger in size and, as the glass cools, they begin to press against each other, forming a protective layer on the surface in which the molecules are tightly pressed.  The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows you to make this protective layer thick enough to give the glass strength and scratch resistance.  In addition, studying the habits of end users helps to give the glass the right sensitivity and tactile properties.  Everything is provided down to the impact on the glass of ketchup, lipstick, aftershave, water, and many other household items and products.  The test results showed that Gorilla Glass surpasses all analogues in the market by all indicators and restores optical transparency faster.  Also, due to the new coating, the fingerprint problem has been solved: it is enough to wipe the screen with a microfiber cloth or cotton to completely clean the surface. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5008/samsungrussia.5c/0_66197_1131c2c4_L.jpg" width="360" height="240"><br><br>  In the end, Gorilla Glass has only two, but decisive advantages: it is thin and durable.  And this is what makes it the best solution for mobile devices with touch screens.  Impact resistance and reliability tested and demonstrated by a variety of tests.  Particularly curious izuvereni have to put a lot of effort to still break the glass, whose thickness varies from 0.5 to 2 mm.  It may be even thinner depending on the needs of the industry.  Thinner is not needed yet, but an increase in thickness can lead to curious developments: why not make one-piece cases from Gorilla Glass, for example? <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5707/samsungrussia.5c/0_66194_18a514b4_L.jpg" width="500" height="333"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121972/</a></p>
