The remote, of course, is good, but not a single remote control is controlled by a truly <i>smart</i> TV. <br><br>  Users of Android-based smartphones can get full access to their LG TVs with the Smart TV feature using our updated LG TV Remote App.  It is about him today and will be discussed, and if you think that in such an application is not very interesting, and the topic is advertising - look under the cat, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  ;) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To study the problem of console construction, perhaps, it is worth starting with the study of the origins of the TV remote control. <br>  Probably, when only remote control systems appeared (still wired), they seemed to be the height of the evolution of the convenience of operating a TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcf/871/9af/dcf8719afedd4d2934f4367ec166b2c3.jpg"><br>  <sup>Although, looking at the picture, it is difficult to believe that <b>this</b> remote was convenient.</sup> <br>  True, the TV itself was small and ‚Äúpot-bellied‚Äù at that time, but this has nothing to do with the matter.  Later, consoles based on infrared LEDs and radio wave transmission consoles appeared, but their basic form of ‚Äúbrick with buttons‚Äù underwent only minor changes in the shape of the brick itself and the arrangement of buttons on it.  What functionality was originally laid by the creators of this remote, so you were content throughout the life of this TV.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/689/f25/2b7/689f252b791276abe216e9fda2f9b818.jpg"><br><br>  Usually, however, they immediately stuff "everything that is," and this makes the consoles start to look weird and weigh inhumanly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae0/25b/624/ae025b624092e3f7780fd7ae67b50c9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How to replace the remote from the TV? </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreplacing the remote from the TV to the smartphone began to ask for itself exactly at the moment when smart TVs appeared, and smartphones became an integral part of modern society, like a car or the Internet.  On the touch screen, you can display what you need, and all the ‚Äúextra‚Äù can be easily hidden in a drawer, a separate screen or a submenu.  Well, good thoughts are usually someone who embodies it, especially since the company has experience in smartphone construction and one of the best Smart TV systems on the market. <br><br><h4>  Lg remote app </h4><br>  An application that anyone can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.lge.tv.remoteapps%26feature%3Dsearch_result">download</a> on the Google Play Market is much more than just a remote control.  It is a flight control center and a supermarket in one bottle.  Opportunities for this platform - the sea, almost all the Smart TV-content can be controlled from the screen of your smartphone. <br>  The main menu, applications and premium services, content via Smart Share, settings and other features are available directly from the application.  There is no need even to open the menu on the TV, all the information is on the screen of the device that is in your hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/369/db8/dba/369db8dba144a7b4303a0c146cf42e43.jpg"><br><br>  The application supports full-text universal search, which doesn't care anymore, search among applications, services, games or in the program guide: enter the first letters, choose what you are looking for, and launch / read with one touch.  You can also forget about not the most convenient text input in the browser, social network applets and just in the calendar - the keyboard of your smartphone (or tablet, on tablets, everything will work too) becomes the main input method for the TV.  In the case, if you still need to work with the screen cursor - it makes no sense to put the smartphone aside.  A virtual touchpad (and, we hope, in the future - also an accelerator-based virtual remote control) - is at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d14/5d0/552/d145d05527e27e44301b181ebaa5426e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b5/389/3e8/5b53893e8bb4e89c9d9cca91b69ba1bf.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to all this, this ‚Äúsmart remote‚Äù also receives feedback options: broadcasting a TV program to a smartphone or tablet (even to another room), screenshots at any time and convenient control of the TV in gaming applications and the browser, access to everything you need. a couple of "clicks" on the screen without interrupting the playback of current content.  Such ordinary remotes never even dreamed of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a3b/67d/cae/a3b67dcae767f902476c3b795dbe6de7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06b/6ee/e18/06b6eee186a8aab61d35e83c4f980dc4.jpg"><br><br>  You can download and test the application in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.lge.tv.remoteapps%26feature%3Dsearch_result">Google Play Store</a> .  This application is compatible with all models of 2012, last year‚Äôs TVs will work with a simplified version of the program, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.clipcomm.WiFiRemocon%26feature%3Dmore_from_developer">LG TV Remote 2011</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158805/</a></p>
