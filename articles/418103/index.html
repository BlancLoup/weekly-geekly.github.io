We are talking about cells, about microorganisms, about former life. ‚Äù

      The Russian-European mission ‚ÄúExoMars‚Äù should help to get closer to the answer to this question. <br><br><h4>  Rogozin thinks how to protect the Earth from asteroids </h4><br>  The second interesting task, according to the head of Roscosmos, is to protect the Earth from asteroids.  Here, Rogozin remembered the film ‚ÄúArmageddon‚Äù with Bruce Willis: ‚ÄúBut seriously speaking, there are no such technologies, and will we have time to create them since the moment of detection of danger to our planet, will we have enough time and knowledge to create such technology?  I think about it, I don‚Äôt know how to get close to this idea, ‚Äùthe head of the Russian space corporation shared his doubts.  ‚ÄúOne thing I know for sure is that this should be an international project.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow astronomers do not see some celestial bodies that dangerously approach the Earth.  But this they do not see now, and tomorrow, for example, they will see.  Do we have the technology of rejecting the trajectory of a dangerous approach? ‚ÄùHe asks a rhetorical question. <br><br>  The official called the protection of the Earth from asteroids "true universal human values." <br><br><h4>  Lunar station with deep drilling system </h4><br>  At the meeting, there were also new data that were not previously reported by the media.  In particular, Rogozin <a href="https://ria.ru/space/20180723/1525152930.html">told reporters</a> that Russia could create a lunar automatic station with a system for drilling soil to a depth of four meters.  The drill for this station is already being developed by students of the educational center "Sirius". <br><br>  According to the current plans of Roskosmos, in 2022, the Luna-27 station is planned to be launched to the satellite, but its drilling rig is limited to only two meters in depth, so the new invention will come in handy. <br><br><h4>  School companions </h4><br>  The meeting focused on research and education satellites collected by students in conjunction with specialists from Sputniks based on the OrbiCraft-Pro nanosatellite platform developed by the company.  The payload of the apparatus is a detector of cosmic particles.  The sensor was developed by the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University and assembled with the participation of a group of schoolchildren from the Sirius educational center. <br><br>  As <a href="https://ria.ru/space/20180723/1525140223.html">reported</a> , the satellites should launch into orbit the Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Prokopiev during the spacewalk on August 15, 2018.  During yesterday‚Äôs event, schoolchildren even <a href="http://tass.ru/kosmos/5396921">held a communication session with</a> Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Prokopiev, who are on board the ISS. <br><br>  In addition, the guys from "Sirius" are developing small satellites for remote sensing of the Earth and measuring radiation.  It is planned to launch them with the ISS, and as an associated load on the missiles with other devices. <br><br>  However, Rogozin spoke in favor of strict control when launching space technology: ‚ÄúThere are many schools in the country, you never know, schoolchildren can shove, you see, there are various schoolchildren,‚Äù he joked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64f/67b/9dc/64f67b9dc065e3e2daf1cd6832186b57.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The first rocket Rogozin </h4><br>  Dmitry Rogozin proved that it is not for nothing that he is in charge of the Russian space industry.  It turns out that he has a wealth of experience in this area: ‚ÄúDo you know when I went to the space circle?  At six years old.  I made my first rocket with a teacher at the age of six, ‚Äù <a href="https://ria.ru/space/20180723/1525140223.html">said</a> Rogozin. <br><br>  As a child, Rogozin was fond of astronautics, and this was a common hobby among Soviet children.  Unfortunately, the situation has now changed: ‚ÄúWe have fewer young people in Roskosmos than in other industries: less than in aviation, less than in shipbuilding ... Therefore, Roskosmos now will absorb a lot of young specialists like a sponge,‚Äù the head of Roscosmos <a href="http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/news/36731/">promised</a> made his career a <a href="https://bit.ly/2mHo4cA">lot of promises</a> .  - We want to make Roskosmos open doors somewhere in the first weeks, in the middle of September, in order to start acquainting the guys who are engaged here (in Sirius) with real production, with the problems of this real production, honestly say what we need.  Because I want them to understand where they can go, what they should prepare for. ‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  <b>A warning at the request of the site administration:</b> ‚ÄúWhen commenting on this material, please follow the rules.
