  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Annual Report Habrapost - 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/871/1e7/5e2/8711e75e224e4e5ca354e8e16d13fd7c.jpg"><br>  The past 2015 was not easy.  Similarly from 2016;  The next prime number in the annual sequence will be 2017. But, we admit, it was not this mathematical collision that created the editorial offices of the Intel blog the biggest problems.  Our harmonious system of statistics, traditionally published in the New Year holidays, stumbled over the reform in Habr√©;  after its reproduction by budding, it became absolutely incomprehensible what and how to count.  In shock, we even missed the previous year, but this time we decided to take it in hand - because they are traditions to observe them. <br>  So, about the calculation of statistics in the transition period (when the road behaves as in that bearded joke and on the KDPV), and, of course, about the very best posts for 2015, as well as the New Year's contest, and will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúThe trouble will inadvertently descend when you do not expect it at all,‚Äù - so it seems, it was sung in an old song?  Intel lived on a blog, didn‚Äôt torment, released posts, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/206786/">summed</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/164223/">up</a> , and suddenly, without a declaration of war, Habra was divided into parts, and there were more blogs, and there were fewer views, advantages, comments, and everything else.  And it's not so bad.  Intel‚Äôs blog was artificially divided into two parts;  artificially - because many posts in their content should have been on both Habr√© and GeekTimes, and turned out to be only in one tape, which, of course, also influenced the ratings. <br><br>  Our first thought was to introduce a coefficient that takes into account the numerical changes in the indicators of posts before and after separation.  But the trouble - it was not so easy to calculate.  And although the length of time to today seemed to be sufficient, the patterns were not traceable.  But to deal with extremely noisy data with a giant dispersion is somehow not Intel-like.  Judging sensibly, we came to the not quite satisfying us, but it seems that the only possible solution is to leave everything as it is and somehow live with it, considering the emergence of a new blogging system as a starting point, but not forgetting the old glorious times.  Yes, 2013 seems now an unattainable dream ... but, but we have something to strive for. <br><br>  On this let me consider the lyrical preface completed.  We now turn to, in fact, statistics.  I remind you, the apocalypse came in October 2014.  2015 - the first full year after the reform.  We will not share the results of Habrahabr and GeekTimes - we were told that this is a single blog.

The authors, employees of the company continue to write interesting posts, the number of posts has increased significantly due to transfers from the English-speaking resources of Intel.  But do not say that for us these transfers are 'free'.  Firstly, an interesting blog article has yet to be found (try to walk around the Intel sites for developers), then translate, report back and edit it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f4/550/721/0f4550721a54425e9fc0750ee3e44e71.png"><br><br>  But with the ratings, as already mentioned, everything is sad.  However, we will still keep in mind: "+1" of the sample of 2013 and 2015 - these are completely different plus points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/2a1/217/15e2a1217cf94ec68cfe33a5cfb1581f.png"><br><br>  With indicators of the community, too, everything is not very well.  The most annoying thing is that GeekTimes is dragging Habrahabr down ... but we will not say anything about it. <br>  Nevertheless, the number of subscribers to both blogs over the year increased by about a thousand people, which, undoubtedly, we add to our assets. <br><br>  We now turn to the most-most. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Top rated post</i> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/248279/">Intel IoT Practicum.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/248279/">Galileo Gen2 - First acquaintance</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/avstepanov/" class="user_link">avstepanov</a> author </li><li>  <i>The most commented post</i> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/258779/">Reach: GPS accurate to the centimeter</a> by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/saul/" class="user_link">Saul</a> </li><li>  <i>Most Favorite Post</i> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/265679/">Creating artificial intelligence for games - from design to optimization</a> , by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vikky13/" class="user_link">vikky13</a> </li><li>  <i>Maximum views</i> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/258495/">About data transfer via audio jack</a> , by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/coopermaster/" class="user_link">CooperMaster</a> </li></ul><br><br>  And, in conclusion, a few words about the contest among readers held in December.  First, it was a pleasant surprise for us the number of respondents.  Yes, of course, we follow our audience, we know the most active commentators in the face, but in order to be so friendly ... we are very pleased, honestly.  The second truth revealed to us will seem trivial to someone: experience is needed in every case.  The competition in the recent history of the blog, we held the first time, there was no one to make mistakes before us, and we did it ourselves. <br><br>  It turns out that the law formulated back in the time of Murphy: ‚Äúif you can be misunderstood, then it will happen exactly like this‚Äù - just about the originators of the competition questions.  For example, asking the question: ‚ÄúWhich network cards with which interfaces did this first appear for Intel?‚Äù, We were in no way prepared for the majority to respond to ‚ÄúPCI Express‚Äù.  After all, we had in mind the network interfaces that appeared in 2015.  But they did not explicitly spell out the word ‚Äúnetworked‚Äù, and the thought of the respondents went the other way (to the wrong one, by the way, since in terms of PCI Express, Intel has not yet come up with anything new).  And the correct answer is 40G and 100G Ethernet. <br><br>  Another problematic question: "How many days have we published a post describing all sorts of sensors that can be connected to Intel Edison right now?"  Here it was necessary to emphasize that there is a post entirely devoted to sensors for Edison.  Not everyone found it among other posts about the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù, including those describing the connection of individual sensors.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/261123/">Here it is</a> .  Well, the most difficult was, as expected, the question about the number of hackathons.  There were only three of them, believe me: one in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/254057/">Nizhny Novgorod</a> , the second in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/261747/">St. Petersburg</a> and the third in <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/intel/blog/266394/">Moscow</a> . <br>  Note that all complex questions were evaluated in a special way: the correct answer was considered a bold plus, and the wrong one was a minor minus.  We will not dwell on simple ones, everything is clear with them.  All winners have already been notified by e-mail, in January our prizes will go to them. <br><br>  So, wish us good posts in the already difficult 2016 year.  And to you, in turn, creative successes and professional moves! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274379/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274379/</a></p>
