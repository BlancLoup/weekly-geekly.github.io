And what's wrong with modern headhunters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret that programmers are now in demand, and finding a job as a programmer with experience is not difficult.  Demand is now more supply. <br>  In this post I want to describe my experience and observations that I made after undergoing several interviews.  I would be glad if it is read not only by applicants, but also by employers. <br><br>  <i>A little disclamer.</i>  <i>I am a programmer and write from the point of view of a programmer.</i>  <i>I'm not looking for a job right now.</i>  <i>I do not represent or advertise any of the companies mentioned in this post.</i>  <i>I received an offer from about 6 of 9 companies where I had an interview.</i>  <i>I do not see anything wrong with openly writing the names of some companies, because they themselves do not make secrets of their activities and openly publish their vacancies.</i>  <i>From my hands no headhunter was hurt.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After several years of working as an office programmer, I gained some experience, knowledge, and a desire to try myself in some of the adjacent roles ‚Äî a team leader or a senior developer.  It was not a prerequisite - I was not opposed to getting an ordinary programmer in a strong team, but there was one important condition: the project should have been interesting for me and benefit people.  But this is not about this post, but about the actual job search process. <br><br>  Here we have a summary on hh.ru and / or a profile on My Circle, where we described the technologies we worked with and some of our experience.  We indicated in the resume that we are now looking for a job and are looking at vacancies together with interest.

    <h4>  Recruitment Agencies </h4><br>  The first thing we encounter is headhunters.  Scourge IT-present.  They fly at you <s>like flies on shit</s> - after all, for each job seeker they receive very substantial money.  And it would be okay if there was any benefit from them, but in fact, 95% percent of them do not cost their money, and instead of benefit bring only harm. <br><br>  <b>Dear employers, please, I beg you, do not use the services of these dubious offices at all, or at least look for a decent office.</b>  <b>If you have such an opportunity, set aside a part of your programmer or team lead time for interviewing job seekers.</b> <br><br>  Most of these headhunters have the following features: <br><ul><li>  in principle, they do not have a programming domain; </li><li>  they very vaguely represent what the company needs from you; </li><li>  they do not represent at all what the company does, and what, in fact, the project to which you are invited. </li></ul><br>  However, they: <br><ul><li>  Often they do not even give the text of a vacancy or give it in a general form (only the requirements); </li><li>  Do not say the name of the company and its address, because they are afraid that you will get there past them. </li></ul><br>  <b>Dear employers, if you missed my last paragraph, a request to you, then I beg you, I beg you, do not use the services of these dubious offices in general, or at least look for a decent office.</b>  <b>Such offices not only take the time of programmers and drive potential employees away from you, but also spoil the image of you as an employer.</b> <br><br>  Among the many such pseudo-offices, I want to single out one particular.  PRUFFI.  In addition to the general incompetence of their headhunter girls in IT matters, I was faced with some familiarity in communicating on the part of several of their employees and an absolute disregard for all the norms of human communication on the part of one of them.  She did not ruthlessly spam me with her suggestions, calling me completely different names (just copy-paste letters), but even more than that, she thought of sending a message to my friends on VKontakte asking her to urgently give her my phone for a very important matter.  As a result, one morning I received a call from several friends asking ‚Äúcan some strange girl give your telephone number?‚Äù. <br><br>  With many other free headhunters, I most often had a similar - negative or "no" - experience.  He just did not remember me something particularly bright. <br><br>  But in fairness, I want to say that there was a positive experience.  There were some good headhunters who I remembered for their goodwill (sincere, not sweet), high qualifications and a good sense of humor.  For example, headhunters from the company ‚ÄúGeneralist‚Äù (‚ÄúSvyaznoy‚Äù works with them) described concrete projects to which I was invited in great detail.  They introduced me to the activities and plans of the companies whose vacancies they offer are as detailed as if they themselves work in them, and not at the last posts.  And, not least, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãweb development is also at the level.  They know that Postgres and MySQL are databases, and that experience with these technologies can be interchangeable.  They know which technologies belong to the backend, which ones belong to the front end, and ask competent questions. <br><br>  Although you know, I would still prefer to communicate with a representative of the company I am settling in, and not with a recruiting agency. <br><br><h4>  Actually, the interview. </h4><br>  <b>Dear employers, before inviting for an interview, please take the time to tell who you are, what you do, what you want from the developer and what you are ready to give him.</b>  <b>This will save time - yours and others.</b> <br><br>  In fact, in this area, everything is much more positive.  Conducting a thorough screening at the employers search level, I already came across mostly positive people at the interviews. <br>  I liked to communicate with Svyaznoy, Imkhonet, GdeEtotDom companies and many others.  Most often there was a very productive 1-2-3 hour conversation with a timlide or several, interesting to both parties.  I was not asked why the manhole cover is round.  More and more interested in, what is all the same abstract class is different from the interface :) <br>  Sometimes during the interview they offered small written tests, so that there was something to talk about. <br><br>  Only in Yutinet / Megaplane I was met not by technicians, but by personnel officers who offered to write me a test for 30 minutes on some bit of the table, where couriers and other applicants for different positions wrote their tests.  With further communication, this company showed itself only with the best in all matters, and I would even say that in many respects it can be a standard in the organization and work of development departments.  But my first wish was to offer personnel officers to shove this test somewhere.  Against the background of other companies where tmlids meet a new developer as a potential member of their future team and an assistant in solving their problems, the approach ‚Äúhere is a piece of paper for you - sit decide or goodbye‚Äù (despite the fact that you yourself have invited) looks pretty sad. <br><br><h4>  My experience, which may be useful to applicants </h4><br><ol><li>  Decide for yourself what you need as accurately as possible.  It doesn't matter if it‚Äôs an interesting job, a lot of money, an interesting team, professional and career growth, an office across the road or a month-long vacation - decide what you need and look for work from these priorities.  Work with exact requirements is much faster than with abstract ones. </li><li>  Formulate all your requirements and do not forget to tell the employer about this.  If you work only on a poppy, or you need open windows, if you sometimes want to work at home or are used to having rest for more than two weeks in a row, it‚Äôs better to say this right away than to hope that these issues will be resolved along the way.  They can decide, and can become a stumbling block, which then turn into conflicts and discontent. </li><li>  Often, if a specialist of your level has an average market salary of 100 thousand, then you can find a company that for some reason is ready to pay no more than 80 and agree on some buns, such as part-time work, freer schedule or part-time work. </li></ol><br><br>  I would be very happy if what I wrote helps someone.  I wish you all a good day, job seekers find an interesting job, and employers good employees. <br><br>  <u><b>Update</b></u>  Still, I do not understand Habr.  Totally.  Once upon a time, in 2009, I wrote an article about multithreading in PHP.  From a professional point of view, she was mediocre, but I put my soul and all my knowledge into it at that time.  I zaminusovali, and the article had to be deleted.  Now I have written an article about nothing.  More precisely, that, and so everyone knows.  He embellished several suss-musu from his adventures.  And he was morally prepared for the fact that they would again me zaminusyut.  And suddenly the article is the best in 24 hours ... So many advantages, comments, additions to favorites. <br>  People, what did I write so valuable?  Maybe I just did not understand myself yet? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148388/</a></p>
