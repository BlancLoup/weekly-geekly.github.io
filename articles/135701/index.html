Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/135575/">first part</a> I tried to give an understanding on how to choose a customer / performer for the project.  Naturally, in one article there is no possibility to list everything that one has to face, but I tried to describe the basics. <br><br>  As it was correctly noted in the comments, such important points as interaction during the project and payment for work are not described.  We will make the payment in a separate post, but now I would like to talk about how to conduct the project.  Again, not being the ultimate truth, I do not say that you do this way and not otherwise.  It was just that this experience was rendered on the basis of mistakes, and in my case these rules help to live. <br><br>  Well, from words to deeds

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br><br>  This time I will not write separately for the customer and the freelancer, because most of the points are true for both parties.  If something will concern only one side, I will try to isolate it separately. <br><br><h4>  Getting started </h4><br><br>  So we get to work.  At this stage there are two important points, which I try not to neglect.  The first is to let the customer understand / understand that the freelancer is not an employee in the office.  Although the customer pays the contractor money, and the contractor does the work, but to treat the freelancer as an employee on a salary is stupid.  By this thesis, I mean the relationship "I am the boss - you are subordinate."  If you are a customer, forget this wording for the time being.  If the freelancer - seeing this in the early stages of the project - end the relationship.  You make it your task to make it clear to the client that you are not his property, safely asking ... if the project will be in any case unprofitable - both by nerves and by means. <br><br>  A good question is - how can you make it clear that you are a professional, whom you turned to as a companion, and not as a stupid draftsman / writer?  It is difficult to explain, it comes with experience, but there are a few rules.  By the way, these rules are also applicable to customers, because if the contractor decides that ‚Äúwell, how can I do it for you‚Äù, then this will lead to the option ‚Äúorder from a relative‚Äù that does not lead to anything good, as practice shows .  So: <br><ul><li>  avoid cronyism </li><li>  try to communicate politely, but within the framework of the case.  Do not tamper with each other for the sake of "just talk" </li><li>  use special terms, but be ready to explain them in an accessible and understandable manner. </li></ul><br><br>  The second thing you should pay attention to is the TK.  In whatever form.  Whether it is a text description or sketches or a prototype - it is important, unless you are writing a simple calculator (under the calculator, I mean not a calculator for the site, but one that is Start - Standard ...).  As practice shows, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you how it should be, what for us extra writings‚Äù is practically a sentence to the project.  Having such a description of the task, the chance of successful completion is 10-20%.  Do not be lazy to ask for the TZ, do not be lazy to write the TZ, and if you, as a freelancer, refuse to provide it, offer to do it yourself.  If TK turns into something that is running like a plague, leave that project without regret. <br><br>  As for the contract for the execution of works, then here is exclusively for your consideration.  Someone needs it, someone just needs words.  Do not be alarmed if the customer asks for a contract - this is normal.  The only time - if the contract is signed, carefully read its content.  If something is not clear - contact a lawyer.  You can plunge into two times, think about it - do you need it?  The contract should be as transparent and understandable.  Ideal to have your own template. <br><br><h4>  While working </h4><br><br>  If during work you have any doubts about contacting you, then immediately stock up on alternative means of communication.  Mail, and better phone.  Send an SMS, and ask under any plausible pretext to say its content or the last digits of the number.  Pretend a pretext for yourself. <br><br>  If during work the performer disappeared for an indefinite time, then it is worth seeing what the project is.  If the work is small, and the timing is not too tight - feel free to look for a new one.  I have always been moved by the excuses of the form ‚Äúthe internet has ended‚Äù and their ilk.  If a person is professionally engaged in freelancing, then he has duplicate means of communication.  I, for example, except for home Internet, have Internet telephone (who do not have it now), modems from the skull and MTS.  In an extreme case, to clear the conscience, you can try to hook a person through all available means of communication.  Freelance site, mail, ICQ, Skype and phone.  Clear conscience, go to another artist. <br><br>  A good way to awaken from a hibernation freelancer is a negative review.  It helps, but the guarantee is 30 percent. <br><br>  As for the customer, then everything is somewhat more complicated in terms of what work is being done, and you are losing money.  Therefore, it is necessary to immediately discuss with the customer that in case of his loss of work will be suspended at the discretion of the contractor.  A good help is a phased payment - adding the inconvenience in terms of more iterations of acceptance / delivery, allows you to not lose a lot of money. <br><br><h4>  Autumn </h4><br><br>  So we have called the moments when the customer suddenly punches on something that is not included in the TK, but it is absolutely necessary and important.  Presenting two sides simultaneously, I took the following rule for myself: <br><br>  <i>If there is no debate with the customer / executor, then the performance of such works is possible only if they are insignificant compared to the rest of the scope of work.</i> <br><br>  In case there is friction with the customer during work, then you should refuse to perform the finishing touch flatly.  But even if you are doing the work for thanks - focus on this.  Those.  agreeing to perform some improvements as part of the payment, do not be lazy to clarify that since the modifications are minor, you agree to carry them out as a ‚Äúgift from the company‚Äù.  Anyone, even the most remarkable customer, can instantly become the most awful, if you miss this moment. <br><br>  In addition, I believe that before starting work it is worth discussing that we perform work in the framework of the TOR.  The discrepancy with the task is not allowed at no extra charge.  Let this be understood as precisely as possible, and if you suddenly suspect that this condition is accepted with a creak, this is another reason to think. <br><br>  If you have decided not to perform the work that you are forced to perform for free, stand on your own to the last.  Naturally, at the same time, your conscience must be clear - if there are jambs on the project, then the performance of unspecified works is a way to improve relations. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135701/</a></p>
