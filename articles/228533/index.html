      Let's make our quiz that uses the needs of the main types of players: <br><ul><li>  <b>"Killers"</b> - those who hunt for complex issues and gets pleasure from it. </li><li>  <b>"Munchkins"</b> - this subtype of players needs recognition of coolness in social ways.  Points are more important than questions. </li><li>  <b>"Achiverov"</b> - these guys are important to sort through all the quests of the game.  In the quiz, they want to sort out all the questions and find out the answers to them out of curiosity.  For them - a special category of questions. </li><li>  <b>"Adventurers"</b> - those who are looking for social interactions, and, most likely, do not know how to answer questions.  For them, we make a bluff. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  let's play </h4><br>  The rules are simple.  It is necessary to answer questions with numbers, trying to get more accurate.  Read the questions, think no more than a minute, open the spoiler to check the answer.  Like this: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If the mass of a person on Earth is 100 kg, what will be its mass on Jupiter?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  100 kg.  If you do not understand why, it is worth repeating the school course of physics. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the largest number of parts that will divide the circle 4 straight lines?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  11 fragments </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the probability that in a group of 60 people the two of them will have the same date and month of birth (as a percentage)?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ~ 99% (a great example of how probability theory is perceived unintuitively) </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In which year did the first computer virus appear?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Working examples of virus programs appeared in 1961, 10 years after the theory of the principles of their work.  The first viruses were not malicious, but simply proved their ability to multiply within the system - McIlroy et al.  Darwin, a Game of Survival of the Fittest among Programs.  The very first PC-compatible viruses appeared 1981 for the Apple II platform. </div></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Questions on thinking </h4><br>  Since, according to the rules, it is enough just to get closest to the answer, many questions should be answered approximately, quickly evaluating options on your fingers.  It's like in project management: you will never have a complete set of data, but the ability to quickly figure out with an accuracy of 5-10% helps a lot.  Try it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the maximum number of horses that can be placed on a chessboard so that they are not under attack from each other?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  32 horses.  Here you need to imagine the field and understand that the horse always hits a cage of a different color.  Here are 32 peaceful horses: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/9a0/d57/3c49a0d5779169f9c38641b9c500f729.gif"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In what year was the first level ru domain officially approved?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In 1994.  If we recall the year of the appearance of the Runet, it is easy to get a close answer. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Everest height is 8848 meters.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">The first ascent took place on May 29, 1953.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">What was the height of the highest mountain on the planet before?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  8848 meters.  Seriously. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Russia is the largest country in the world.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">What percentage of sushi does it take?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  12.5%.  Russia surpasses South America in size.  On our territory can fit 45 Japan. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many fingers does a cat have?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  18 fingers, 10 on the front paws and 8 on the back.  Have a healthy cat. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the average mass of a human head?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  3.6 kg.  This question gave a huge scatter of answers on the tests. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many liters of water will flow out of a regular water tap in a day, if the jet is needle-wide?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  840 liters.  It is clear that the size of the needle is a very inaccurate value, but I remind you that we do not need an exact answer.  Order is important - and rarely did anyone write more than a pair of buckets on tests. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What percentage of the mass of the solar system is the sun?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  99% </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">When were the Olympic Games held, on the emblem of which the year was indicated in five digits?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Second Martian, it is a pity that you missed them.  But seriously, when I asked this question, players of CPGs - first they considered all the points about five numbers and came to the conclusion about the Romans, and then they remembered the year of games in Italy.  The answer is 1960. The Olympiad was held in Rome - the number ‚Äú1960‚Äù was recorded as MCMLX. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The Rubik's Cube Algorithm for the smallest number of moves was called the ‚ÄúGod Algorithm‚Äù.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">How many moves are there?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  20 moves.  Given the scatter of answers, it is enough to remember that records are measured in seconds - and the order will be immediately. </div></div><br><br><h4>  Questions on erudition </h4><br>  These are standard quiz questions, where you don‚Äôt need to count or think a lot - you just need to remember some fact or at least the order of the answer number. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the sum of all the numbers on the roulette?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  666 </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How long did the Hundred Years War last?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  116 years old.  The next question is: is it true that Microsoft is doing little software? </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many percent of the human genome coincides with the mouse genome?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Institute of General Genetics says - 90% </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many authorship certificates for inventions does Mikhail Kalashnikov have?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The base of patents of the USSR - 35 certificates </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the international dialing code of Antarctica?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  672 </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How long does it take for the human brain to accurately recognize an image or object fixed by a look (in ms)?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  5 ms - Juan S. Oddities of our body.  Interesting anatomy.  - M .: Ripol classic, 2010. </div></div><br><br><h4>  Questions on expanding the boundaries of knowledge </h4><br>  It is assumed that the answer to these questions does not know any of the ordinary players.  This is necessary because the game mechanics also bet on the most correct answer in your opinion - and so that players can bluff a bit, such questions are introduced.  They are selected so that the answers a bit surprised - and immediately brought some useful information, expanding the picture of the world.  These questions are very popular with achivors and adventurers.  The latter, for example, is the fact that it is possible to discuss the age of Juliet and contemporary mores. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">At what temperature of food (¬∞ C) does a person perceive taste most acutely?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The MSU information and research portal reports that at 24 ¬∞ C.

That is, your topic will begin to ply no earlier than 2 minutes per page after publication. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many types of bacteria are transmitted from one person to another when kissing?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The World Health Organization claims that there are about 278 species of bacteria.

We consider not only land species. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What place did Charlie Chaplin take in the Charlie Chaplin doubles competition in Monte Carlo?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  III place.  Noble troll. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many years will it take to skim through all the books of the Lenin Library?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  leninka.ru - 79 years without sleep and rest </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the diameter of the world's largest globe?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Guinness.  World Records 2011 - 12.5 m. The globe occupies a three-story atrium in an office building in the United States.  But this is not the headquarters of the X-team. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The most populous metro station is in Japan.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">How many people does she serve daily?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  HSE - 491,958 people. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many teeth does a snail have?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  25 thousand teeth.

Some guys have marked our planet as an apple in the store. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">At what distance does the male Astias selene butterfly smell the female?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  11 km - Guinness.  For some reason it seems to me that it is worth digging in this direction when developing security terminals. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the mass in grams of the smallest animal on the planet?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Full illustrated encyclopedia.  "Mammals" D. McDonald - 1 gram.

It seems to me that they should be answered on time and in detail, while there is such a great chance. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How old was Juliet Capulet?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  14 years old. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many stories about Sherlock Holmes did Arthur Conan Doyle write?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  56 stories.  This is the same question, after which someone will go and reread a couple in the subway. </div></div><br><br><h4>  Closing needs </h4><br>  Let's look at the needs chart: <br><ul><li>  "Killer" finds questions on erudition and thinking, getting a buzz from what he <b>knows</b> . </li><li>  For the "Munchkin" procured mechanics rates not to your answer.  Using the basic knowledge of the theory of probability (associated with the expectation), he may well win without even knowing the question. </li><li>  "Achiver" drags on questions of the expansion of consciousness. </li><li>  "Adventurer" rejoices at the desk and the fact that you can bluff in some matters.  For example, the question ‚ÄúWhat percentage of hockey players lost at least one tooth on the ice?‚Äù Is clearly difficult to give an exact answer.  An adventurer can happily smile and say - ‚ÄúOh, and I just read the report of the Olympic Committee of the Russian Federation yesterday‚Äù - and write a number from the baldies, for example, 98%.  And rejoice that everyone will bet on it, while other players will write 99%, 95% and so on.  Immediately enjoy the "killer", put on 50% - because the correct answer is 68%. </li></ul><br>  In general, I must say, the game is very interesting exactly the latest phenomenon.  To explain how this works, you need to get a little distracted and tell about the field.  See: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdf/889/f79/bdf889f7919722d4f44ebfdd71b5f482.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Mechanics:</b> <br><ol><li>  Players get a question. </li><li>  Write the answer options on the cards and put them upside down (independent decision making). </li><li> Open the cards and arrange them descending on the field.  The further the card from the center - the higher the reward for betting on it. </li><li>  Players make bets on the answer that seems right to them (dependent decision making - bets are made openly). </li></ol><br><h4>  Does the bet of other players on your bet? </h4><br>  Yes, and how.  We connect one more fine algorithm of our vetver, important for a society survival.  It seems that we have inherited since the time of the monkeys.  Namely - the more people make a decision, the more correct it is. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : the mined comments are minus and further, the negative comments - plus and further.  It is extremely rare for a commentary to change polarity, except as a result of an unexpected turn of discussion or in a holivar when reinforcements arrive.  The fact is that considering a comment with a rating of -10, we, on the whole, come up with a presupposition ‚Äúit is interesting that there is something bad in it‚Äù and begin to look for the bad.  Agree, it is much easier to find when you specifically search for it. <br><br>  So, in the study "Opinions and social pressure." Asha in 1955, remarkable results were obtained.  The group was given two pieces of paper - with one segment and three.  Among the three segments, it was exactly the same in length as the reference, shorter by about 20% and longer by about 20%.  The task was to find the source, comparing the paper.  A group of 8 people (7 addicts and 1 test person) correctly answered the first N series of experiments.  Then, when the testee was convinced that the group gave the same answers as he, the most interesting part began.  In the next experiment, the whole group (7 addicts) clearly pointed to a shorter segment, which could not be exactly the same as the reference one.  The test subject first slightly went nuts, then went on more strongly, then discussed this with the group, then gave the answer. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I bet you won‚Äôt guess how many times the group urged the test subject that the deliberately wrong answer was correct?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  75% of the subjects came to an agreement with the group after a long discussion.  In the case where the discussion was shortened, the generalized result is a third of the subjects.  Each of the subjects was tested on the eye and the ability to assess the length of the lines - the error in this is not more than 2%. </div></div><br><br>  Then a series of experiments were conducted (for example, ‚ÄúSex variable in conforming behavior‚Äù in 1971), showing that: <br><ol><li>  People with a good social graph are more likely to agree with the group.  Singles rely on their opinions. </li><li>  People with technical education on average are less prone to such manipulations (for, I think, for obvious reasons). </li><li>  The results depend on the cultural traditions of the people of the subject. </li></ol><br>  This is nothing more than social proof, which I have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/219351/">spoken about</a> in relation to sales. <br><br>  So, back to the game.  At the bets step, the coolest begins - you can directly feel how your opinion changes depending on the expectations of the group.  Few people bet on their answer if it is at the edge of the field (even with a big bet and the conviction that the answer is correct). <br><br>  Let's try.  Here are 5 quiz questions.  Can you understand which group gives the wrong answers without looking under the spoilers? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the chance of winning a winning combination in Solitaire Solitaire?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Answers: 95%, 80%, 97%, 99%, 100%</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Correct - 100% </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the highest speed developed by the car?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Answers: 900 km / h, 950 km / h, 800 km / h, 890 km / h, 950 km / h</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Andy Green on the car Thrust SSC, October 15, 1997, Nevada desert - 1227 km / h.  Also this guy is known for being the first to break the sound barrier on land. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What percentage of the territory of the Russian Federation is suitable for a comfortable permanent residence?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Answers: 70, 50, 60, 55, 70.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  15% </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many dollars did the most expensive domain ever sell?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Answers: 850, 900, 500, 300, 578.2</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  $ 30,180,000 - Nations Luxury Transportation bought the domain PrivateJet.com. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many times can you fold an A4 sheet in half without tools?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Answers: 6, 7, 6, 5, 8</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1 time, then it will not sheet A4.  The resulting composition can be folded 6 more times in half, then the capabilities of a person are not enough. </div></div><br><br>  Feel the way it goes?  You first cast the group's answers to the conditions, quickly checking the realism.  If you yourself believe in this realism, you have two opinions - one is yours with your answer, the second is that you agreed upon as a result of this ‚Äúfitting‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>How can the first opinion affect the second?</b>  They, like, are not related, right?  Well, they are not related in the same way as checking in one if conditions ($ a&gt; 0) || ($ i ++).  Depending on the compiler flag, it may not come to i - although, in theory, parts are independent.  So, if you do not make a conscious effort and do not think further, the brain will try to "slip" the difficult moment, using ready-made solutions or close to them. <br><br>  Let's have one more question.  You might think a little longer, try to count.  In Moscow, for example, in 2008 there were 1.7 thousand traffic lights. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The population of Cairo is 8 million people.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">What do you think, how many traffic lights were in this city in 2012?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  9 traffic lights - Vesti.Ru </div></div><br>  It turned out to catch the moment? <br><br><h4>  So what's the quiz about? </h4><br>  Let's look at the questions again.  They cover the needs of all players on the goal chart.  There is the last moment - the <b>removal of the discomfort of loss</b> .  Here, as you can see, everything is simple.  For example, if your answer is out of the group version, you can get better and put on the group average.  In case you were right, you answered correctly.  If wrong - well, you still won the bet.  If your answer lay in the middle of the group, and won the last one - ‚ÄúWell, so none of us waited, surprising!‚Äù.  Social idyll. <br><br>  This social idyll plus betting interface with chips made the game ‚ÄúBet‚Äù one of the most popular and best-selling quizzes in the West (without TV support, as is the case with Trivial Pursuit).  Given that publishers crammed in there a lot of questions that inspire patriotism in the spirit of: ‚ÄúIn which year American Armstrong became the first person to land on the moon,‚Äù the compote turned out to be excellent.  Players got up from the table with a sense of deep moral satisfaction - this is another example of the fact that the ‚Äúhigh point‚Äù often lies beyond the limits of game mechanics. <br><br>  I must say that during the localization, we cut out a lot of questions about American realities known only to them and added Gagarin, Tolstoy and some nuclear power plants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228533/</a></p>
