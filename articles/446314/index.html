Tell me what the problem is. ‚Äù <br>  Immediately I remembered the anecdote of drive times by 3 and a half inches: <br><br>  <i>Lamer comes to the hacker.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Nothing works for me, tell me where the problem is.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- In the DNA ...</i> <br><br>  But so it is impossible to solve incidents of performance, of course.  ‚Äú <i>They may not understand us</i> ‚Äù (c).

This is very bad. </li></ol><br>  This is bad of course.  But this is only on the one hand.  On the other hand, this is very good, because the task definitely has a solution and the query can be improved. <br><br>  <i>Do not go to the fortuneteller (C).</i> <br><br>  The query plan is not so complicated, but quite indicative: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Execution plan</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qk/ti/3c/qkti3ck7sqjaai_kqouhlpdzork.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  The most interesting and useful, as usual, at the beginning and end. <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">Nested Loop (cost=935.84..479763226.18 rows=3322 width=135) (actual time=31.536..8220420.295 rows=8111656 loops=1) Planning time: 3.807 ms</code> </pre> <br>  <b>Execution time: 8222351.640 ms</b> <br>  <b>Run time more than 2 hours.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xz/pr/es/xzpresqd2jlpkcnhxg_s46ln9vu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  False hypotheses taking time </h3><br><h4>  Hypothesis 1 - Optimizer is mistaken, builds wrong plan. </h4><br>  To visualize the execution plan, we will use the site <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/">https://explain.depesz.com/</a> .  However, the site did not show anything interesting or useful.  At first and second glance - nothing that could really help.  Is that - Full Scan minimum.  Go ahead. <br><br><h4>  Hypothesis 2-Impact on the base of the autovacuum, you need to get rid of the brakes </h4><br>  But, the autovacuum demons behave well, there are no long-hanging processes.  Some serious load is not.  Need to look for something else. <br><br><h4>  Hypothesis 3-Statistics is outdated, you need to recount all flies </h4><br>  Again, not that.  Statistics is up to date.  That, given the lack of problems with the autovacuum, is not surprising. <br><br><h3>  We begin to optimize </h3><br>  The main table 'wdata' is certainly not small, almost 3 million records. <br>  And this table is full scan. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">Hash Cond: ((w."SPENT_ID" = s."SPENT_ID") AND ((SubPlan 1) = s."SPENT_DATE")) -&gt; &lt;b&gt;Seq Scan&lt;/b&gt; on wdata w (cost=0.00..574151.49 rows=26886249 width=46) (actual time=0.005..8153.565 rows=26873950 loops=1)</code> </pre> <br>  We act in the standard way: ‚Äúcome on, let's make an index and everything flies‚Äù. <br><br>  Made an index on the field "SPENT_ID" <br><br>  As a result: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Index query execution plan</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/l3/ym/rgl3ymwfodngrs1--dcpybai0ya.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  Well, helped? <br><br>  It was: <b>8 222 351.640 ms</b> (a little more than 2 hours) <br>  It became: <b>6 985 431.575 ms (almost 2 hours)</b> <br>  In general, the same apples, side view. <br><br>  Remember the classics: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDo you have one, the same, but without wings?</i>  <i>Will seek".</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/xg/rm/otxgrmavhggwvxjuylc0yvjmxmg.jpeg"><br><br>  In principle, this could be called a good result, well, not a good one, but acceptable.
