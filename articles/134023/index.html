    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  About ideas </h1><br>  An idea is the first (and often the only) asset of a future entrepreneur.  It's like a golden egg with which you want to rush, to hint about everything, but not to share with anyone, otherwise it‚Äôs all ... All sensible people understand that before you can start sharing the skin of a dead bear, you need to develop a business model, translate the idea in a working service (let's call the service everything where we can get the service) by interacting with a lot of people, showing the right qualities in the right places and if you're lucky, etc.  etc.  The rest will say that I just need a good programmer / designer / seamstress / guitar player (underline the necessary) and start-up capital.  That is, sort of like it is necessary to share a testicle with someone ... <br>  It seems to me the idea is to share without fear of losing it, because you can find like-minded people to create a team, you can exchange an idea for participation in a project to gain invaluable experience, so you can get useful criticism and add a little more light to your idea.  The attentive reader will rightly remind me of the leather chair and its owner and will be right, because I have not read the next paragraph yet. <br>  The idea arises in the process of consumption of some information.  It does not matter at which stage, at the time of consumption, or lying on the couch, or suddenly, interrupting sleep.  Someone they are born more often, someone less often, but this process is repetitive.  I do not want to delve into the concepts of creativity and how to engage in them purposefully.  I just want to draw the reader‚Äôs attention to the fact that even if in the process of turning an idea into a business you lose it, you still have the most effective long-term asset - the experience gained, as well as new information and the opened horizons for activity.  So you're in the black. <br><br><h1>  About work </h1><br>  We will have to work hard to turn the idea into success.  It can even make you happy, but not burdened.  Then I propose to start working without violating the confidentiality of my idea.  You can get a job in a firm that correlates with your idea, and study the kitchen and the pitfalls.  You can read the literature to dive into the topic, as well as decided to bother to read this article.  Finally, find your future competitors and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses (although the idea implies some novelty, so there should be no direct competitors).  Learn as much as possible about them.  All this forms the movement of your personality and your idea forward.  It makes life interesting and, once looking back, you can catch yourself thinking that you don‚Äôt remember when your idea has grown from that funny and timid right in the beginning to what you are doing now. <br>  By working on the realization of an idea, you absorb information.  And this is fraught with new ideas, they can be written in a notebook, because now you are busy, and they will be occupied later.  For example, I have a notebook, which I called the ‚ÄúIdea heap‚Äù, and he tolerates everything from me - at any time of the day or night.  You acquire new necessary acquaintances that increase your opportunities.  Here you are also in the black. <br><br><h1>  About the time </h1><br>  Ideas are mortal.  In general, there are many conditions necessary for the life of an idea.  She needs to work, communicate with someone, study something, and anyway she may die over time.  You can even argue that the idea has a shelf life.  This gastronomic property needs to be clarified. <br>  First, the world may not be ready for your idea.  Yes, you and a few of your friends are ready for it, but for sure you are targeting a larger target audience.  Finally, if the world is ready to respond to your idea with its attention and participation, this means that the idea is sufficiently obvious for someone else to take up.  These are common truths that were important to say. <br>  And now I ask the reader to remember my notebook.  If you have more ideas than time to deal with them, you have to postpone them indefinitely.  Or, perhaps, not enough knowledge to implement it.  A year later, looking through the news, you find a project with an unusual name, repeating your idea.  I am sincerely convinced that such a situation is unacceptable.  You have a lottery ticket that you can play, but if you can't play it yourself, give it to another.  And this is not pure patronage of the arts.  Putting the idea on display, you say about yourself: "I am a smart fellow, I share this project with you, because now I‚Äôm doing much more tasty."  Intelligent small and intelligent big always attract the attention of people with resources.  Thus, it is important to state the idea on time and sign your name under it in order to put a plus on this paragraph. <br><br><h1>  Instead of conclusion </h1><br>  Finally, the most dramatic end is possible, at which disappointment in the idea takes place, but at the same time no one took away all the advantages mentioned above.  It remains only to wait (or develop) a new idea for a new adventure.  And for this someone needs to consume more information, someone to lie on the sofa, and someone surrender to dreams. <br><br>  I wish you all a successful week! <br><br>  PS Writing was also influenced by the book by Edward De Bono ‚ÄúSerious Creative Thinking‚Äù. <br><br>  UDP  Strange habr-effect, the article put the pluses and comment with approval, and according to karma you can soon write only in the Sandbox.  Please write your comments in the drug at least.  It is also important to improve the quality of future content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134023/</a></p>
