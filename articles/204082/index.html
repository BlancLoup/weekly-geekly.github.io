If they fly, as <b><a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/">Stratoplan.Ru</a></b> is flying <b><a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/">now</a></b> , then in terms of turnover it will be in the horizon of 12-18 months, quite a five-digit business in itself.  Orlov is not against giving me a try and is ready to help.

So maybe let's try together? <br><br><h5>  This is a full time </h5><br><br>  There is no "I'm here half-way guide."  If there is no reserve for a quiet life without a salary in general or at a minimum salary of 3-4 months, it is better not to try. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is not a lot of work and not enough: 12-14 hours every day.  Write a lot, call, negotiate, sell (required). <br><br>  Back in 2009, I was sitting in a warm Yandex and if someone had said that I would sell something to someone, I would have twisted my finger at my temple.  I am grateful to Viktor Tatianin for giving me the conditions and a place in Luxoft, so that I could become a seller.  Seller service.  In a crisis.  It was useful and the money was much more in total.  I propose to twist a finger at your temple and think whether you want to earn 2-3 times more in a year or two + to build a working business as a co-owner. <br><br><h5>  What I can and how I see my participation in this cooperation + what will help our team </h5><br><br>  I have access to the bright head of Orlov and the experience of our team, which has been quietly and without investment in the market for three years making good money.  Calmly I, of course, bent - nifiga it is not calm - but interesting.  Not everything goes smoothly and beautifully at once, but what comes out comes out tightly knit and earns money. <br><br>  If you are in Kiev, it will be easier for you and me.  If you are in St. Petersburg - there is the office of Stratoplan, our team, a coffee machine and Orlov: in the aggregate, of course, it‚Äôs not what‚Äôs next to me (Peter again :), but it‚Äôs quite a working version.  People from other cities do not close the path - but this is really difficult.  Sit there and cut so much that it flew and did not go crazy.  Skype with the camera saves, but this is another point to think about, especially if you have not tried to work at home and alone before.  The lid of the kettle must be kept tight.  I am not kidding.  I have three children at home and I know what it means to work in such an environment. <br><br>  What needs to be done is to build an adult education business similar to Stratoplan.  Media and education interface.  We seem to have found a niche, as it were, no more monetary than that of Stratoplan.  We will give ‚ÄúStart Media Media‚Äù in the form of limited access to our subscribers and clients.  We will tell about all our mistakes.  Website, payment acceptance, infrastructure and other IT foundation will help to build.  Where to dig, how and with whom to speak - at first we will help.  Periodically we will look where we go and adjust.  And then - myself. <br><br>  We need not a programmer - we need a manager who wants to try having a number of people who also tried and went on their way, do their first (or not first) business and start working for themselves. <br><br>  Crimson mountains and gilded bugatti not promise.  I will say for myself.  Having worked for 7-8 years in hiring, I still didn‚Äôt come close to my financial goals, although I was fed well.  Working for myself and making all the mistakes that were possible, in two years I bought and paid for an apartment, traveled the world, continued with a partner of 20-25-25 thousand dollars in experiments and made a lot of discoveries for which it is not a pity for money. <br><br>  Knocking better in the mail: <a href="">hiring@stratoplan.ru</a> - further on the procedure described here: <a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/hiring">http://www.stratoplan.ru/hiring</a> <br><br>  <b>Good luck to us all.</b> <br><br>  PS <br>  If we find each other with your help, friend / comrade / brother, we will show you a viskar according to the results of the test. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204082/</a></p>
