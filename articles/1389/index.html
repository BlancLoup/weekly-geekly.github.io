      <b>History 1. On the loss of a domain.</b> <br>  <b>History 2. Domain in the zone ru - price $ 18 ... per month.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the end of 2004, we ordered a domain in the biz zone via Valuev.  His year prohostyli, extended.  All OK. <br>  At the end of 2006 comes an account for the renewal of the domain ($ 9).  We pay, we wait.  Money came to Valuev, all relaxed.  After a week (2-3 weeks before the end of the term), a letter comes from the registrar (DomainPeople) - they say, gentlemen, if you don‚Äôt pay for your domain, you will lose it. <br>  I call Valuey. <br>  I hear the following: <br>  - You see, we no longer have a relationship with this registrar, so we will not be able to transfer money to them ...: [] <br>  - BUT WE HAVE PAYED YOU!  To YOUR EXTENDED ACCOUNT !!! <br>  - Well, like, it happened.  Let us take this money into account as a month of hosting ... <br><br>  Okay, so be it.  We agreed on the phone for a month hosting. <br>  But the same <b>paid</b> bill continues to come every day to the email - pay, that's all. <br>  I am writing a letter - well, I think a telephone conversation is just words.  We need a written agreement. <br>  I am writing in the letter: ‚ÄúWe agreed on the phone, consider our 9 bucks, extend hosting.‚Äù <br>  I get the answer: "Yes, yes, we agreed, we will extend." <br><br>  It takes a week, HOSTING DISCONNECT! <br>  I call.  I tell about the letters, call the ticker.  Letters are found, hosting included. <br>  But the $ 9 bill keeps coming.  Every day (imagine how it gets?) <br>  I call.  ‚ÄúYes, yes, we‚Äôll mark now.‚Äù  On the trail.  the day falls again the same bill. <br>  Writing.  It takes two days.  The invoice is marked as paid.  It's been a month and a half ... <br><br>  By the way, dialing to technical support Valuev in itself is not a trivial task and requires patience.  Adequate people are there.  But a little.  I have even developed a special tone - patient, calm, unhurried, as they say with underdeveloped children.  Otherwise, I'm afraid to break :) <br><br>  The fate of the domain proceeded no less interestingly, and although this story is already about DomainPeople, I will tell you. <br>  We paid for the domain through a credit card ($ 50!).  We wait.  The girl, the cat.  I registered the domain, quit, therefore, having received a letter with a request to confirm the payment, I simply deleted it ...  The domain is not extended.  For that month, in tech.  whose domain has not yet entered the free pool, corresponded with the registrar (in English), the girl repented, tried to rectify the situation, all to no avail.  The registrar requested a fine of $ 150. <br><br>  As a result, the paid $ 50 spat, waited for the release of the domain and purchased it through a rucenter (the registrar is the same DomainPeople, I'm already afraid. But I don‚Äôt have any complaints to the center, so maybe it will work out). <br><br><br>  <b>History 2. Domain in the zone ru - price $ 18 ... per month.</b> <br><habracut><br>  The contract is different, the story is similar. <br>  Domain in the zone ru.  In December comes the bill for renewal.  We pay in December.  The invoice is marked as paid. <br>  In January comes a new account for the renewal of the same domain. <br>  I call. <br>  I say: <br>  - What is it with you, the domain must now be renewed every month? <br>  Answer (just a rare case of an adequate person on the line): <br>  - So we work ... - And sigh.  - Now remove. <br><br>  Okay, it happens.  Account deleted.  It takes a week.  ONE MORE ONE account for the same domain comes! <br><br>  I call.  On line girl: <br>  - Do not worry, since you paid, everything is fine. <br>  - Did you transfer money to the registrar? <br>  - ‚Ä¶ not yet‚Ä¶ <br>  - And why? <br>  - Well, only in February the term expires ... (don't you, little ones, understand that we are twisting your money to the last?) <br>  - And the account is superfluous? <br>  - Now remove. <br><br>  A curtain. <br><br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1389/</a></p>
