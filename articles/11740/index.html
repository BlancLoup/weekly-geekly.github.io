  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make website design simple and convenient.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Creating a simple website design is a very difficult task.  But this approach has undeniable advantages. </h3><br>  Of course, the main one is the speed of their loading.  It will be easier for the user to use this site.  Simplicity is not always minimalism.  There are many websites in the modern Internet that are clearly overloaded not only with information, but also with graphics.  Yes, in terms of design they are unique, but they are not always convenient to use. <br>  Now, conditionally, all sites on the Internet can be divided into several categories.  The first of these are sites made with templates and using common cms.  Such sites are simply overloaded with information.  Their usability is extremely low. <br>  The second can be attributed to the sites made by themselves, or freelancers.  The user himself creating the site often makes mistakes that reduce all work to zero.  When ordering work from freelancers, there is a high probability of getting a template, albeit a converted one. <br>  The third category includes sites made by design studios.  But here is not so simple.  It is often difficult to convince the customer that a simple design is primarily aimed at the visitor.  After all, to make a website filled to the maximum with graphic material everyone can, and finding the right combination is much more difficult.  And if the customer has a choice between a beautiful site and a simple, but convenient site, the first option wins. <br>  Returning to the creation of a simple website design, we list the benefits that users, the customer and the developer receive.  For users, this is fast loading, respectively, have to wait less.  Such sites become easier to read, without having to search among the large number of images the necessary information.  The main advantage is ease of use.  For the customer it is fast development, implementation, support.  It's easier to redesign.  For the developer, more time to think over small details, more time is left for creative work. <br>  The author of this article does not call anyone to create websites that have nothing but the information column in the center of the page and the logo at the top.  There must be a measure for everything.  Creating a simple design requires some courage from the developer.  Not everyone is able to understand this.  All elements on the page should perform some of their task and should not just take up space.  There is a golden rule of design, which not everyone knows, and who knows, often forgets, or does not adhere to it.  Everything that the user sees on your site should help him find what he is looking for.  And besides, it should contribute to the goals of the site itself. <br><br><br>  Original <a href="http://studiomaximum.net/">http://studiomaximum.net</a> </div>
