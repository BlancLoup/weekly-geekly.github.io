  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skype Connect first acquaintance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Instead of entry.</b> <br>  I deal with Skype Connect for the first time, it is my personal experience that I would like to help the same as me. <br><br>  <b>Anticipation</b> <br>  Somehow I saw the news that now Skype can be connected via sip, at one time it seemed to be free, and then it began to cost money.  Inspired by the study of SIP-technologies, I decided to try to arrange this service for myself.  Going to the section where it was advertised, I fugitively reviewed the order of actions to be performed, namely: <br>  1. Sign in to Skype Manager <br>  From Skype Manager: <br>  2. Pay for call channels and deposit some money into your SIP profile account. <br>  3. Configure your company's PBX or VoIP gateway by specifying SIP profile information. <br>  4. Give SIP profiles money to use Skype. <br>  5. Start calling. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not having addressed the bold ‚ÄúFrom Skype Manager‚Äù inscription, I decided to implement the second paragraph, since the terminal was the closest to my payment methods.  Without a second thought, throwing 10 euros to my Skype account, I was already anticipating how I would set up my Skype sip account in my communicator settings and all my friends would be able to call me as if on a regular phone.  But the feeling of happiness did not last long.  Sitting at the computer, I discovered that the Skype Manager account and the personal Skype account are not related to each other, except that you can transfer money from the first to the second, but there is no reverse procedure ... <br><br>  <b>Attempt number two</b> <br>  That these 10 euros I thought was wrong - I lost the most valuable thing - time!  Having chosen the method of depositing an account in Skype Manager, I returned to the payment terminal.  And then he lowered his gaze to the communicator, in the hope of setting it all up quickly so that it would work.  So I saw the login and password, entered them into my communicator and decided to test the cherished functionality, asked my relatives to call my Skype (which was not online at that time) and the miracle did not happen. <br>  Delving further on the Skype site, I came across an inscription about the impossibility of using a skype account attached to the sip channel through their standard program, but to my surprise everything worked from a desktop computer ...

      <b>Earned!?</b> <br>  A little later, I discovered the concept of "Business Account", I realized that this is just what I need.  Now I will make a business account from my account and will be able to receive calls.  No, why not?  Ah, yes, a channel is attached to my account, skype offers to create a new one.  I‚Äôm looking for an account, I receive emails about the incredible capabilities of Skype, and lo and behold, I‚Äôm receiving calls to the newly created account attached to the incoming call. <br>  Yes, it's great, but why do I need another Skype account?  I have 13 euros on the current one, and this client, which has been cut down even through the program, does not enter it, as the Skype site claims. <br>  At the moment, I have achieved my goal, calls are received to a Skype account, although not to the one I wanted.  I couldn‚Äôt find a call forwarding from Skype to Skype without buying additional services.  Put the status in Skype that I have another account to which you can now also send calls. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  Carefully read everything written - this is basic. <br>  Connect in a strictly defined order on the site, i.e .: <br>  1. Login to Skype Manager <br>  2. We put money not on your Skype account, but on your Skype Manager account <br>  3. Pay for Skype Connect services <br>  4. Create an account (business account) for incoming or outgoing calls <br>  5. Bind him to the service <br>  6. Enjoy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147299/</a></p>
