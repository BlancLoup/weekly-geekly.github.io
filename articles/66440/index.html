  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EGE - one plus and two minuses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It will be a question of the exam in the eyes of the applicant, although I myself am not.  A little background.  This year 2 brothers came to universities and I had to run with them and at the same time see it all with my own eyes.  In this article I will tell you how it all happens, what problems there are and how you can solve them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first step is to make copies of Kuevo and take it to the desired university.  You can also send by registered mail.  Because  there are no restrictions here, it can theoretically be sent to all educational institutions of the country.  There is no problem for the applicant does not arise, it is a big plus for the exam.  When I did, I didn‚Äôt have such an opportunity, because  The likelihood that exams could be on the same day in two places was very high.  But this plus is a minus, but about it a bit later. <br>  In one of the beautiful days established by the MO, universities are no longer accepting documents.  The next day, they post a list of applicants for each specialty sorted by points.  And during the week you have to choose which university to give the original to.  <b>This is where the biggest problem begins for applicants.</b> <br>  To begin, remember the competitions in universities before the exam.  In those days, more than 10 people rarely applied for one place.  Probably, only universities of Moscow State University, Novosibirsk State University, Moscow State Technical University (and maybe all MGICS) could boast of it.  Now the situation has changed.  Because  The applicant can apply not for one specialty or two, but say for 10, then the competition for one place is growing throughout the country.  And then there is the <b>first minus of the</b> exam.  Imagine 3 entrants: Vasya with 200 points, Petya with 150 and Sasha with 100 and two universities: B1, B2.  And only 1 person can enter each university.  Logically, the problem is solved very simply, the one who has the most points, Vasya, chooses the first. Next, Petya chooses, and Sasha has no choice but to go and serve.  But what really happens.  Vasya sees that he goes through the competition everywhere, rejoices and goes to submit the originals, say in B1.  Petya is in thought, he has an average mark everywhere, he does not pass in the main competition, but he knows that some who passed in the main competition may not pass the original documents, then he can pass.  He risks and gives the same to B1.  And what remains for Sasha, sees that his result is below average, there are a lot of people in front of him, well, he doesn‚Äôt vanish, and he leaves the original documents in B2.  As a result, Vasya enters B1, and Sasha in B2. And Peter goes to serve, although he has more points.  such a case really happened to a brother.  He was in the role of Sasha and he was lucky. <br>  <b>The second minus</b> is that the lists do not mark those who have handed over the original, but who have a copy.  Perhaps this is not always the case, but in those where I was, I did not see such a list.  Moreover, in one university, I even went over to clarify whether there would be such a list, I was told that it was not, all this is confidential.  What would help me list with a tick in the column "original".  I could calculate how many people above me in the list, handed over the originals.  And if I knew the total number of places in this specialty, I would have roughly known whether I would go there or not.  There certainly is one drawback associated with health.  If I stand 21 on the list, and only 20 do, then it is likely that someone out of twenty people from that list will ‚Äúchange his mind‚Äù and take the documents. <br>  What solution would I suggest?  Create a website.  The site where in real time you can see for each specialty a list of applicants who submitted the document.  And there it should be noted that he submitted the original or a copy and how many points he has.  How this should work. The applicant will leave his documents (or a copy), the data will go directly to the site.  He comes home, enters the Internet, opens the site, finds a university, specialty and sees a list of all who submitted the application and how many points there are and who has a copy, and who has the original.  If I have such data at hand, it is already easier for me to decide where there is a chance, and where it is not necessary to go.  What do you think about this% username%? <br></div>
