  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the report ‚ÄúEnsuring the availability of mobile phones and mobile services for people with disabilities‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In August 2012, the International Telecommunication Union (International Telecommunications Union) and the G3ict, a global initiative for inclusive ICTs (Global initiative for inclusive ICTs), published a joint report entitled ‚ÄúMaking Mobile Phones and Mobile Services for People with Disabilities‚Äù (‚ÄúMaking Mobile Phones and services accessible for Persons with disabilities ‚Äù).  The report contains information on what services, today, can be offered by mobile operators for a special category of people who have these or other disabilities. <br><br>  This material is a brief overview of this report and is intended for a brief acquaintance with its content, which may be useful for those who are not ready to independently study a rather voluminous document in the search for interesting sections. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The full report in English is available for download at <a href="http://g3ict.org/download/p/fileId_934/productId_191">http://g3ict.org/download/p/fileId_934/productId_191</a> (2.18 MB), and the unofficial Russian translation is available at <a href="http://www.unic.ru/news_inf/unic%2520mobile1.pdf">http://www.unic.ru/ news_inf / unic% 20mobile1.pdf</a> (515 kB).  Nevertheless, it is important to note that the mentioned translation contains a number of inaccuracies, often of a fundamental nature, therefore we do not recommend its verbatim use in the eventual preparation of official documents based on this report.  In particular, this remark applies to the translation of the title of the document. <br><br>  The content of the report consists of eleven chapters. <br><br>  The first chapter discusses various functions that ensure the availability of mobile phones for people with certain restrictions, and special services provided through mobile phones that can improve the quality of life of people in this category.  In general, we are talking about a variety of hardware and software solutions, both embedded and supplied as a third-party solution. <br><br>  The considered technologies are grouped into sections corresponding to different types of physical limitations, in particular for the deaf and hearing impaired, blind and visually impaired, having limited mobility, having cognitive disorders, illiterate or suffering from dyslexia. <br><br>  The second chapter discusses some special services that people with disabilities can take advantage of.  Here we are not always talking about specialized solutions developed specifically for this category of users.  Often, these are quite mass-oriented services, but which can provide significant assistance in the rehabilitation of people with disabilities. <br><br>  In particular, the chapter discusses digital libraries, satellite navigation, retransmission to convert information into a readable form, services that increase the ability of self-service, the ability for a subscriber to call emergency services with certain physical disorders (speech, hearing, etc.), branded services technical support adapted for customers with disabilities. <br><br>  The third chapter is devoted to the review of the industry of specialized software for mobile devices, designed to solve certain problems of users with disabilities.  In general, the chapter considers both software to meet specific needs, as well as for the device of an integrated home automation system, as well as for solving educational tasks. <br><br>  Chapter four focuses on the socio-economic aspects of mobile accessibility.  It emphasizes the importance of providers understanding the demographic situation in their target market.  It is noted that at present there are great business opportunities in the field of solutions and services that increase the availability of mobile communications, since we are talking about meeting the needs of a large group of people with disabilities, the elderly and illiterate people. <br><br>  The fifth chapter continues the topic raised in the previous section of the report and contains a number of examples of successful commercial activities related to improving the availability of mobile phones and mobile network services.  The topic is revealed on the example of several American, European and Japanese mobile operators. <br><br>  The sixth chapter is a review of various accessibility improvement initiatives proposed by major international mobile phone manufacturers and telecom operators.  The experience of such companies as Nokia, Apple, Samsung, Motorola, Google (within the Android OS), Doro, Emporia Telecom and Sagem is considered. <br><br>  The seventh chapter is devoted to the consideration of the obligations of the States Parties to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> regarding the availability of mobile phones and mobile services for people with disabilities.  In general, the chapter is the most abstract of all and represents a review of those sections of the Convention, where directly or indirectly we are talking about information and communication technologies and their availability. <br><br>  The eighth chapter examines the role of various government organizations and services in the process of disseminating information and services for people with disabilities through assistive technologies for mobile platforms.  In particular, the competencies of telecommunications regulatory authorities, social policy authorities and ministries that provide services in electronic form are reviewed. <br><br>  The ninth chapter is devoted to the review of measures taken by various states in order to increase the availability of communication services for people with disabilities.  Data is provided for Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union as a whole. <br><br>  The tenth chapter outlines the measures that turned out to be most effective in terms of the policy and practice of implementing the availability of communication services.  In particular, we are talking about raising awareness of key participants in the process, cooperation of efforts, encouraging mobile operators and manufacturers of equipment from the state and so on. <br><br>  The final eleventh chapter is devoted to existing information resources on assistive technology on mobile platforms and existing solutions for people with disabilities.  It provides data on standards, national institutions and organizations, research associations and user communities. <br><br>  In general, Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are the most comprehensive and extremely important for people with disabilities to understand the very principles of the use of mobile technologies.  Therefore, it makes sense to familiarize yourself with these first three chapters with everyone reading this report.  In addition, they will have the most practical value for private software developers and accessories. <br><br>  Chapters 4, 5 and 6 are more focused on large manufacturers of mobile communication devices and mobile operators and are designed to convince them of the profitability of the realization of the availability of their products and services for people with disabilities.  This block of the report, in the first place, can be recommended to representatives of large business in the field of communication technologies. <br><br>  Chapters 7, 8, 9 and 10 are more formal in nature and are oriented more towards civil servants and members of public organizations, since they are devoted to various government measures to increase ICT accessibility.  First of all, it makes sense to get acquainted with these chapters to people responsible for the development and implementation of federal targeted programs to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, as well as employees of various human rights and charitable associations. <br><br>  Chapter 11 can serve as a quick reference guide for those who are interested in learning more about the availability of information and communication technologies for people with disabilities. <br><br>  On the whole, summing up, the report ‚ÄúEnsuring the availability of mobile phones and mobile communication services for people with disabilities‚Äù can be described as a rather informative document combining a significant amount of data from various fields on the availability of mobile communication technologies for people with disabilities.  And although even at the time of its publication, the information contained in it in some aspects was already outdated, it can still serve as a very informative source for those who have little knowledge of mobile accessibility technologies. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the report did not reflect some key concepts of accessibility technologies that lie in the plane of global paradigms for the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, so you should not take it as a self-sufficient document.  With an integrated approach to solving the problems outlined in the report (both from business and from the government), it will be correct not only to confine them and to resort to other studies in the field of accessibility, as well as expert advice. <br><br>  In conclusion, unfortunately, one has to note that Russian-speaking countries are not reflected in this report, since they do not have significant experience in this area and often face serious problems even in implementing the basic fundamentals of mobile accessibility technologies.  This concerns both the absence of specific targeted programs from the state, and constructive initiatives by mobile operators represented in these markets.  In these countries, one can only note a number of spontaneously arisen small projects implemented by private individuals, moreover, as a rule, on a voluntary basis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153849/</a></p>
