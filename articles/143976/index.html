      1 Correction of key technical problems <br><br>  The key technical problems I call problems that bring the maximum amount of problems, compared with the others, or can lead to serious consequences if they are ignored.  In my case, such problems were project things and completely failed servers of some clients. <br><br>  Problems in projects: <br>  - lack of anti-virus protection, backup, monitoring systems and software standardization; <br>  - critical state of network security; <br>  - the mechanism of transport of official traffic from multiple outlets to the central office was, most of the time, inoperable than in the working and was a very critical aspect. <br>  Outsourcing customer problems: <br>  - absence of antivirus protection, backup, monitoring systems; <br>  - many small and large chronic problems that have become acute with time; <br>  - dissatisfaction with the results of our company, many were on the verge of termination of contracts. <br>  An example of problems with clients: a pair of central servers of one of the clients were in an unrecoverable state from the point of view of software.  The situation was maximally strained, because at that time there were already several attempts to breathe life into them and it was necessary to act effectively.  My first working day began at 9 am and ended at 5 am the next day. <br><br>  For a while I could compare myself with a wolf from the Soviet game ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute,‚Äù who catches the falling eggs.  Most were caught, some fell. <br><br>  2 Study of all the activities of the department <br><br>  Aspects that I needed to read: <br>  - current projects; <br>  - outsourcing subscribers and their individual characteristics; <br>  - principles of working with existing customers; <br>  - customer contact information; <br>  - access to client equipment. <br>  There were problems with all aspects of familiarization.  For projects there was only information in words and no documents.  Outsourcing subscribers had a lot of fragmentary data and nothing really.  The principles of working with clients remained vague due to the lack of coherent information.  Documents with contact information was not.  Access to technology was scattered throughout the "file storage". <br><br>  It took about a month to solve these problems.  We together collected information bit by bit.  Information on projects documented with words.  For businesses to subscribers, that was documented with the words, the rest was found out at meetings.  Separately, we were engaged in clarifying the clients' belonging to our department.  Contact information was collected using the scanty contacts that we had.  Access to the equipment had to be systematically rebuilt. <br><br>  3 Customer negative cancellation <br><br>  Client negative was sharp.  Many of the clients were on the verge of abandoning our services.  This situation was caused by internal lack of organization, low professional training of personnel.  A very frequent occurrence was an inconclusive "romp" or "romp", which brought the appearance of the result.  Due to negative aspects, the solution of client tasks was delayed, they worked on the same task several times.  To solve this problem, you can select a responsible employee and direct the flow to him.  In my case, there was no such employee, so I took a stream for several months.  The qualitative solution of client issues did not always remove the negative that has been accumulated over the recent work of the company.  To keep the situation resorted to the appointment of discounts for services, sometimes these discounts were equal to the volume of a monthly subscription.  fees. <br><br>  4 Work with staff <br><br>  The first few months, while I was answering calls, the work of the rest of the staff (three employees) was inertial, i.e.  they performed tasks in those zones that were assigned to them, the effectiveness of their work could be compared with the efficiency of students in the first workplace.  After solving the acute technical aspects, there appeared some time to work with the staff: coordination of their actions and improvement of professional qualities. <br><br>  4.1 Delegation <br><br>  The task of delegation has become.  Honestly, it was scary for me, I realized what the admission of employees of this level to systems that solve business problems of clients, especially server ones, can lead to.  The situation dictated its conditions and I did not have to choose.  It was necessary to conduct maintenance and projects with the help of the staff that was, because  there was no time for personnel changes, and the situation was hardly controlled.  For the control of work on important areas, checklists and instructions were made.  The purpose of creating such documents was to minimize errors during the work of inexperienced people. <br><br>  4.1.1 Checklists <br><br>  A checklist is a document containing a list of checkpoints for the execution of work.  The task of the employee to go through the steps and put a mark on the implementation of each step. <br><br>  4.1.2 Instructions <br><br>  An instruction is a document with an algorithm for achieving certain technical tasks.  This document describes the actions that were between the control points.  Sometimes both documents were used simultaneously, and sometimes separately, it depended on the complexity and severity of the work performed. <br><br>  4.2 Control <br><br>  The task of control in these conditions is rather time-consuming.  Errors can be made literally at any stage, even when the employee is working on an algorithm.  People with insufficient experience pay attention, most often, to those aspects that are not important, but important ones miss.  It turns out that the employee, without realizing it, does not do so and it does not occur to him to ask the manager a question at the right time.  To minimize such cases, I asked the staff to solve the problem out loud in order to understand the logic of their thinking in certain areas.  If the work was done by employees in the office, then speaking with them methods of solution is quite simple.  If an employee works on the field and has problems, it was more difficult, because  he could not understand the topic to the extent necessary and could not ask a clear question.  Connectedly, the employee begins to express himself when he understands about half of what he does.  Also significant difficulties arose in the formulation of undocumented tasks.  They often do not hear or remember something in the performance, if the task is in words.  When everything needs to be done very quickly or to change the entrance conditions on the fly, there is no way out of ‚Äúfrom the words‚Äù.  To mitigate the problem, I asked them to take notes for themselves on paper.  Cases of deliberate misunderstanding and forgetting were the reason for making decisions.  The only employee we had to say goodbye to was engaged in this kind of work. <br><br>  4.3 Training <br><br>  The task was to increase the knowledge of staff in the necessary areas of technology.  The task is clear, but given the lack of time, there was something to think about.  We had an idea how to train with minimal time - internal seminars. <br><br>  4.3.1 Internal Seminars <br><br>  For the reports were selected topics for those technologies that were most important for the department.  Employees themselves prepared reports and told the others.  Thus, the outlook of employees is well expanded, and the outlook, in turn, makes it possible to delve into smaller details on their own. <br><br>  4.4 Discipline events <br><br>  To stop the ‚Äúdisorder and hesitation‚Äù, disciplinary measures were introduced in the department: explanatory notes and fines. <br><br>  4.4.1 Explanatory Notes <br><br>  Light disciplinary measure was chosen explanatory note.  This tool was used in repeated cases of petty negligence.  Three notes equated to a fine. <br><br>  4.4.2 Penalties <br><br>  Penalties were imposed in extreme cases.  An extreme case is the infliction of financial damage to the company or malicious violations of discipline.  An example of a malicious violation of discipline was leaving the workplace, without warning, in the absence of a manager.  An example of actions that lead to losses is poor-quality performance of assigned tasks that entail repeated work.  Penalties we were not welcomed and were minimized.  In order not to make fines by the system acceptable to employees and not to give rise to a situation where it is easier for them to pay a fine than to do the work, a fixed amount of the fine was introduced - 250 UAH.  The first penalty was equal to a fixed amount, the second was multiplied by two, the third penalty was followed by dismissal. <br><br>  4.5 Promotions <br><br>  Employees should also have pleasant moments that should motivate them to develop.  Such points were bonuses, wage increases and holidays, according to the schedule. <br><br>  4.5.1 Increase in salary <br><br>  Our top management is not greedy, for them the main work done smoothly and on time.  Therefore, each stable, growing employee relied fin.  growth.  Growth was expressed in premiums or wage increases.  Bonuses and promotions took place on the recommendation of the immediate supervisor of the employee.  The earnings of individual employees for the year grew by 70%.  Sometimes it is possible to raise wages not at the expense of additional income, which brought the work of the employee, but for other, smaller services.  Practice has shown that from such growth an employee can imagine himself as irreplaceable, to assume that he is improving quickly, so there is no point in staying at this workplace. <br><br>  4.5.1 Vacation <br><br>  The last few years, before my arrival, the company has been actively growing, employees have not been on vacation for years.  I did not agree with this policy, in view of the large burden on all of us.  In such a dynamic, as we were then, it was not an easy task for everyone to leave, because  every employee was needed, and interchangeability left much to be desired.  To solve this problem, ways and means were found to provide vacations for all employees in the summer, for a period of 2 weeks. <br><br>  5 Work on social aspects <br><br>  Among other things, I wanted to improve working conditions.  Platform for improvements was the office.  Up to this point, he was overwhelmed with industrial "junk": boxes with servers, bespereboynikami, fiscal registrars and other equipment.  There were so many materials that it was impossible to move freely around the room without stepping twice.  Therefore, means and methods were found to free the premises from the equipment and restore order. <br><br>  5.1 Workspace <br><br>  From the moment the cabinet was released, the mess on the tables became visible.  We began to fight with him and achieved success.  Now not only the floors, but also the tables glittered.  It is more pleasant to work in a cozy office than in a warehouse, agree.  In addition to the order, the computers that required it were modernized. <br><br>  5.2 Reducing overtime <br><br>  During the solution of global problems of the company, the work was carried out at a time when the situation required it, we did not work at night, but in the mornings and evenings often happened.  To reduce the amount of such work, duty was introduced on weekdays and weekends.  On average, each employee was on duty once a week on weekdays and once a month on weekends.  The duty was as follows: answering calls and staying at a computer with the Internet, at home or in any other place.  Thus, the personal time of the rest of the staff became free. <br><br>  6 Stopping threading <br><br>  As a result of a tough policy, which is necessary in overcoming the crisis and, possibly, as a result of too fast fin.  employee growth, threading has arisen.  Many companies successfully live with this, but for us this aspect is negative, so we are taking active steps to combat it: we increase the comfort of work, closely monitor the load on each employee and adjust it. <br><br>  <b>Article in its original form</b> <br><br>  Some input data.  The company, in which I came to work as the head of the information technology department, is developing and implementing accounting systems.  At that time, there were 3 large IT projects and a dozen IT outsourcing subscriber companies complete with tracking systems support.  The number of serviced vehicles about 250 computers and servers. <br><br>  A little about the staff.  The department consisted of four people.  Two of them worked in the company for the first month - they were 2 students without specials.  skills that came to the first job.  Another person, as I was told, ‚Äúhis level is higher than the rest,‚Äù as it turned out later, this point of view was subjective.  Well, the fourth person is an employee at the client, i.e.  attract to the project was not possible. <br><br>  I got a special impression from the first glance at the room in which there were 3 people and the head of the department.  It was a small room.  In order to cross it diagonally, from the entrance to the workplace of the head of the department, in the far left corner of the room, it was necessary to step 2-3 times through the box from HP servers, bespereboynik or system unit. <br><br>  The former manager did not find another place to place the project materials and decided that everything would fit and be kept in his office. <br><br>  When I talk about the crisis, I mean the situation faced by many actively growing enterprises, namely, marketing has worked, contracts are received, but resources are scarce or they do not meet the ever-growing requirements.  This moment, in my personal opinion, is a turning point in the evolution of enterprises and requires the maximum benefit from management and staff. <br><br>  I had the role of an anti-crisis middle manager.  The department that I got was supposed to provide the foundation for the implementation of accounting systems.  At that moment it was necessary to save the situation.  The transfer of cases, in the full sense of the word, from the outgoing leader to me, was not discussed.  The task was set before me: ‚ÄúHold all projects and all subscribers‚Äù. <br><br>  They assigned me an executive director, in the literal sense of the word, he made every effort to introduce me to the ‚Äútheme‚Äù in all areas.  And of course, he controlled the dynamics and trends that came with me. <br><br>  I will not tell you about the physical costs that were made to equalize the situation, I would just say that they were significant. <br><br>  Well, now in steps: <br><h5>  "First Wave" </h5><br>  <i>1</i> .  First of all, we, together with the executive, analyzed those.  part of current projects.  Made significant amendments and improvements, improvements in this direction have been going on for several months in parallel with the rest. <br><br>  <i>2</i>  Lined up with a crowd of dissatisfied business subscribers.  In other words, I sat on the "first line" and began to serve all incoming applications.  Then the first line in my face worked from 6 to 22 hours 5-7 days a week.  To extinguish the "first wave" took 2.5 months. <br><h5>  "Work with staff" </h5><br>  <i>3</i>  After the suppression of the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù, active work with the personnel began, we began to delegate hard.  Stiffness was the zero qualification of employees.  At that moment, it didn‚Äôt matter at what price to resolve issues, I certainly had full authority, but I didn‚Äôt have time to search for new employees or to train existing ones.  Therefore, steps were taken: writing instructions and developing control points.  Thus, the employees were put in conditions when it was difficult for them to make a mistake while working, but of course, they were wrong, but the work went.  For failure to comply with the instructions penalties were imposed. <br><br>  <i>4</i>  The instructions did not solve all the problems, they made life easier, but the staff remained unqualified.  Internal seminars were introduced.  The topics for the seminars were the technologies that the department encountered most often.  Topics were shared among staff, they prepared reports and told the rest of 2p.  in Week.  The holding of such events had a positive effect on the qualifications of the listeners and speakers, it gave a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe personal qualities of each employee.  For quality reports awards were appointed. <br><br>  <i>5</i>  Methods and measures were found to free the work cabinet from the production "trash".<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now the room had full-fledged workplaces, for all who worked there, and a brilliant clean floor. </font></font><br><br>  <i>6</i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After 3.5 months </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from the end of the "first wave" came full stabilization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It lasted about three months.</font></font><br><br>  <i>7</i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After 3 months </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from the end of full stabilization personnel changes began. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first employee was identified and fired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason for the dismissal was professional negligence. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A holiday company schedule was formed, all department employees, for the first time in the last few years, went on vacations, all in the summer when they wanted to.</font></font><br><br>  <i>9</i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">W \ N junior staff has grown over these 9 months. by 70%. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The tasks set by the management were fulfilled, and the goals were achieved. Projects were not lost, not one subscriber did not leave because of the quality of our work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result of tight working policies and too fast fin. employee growth, there was a "thread" of personnel. By the end of the first year of my work, the staff completely changed, but this situation was no longer acute and did not threaten the existence of the company.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since ‚Äúthreading‚Äù is a negative factor, actions have been taken to stop it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would also like to note that working in a rigid framework had a positive effect on the professional and personal qualities of the staff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three of the four departed employees settled in large corporations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One came back to us as an employee at a client in the neighboring city where he lives. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second year of my activity is suitable, the department consists of 6 people, including me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company moved to a new spacious office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have 2 people on the first line, 2 for the second and 2 professionals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We continue to develop along the planned directions.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143976/</a></p>
