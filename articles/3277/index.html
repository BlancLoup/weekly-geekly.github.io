  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google thinks TV will kill the internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Friday, the news feeds of many reputable resources were replenished with a noticeable message.  Quoting the speech of the head of Google TV (a division that deals with one of the most promising areas of work for the company - Internet TV) Vincent Duro (Vincent Dureau), almost every one of them put loud headlines like ‚ÄúGoogle: the Internet is not created for Web TV‚Äù - someone softer, and someone stronger (up to the use of the words "murder" and even "apocalypse"). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The speech was held within the framework of the ‚ÄúCable Europe‚Äù Congress in Amsterdam, where Duro represented Google as one of the most influential traffic consumers on the world stage and at the same time the owner of his own extensive cable infrastructure. <br><br>  The topic of Net Neutrality - the principle of equality of rights of all clients of cable companies owning information transfer channels (simply wires) - has long been one of the central industrial congresses of this kind and has already been loved by many politicians who do not hesitate to play it at the elections of any more less significant scale.  She was discussed at this time. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Even despite the company's firm stance against Net Neutrality, Google‚Äôs management has always tried to find some kind of compromise with its supporters and didn‚Äôt resort to such measures as frightening everyone and everyone with the upcoming Internet end, which is supposed to be strangled by background noise from day to day created by a multimillion audience of new-fashioned video and audio services. <br><br>  Therefore, the quote, which clearly makes it clear that without a serious, very serious investment in the development of a boring copper and optical network, all the progressive directions of Internet business should be closed right away from sin, this quote made a great impression on many. <br><br><blockquote>  Network infrastructure, and even Google ... does not scale [ <i>following demand</i> ].  It will not offer the quality of service that consumers expect. </blockquote><br><br>  But no one yet wants to invest billions of dollars in order to guarantee a stable broadcast of the next football World Cup without jerking pictures and delays.  Even after the previous one, in its joint efforts with an unprecedented heat in the locations of the largest server centers, in fact almost knocked out more than half of the Global Web.  And the worst thing (for business, of course) is that the users themselves are not at all ready to agree with the inevitable significant increase in tariffs. <br><br>  So, did the Internet really come up against the wall and can not go on?  Opinion of the author: no, not even at all.  It's just time to stop playing politics where it has no place.  And we must prepare ourselves to pay for the right of uninterrupted access to information exactly the price it costs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3277/</a></p>
