I expected that Karma would go down, and she went up.  So I increased the number of pops in the habr!  Forgive me Habr ... </h4><br>  The audience of Habr more and more pops and starts to remind angry Anonymus with two.  I noticed this a long time ago, but today, the habrovchan‚Äôs nasty behavior has now finished me. <br><br>  I read the comments on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/64977/">topic</a> and it became sad for me. <br><br>  So, consider the situation: a person honestly spoke about his negative experience of launching a startup.  Yes, for the most part his conclusions are banal.  Yes, there are some questions.  But I do not understand why the habrovans rushed to throw shit at the author? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone began to laugh at the author and teach him life, but:

      <b>1)</b> A person was able to earn money - the majority of habrovchan this money is simply not able to earn. <br>  <b>2) The</b> man decided to change the scope of activity - very few people are capable of that.  Habravchane generally believe that Gd was caught by the balls and work in the most high-tech industry and also occupy a top position there. <br>  <b>3) The</b> man came up with the idea - for the most part habrovchane can not generate anything at all.  But well I am able to obserat others ideas.  And I consider my miserable little ideas GENIUS by definition. <br>  <b>4) The</b> man decided to spend his money on the idea - habrovchane prefer to spend the money of the investor.  At the same time they are offended that the investor is in no hurry to give them money.  And if it gives, then for some reason, such a reptile, it demands a large share for itself. <br>  <b>5) The</b> man spoke honestly about his mistakes - habrovchane can not recognize their mistakes.  Apparently because they do not commit them. <br><br>  Conclusion.  Average habrovchanin: <br>  <b>1)</b> This is a young (up to 25 years), but already fully formed snob incapable of any creative activity. <br>  <b>2)</b> This is a person suffering from an inferiority complex, which he is trying hard to pass off as a superiority complex.  A habrovcanin is a person who asserts himself by humiliating others. <br>  <b>3)</b> He considers himself very clever, and considers others to be habrovchan fools by definition. <br>  <b>4)</b> He is a terrible coward - he rushes insults on the Internet, but even his boss can not send.  At the same time, the head of Khabrovsk is his main enemy. <br>  <b>5)</b> He does not respect those who work for his uncle, but at the same time the habrovchanin himself works for an uncle (hence, by the way, the habrovchanin does not respect himself) <br>  <b>6)</b> He does not like those who work for themselves, although in his heart he dreams of working for himself.  But the whole world (stupid Americans, government, neighbor on the porch) prevents him from fulfilling his dream. <br>  <b>7)</b> He is lazy and incurious - except for Habr, he does not read anything. <br>  <b>8)</b> He is trying to hide from reality - therefore a lot of gambling. <br>  <b>9)</b> <u>Important: habrovchanin poor as a church rat.</u>  <u>And greedy !!!</u> <br>  <b>10)</b> He despises karmadrocherov, but he quietly (at night?) Podrachivaet.  Karma <br>  <b>11)</b> The biggest crime for the Khabrovsk resident is not to remove the main part of the article rolled up. <br>  <b>12)</b> Khabrovchanin is always the only non-cattle on the resource. <br>  <b>13) A</b> true Khabrovskian denies having the above described qualities in himself, but sees them in all the others. <br><br>  It is sad.  It is sad. <br><br>  Saw something to do with yourself?  Think about it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65001/</a></p>
