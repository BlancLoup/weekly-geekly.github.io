For several years, I explored the issue of emigration: I read blogs, forums, communities, talked with friends and acquaintances who could tell me something new and, of course, during this time, considering the relocation itself, I had a certain amount of information accumulated which I want to share.

      So, if you have an IT education and you are interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdumping from the sad post-Soviet reality, I ask you for a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my case, moving to Germany can be divided into the following stages: <br>  1. desire and opportunity; <br>  2. job search; <br>  3. interview and contract signing; <br>  4. obtaining a visa; <br>  5. direct transfer; <br>  6. Registration at a new location and obtaining a residence permit. <br><br>  Let's go through the details on each of the items. <br><br><h4>  1. Desire and opportunity </h4><br>  It all starts with desire.  Of course, there are cases when a person does not particularly think about moving, and at one moment he comes up with an offer to move to another country.  But in general, the basis of the move is desire.  Motivated person is easier to achieve the desired goal, despite the problems that arise on the way. <br>  Desire helps to find opportunities to move.  We, IT-Schnick, the mass of these opportunities, there would be a desire. <br>  For a person who has education in the field of information technology and work experience, moving to Germany / Holland / Austria is not a big deal. <br><br>  Over the years of researching this topic, I have met many people who said that in Europe we are not needed by anyone, that programmers are here in bulk, and PHP is generally a shitty language and they only write pseudo sites in small desktops.  I heard and read a lot of demotivating statements, they say, they will not give a visa, and there is no work, and the salary will be a penny, and I will die of hunger and in general, where I was born, it was useful there - everything is in the best traditions of the RuNet.  I want to tell you: filter what you read and hear.  It seems to me that a lot of people who have left in their hearts remained scoops, and it‚Äôs just a bastard that someone will be able to leave too, because they are trying to scare you.  Well and surely there are typical characters for whom the abstract "spirituality of the people" is more important than real economic / social / political indicators. <br><br>  I am sick of clever men who, without understanding the essence of the question, are scattered by harsh negative statements.  Here are some of them: <br>  1. "In Europe, programmers are already overkill, their experts are sitting without work." - False.  During the last year, only among my friends and acquaintances of IT-shnik two of them moved to work in Holland and three to Germany.  Just the other day, another acquaintance received a work visa for himself and his wife. <br>  2. "PHP is not needed by anyone, money is not paid, there are few vacancies." - False.  To date, four of my friends have already received a visa and are working with PHP-people in Germany and the Netherlands.  Salaries are not huge, but not penny, for the first time there is enough money for everyone to rent a 2-room apartment and maintain a family of two or three people.  For the start of this is quite enough, and with time the RFP will naturally rise.  In addition, at the moment I have been working in Germany for a year now, and I receive requests from recruiters with vacancies through linked.in and xing several times a month. <br>  3. ‚ÄúWithout knowledge of German, the chances of finding a job are minimal.‚Äù - Exaggeration.  For IT-Schnick, as a rule, requires knowledge of English.  For example, I practically do not know German, and my friends who have moved also don‚Äôt really know German / Dutch.  But for non-IT specialties without a knowledge of German, finding a job is really not easy. <br>  4. "From beginning to end on the move can take a year or two" - False.  My first conversation with recruiters took place on September 18, 2012, and on February 4, 2013 I went to work in Germany - a total of 5 months.  My friend started to sign up on Xing on August 8, 2012, and although he was in a passive search, the first recruiter wrote to him already on September 19, then another 6 people wrote to him, a friend did not hurry and did not gossip with recruiters.  But on February 8, 2013, he received a proposal that he liked, and as a result of May 2, he already went to work in Germany.  9 months from the moment of registration and less than 3 months from the moment of communication with the desired recruiter before the move. <br><br>  Therefore, moving is not so terrible as some people like to talk about.  Naturally, Germany also has its drawbacks and problems, but everything depends on the desire and motivation of the person and on what is more important for him.  And I want to say once again: if you have an IT education and experience in the relevant specialty, you have great chances to leave this mess. <br><br>  Blue Card - it was for this program that I went to Germany.  This is a real opportunity for IT professionals to move to Germany and some other EU countries.  Many of the readers have probably already heard about the Blue Card, but I want to briefly describe its main points: <br>  - This program makes it easier to obtain work visas for a number of EU countries; <br>  - Each country that participates in this program may have its own specific requirements for candidates; <br>  - Blue Card is aimed at highly skilled workers and specialists in industries that are experiencing a shortage of personnel; <br>  - the greatest chance of getting a Blue Card from IT-Schnick, doctors and engineers; <br>  - the Blue Card holder has the right to work in another country, which also participates in this program, but first it needs to work out a year and a half in the country that issued the card; <br>  - If a family member has received a Blue Card, his spouse (in general) receives a work permit without reference to the employer and the field of activity; <br>  - 33 months after working on the Blue Card, you can get a permanent residence; <br>  - if you know German at level B1, then permanent residence will be given to you after 21 months of work on the Blue Card; <br>  - in theory, the spouse of the Blue Card holder does not even need to know German, but the embassy staff may not agree with this, so the spouse may need a certificate that he knows German at A1 level (the lowest level); <br>  - As a rule, in order to get a Blue Card, you need to have a contract from an employer with an RFP not lower than a certain level and a higher education in the relevant field. <br><br>  In 2012, the year for Germany, the ZP level was ‚Ç¨ 34,944 / year for IT specialists / doctors / engineers, and ‚Ç¨ 44,800 / year for other specialists.  In 2013, the level increased slightly - ‚Ç¨ 36.192 and ‚Ç¨ 46.400, respectively. <br><br><h4>  2. Job search </h4><br>  The desire is there, and the Blue Card is a real opportunity.  Now we will look for work in Germany. <br>  About Linkedin.in know almost everything.  But not everyone knows about Xing.  Meet: <a href="http://www.xing.com/">www.xing.com</a> is an analogue of LinkedIn, which is widely used in Germany.  It was through Xing that recruiters found me who brought me to the company where I work now.  Through Xing, my friend, a former PHP person who focused on JS, also found a job.  So first of all get yourself an account on Xing and Linked.in, indicate there that you want to move and fill out the profile fully.  By the way, I still get job offers from both sites, although I‚Äôve always noted that I‚Äôm not looking for a job (this is another stone in the garden of those who say that it‚Äôs impossible to find a job in Germany). <br><br>  In addition to these two sites, you can also register and search for vacancies such as <a href="http://www.monster.de/">www.monster.de</a> and <a href="http://www.stepstone.de/">www.stepstone.de</a> . <br><br>  In Germany, when they send their resumes to an employer, they often send the following documents: <br>  - Bewerbungsschreiben (English Cover Letter) - a motivation letter, where you briefly write, what interested you company, what position do you want and why they should take you (this is one file, one page); <br>  - Lebenslauf (English - CV) - the actual resume (this is also one file, for a couple of pages); <br>  - Zeugnis (English - Certificate, Reference) - documents showing your education, reviews from previous work (separate files with diploma translation and reviews). <br>  All documents must be in pdf format.  If you do not know German and expect to work in an IT company where they speak English, you can safely send documents in English.  I have most of the Germans in the company, and therefore they speak German among themselves, but during discussions, in documentation, or in person with English speaking, they calmly switch to English. <br>  Since I was found through Xing, I only needed to send a resume in English.  But if you want to take the initiative and send out a resume yourself, then it would be nice to send all the above documents. <br><br><h4>  3. Interview and contract signing </h4><br>  As a rule, the first interview is via Skype, in addition, you can be given some test items.  Sometimes they can even call you on a mobile phone.  If you successfully pass a Skype interview and perform test tasks, then you will most likely be invited to an in-person meeting at the office of your employer.  Personally, I first had several phone calls and Skype interviews with a recruiter, then several Skype interviews directly with the employer.  After the Skype interview I was given a test task, and when I did it, I was already invited to a personal meeting in Germany. <br><br>  For most of us, a visa is required to travel to Germany.  When applying for a visa, I highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the list of required documents directly on the website of the German Embassy in your country.  Here, for example, the list of documents on the website of the embassy in Kiev: <a href="http://www.kiew.diplo.de/Vertretung/kiew/uk/05/Visa/Unterlagen/Reisezwecke-15-sonstige.html">www.kiew.diplo.de/Vertretung/kiew/uk/05/Visa/Unterlagen/Reisezwecke-15-sonstige.html</a> . <br><br>  In order to confirm the purpose of your trip, you will need to show an invitation for an interview at the embassy.  With what specifically indicate the purpose of the trip, not everything is clear.  I had indicated the purpose of the trip as ‚Äúother‚Äù and gave the visa without problems, the other purpose of the trip was initially indicated the same, but in the embassy he was asked to correct the purpose of the ‚Äúservice‚Äù and the visa was eventually given a service one.  If you are unsure what purpose to indicate - call the embassy. <br><br>  It is very desirable to bring the original invitation.  I didn‚Äôt receive the invitation on time, so I had to carry a printed copy, which I was sent to the soap, and the employers, in turn, sent a copy of the invitation by fax to the embassy.  A couple of days after the interview, I was asked to convey to the embassy another copy of the director‚Äôs identity card (on behalf of which the invitation was signed) and an extract from the company's trade register (Handelsregisterauszug), as confirmation that this was a real office and the person who signed the invitation is indeed the director.  By that time, I had already received a physical letter with an invitation, and I reported all these documents to the embassy.  The visa was given somewhere in 5 working days, and I was incredibly pleased to fly to Hamburg for an interview.  My friend was given a visa in 3 days.  But I heard that now the rules have changed and the deadlines through the embassy have increased to 10 days.  As an option - you can contact the visa center, which for 800 UAH ($ 100) will make a visa in 5-7 days.  This is data for Ukraine.  Visa center in Kiev is located on the street.  Frunze 60 (http://www.germanyvac-ua.com/). <br><br>  At the face-to-face interview, I first had a conversation with the director and technical director of the company, then the team lead backend (PHP) and frontend (JS) departments spoke to me in turn.  The next day I was offered a contract, I had previously agreed, but asked for a couple of days to read the text that I had been thrown to an e-mail.  In Kiev, I read the contract in detail and agreed to sign it.  I was sent the contract by physical mail and asked to pre-print and sign an e-mail version of the contract. <br><br><h4>  4. Getting a visa </h4><br>  The employer has been found, it remains to wait until the paper version of the contract comes, sign it again, and go to the embassy for a visa.  Initially, the embassy gives a 3-month national visa for the purpose of employment.  These 3 months you are given to settle in a new city, register at the apartment, and apply for a Blue Card already in Germany - in paragraph 6. That is, the Blue Card is not issued at your embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãbut directly in Germany, where you come for a 3-month visa (on which you can already work). <br>  Here is the page on the website of the embassy in Kiev, where documents for different visas are <a href="http://www.kiew.diplo.de/Vertretung/kiew/uk/05/Visa/Visa__K-II/Merkblaetter__K-II.html">listed</a> - <a href="http://www.kiew.diplo.de/Vertretung/kiew/uk/05/Visa/Visa__K-II/Merkblaetter__K-II.html">www.kiew.diplo.de/Vertretung/kiew/uk/05/Visa/Visa__K-II/Merkblaetter__K-II.html</a> .  We are interested in the ‚Äúvisa application form for employment in Germany‚Äù, which lists the necessary documents - <a href="http://www.kiew.diplo.de/contentblob/1351384/Daten/3194837/pdf_arbeitsaufnahme.pdf">www.kiew.diplo.de/contentblob/1351384/Daten/3194837/pdf_arbeitsaufnahme.pdf</a> . <br>  I moved with my wife, so we had to collect documents for her too - her visa is called a ‚Äúreunification visa‚Äù.  Documents can (and even better) submit at the same time. <br><br>  Please note that your certificate of higher education (yes, the diploma came in handy) you need to submit an apostille, translate into German and notarize.  I did it all separately - at first I went to the office, which puts an apostille, then I took it to the translation bureau, then to the notary - I had to tinker.  There are offices that do everything at once - just bring a diploma and money. <br>  The same operation (apostille, translation, notarization) must be carried out with a marriage certificate. <br>  As I wrote above, it may turn out that the spouse will be asked to confirm the minimum knowledge of German.  The surest way in this case is to send a wife / husband for a couple of months to German courses at the Goethe Institute, after which you can get certified to level A1.  In principle, you can go to any German courses, but you will still take the exam at the Goethe Institute.  Knowledge of the language in any case does not hurt.  Since my wife is a translator of German and English, instead of a certificate, we brought her diploma to the embassy (again, with apostille, translation and notarization). <br><br>  At the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãyou definitely need to bring the original contract with your signatures and signatures of the director of the company.  I already wrote that my invitation did not come on time.  Now I will write more.  The contract, which the Germans sent by mail, did not reach me at all!  The Germans sent a contract via DHL Express, which delivers the letter quickly to the border with Ukraine, and then it falls into the hands of UkrPoshta, that is, it falls into a black hole.  In general, I saw that the contract did not go for a long time, and asked employers to send the contract through the bus driver Hamburg - Kiev.  And, voila, for 10 euros and a few days the contract arrived in Kiev.  So if you want to sleep peacefully, ask employers to, if possible, send you a contract through UPS, DHL Express Worldwide or DHL Air - this is more expensive, but more reliable.  In extreme cases, you can negotiate with the bus driver or sign a contract immediately in Germany. <br><br>  If you have any questions about visas, I advise you to call the embassy.  Sometimes it even makes sense to go to the embassy and personally ask.  That's exactly what I did.  In the list of documents for a visa for the purpose of employment is the item "insurance".  This is the most incomprehensible point, since you most likely will not yet have full medical insurance and you will have nothing to bear.  A temporary honey.  insurance, as a Schengen visa, is not suitable in principle here.  I called the embassy and they told me that I had to carry insurance, then I went to the embassy and they told me that it was not necessary to carry insurance.  Mess.  In general, I brought to the embassy a copy of the questionnaire for honey.  the insurance that the employers sent me, and my friend, for example, generally submitted the docks even without a hint of insurance. <br><br>  In addition, the questionnaire will be the point where you must specify the address of your residence.  Most likely, you will not have an apartment in Germany at that time.  If a company provides you with a home for the first time, you can indicate this home.  In extreme cases, specify the address of the company.  The embassy must know at least some address, since it will send a request to the Office for Foreigners, which is tied to this address.  The Foreign Office in Germany is called Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde, in Russian-speaking communities they like to call it ABH.  In this case, the embassy mediates between you and the ABH and simply transfers your documents to this department.  And already ABH decides whether to issue you a visa or not.  Sometimes you can ask your employer to call ABH and find out how things are going there with the review of documents, and possibly ask them to speed up.  Judging by what is written on the Internet, I would not advise you personally to write or call ABK to find out how the matter is progressing, it is better to let the employer do this. <br><br>  The time of issuing a visa is different, according to the Internet and my experience - from 3 weeks to 2 months.  I submitted the documents, it seems, on December 18th, 2012, and received a visa on January 29th, 2013. In my case, the process was delayed due to the Christmas holidays.  My friend filed the docks on March 20, received a visa on April 19.  Another friend submitted the docks on April 23rd, and received the visa on May 22nd.  An acquaintance who recently received a visa with his wife, generally waited only 3 weeks.  Then how lucky. <br><br><h4>  5. Immediate relocation </h4><br>  We received visas, now we are thinking how to move to a new place.  There are different options.  For example, you can collect a couple of bags of essential items and fly on an airplane.  In this case, the rest of the necessary things can either be bought in Germany, or later when traveling home, take a couple more bags of things with you.  Most likely, you will be given a multi-visa, with which you can easily leave Germany and come back. <br>  Another option, if there is a car, is to load the clothes into the car, how much will fit, and drive it under its own power. <br>  Since we sold the car before we left, and there were a lot of things, we decided to negotiate with the driver of a minibus who would help with transportation.  As a result, we found a great guy who has been turning the steering wheel around Europe for many years and knows how to talk to customs officers. <br>  If anyone needs, here are the contacts of the carrier (name is Vladimir): <br>  +380631490799 - Ukrainian number 1 <br>  +380679359416 - Ukrainian number 2 <br>  soap: lvov_vladimir3@ukr.net <br><br>  I highly recommend taking 5-10 thousand Euros with me.  Depending on the situation, you may have a lot of expenses.  For example, if you move into an apartment, if you are not lucky, you will immediately have to pay 5-6 monthly apartment payments, this can already result in ‚Ç¨ 4k.  In addition, the apartments often come across not furnished, respectively, you can spend a thousand or more Euros on furniture.  Well, the first month you will have to live on something, plus there will definitely be some other related expenses.  Therefore, in order to feel calm, take at least ‚Ç¨ 5k. <br><br><h4>  6. Registration at a new location and obtaining a residence permit </h4><br>  Well, moved.  But it's too early to relax, everything is just beginning.  New place, new people, if you do not know German, then a new language.  As far as I know, in Germany, English is better in big cities and tight in small ones.  Although even in big cities not everyone speaks English.  Of course, the percentage of people who know English is much higher than in Ukraine or Russia, and there is a high probability that you will find a person who speaks English in the street or in the store.  But this is not always the case, and sometimes without German it‚Äôs hard.  So my advice is if you intend to move, study the language.  For work only knowledge of English can be quite enough, but for a full-fledged daily life, English will not be enough and with knowledge of the language, life will become much more comfortable. <br><br>  Yes, by the way, and moved where?  A good option if your employer for the first time provides some kind of housing and gives you a month or two to search for your apartment.  If the employer does not provide housing, then the situation is more complicated.  Remotely renting an apartment will be very problematic, especially in large cities - Hamburg, Munich.  In any case, you should talk about housing with your employer before the move, most likely, you will be able to prompt something or help with the search for housing.  Maybe you have to rent some inexpensive hotel for the first time. <br>  In my case, the first month I lived in one of the rooms of the 3-room apartment of the employer. <br><br>  In the first few days after the move, you will need to do the following: <br>  1. Register where you have moved.  To register you need to go to your local registration center - Einwohnermeldeamt, look on the Internet, which refers to your address.  Wherever you live for the first time (employer's apartment, hotel, etc.), you need to register at this address during the first week.  For registration you need to come with your passport to Einwohnermeldeamt, say that you want to register, they will register you on the same day and give you a certificate of your registration.  Just in case, you can take along your work contract and some confirmation that you really live at that address (if you have one), but it seems to me that they did not ask me. <br>  2. Open a bank account.  In order to open an account, you will most likely need a residence permit, and, of course, a passport and a work contract.  On this account, you will be transferred a salary, and in the future you will be charged money for an apartment, gas, water, etc.  Which one to choose a bank, I can not advise.  I will say that I have an account with Hamburger Sparkasse and I do not complain, but he, apparently, is only in Hamburg.  I also heard good reviews about Sparda Bank and Commerzbank, but I didn‚Äôt come across them personally. <br>  3. Buy a SIM card.  Here, too, the choice is yours, on the Internet there are a lot of discussions and websites about choosing an operator.  In the end, I stopped at Aldi Talk, because he had for ‚Ç¨ 8 / month.  You can get 300 minutes + SMS (anlim. within the network) and 300Mb of the Internet, which is quite a good offer for Germany. <br><br><h5>  6.1.  Apartment Search </h5><br>  After that, you can start a full search for an apartment.  Naturally, in different cities the situation with apartments is different.  For example, in Hamburg and Munich it is quite difficult to find an apartment, there is a lot of competition and high prices.  At the same time, there are few offers in small towns and everything is very spread throughout the territory. <br>  Here are the main sites through which you can search for apartments: <br>  <a href="http://www.immobilienscout24.de/">www.immobilienscout24.de</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.immowelt.de/">www.immowelt.de</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.wg-gesucht.de/">www.wg-gesucht.de</a> <br>  <a href="http://immo.suedfinder.de/">immo.suedfinder.de</a> <br>  And another brokerage site, where the brokers themselves select an apartment for you (of course, not for free): <br>  <a href="http://www.homecompany.de/">www.homecompany.de</a> <br><br>  Before moving, you can analyze the situation on these sites by options and prices, in order to get ready for expenses in advance.  If you investigate the state of prices, be guided by average and above average prices, since in reality apartments that are cheap either do not give up, or there is tremendous competition, and the chance to rent such an apartment will be rather low. <br>  Be careful, sometimes you can run into kidalovo, this is especially important for large cities, where there are a lot of foreigners.  If the option is very cheap, or if everything looks too good to be true, this is probably a divorce.  Do not give money until you have seen the apartment and have not yet agreed on a contract. <br>  Here is a very useful article about finding an apartment in Germany - <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/Apartment_rental">www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/Apartment_rental</a> , I highly recommend reading. <br><br>  When searching for apartments, you first need to remember that there are two prices, "Kalt" and "Warm": <br>  - ‚ÄúCalt‚Äù is the cost of renting an apartment, without utilities; <br>  - "Varm" is the cost of renting with utilities (water, gas, electricity, etc.). <br>  In addition, you may have to pay separately for the Internet and something else - so be sure to find out what exactly is included in ‚Äúkalt‚Äù, what is in ‚Äúwarme‚Äù, and what else you will have to pay. <br><br>  As I wrote above, the entrance to the apartment can hit your pocket a lot, since you may incur the following expenses: <br>  1. Give the 2.38 monthly ‚ÄúCalt‚Äù lease to the broker for his ‚Äúservices‚Äù (i.e., if you rented an apartment for ‚Ç¨ 1000 ‚ÄúCalt‚Äù, then you will have to pay ‚Ç¨ 2380 to the broker).  Not all apartments are rented through brokers, sometimes you can get on the owner, or on a small apartment company, where they take the symbolic 150-300 euros. <br>  2. To pay as a pledge (deposit) the amount of 1-3 ‚ÄúCalt‚Äù payments - the amount of the pledge depends on who you are on. <br>  3. Pay for the first month of stay. <br>  Thus, with a not very successful set of circumstances, you can immediately pay 6 times the amount of "Calt" rent.  And this is the reality.  So be prepared, it‚Äôs better to bring more money and then find out that you paid less and manage the remaining money at your own discretion than to bring in a little and then puzzle over where to get money to rent an apartment. <br><br>  Another important point - the apartments most often rent not furnished.  Basically - it is an empty apartment, where there is a kitchen (cabinets, refrigerator, stove, sink) and a bathroom (toilet, shower, washbasin).  Perhaps there will be no lamps on the ceilings.  There are even completely empty apartments.  Sometimes you can get to the furnished apartment - but this is as lucky.  Therefore, depending on your needs, put ‚Ç¨ 1k- ‚Ç¨ 3k on furniture.  In my case, the apartment was with a kitchen, the bathroom had a toilet, a washbasin and a bathtub under the shower stall, and there were already chandeliers on the ceilings.  Everything else (cabinets and a stall in the bathroom, wardrobes, sofa, bed, table, chairs, etc.) was bought independently in Ikea and Poco. <br><br>  In order to rent an apartment, you will most likely need: <br>  - working contract; <br>  - passport with a visa; <br>  - Bank account; <br>  - Besch√§ftigungsbescheinigung - a piece of paper from the employer, which confirms that you are actually working for them; <br>  - Vorvermieterbescheinigung - a note from the past landlord that you were a good tenant.  If you live the first time in the apartment of the employer, you can ask them for this piece of paper.  In extreme cases, go without it. <br>  - SCHUFA Auskunft - an extract that you have a good credit history.  Can be done for a small fee here - <a href="http://www.easycredit.de/Schufa.htm">www.easycredit.de/Schufa.htm</a> <br>  Although my friend, who rented an apartment in the south of Germany, needed to bring only a working contract.  Even the passport was not needed. <br><br>  Remember that in Germany they take seriously how many people live in an apartment.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If landlords consider that the apartment is too small for a certain number of people, you will be denied. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are traveling together, it is better to immediately begin the search from 2-room apartments, it is very difficult to rent a one-room apartment for two people, although anything can happen. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not know how the situation is in other cities, but in Hamburg a lot of landlords in English either do not speak or speak with difficulty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me it turned out to be quite a big problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, I had minimal knowledge of German, which sometimes allowed me to somehow agree on viewing the apartment. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After signing the contract and settling in your permanent apartment, you will need to register at Einwohnermeldeamt at your new address.</font></font><br><br><h5>  6.2.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Getting a Blue Card </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a residence permit, you can go to apply for a Blue Card in your local ABH. First you need to go to ABH and book the filing date of the documents (called ‚Äúterm‚Äù, in some ABH you can book through their website). The date can be assigned now, after a week, and after a month. In order to book a date, you do not need to have a registration - you will need it when you come to apply. Terms of issuing cards depend on various factors, and may take from 3 to 6 weeks. Considering that your visa will be valid for only 3 months, I would recommend that you agree on the date of submission of documents so that there is at least 6 weeks left until the end of your visa. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the documents you will need: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- working contract;</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- confirmation that you are actually working (Besch√§ftigungsbescheinigung); </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- passport with a visa; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- registration; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- documents confirming qualification (diplomas, language certificates); </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- honey insurance (issued in the Krankenkasse you like - I advise you to talk with your employer about this); </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- if you are with your wife, take her residence permit, passport, and marriage certificate (your wife will also receive a residence and work permit); </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- some other small documents - in ABH you can give you a complete list of everything you need to bring.</font></font><br><br>    ,     , ,             .    ,      ,                   ‚Äî      . <br><br> Blue Card ‚Äî           .    ,     4 ,      ,          3  (  ,  4 ),    ,       . <br><br><h4>   </h4><br>      .   5   ,        - .
