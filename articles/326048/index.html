  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Games for HTC Vive that can already be played</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On May 17, we will have an exhibition and conference on virtual reality <a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">VR-TODAY in VSHBI</a> .  In this regard, we decided to add to our blog on the gaming industry translations of collections of games for virtual reality helmets from the Upload VR portal.  To make it easier to navigate with which games it is worth starting acquaintance with virtual reality, and if you own a helmet, what should be installed.  So, under the cut translation for games for HTC Vive.  And also at the end you will find a small survey about which VR helmet you like best. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/bea/f83/72fbeaf832dc469abe777661f270adcf.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since HTC Vive has been on the market for some time, we were able to see a huge amount of content for Valve's flagship VR helmet.  Hundreds of Steam games support HTC Vive, although it's worth noting that most of them can offer not so much exciting content besides simple gameplay mechanics that could entertain for half an hour. <br><br>  As a result, we felt the need to provide a complete list with the current list of the best games for Vive, in which you could play right now.  It goes without saying that the first three Vive games you should play are the three original titles that came with the very first Vive pre-orders: <b>Tilt Brush</b> , <b>Job Simulator</b> and <b>Fantastic Contraption</b> .  And although these games are no longer shipped in a bundle, they are still a great demonstration of what VR can achieve when focusing on very specific concepts.  In addition, <b>The Gallery: Episode 1 - Call of the Starseed</b> and <b>Zombie Training Simulator</b> are now included in all Vive <b>bundles</b> , and also deserve attention, as in their own beautiful games.  In addition, <b>Google Earth VR</b> , <b>The Lab</b> and <b>Rec Room</b> are the top three apps of all time, but since they are absolutely free, we decided not to include them in this list.

      This list focuses on games for which you do not have such a simple initial access.  If you have just purchased a Vive or are looking for something to play, then you already tried those games that were included.  And you want something more.  This is what this list is for. <br><br>  None of the following games comes bundled with a helmet, prices are likely to change every week or month, and there is a chance that they will receive updates and patches that will make them even better than they are now.  But the fact remains that at the time of this writing, these are 9 mast hevas among the currently available games for Vive, and we will present them out of any particular order. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Arizona Sunshine</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZ7T0VVMEyg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  If you‚Äôve ever sat with your friends and played: ‚ÄúHow could we survive the zombie apocalypse?‚Äù Then the Arizona Sunshine is the game for you.  Its developer Vertigo Games takes you straight to the sun-scorched Arizona desert.  Landscapes would be quite picturesque if they were not filled with legions of ghouls. <br><br>  Being armed only with a handful of firearms, you will need to scour for food, ammunition and shelter, as you work your way through the contaminated terrain in search of a safe haven from an endless horde of zombies.  The gameplay of Arizona Sunshine is satisfying and letting you feel in your gut, the protagonist is superbly voiced, and the story makes you feel despair, which is forced by the feeling of the end of the world. <br><br>  Also in the game there are various modes of complexity that allow you to change the damage of the zombies and the degree of shortage of ammunition.  As a culmination, there is an almost impassable ‚ÄúApocalypse Mode‚Äù that will make you think seriously before each shot.  The horde's online mode is awesome for passing with friends, and the mechanics of the shootout and reloading weapons will retain the feeling of your active involvement in your own survival. <br><br>  In a market crowded with zombie shooters, the Arizona Sunshine is a cut above the rest of the games. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Raw data</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8phhKZn4DuM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  Raw Data is what happens when a group of game developers get together and create a virtual world in which all the protagonists are cool heroes who are endowed with superpowers and knead cyborgs.  It would be possible to take for "just another wive-shooter," but that would be a disgusting simplification of this game.  You do not just defeat robots and consider this to be a complete matter, but also you move around in the environment and are engaged in defense, evasion and other things. <br><br>  What makes Raw Data so great is that you are not only fighting with these robots alone, but also in cooperative multiplayer with friends or random people from the network.  The variety of different classes, such as fighting with a pistol or a sword, provides a wide variety of gameplay.  And with the addition of more classes, as well as missions, skills and enemies, this is quite one of the most polished and strongest VR titles on the market that are in early access. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Vanishing realms</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RauvvV4QAHQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play D &amp; D with a touch of Zelda in BP?  Then you no longer need to look for this, because Vanishing Realms will be able to satisfy this need quite well.  At first glance, this is a relatively banal dungeon-crawler with light elements of world exploration and jigsaw puzzles, but this game really begins to manifest itself when you enter into battle. <br><br>  Using the Vive controllers and their tracking, you are maneuvering among your surroundings, dodging enemies and attacks, and you can even swing your sword and block with a shield with realistic 1: 1 motion tracking.  Did you hear the sound of a bowstring released behind your back?  Turn around and block the arrow strike with your shield.  Sneak up from behind cover and cast spells on enemies.  All this you can do in Vanishing Realms. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Onward</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkDrMbQhh3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  This is a hardcore VR shooter for hardcore VR gamers.  If you grew up playing games like Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, SOCOM and other similar tactical military shooters, then you will feel at home in Onward.  It has much more in common with these games in terms of a grueling team game than in terms of running around and shooting, which can be found in modern shooters such as Call of Duty, and the whole game was created by one guy. <br><br>  Starting from holding your rifle with both hands and using a walkie-talkie on your shoulder, ending with pulling a knife, while sneaking up to your opponent, Onward is the very visceral, realistic VR game that many people have been waiting for.  A healthy and fun community makes this game really stand out among other titles HTC Vive. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A Chair in a Room: Greenwater</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyyrIrTdaYw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  What can scare you?  I do not mean that it can make you jump up in surprise due to the fact that something jumps out from around the corner in the dark, or an unexpected loud noise that took them by surprise.  I mean, what really might scare you?  Such a horror that will make everyone think about it after you take off the helmet and finish playing.  The answer to this question will be quite different depending on each individual person, but for me this is A Chair in a Room: Greenwater. <br><br>  Everything from waking up to leaving a bad sense of foreboding sounds and atmosphere, to a swirling history of mental disorder and terrifying bondage, makes A Chair in a Room: Greenwater one of the worst games played on HTC Vive.  Instead of relying on cheap pop-up horror stories, she suggests a disturbing narrative that leads to a breathtaking ending.  The game is far from ideal, but this is a great example of what opportunities VR offers to the horror genre. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The Brookhaven Experiment</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5mOb09lqnU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  You have probably heard about it before or have seen it, since The Brookhaven Experiment has become a synonym for: ‚ÄúHey!  Look at the ridiculous reaction of a person to VR! ‚Äù  But the good side of The Brookhaven Experiment is that if you look deeper than the video with stupid reactions, and look at the essence of the game, you will find one of the most satisfying (albeit terrifying) VR adventures that exist on the market at the moment. <br><br>  You can cut through the game both in survival mode, defeating the waves of enemies as they become more and more difficult and in the campaign mode, in which there is a pseudo-plot and dubbing, telling about the story in progress.  Between the waves, you can upgrade your weapons, preparing for the attack of an increasing number of zombies, crawlers and other terrible creatures.  It sounds pretty simple, but the slow-growing horror that you encounter when you turn around in search of the last zombie (just before the battery in your flashlight sits) really unnerves. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">AirMech Command</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOjgmyVesgM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  It would seem that there is no point in doing a top-down strategy in VR.  After all, most people when they imagine that they would like to do in a VR helmet, then think about such things as first-person shooters or adventure games, but in fact, strategies are quite suitable for this platform.  After all, the advantage that you get, watching as if from the height of bird flight - this is an opportunity to see the whole battlefield like never before. <br><br>  With the latest update, AirMech Command has established itself as one of the best strategies in VR, including support for motion controllers, so you can actually reach out and interact with the world and your units.  Fans of real-time strategies should definitely try this game.  Saturated single and multiplayer modes provide enough content to keep you busy. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Island: 359</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpN-TyljLOA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  Damn sorry, but apparently, in 2016, people almost forgot how terrible dinosaurs can be.  They were mostly driven out by zombies, as the first choice of monsters, but there is little that can be compared with the ferocity and horror of the roar of the uplifting tyrannosaur.  This is what Island: 359 not only covers, but also develops from start to finish.  For the time being, this may be only a fragment of a planned vision, but it already provides much of what was promised at the beginning. <br><br>  In Island: 359 you are a mercenary who was thrown into dangerous tropical jungles to hunt large, evil dinosaurs.  You will be instructed to travel to the depths of wild nature overgrown with trees, vast areas, complemented by fast movement through teleportation.  With a lot of objects, weapons and other things that you can find, you will spend your time pumping as you move through the jungle.  But be careful: your loot will not be counted if you cannot return to the helicopter to evacuate. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Redout</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr_BQyO6MbI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  Imitation WipeOut, which does everything right and in its imitation, surpasses Sony's own races by upgrading them for 2016 and adding VR support.  This may not be just a VR game, unlike the others that we aim to cover on UploadVR, but this is still one of the best games that you can play right now with HTC Vive. <br><br>  Incredibly intense speed and obviously a wide range of content looks refreshing in the industry, which is permeated with demo versions and short-lived adventures.  Redout appeared out of nowhere, offering speed, arousal and intensity, which the market lacked so much.  If you have not tried this game, then be sure to do it. <br><br>  <i>At this our translation came to an end.</i>  <i>Live to try the games and non-gaming capabilities of virtual reality can be with us on May 17 from 11:00 to 18:00.</i>  <i>There will be virtual reality suit testing for total immersion, showcases of VR projects, VR rides, a VR cinema and a number of reports with practical cases of introducing VR in various fields.</i>  <i>And each participant will receive a certificate from the Higher School of Economics Higher School of Economics at the conference.</i>  <i>For all readers of our blog on Habr√©, we decided to make a 20% discount on a ticket.</i>  <i>When <a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">registering,</a> use the code "habr" in the "from where you learned about the event."</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326048/</a></p>
