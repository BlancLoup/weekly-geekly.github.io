It is installed on the computers of private entrepreneurs - OSMP terminal owners, and sends the details (terminal number, user name, password) of the agent account in the OSMP payment system to the attacker. <br><br>  In recent years, the program has gained wide popularity, ‚Äúbaths‚Äù with money were sold on forums with a discount of up to 80%.  Their devastation was carried out even with the help of spam emails like ‚Äúreplenish a mobile phone account for 50%‚Äù with the withdrawal of WM through anonymous wallets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  They say that, thanks to OSMP Grabber, the scheme of the Gulf of money became possible not through traditional drops, but through legal entities.  Apparently, OSMP terminals were used as a buffer in the scheme of cash withdrawal from other bank cards.

      On the website of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, it is reported that in the framework of a single criminal case with Glotov, a certain Andriyan Stepanov, who helped in cashing, will be tried.  In addition, ‚Äúwithin the framework of this criminal case, another member of the criminal gang was charged.  Due to the fact that a pre-trial agreement was concluded with him, he has already been sentenced to 2.5 years in prison ‚Äù(here everything is clear without comment). <br><br>  In this criminal scheme, the following moment also looks unusual.  The private company Group IB has helped to catch the fraudsters, the Vedomosti newspaper <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/1444483/vorovat_ponovomu">writes</a> .  The newspaper does not say who specifically paid for the company's services, but the fact of their participation is confirmed.  Stepanov and Glotov ‚Äúcaught stealing 10 million rubles.  from accounts of 41 agents of OSMP and E-port electronic payment systems (now Qiwi system) in 2007-2009. ‚Äù  The record ‚Äúbath‚Äù, according to the materials of the criminal case, was merged from a businessman from the city of Vladimir in the amount of 1.8 million rubles.  Maybe the ‚Äúdetectives‚Äù from Group IB hired him. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.group-ib.ru/">Group IB has</a> lit up on Habr√© only once when it <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/116390/">announced tariffs</a> from underground forums, describing in detail the types of services and prices for DDoS attacks of different quality, ‚Äúflooding‚Äù money from remote banking services (remote banking service), selling downloads in different regions of the world, buying traffic, black SEO, etc.  Obviously, this company has informers in the world of the criminal "underground", so it is capable of uncovering even crimes that are inaccessible to the understanding of federal services.  They act as experts during various incidents related to DDoS attacks, money theft in electronic payment systems.  The company provides a number of services to its customers: computer forensics, incident investigation, search for customers for DDoS attacks. <br><br>  Group IB CEO told Vedomosti newspaper that Russia has six successful criminal groups that specialize in frauds in RBS systems, and each steals about $ 150 million a year, so the lawsuit against Glotov because of the damage of 10 million rubles .  can be called "little things." <br><br>  A hearing on the case of Maxim Glotov will be held in the Zheleznodorozhny District Court of the city of Yekaterinburg (case <a href="http://zheleznodorozhny.svd.sudrf.ru/modules.php%3Fname%3Dsud_delo%26srv_num%3D3%26op%3Dcs%26case_id%3D17591078%26delo_id%3D1540006%26case_type%3D50780000">No. 1-742 / 2011</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134086/</a></p>
