      <b>And this is what should not be done in any case in order not to lose the advantages of containers:</b> <br><br>  <b>1. No need to store data inside the container.</b>  During the life cycle of containers can be suspended, destroyed, replaced.  If the application runs in a container, then version 1.0 of this application should be easily changed to version 1.1 without data loss and other troubles.  Therefore, if you want to save data, you need to write them on that.  However, then you need to take care that the two containers are not written in the same place, so as not to damage the data.  So, check that applications correctly write data to the shared storage. <br><br>  <b>2. Do not crush the delivery of applications.</b>  Some people think that the container is the same virtual machine.  And most of them believe that applications need to be deployed in existing existing containers.  In fact, this is also possible, especially in the development phase, when there is a constant debugging and deployment.  However, applications should only arrive on the CD conveyor for continuous delivery to the QA department or in production as part of their own image.  Remember: containers are immutable. <br><br>  <b>3. Do not create large images.</b>  Large image is more difficult to distribute.  Therefore, you should include in the image only those files and libraries that are really needed to start the application process.  No need to install unnecessary packages or run updates (yum update), which create a new layer in the image and write a lot of files to it. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not use single-layer containers.</b>  To efficiently use multi-layer (multi-level) file systems, always create separate layers for the OS, for username definition, for configuration, and finally, for the application itself.  So it will be easier to recreate, accompany and distribute images. <br><br>  <b>5. No need to create images from running containers.</b>  In other words, do not use the docker commit command to create an image, since such images will not be reproducible.  Instead, always use Dockerfile or other S2I tools (source-to-image) that provide reproducibility.  In addition, you can easily track changes in the Dockerfile by storing it in the source repository (git). <br><br>  <b>6. Do not use only the latest tag.</b>  This tag is something like SNAPSHOT for Maven users.  Due to the multi-layered file system of containers, tags are very useful.  However, you may have an unpleasant surprise when, for example, after a break of many months, you decide to build an image and suddenly find that the application does not start anymore, because the parental layer (FROM in Dockerfile) has been replaced by a new version that does not support backward compatibility.  Or because the latest version that you were waiting for was removed from the build cache.  In addition, the latest tag should also be avoided when deploying containers in production, since you cannot track which version of the image is running. <br><br>  <b>7. No need to run more than one process in a container.</b>  Containers are ideally suited to perform a single process (http daemon daemon, application server, DBMS).  Otherwise, you may encounter all sorts of troubles, such as digging into logs or updating processes separately. <br><br>  <b>8. No need to store credentials in the image - use for this environment variables.</b>  Do not write in the image of any usernames and passwords.  Instead, use environment variables to pull relevant data from sources external to the container.  The Postgres image is a great example of how to do this correctly. <br><br>  <b>9. No need to run processes as root.</b>  ‚ÄúBy default, docker containers run as root.  (...) However, as technology evolves, other, safer default launch options may appear.  In modern conditions, the requirement of root rights can be regarded as a threat and not available in all environments.  To specify a user other than root, on behalf of which the container will be launched, the USER directive is used ‚Äù(Extract from Guidance for Docker Image Authors) <br><br>  <b>10. Do not rely on IP addresses.</b>  Each container has its own internal IP address, which may change after the container is restarted.  If an application or microservice needs to communicate with another container, use the environment variables to transfer the desired hostname port number from one container to another. <br>  Remember?  Now you can safely use.  And practical advice on the use of containers can be found in our blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421663/</a></p>
