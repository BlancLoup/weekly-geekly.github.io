If you are sitting on Habr√© instead of sitting on the beach, there probably is a good reason (unhealthy workaholism? Give five to the entire Madrobots team).  Velvet August and September are still ahead, a good time to go somewhere.  Therefore, in the catalog of our online store there are new gadgets and useful accessories for travelers.  We chose our beloved and talk about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/pacsafe-venturesafe-x-waistpack/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">Waistpack Pacsafe Venturesafe X Waistpack</a> </h3><br>  Pacsafe has been manufacturing travel and tamper-resistant travel bags and backpacks for 20 years.  The company was founded by two avid travelers, so the protection methods are dictated by experience and tested in real life.  The most practical development of the brand‚Äôs designers is equipped with a Pacsafe Venturesafe X Waistpack waist bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/pc/ip/wzpcip0v4hzssowyw2tucqermro.jpeg">

      Venturesafe X Waistpack is a compact classic waist bag measuring 18 x 38 x 12 centimeters.  It sits comfortably at the waist, the strap is tightened and loosened as desired.  The volume is 4 liters, the main compartment will fit a 7-inch tablet or e-book.  There are a couple of shielded inner pockets for documents or cards.  The outer large pocket is an organizer for small items, it has a lock for keys.  A hidden pocket is hidden on the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/dj/jn/jidjjnk1syt6ove4f2iiitidupa.jpeg"><br><br>  The line of defense is built on the assumption that the Venturesafe X Waistpack will ‚Äúdefend‚Äù from a position on the owner‚Äôs belt.  Therefore, the part of the bag adjacent to the body is made of soft, breathable material, and the outer part is sewn from ripstop nylon fabric and reinforced with a steel mesh.  Do not cut through with a knife or scissors.  The belt is reinforced with a steel sling, and its buckle is equipped with a lock.  To open it, you need to turn and press the inconspicuous pin.  The zippers of the main compartment and the front pocket do not pierce, and their ‚Äúdogs‚Äù are fixed on another lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fq/pg/lo/fqpglo_fuxapedvuoluroynhy8c.jpeg"><br><br>  That is, before diving into a crowded crowd in front of some tourist attraction, it is enough to close the two locks on the bag.  It seems complicated at first, but in a couple of attempts the movement is worked out to be automatic.  Everything, now documents, money and gadgets will not go to souvenirs to local thieves. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/thule-subterra-travel-34/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">Thule Subterra Travel Travel Backpack</a> </h3><br>  The Swedish brand Thule is known for city and travel backpacks.  Thule Subterra Travel 34L belongs to the latter category.  With one important clarification: the backpack is designed for the traveler who, even on a trip, does not part with a dozen gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/jx/fb/shjxfbchrzgugjdvt2dwli7oc5g.jpeg"><br><br>  Thule Subterra Travel is made of durable nylon with a density of 800 den.  The design is minimalistic, decoration is only iridescent fabric texture.  This is a rolltop, that is, its upper part unfolds and collapses.  Thule managed to make this feature almost invisible: Subterra Travel looks neat, without ugly protruding corners.  To do this, the neck is connected with a magnetic fastener along the edge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/pw/oe/hipwoepqfdeo4ecnrfmczoknxja.jpeg"><br><br>  The straps are breathable and thick, and on the chest are connected with a screed, so that the backpack sits comfortably on the wearer.  On the back of the Thule Subterra Travel there is a loop for fastening on the handle of the suitcase so that the backpack can be conveniently carried around the station or airport. <br><br>  The backpack can be worn on the shoulders, as expected, but it can be worn as a travel bag: turn it 90 degrees and lift it by the side handle.  In this position, access to all compartments of the backpack is maintained, as they open on the side.  The handle is sewn on the left, and on the back there is an elastic pocket for water bottles or umbrellas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/xb/ry/yvxbryokxrjjw6jhli80xjswnho.jpeg"><br><br>  There are three branches.  On the back of the backpack is a fortified laptop compartment with a diagonal of 15 inches.  Then follows the main compartment, inside of which a removable cover for clothes and shoes is enclosed.  Leave it at the hotel with your belongings, and carry the backpack with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e1/4s/pj/e14spjteartzp1nbunait425iz4.jpeg"><br><br>  Outside - a typical Thule office organizer with many pockets and pockets for small items and gadgets.  There is a separate pocket with a soft lining for a tablet or smartphone and a mesh one for a bank.  The mesh pocket has a separate hole, and a fabric ‚Äúcover‚Äù for the cable is sewn directly above this hole.  You can put the mobile device on charge right in the backpack, and the extra wires will not dangle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/pu/zp/ubpuzp4-f8moah1mcz-ilzt2bys.jpeg"><br><br>  Thule Subterra Travel volume is 34 liters, the size of the backpack goes like hand luggage: 23 x 31 x 52 cm. However, if you fly with a low-cost airline, be sure to check the restrictions of a particular airline. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/izi-khalatentse/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">Jalatenza</a> </h3><br>  Jalatenze is a strategic development of the Madrobots department, which dealt with portable inflatable sofas Bivans.  What does a person who wants to lie comfortably on a sofa need?  He needs a bathrobe.  But the bathrobe has a narrow scope.  So, a bathrobe should be more useful.  After long brainstorms in the homeland of Bivanov (in Omsk), the designers came to the conclusion that the dressing gown should become a towel.  Negligible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h1/b0/ua/h1b0ua_a5sde9lhonbnbemmiomm.jpeg"><br><br>  Outwardly, Halatenza resembles a sleeveless hoodie.  He has a straight cut unisex, hood and kangaroo pocket, length - knee-high.  There are three sizes and six colors.  The main material is cotton terry.  Halatenz immediately absorbs moisture from a wet body.  This is convenient when you need to quickly dry out after a shower in a hotel, in a pool, in a gym, on the beach or at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/lh/zk/golhzkwun692rrlzwlr-p7r_wwi.jpeg"><br><br>  It is not necessary to wipe oneself with a rogue.  It serves as home, beach and bath clothes.  Then you can carry a smartphone in your kangaroo pocket.  The fabric is soft, fits nicely to the body, in such clothes it is not hot to walk.  If you take Jalatenza with you on vacation, it takes up as much space as a small bath towel, and performs much more functions. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-comfort-set/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">Set of mask and earplugs Travel Blue Comfort Set</a> </h3><br>  If hell exists, then on one of its circles sinners are locked in a train or in an airplane with screaming children.  Or with music lovers listening at full volume to the ‚Äúlegend of the Russian chanson‚Äù.  Or with the ladies who spend hours of intimate conversations over the phone.  Hell, most likely not, but loud passengers are found.  To make the trip go without unnecessary suffering, Travel Blue offers a set of earplugs and a Comfort Set eye mask. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/lo/vu/zxlovu10gg-mwig0mk1njbwkli0.jpeg"><br><br>  The mask is made of polyester and does not transmit light.  Reusable earplugs are made of polyurethane foam, they do not let in sound.  The size of the mask and ear plug is one.  The kit includes a plastic case for "plugs" and complete isolation from the hardships of life for the duration of your trip.  Comfort Set is needed for those who like to sleep on the road, but will come in handy when trying to meditate and relax. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gb/a3/bl/gba3blgp2fjtnorhrolenjmj-hs.jpeg"><br><br>  Travel Blue, a London-based company, has been manufacturing travel products since the late 1980s.  The brand has convenient folding bags, airbags, adapter adapters and other little things that make life easier for a person on a trip.  At Madrobots you will find various brand accessories.  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/travel-blue/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">We recommend to see them</a> if you are going to travel. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/rombica-neo-ns120-quick/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">External battery Rombica NEO NS120 Quick</a> </h3><br>  Even if you are one of those who manage not to discharge the smartphone in a day, a gadget spends a lot of energy on a trip, because it works a lot.  It translates obscure names, shows maps and reviews of local cafes, helps to find out if the museum is closed.  The Rombica NEO NS120 Quick will charge the device if it is discharged prematurely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/yw/ri/8rywrisut5gk4ljnfj5sijvgnfy.jpeg"><br><br>  NEO NS120 Quick is a wired power bank.  It has a capacity of 12,000 mAh and two USB outputs with a current of 3 and 2.4 amperes.  It quickly charges itself and instantly charges other devices, as it supports the Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging standard and is equipped with a USB-C input.  In addition, it has a microUSB input. <br><br>  The batteries are lithium polymer and high quality.  NEO NS120 Quick is safe to use, but you will most likely have to take it in your hand luggage.  It's okay too: it's a small bank and fits in your pocket. <br><br><h3>  Children's pillows toys Travel Blue </h3><br>  Travel Blue has not forgotten about little travelers.  For them, there is a separate line of plush toy pillows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/tl/b4/xntlb4tt-ktltqnplhv9mex54zo.jpeg"><br><br>  Pillows are different.  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-snowy-the-sheep-290/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">A</a> <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-sammy-the-ram-287/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">sheep</a> and a <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-sammy-the-ram-287/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">lamb</a> fold in half and take the form of an animal.  Before going to bed, you need to lay out the pillow-toy so that the lamb turns into a ‚Äúdoormat‚Äù and place it under the child‚Äôs head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/xg/ja/ppxgja6alo6xpehgsxzqh8bgqfk.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-kitty-the-cat-282/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">The cat</a> <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-mario-the-unicorn-288/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell%2522">pillow, unicorn</a> <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel-blue-chi-chi-the-panda-284/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">pillow and panda pillow</a> are already made in the form of ordinary head restraints.  They are attached to the neck of the child and do not allow her to numb while the baby is sleeping in a chair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/ee/fk/p0eefkld7a9dzozyb2yyv4jbdda.jpeg"><br><br>  Little travelers like pillows.  In size, the entire line is suitable for children from three years.  Material is polyester. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/audio-technica-ath-anc100bt/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtrawell">Audio-Technica ATH-ANC100BT Wireless In-Ear Headphones</a> </h3><br>  According to legend, the professor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Amar Bowes came up with the use of noise reduction technology in headphones during a long flight from the USA to Switzerland.  Now many companies make such headphones, including the Japanese Audio-Technica.  Its Audio-Technica ATH-ANC100BT in-ear headphones combine decent sound with active noise reduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/70/kc/pr/70kcprnumqtpsdxpux-ifhwe60w.jpeg"><br><br>  Active noise reduction - this means that the headphones generate a sound wave with the same amplitude but reflected phase as the noise wave.  In the small and light ATH-ANC100BT there was a place for the whole NC-system due to the fact that part of the electronics is moved to a separate control panel.  The headphones also fit a Bluetooth receiver, that is, they are wireless.  The batteries last for 10 hours of playback with noise reduction and via Bluetooth, then the headphones can be listened to over the wire (this is a mini-jack 3.5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/ck/9o/yack9okb1agpnpmmj0rcwnbnp4s.jpeg"><br><br>  Miniature headphones are suitable for playing simple, ‚Äútravel‚Äù genres, such as industrial and trip-hop.  Their reproducible frequency range is 20-24000 Hz.  The noise reduction quality is even too good for such a small device. <br><br>  In the <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/travel/">Madrobots special collection for travelers,</a> you will find many other useful products.  Until August 15, they receive a 15% discount on the TRAWELL promo code.  Hurry to see the world - along with gadgets from Madrobots. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461509/</a></p>
