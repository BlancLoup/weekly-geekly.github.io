      On which department of the company is it better to place this uneasy burden?  Marketing department, sales department, customer support department? <br>  To find the answer, you need to decide on the purpose of the company's presence on Twitter. <br>  For example, the network of stores @perekrestok mainly uses twitter to support and work with consumers.  Other companies may aim to inform people about the news, conduct promotions, attract the attention of potential customers (generate leads).  If the purpose of being on Twitter is to serve customers, then obviously Twitter should be led by service experts.  If these are broader goals, it is better to entrust Twitter to marketers, PR specialists, the whole team. <br><br>  <i>2. Who will the consumer communicate with?</i>  <i>What face will the brand have?</i> <br><br>  Managers need to balance corporate tone with Twitter.  It is necessary to adhere to the ‚Äúbrand image‚Äù, but also not to forget that many people feel more comfortable communicating not with a cold corporate twitter, but with a living person. <br>  Some companies consciously associate real people with the brand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/303df393/b601f07c/6a087b16/9333cf59.png"><br>  The interests of the Ford Motor Company, for example, are represented by @ScottMonty, director of social media.  Monty says: "People feel more comfortable talking to a person, not a brand."  Here and in Copiny agree with Ford =) Therefore, I try to communicate with customers through a personal account. <br>  It is also advisable to present a few people, a team to the face of the brand.  ‚ÄúThis should be a process in which people share responsibility.  Ford is a group of six people who are a combination of products and corporate employees, ‚Äùsays Monty. <br><br>  <i>3. It should be interesting.</i> <br><br>  Hannah Johnson, a well-known social media associate who manages Twitter accounts for five large companies, says: ‚ÄúPeople follow the accounts they find positive.  From time to time you need to tweet something that will make the followers smile.  It is this content that they will retweet more likely. ‚Äù <br>  Other ways to save and win the followers include posting links, videos and photos and retweeting your own followers.  Twitter is primarily a sharing tool.  No need to post a plain text and be like the media. <br><br>  <i>4. You need to respond quickly, you also need to be prepared for risks</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúDialogue is a two-way process, usually in real time.  In social networks, companies must respond to their customers in a timely manner, ‚Äùsays Stephen Waddington, a well-known PR and SMM specialist. <br>  Presence on Twitter allows customers, employees, journalists and other activists to find a company and openly express their attitude to it.  Regardless of the purpose of their presence, customers will try to get in touch with the company, which is not surprising, people like to communicate where they are comfortable, where they are. <br>  You need to make sure that you are ready to respond in a timely manner to any problems of your customers. <br><br>  <i>5. Refer to your other social media channels and main site.</i> <br><br>  Twitter is just one social media platform, which should clearly fit into the overall social media work and be its working link.  Facebook has so many more people than Twitter.  The integration of Twitter + Facebook will increase the audience without additional effort.  Youtube also provides additional features.  Do not forget about the company's website, a sacred place so to speak. <br>  Candace Kuss, Hill &amp; Knowlton's top manager, agrees: ‚ÄúWe use integration with each other on various platforms.  Twitter is good in itself, but it gets even cooler thanks to connections with other social media channels. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>6. Sales via Twitter.</i>  <i>Special promotions.</i> <br><br>  If you decide to use Twitter as a sales channel, be careful, you can not be too annoying and frankly ‚Äúsell‚Äù.  Conduct special promotions via Twitter, make follower discounts, use promotional codes, this will allow you to get many subscribers and increase sales at a fast pace.  A shining example is Dell's well-known fantastic sales through Twitter - @DellOutlet <br><br>  If you have something to add or discuss, write in the comments, discuss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125759/</a></p>
