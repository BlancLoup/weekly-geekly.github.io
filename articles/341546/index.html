More suitable for PR, and not for traffic. <br><br>  <i>Minuses:</i> <br>  It is difficult to gain an audience. <br>  Insta - 1000 <br>  Pros - not revealed <br>  Cons - if I say that nothing, then many will understand what I mean. <br><br>  <b>Twitter</b> - 340 subscribers, if not strange, the top social network for promotion. <br><br>  <i>Pros:</i> just move, good coverage, even with a small audience.  Your followers are promoting you.  Instalov 250+.  Tags are interested motivated audience, which gives an adequate assessment of both the product as a whole and monetization. <br><br>  <i>Minuses:</i> Limitations in the number of characters.  It is difficult to communicate within the social network. <br><cut></cut><br><h3>  Communication with the community </h3><br>  This is the best that can happen to you in the initial stages of development. <br>  Don't be afraid to share your first MVPs that have become playable.  Immediately place in alpha mode or beta test in the market.  Strongly simplifies life. <br><br>  Many testers, let's call them that, give out very useful tips and suggestions.  I do not call to immediately implement them, but we have worked out some rules for ourselves: <br><br>  1) Bugs - fix everything, regardless of the number of problem devices. <br><br>  2) Proposals - if received three or more times - we consider it as a task that we will be taking to work with a high degree of probability. <br><br>  3) Negative - a very useful thing.  Initially, we all know the positive aspects of our projects.  A negative constructive allows you to get rid of the moments that will further lead to the dumping of players and negative reviews.  Not all should go to work, as well as with proposals.  Immediately dismiss: <br><br>  - It is necessary to give more in-game currency <br>  - Taste, of course, if it is not total indignation.  Then it is better to redo everything and the sooner - the better. <br><br>  Immediately pick up (by example): <br><br>  - Inconvenient interface <br>  - incomprehensible tutorial <br>  - Problems with physics <br><br>  Communicating with the community allowed us to quickly solve a lot of problems that were not obvious to us and get a positive feedback after the second survey. <br><br>  The main thing - do not need to spend power on disputes and negative.  Collect opinions, be sure to thank for the feedback.  This will help your project to become better, increase the chances of success and acquire loyal players. <br><br><h3>  Market </h3><br>  We went to the market immediately after receiving the playable build. <br><br>  This allowed us to: <br><br>  1) Quickly share a link with testers <br>  2) Collect analytics dumps and loyal users <br>  3) Integrate In-app services <br>  4) Do A / B tests <br>  5) See how optimized the description is (about this separately) <br>  6) Distribute updates by air <br><br><h3>  Description and optimization for organics: </h3><br>  Buying traffic for turkeys is a sore subject.  Since it is expensive, difficult and incomprehensible.  To resolve the issue with the second paragraph, you need to conduct tests, and this is the first paragraph.  Therefore, we must try to get as much organic as possible.  With this, the viral part of the application can work, but as long as you do not have an audience, there is little use to it. <br><br>  Collect information of direct competitors - tops, learn how text is optimized and by what keys you can go to the top.  Participating in MBT will allow you to see how you enter the index.  The whole point is that you are not in any directory, but when you key in the search for your game will show in the issuance of the market. <br><br>  At the moment we are naturally the first in the issuance of the name of the game - Monster Beast <br>  For two MF queries, we enter the top 10 and, according to a pile of low frequencies, the top 250. <br><br>  When purchasing traffic and receiving reviews, the positions will grow, and consequently, do not waste time in the empty and optimize / experiment until full release. <br><br>  Thanks to all!
