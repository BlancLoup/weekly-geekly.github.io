Introduced the scale of fines, write an electronic system of working time.  Ok, figs with him, so it‚Äôs necessary, we‚Äôll go on time, especially since the schedule is quite flexible, you have to be at work until 11.  But that would like to discuss.  In the electronic system of the accounting of working hours there will be one button ‚ÄúCame‚Äù.  That is, if you forgot to press - he is a fool, get a penalty.  If you stayed on the way, for example, met with the chef going up the stairs - get a penalty.  If you came a minute before 11, but did not have time to load the computer - get a fine.  I expressed my opinion that it would be possible to choose the time of arrival arbitrarily.  I laughed at my own colleagues.  Yes, at first glance you might think that I collapsed from an oak tree, everyone will be cheating.  But if you think about it, it turns out that everything is completely different.  I sat down here and tried to write down the pros and cons of the system with one button, without the possibility of timing: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Advantages of the</b> system with one button: <br><br>  1. Excludes fraud <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b>

      1. Does not exclude falsification!  Because: <br>  1.1 I will write a script that presses a button at a certain time on the crown <br>  1.2 I will climb and change directly in the database <br>  1.3 I will call someone and ask to press the button for me. <br>  1.4 Admin will always be able to change everything he wants <br><br>  2. Introduces an extra element of distrust that reduces motivation.  For me personally, my conscience is more expensive than $ 10, I will not blush so that I can blush later. <br><br>  3. The implementation of the system is more difficult, since in order to eliminate falsification, it is necessary to use all sorts of captcha, control by IP, to close access to the database, although all this will still be broken.  And most importantly, these prohibitions STIMULATE their desire to get around! <br><br>  4. Such a system does not exclude the accrual of unfair fines. <br>  4.1 Forgot to press a button <br>  4.2 I was late on the way to the computer, for example, to say hello or discuss something with my colleagues. <br>  4.3 The computer is turned off while it is already late <br><br>  5. Such a system does not preclude a violation of statistics.  You can forget to press not only the button upon arrival, but also upon leaving, which means that the person worked 24 hours a day.  When summarizing statistics, finding out the exact time of presence will be difficult. <br><br>  6. In order to reduce the likelihood that the button will be forgotten, you will have to set and configure all kinds of reminders. <br><br>  Total  Plus one, although he is not on closer examination.  A lot of cons!  In my opinion, the choice is obvious! <br>  But why am I alone advocating the only right decision?  I asked opponents to give my reasons, but they cannot, except what I indicated.  There was only one argument: ‚ÄúIf you make a mistake when choosing the time, you will have to disturb the admin that he would correct‚Äù <br>  But this is nonsense!  I can <b>only</b> be mistaken if for some reason I could not press the button on time.  If this did not happen because of being late, then <b>every time I</b> have to disturb the amine, and <b>not only</b> when I was mistaken. <br><br>  I'm stupid?  No one around me can explain my mistake, although I really want to understand where I am wrong and why I cannot make the choice of time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48097/</a></p>
