For 11 years, a person lives Habrom, knows it up and down. <br><br>  <i>Alexey:</i> Now I am in charge of the user assistance department, the community management on our projects, Habr, Geektimes.  Prior to that, he worked in other divisions of the company, and even earlier he led blogs of companies. <br><br>  <i>Anton:</i> A lot of posts now go through Alexey: both user and corporate.  He well knows almost all the content that is on Habré and Geektimes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e5/e41/c7f/7e5e41c7f49539c95c0cecd1f957520f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Danil Dehkanov, owner of the agency “FU2RE.RU”, which works with many large companies, including M.Video, Mail.ru, Intel, Yota, Asus - leads blogs on Habré, Geektimes and in many other places.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b29/922/37e/b2992237e00e8ed74fd8051ed3a19b63.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Vlad Zaitsev.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Vlad has been writing on Habré and other blogs since 2010, he also had his own little agency.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">He worked with large customers, including Sony and many others.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Vlad has the Blog of the Year award, received in 2013 from Mail.ru.</font></i> <br><br>  Let's ask them questions.  I will begin. <br><br>  <i>What important things should the author of a post remember at the time of working on it?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Alexey</i> : Initially, the author must understand the goal that he pursues when writing a post, that is, what he wants to get at the exit.  It should not be that he, like a yacht without a sail, sails where he sails.  He should remember that his publication at the exit should be useful and interesting for our audience.  If he sets a goal, and the publication turns out to be uninteresting, then the goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the publication is likely to be published in vain. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : So there should be work for the audience? <br><br>  <i>Alexey</i> : Habr and Geektimes is a self-regulating community, where the audience has very high requirements for the posted material.  Therefore, if they read, spend even a few minutes of their time reading something that would be uninteresting and unhealthy for them, then the publication will be ruined and they may react to it in different ways. <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : we should not forget why the person who publishes a post needs it.  This is his own motivation, he must come back to it all the time and see if his post responds to his motives, whether he will achieve his goal.  If his goal is simply to publish a post, then his inner motivation is not enough.  It is necessary, for example, to tell about some interesting feature, about some interesting product, or it is interesting for him to show himself to this professional audience, to show his professional level and he should not forget about it when he is preparing a publication, since these questions will also help him Correctly respond to comments that may affect the post rating. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : I would like to clarify.  The audience actually quickly notice the fake, if the motivation is wrong, artificial? <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : Yes, if a person, when preparing a post, tries to deceive an audience and give out some kind of secret motives, but does not do it very cleverly, then it is very easy to read, traceable, and all this is sewn with white threads.  Since the audience is smart, she sees it all at once and minus the post. <br><br>  <i>Vlad</i> : About motivation I can also add that it is very important primarily for the author himself.  If it is wrong and the person does not see any benefit for himself, then he perceives the writing of the post, as often happens with technical specialists, as an uninteresting duty.  As soon as you tell him that it is he who receives it, it immediately adds a few advantages to the post.  And on the topic that a person who writes a post should remember, he still needs to understand who will read his post and how he will read it.  In many respects it concerns the design of the post.  No matter how good the post is, it should be comfortable and convenient to read.  This is a prerequisite for large coverage. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : Need to pay more attention to the design? <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : And in the illustration: for example, pick up some pictures or photos, and for decoration.  And to read the post. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : You can ask questions to our experts. <br><br>  <i>Tatyana Volkova, Samsung</i> : My question is about trolls.  Everyone knows that on Habré and on Geektimes there are a number of people who do not write any posts themselves, but they love to come in the comments and write such biting, harsh, aggressive comments.  In general, it pleases readers.  It is always nice to watch someone attack someone, and they add them.  How to deal with such commentators?  Should they answer something, if it is clear that in fact it is difficult for them to argue?  Whether to ignore them or to still enter into a discussion with them, if it is clear that they are trolls. <br><br>  <i>Vlad</i> : I like the psychological theory that speaks about boundaries.  Any person has boundaries.  It is impossible to act in other people's borders, in your own — it is possible.  The situation with trolls is about the same.  Because when you act absolutely within your limits and are invulnerable, you are not doing anything to reproach you.  You do not deceive readers, do not give a reason to blame you for mistakes in some posts.  You honestly point out all the pros and cons that are. <br><br>  The troll comes to you in the post, and he can not do anything, because you act absolutely within your boundaries, you are not deceiving anyone.  The only thing he can do is start any discussion without personally affecting you.  And the discussions under the posts is good.  The more communication under the posts, even if it is a little off topic, the longer the post is “discussing” now, the more people come there, read it and participate in the discussion. <br><br>  Therefore, trolls are dangerous when they hurt you personally, prevent you from creating some kind of mood, solving problems for which your post is needed, and without this they simply run and discuss something.  I know that Mail.ru had a special training manual for these trolls, including two or three comments that could be answered with them.  “Mail.ru has this problem.  We are struggling with this and apply methods to reduce the number of ".  Politely, clearly, clear.  Discussion, as a rule, did not go further.  This is potentially a commentary, which is in the minus of the organization, but with a competent answer, it is absolutely within its borders and does not give a reason to object again.  It all comes down to zero. <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : Can you answer as the person who wrote this training manual for Mail.ru?  Five years ago, when we came to the Mail.ru Group, the rating of this company was very low.  Ksenia Chebanenko set the task to do so as to at least bring this rating to a positive level, and at the most - win first place on Habré. <br><br>  For four years, we have consistently performed this function, and the trolls were one of those demotivators that even the staff feared.  That is, an employee of Mail.ru came and said - “Let me publish the article, but not under my nickname, but under the corporate one”.  They were afraid that they zaminusyut.  In this case, you need to look at the strategic goals of the blog itself: if you have a task in six months to take a certain position, then you need to behave like an elephant, confident, knowledgeable, satisfied that he has a lot of professionals working, slowly walking to your goal.  When the trolls came in the comments and slowly began to write their negative comments, the answers were very calm, professional and friendly.  Over time, we were able to turn the situation around in such a way that not Mail.ru employees, not Mail.ru authors, but other users of the resource came to the defense. <br><br>  <i>Anton:</i> How important is it to admit your mistakes?  When it can be done, and when it is impossible?  Suppose 95% of the information in the post is super, but there is one small blot and they begin to criticize for it. <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : This is the typical behavior of any troll: find some mistake and start attacking for it.  In general, this is normal.  Not normal - try to protect yourself from this.  Because you first need to recognize that this is really a bug, and not try to turn this bug into some kind of feature.  Just because the audience around is pretty clever.  Do not make excuses or dig up the comments of the author.  This behavior will immediately show that you are defending. <br><br>  It is necessary to say: “Yes, I admit this mistake, I am guilty, everybody has mistakes.”  Worse, when you have to answer not for yourself, but for the team.  You take a hit, but this is not your bug.  Someone from your team, some other programmer, did this. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : Maybe then it is not so closely perceived? <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : If you are the team leader, you still have to show that this is your bug.  It means that your testers did not work well, or your engineers made a mistake.  You must acknowledge this mistake, thank you for finding this mistake, and say that we will try to eliminate it.  And in any case, do not belittle the person who found it, but on the contrary - to be very friendly and positive towards him. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : Does it ever happen that admitting an error whips trolls even more? <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : Of course it does.  For the short-term strategy of this particular trader, this communication, this may be a negative, but then it will be seen that you answer consistently, always admit mistakes and correct them. <br><br>  For example, in the next post you can publish that this bug was implemented in a certain way, and at the same time we made some additional features.  This post can already be zaplyusovat, because they see that you not only recognize this error, but also work on it.  We had many such cases when posts were born on the basis of the communication that was in the comments.  It needs to be used, and the audience Habra perceives it very positively. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : Thank you.  I know who we have is the main fighter against trolls.  Alexey, you cruelly ban them. <br><br>  <i>Alexey</i> : The first thing I wanted to say: we have a link to the documentation on the website in the footer, when you click on that, two documents are opened.  One of them is called “ <a href="https://habr.com/info/topics/toolkit/">How to blog</a> ”, where many tips are written for companies in distilled form.  In addition to information on how to search for ideas and so on, there is a sign that concerns comments and trolls.  And there are just examples of what comments are and how best to respond to them.  This is not an instruction for action, but it can be used as a guideline for feedback. <br><br>  Second, as you originally said, they write trolls.  Here, I think it is important to understand what the word troll means to you.  For us, the trolls are those who have a badge “Troll” in their profile, which is issued for heavily minted karma.  That is, these are people who, as a rule, come purposefully, to spoil the party, so to speak.  Sometimes it happens that they go too far, and then it is enough to contact a support service or client department.  We are considering a case and, if it is indeed a very toxic troll, we will most likely impose a sanction on it.  But this does not mean that for every negative comment you have to write us something like “Guys, he called our smartphone a shovel, bury it”. <br><br>  But if we talk about ordinary users who have thousands of comments, several publications, positive or negative karma, and they just wrote some negative comment, it is incorrect to consider them trolls, they express their opinion and it is important to react to their feedback.  And here I want to give some advice. <br><br>  First: publications on Habré and Geektimes “live”, that is, they are actively discussed, relatively shortly.  The most surge in views, comments, is the first two days, after that everything goes into decline, there is only search traffic, digests, social networks and other crumbs.  Accordingly, if you see some kind of super negative comment, and you reply to this comment immediately, then there is a high probability that those who unwind this tangle will quickly come.  Accordingly, if the answer to this negative comment can be postponed for a day or two, then in this publication by and large there will not be such a noisy crowd that could pick up this situation and somehow develop it in a negative way for you.  This negative is better to neutralize, but it must be done carefully.  I remembered a metaphor.  I recently attended counter-emergency driving courses and there the instructor said that in any difficult situation you need to smile.  It will be psychologically easier for the body to overcome a stressful situation, and you will leave the same skid with a smile.  This advice can be projected to work with comments.  If you write to users negatively, “you are wrong, we will complain to the administration,” etc., this will not lead to anything good.  And if you are positive, but without sarcasm and familiarity, you answer “let's solve this question in personal messages”, then I know many cases when it worked and even when trolls turned into loyal users.  Take any mobile operator.  He has a lot of negative comments.  This negative is worked out in personal messages and everyone is satisfied in the end.  Habr and Geektimes, many users love including the fact that they have the opportunity to communicate directly with companies and even reach out to management.  Accordingly, it is possible to bypass trolls in a positive way. <br><br>  And the last moment, the fact that Daniel correctly noticed, there is no smoke without fire.  If someone wrote a negative comment, this is already a consequence, and the reason was before that.  We must fight not with the investigation, but with the cause.  If there was a bug, if the same smartphone ignited, do not deny it.  You can say, "yes it was, we are working on it," and everything, the troll will have nothing to say.  In any training manual about trolls they write that the less you pay attention to it, the less it will be interesting for him to participate in all this.  Therefore, if you see that you are a troll troll, then do not feed.  Do not feed the troll, such advice. <br><br>  Tutu.ru: I have several questions at once.  We have been blogging on Habré for a year, now in the near future we will begin to keep on Geektimes.  From the very beginning we took a guideline for our employees to write, and one of the main problems in this story was motivation.  As an editor of our corporate blog, I have a question, how can I motivate a person, why he should want to do it.  We have cool developers, a big team, but how can I attract them?  To say that it's cool to be an author - not everyone is interested. <br><br>  <i>Anton</i> : The question is really difficult.  That is why we have developed a training program for companies. <br><br>  <i>Aleksey</i> : Moreover, we had training both about motivation, and about working with comments, which is why today there is such a vinaigrette. <br><br>  <i>Anton:</i> Let's briefly discuss the main things that relate to motivation. <br><br>  <i>Vlad</i> : I will talk exclusively about my experience.  I have, I think, more than a hundred articles.  The last four works and it is unknown how many projects, part-time work, some interesting meetings, acquaintances I got thanks to the articles on Habré.  Any article is a line in the summary, a reason to boast.  This is quite a weighty argument in answering the question: “What are you doing?” Because if this article is interesting enough, it will be discussed.  It will be noticeable.  For me, this is a very big plus.  Many people come and read, come to me in a personal and say: "Wow, how cool."  Then a few more years they write to me: “Thank you for the article.”  I am sharing this article in the comments, and they answer me: “Yes, we have already read, very cool, thanks dude.”  I have enough of this.  This may not be a motivation for everyone, but for me it is very serious.  Naturally, writing one article will not have such an effect.  It will be much smaller, but on the scale of five or more articles there is sufficient weight.  You begin to learn, and it motivates. <br><br>  <i>Danil</i> : We, as an agency, help grow editorial companies that support blogs on Habré and Geektimes.  The main task for us is to make our agency materials smaller and more client materials.  We often have to explain to the employees themselves that Habr, as Vlad correctly said, is a line in the resume, and for which the mail has a separate field in the feedback forms in order to sign up for an interview.  This is a filter that allows professionals to check how much you are an expert in your field, and a HR specialist simply needs to go to your profile, see if there are many advantages to your material, and if there are a lot of them, then the rating of this community has approved you.  So, you are a professional, at least in the topic about which you wrote.  This is immediately a great bonus to invite you for an interview and talk to you. <br><br>  Employees can also be motivated by the fact that they can rethink what they are doing with this material for themselves, and if a person has been cutting code for a long time, then he will be so deeply entrenched in this topic that he can no longer see himself from the outside.     —            ,      ,            .            ,    . <br><br>  ,       :      ,    .     ,    ,         . <br><br>   ,      -   ,     .
