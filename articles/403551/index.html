  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Continuing the theme of ‚ÄúCancer. What to do with him...". Experience one treatment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last year, I wrote about my fourth stage oncology (Continuing the theme ‚ÄúCancer. What to do with it ...‚Äù).  I am grateful to everyone who commented on my story and special thanks to those who sent their thoughts and words of support by mail!  It was all very helpful.  Now I want to share what happened recently. <br><br>  For the first six months after the diagnosis, I was treated successfully, PSA returned to normal and no special changes in lifestyle were required.  Last December, the pendulum went the other way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Upon completion of the described course of BIKANS and ZOLADEKS (in the middle of November), I asked for a short time out to monitor the situation, relying only on homeopathy taken on the basis of my blood, constantly monitoring PSA.  Homeopathy in this case was ineffective, PSA went up again after two weeks.  The doctor decided to repeat the well-proven course, but said that a new batch of the drug, which he has, does not seem to him, judging by the reactions of several patients, as effective as before.  Indeed, neither the injection of Zoladex, nor analogs of other manufacturers of bikaludomid (I refrain from reducing the manufacturing companies so that it is not perceived as an advertisement or vice versa) did not ultimately yield any result; even a paradoxical increase in testosterone was observed when using drugs that suppress it.  The picture turned out to be blurred (either the tumor‚Äôs attitude towards medicines changed, or the medicines were of a different quality), but as a result, PSA rose above a hundred and in early February, literally within a few days, my legs stopped listening to me - pathological changes in the spine affected.  Spinal surgery has become a necessity ‚Äî and essentially useless with high PSA, which deforms the vertebrae so that they compress the spinal cord.  You can fix it in one place, with a high PSA it will break in another ... <br><br>  All this time, other treatment regimens have been tried, which have shown a tendency to decrease PSA.  At the end of March, the operation was carried out, and now eight titanium parts strengthen the spine.  The surgeon who performed the operation said that the prognosis for recovery was favorable.  The past month so far confirms this forecast.  Feet begin to obey.  I can sit.  Not without difficulty, but moving around the house on a walker.  Modestly, but after two months of lying, when to roll over from side to side - a lot of work, it is a great joy.  According to the forecast, I will walk to the summer without crutches.  Cloudless future, if you can keep the current PSA - 3.4 ng / ml.  I think a few months, and even more - I have.

      And another important detail - almost managed to abandon painkillers and sleeping pills.  Valerian instead of them does not cloud the head. <br><br>  I want to go back to the beginning and say how I would do now if I found myself with a slightly higher PSA (say 6-9) (as I had two years ago).  Would do a monthly PSA test (and do a general MRI in case of any surprises).  And with the growth of PSA by a couple of units per month, I would have gone for a prostate biopsy.  I am not a doctor, but in my experience and for my case this is the right approach to meeting such a disaster. <br><br>  As part of homeopathy and ASD.  Witnessed how homeopathy worked in several cases (not in oncology).  In my case, it was ineffective.  I do not dare to make any general conclusions about her.  The effect of the ASD outright could not trace, to say nothing about this. <br><br>  In conclusion, I can recommend a wonderful film about the problems of oncology and cancer treatment in some cases.  The film is made with academic care, without advertising.  There are Russian subtitles.  There is something to think about.  And maybe something to take for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403551/</a></p>
