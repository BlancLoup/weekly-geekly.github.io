And for the monitoring of commercial vehicles use applications that allow the most flexible configuration of the desired functionality / reports, the ability to build the best routes, the product of remote diagnostics. <br>  In Russia, there is a production of various commercial vehicles - tractors, combines, buses, etc.  But I did not manage to find M2M services ‚Äúfrom the automaker‚Äù.  But the secondary market, which offers a variety of specialized services, turned out to be quite rich. <br><br>  <a href="http://agrocontrol.ru/ru/">Agrocontrol</a> - service for monitoring agricultural machinery.  It allows you to reduce downtime of agricultural machinery, take into account the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcultivated fields (arable land), monitor compliance with technical conditions of operation, predict service and maintenance of equipment and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acb/fea/a8e/acbfeaa8e45f4d06b1baeee3e15258e7.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ulroad.ru/">Where is my bus?</a>  - an information resource that provides information about the movement of passenger transport - schemes of regular routes with stopping points, forecasting the arrival time at selected stops of the nearest bus taking into account the real traffic situation, displaying a video stream with connected WEB cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d2/820/44f/5d282044f9f04fe38b81a25c9fb9fb17.jpg"><br><br>  Or, for example, the Space-team product is a unique system for monitoring the transportation of alcohol and alcohol-containing products, which allows real-time monitoring of a wide range of monitored parameters of the transportation process (volume, temperature, filling / draining). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d7/94c/914/8d794c9144b6479eacc9c9f44098a7f8.jpg"><br><br>  An interesting comparison has recently been published in the monitoring of the transport of utilities (garbage collection).  We read <a href="http://m2mnews.ru/novosti/item/740-umnie-musorovozi-skoro-i-v-vashem-gorode.html">here</a> . <br>  Buses, housing and public utilities, agriculture are relatively small segments of the commercial vehicle monitoring market, let's now consider the largest one - freight transport. <br><br><h2>  Truck Monitoring, or ESTR vs.  Order No. 36 of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation </h2><br>  To compare such a large and diverse market segment as a freight transport, you need to find those common technologies that are used both in the West and in Russia.  And they are - tachographs.  The volume of the freight transport market in Russia is estimated by at least 3 million cars.  Moreover, the regulation of the tachograph market (as well as emergency response systems) in Russia and the European Union is carried out by the state.  The ESTR and the 36th order of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation are two documents that contain requirements that tachographs must meet, and requirements for work and rest schedules that drivers must comply with.  We will not dive into the details of the work and rest schedules and the design features of various tachographs, but consider the possibilities that tachographs provide when interacting with the vehicle monitoring system. <br><br>  A tachograph is a special device that registers the speed of movement, the distance traveled and the mode of work and rest of the driver.  Why these parameters?  Because the maximum damage is caused by accidents involving trucks, and the main causes of such accidents are driver fatigue or exceeding the maximum speed that is acceptable for this type of vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73b/979/a53/73b979a53d6a477a8c7d850a5e2bb295.jpg"><br><br>  Online analysis of tachograph data will allow timely response to violations.  From the Russian tachograph manufacturers, two companies can be distinguished that make their products as open as possible for M2M monitoring systems.  This Incotex and Atol.  The first specialized applications for online monitoring of transport based on tachographs have already begun to appear.  SC Scout recently made an announcement that they are working on an application that will upload data from the tachograph and analyze it. <br><br>  The following areas of vehicle monitoring, which I would like to tell you a little about, cannot be directly attributed to the OEM, or the secondary to the private, or commercial market. <br><br>  First, smart insurance.  What is smart insurance and to whom it is profitable is well described here.  To compare the volume of smart insurance, you can indirectly estimate the number of insurance companies providing these services. <br><br>  In Russia - Renaissance Insurance, Intouch.  In the West - Allstate, Am.  Family, CSAA, Esurance, GMAC, Liberty Mutual, Progressive, The Hartford, Travelers, State Farm, SoCal AAA, Royal &amp; Sun, Coverbox and a dozen other companies. <br><br>  Secondly, Car Sharing.  Car rental services or taxi call.  Many of you have heard about the service <a href="http://m2mnews.ru/novosti/item/543-uber-alles-londonskie-taksisti-protestuut.html">Uber</a> , which in the West made a lot of noise, bringing taxi drivers to protests.  The appearance of this service in Russia also caused discontent, and the further use of Uber seems to want to be <a href="http://m2mnews.ru/novosti/item/709-gosudarstvennaja-duma-planiruet-zapretit-servis-uber-v-rossii.html">banned by</a> administrative methods, as was done in Germany.  In Russia, taxi call services are also quite well developed: Yandex Taxi, Gtaxi, Robot Taxi. <br><br>  A relatively new direction, both in the West and in Russia, can be considered a car rental service without a driver.  In the West, this is ZipCar and Car2Go.  It is worth noting that the popularity of car rental services without a driver is so great that the Car Sharing Association was created to resolve common issues.  The association has already registered 26 companies.  A similar service ZipCar - Streetcar was recently launched in St. Petersburg. <br><br><h2>  Secondary market </h2><br>  As I wrote above, the lack of M2M service from the automaker can be solved by the services provided in the secondary market.  For example, using the new generation car stereos that support technologies such as Apple Car Play or Android Auto.  Recently, Pioneer has updated the firmware to support CarPlay in their 2014 NEX series car receivers.  The company also launched the SPH-DA120 multimedia receivers with Apple CarPlay support.  The company believes that the receiver SPH-DA120 implements the concept of "Connected Car".  And if this receiver in Russia costs around $ 600 in the western price tag, then it has every chance of success.  The second embodiment of the concept of "Connected Car" is possible using such boxed products as Ezway, MOJIO, Dash, Remoto. <br><br>  Summarizing everything written, you can put everything in one tablet, highlighting the key points: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/199/3a7/ad51993a7bf642d08c8358786c3d3adc.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241367/</a></p>
