Bob Moesta and Chris Spiek from <a href="http://www.therewiredgroup.com/">The Re-Wired Group</a> are doing just that. <br><br>  In 2005, even before Re-Wired, Bob developed unusual home sales mechanics that helped his real estate firm increase revenue by 23%.  The most interesting thing in this situation is that Bob managed to derive an algorithm for ‚Äúinventing‚Äù such breakthrough ideas for any type of business. <a name="habracut"></a>

      At the time, Bob was the vice-president of a house selling company.  Then, as, in general, even now many families tried to ‚Äúexchange‚Äù their larger living space for a smaller new house - the children grew up, who left where, and the ‚Äúnest‚Äù became too big for only two.  In addition, a large house or apartment is more difficult to clean, more expensive to heat and so on.  Older couples were perfectly aware of their needs and knew that it would be enough for them and much smaller house.  Almost all of them no longer needed a large dining room, but wanted to have a spacious second bedroom where their children could stay if they came to visit their parents. <br><br>  It seems to be all clear.  But not really. <br><br>  Often, after the architect finished the final project, which took into account all the wishes of customers, they did not want to buy such a house.  Bob, who in his youth was seriously engaged in aerospace development and did not lose a single drop of curiosity inherent in this type of people, decided by all means to understand the causes of this phenomenon. <br><br>  He stopped focusing on sales and began to listen more to what people were saying about the planned move.  He heard thousands of stories (both good and sad) about family life in the old place.  It turned out that most of these stories were somehow connected with the dinner table - celebrating holidays, the arrival of guests, homework with children - all this often took place at this table.  Each couple had such stories. <br><br>  And then it dawned on Bob. <br><br>  The dining table was the cornerstone on which family memories held for decades.  But when you move from him would have to get rid of.  The architects created the look of an amazing house - it was magnificent exactly until the moment when buyers refused (without realizing this) to get rid of a piece of an old medel who absorbed a million memories and emotions of family life and raising children.  It seemed that it would be easier for them to put to sleep their beloved dog <br><br>  Bob made the architects cut a couple of square meters from the spacious second bedroom in favor of the smaller kitchen.  Immediately after this, sales began to grow, transactions closed much faster than before.  Bob listened to what the customers said about the small kitchen and the large second bedroom, and did exactly the opposite.  Here is how he explains his decision: <br><br><blockquote>  Customers do not want what they think they want.  Our sales began to grow when we refocused on what potential buyers said about their wishes, on what they were actually doing.  They said that they did not plan to organize large feasts, but all their emotions were tied to this old table.  They did not need a table for their intended use, but they needed this table. </blockquote><br>  Branding experts and customers agree that the world does not need ‚Äúone more‚Äù machine, ‚Äúnew music site‚Äù or ‚Äúinnovative energy drink‚Äù.  Getting something new can make you happy, but inspiration from changing something old to something new does not come.  The task is to find something worthwhile and new at the same time. <br><br>  Bob and Chris teach us how to do it effectively: instead of listening to customer desires, where it‚Äôs smarter to listen to the stories they tell that involve the products or services you sell. <br><br>  As Chris says: ‚ÄúIn the process of dialogue, it is important to be able to read between the lines and get the kind of information that the interviewer gives out unconsciously.  No one in their right mind will ever tell you that, because of the reluctance to part with the old dinner table, the family has not moved for several years, but when you hear the mention of this table several times, you should think about digging further in this direction.  Finding such hidden motivations can significantly improve the quality of the service. ‚Äù <br><br>  If you learn this, you can find ‚Äúdining table factors‚Äù in your business and use them to increase sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220041/</a></p>
