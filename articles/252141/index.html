  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Information technology feeds more than 750 thousand people in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hello!</b>  Our analysts have calculated how many Muscovites work in IT, telecom and online business.  More than 750 thousand specialists and their families depend on high technology, as it turned out.  Which of these industries creates the most jobs and where are the cuts expected?  The main trends under the cut. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33d/6e8/6f5/33d6e86f555b4747af8dd7b5a0cf406b.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  <font color="#3881bd">How was it counted?</font> </h2><br>  Statistics of the Rosstat in the region were compared with the reports of Moscow companies using suitable OKVED codes, estimates of industry experts and consultants.  The most difficult task was to estimate the number of people employed in the Internet industry, here the existing classifiers are not always relevant. <br><br>  As a result, directly employed in all three industries - communications, Internet and IT - turned out to be 320 thousand people, of which about 140 thousand are programmers.  The average household size in Moscow, according to the Moscow City Statistics Committee, is 2.7 people.  They introduced a correction factor that takes into account that among the employees of technology companies there are a lot of young people who are not burdened with family, and that there can be two IT professionals in the same family, have received a final figure - high technologies feed 752.6 thousand residents of the capital.

    <h2>  <font color="#3881bd">Where is the work?</font> </h2><br>  Most jobs in Moscow create IT business.  By the end of 2014, 170 thousand people worked in this industry.  At the same period, there were about 100 thousand telecoms workers (13.5 thousand of them were employees of the Moscow branch of Russian Post), and 50 thousand specialists worked in Internet companies.  Despite the difficult economic situation, for the year in all three segments, according to our calculations, a record number of vacancies were opened - about 100 thousand.  And what is especially interesting, compared to 2013, the number of open positions that do not require work experience did not change - there were about 9% of the total number of them in 2014 (during crisis periods, they usually look for experienced specialists for less money). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3881bd">Where is growing, where is it shrinking?</font> </h2><br>  In the first half of 2014, they grew wildly and, accordingly, hired many Internet companies.  Although the dynamics have declined significantly by December, this is the only industry where, according to our forecasts, this year the number of employees will continue to increase (by about 8-10%). <br><br>  The most serious difficulties are waiting for the representatives of the IT department - due to the reduction of the budget for informatization in the corporate and public sector companies will part with 10-11% of the staff.  In telecom, there will be fewer reductions - 6-8% of positions may disappear there, this industry, according to our calculations, depends most of all on the end user, and citizens are unlikely to use communication less, the intensity of consumption is only growing. <br><br>  At the same time, do not expect that your salary will increase greatly, and the company will continue to invest in your education, the costs of corporate universities and business schools will be significantly reduced, so as not to part with expensive qualified specialists. <br><br>  An interesting fact is that by the end of 2014, 800 technology companies closed in Moscow, while a 20% increase compared with 2013 in this area was registered as an individual entrepreneur. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Do not forget to check on the page of <a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/dit/">our special project with ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù</a> , where we will soon begin to test the service access to the city video surveillance system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252141/</a></p>
