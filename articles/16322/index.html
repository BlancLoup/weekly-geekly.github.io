  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two large Nizhny Novgorod torrent trackers are closed.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 15, 2007, two large (and only) Nizhny Novgorod trackers suddenly stopped working.  These resources were very popular among Nizhny Novgorod and residents of the Nizhny Novgorod region, because they were in the Nizhny Novgorod ring, the traffic from which on the common NN-tariffs is free.  Both trackers had a large user base (approximately 15,000 users of which there are about 1,000 active) and content releases. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to the admin of one of the trackers, a paper came in (maybe from a hoster) with the requirement to close the torrent, here's a quote: <br><br><blockquote>  Anyways ... can be considered an official statement. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      tracker is closed.  The paper came from where it is necessary. <br>  in the nearest / shortest time there will be no gestures (read, I will not launch the tracker) until everything calms down and the situation changes (and the situation is complicated, but not fatal, of course ...).  A huge request not to speak on publicly available resources either as off-topic or flood - you can only cause harm. <br><br>  PS Neither I, nor anyone from the former administration, have any relation to all the newly appeared trackers. </blockquote><br><br>  There were many rumors that ‚ÄúDepartment K‚Äù or one of the Nizhny Novgorod providers had a hand in closing the torrents.  But most likely, the closure is associated with a huge load on the servers on which they were located, because every day the number of users and requests only increased.  After these resources were closed, all file hosting services located in the Nizhny Novgorod free ring went down, thereby effectively blocking the downloading of information in the ring. <br><br>  For reference, I would like to note that in the Nizhny Novgorod region with the Internet is not as good as in the capital: the most optimal tariff is 590 rubles per month for unlimited 1 Mbit / s on the Nizhny Novgorod ring and 2 gigabytes of traffic to the external Internet at a speed of 128 Kbps, after which the speed is cut to 32 Kbps. <br><br>  After the resources were closed, new trekkers began to appear like mushrooms, which are no longer in the Nizhny Novgorod ring.  How long they will survive is unknown.  In the meantime, all Nizhny Novgorod Internet users are awaiting the opening of a stable torrent tracker. <br><br>  <b>UPD On</b> November 19, 2007, the sections of VIDEO, MUSIC, GAME, SOFT and BOOK were closed at the most popular forum in Nizhny Novgorod, where a large number of people exchanged links to files (on file hosting sites in the ring).  Reason: "In accordance with the law on Copyright and the protection of intellectual property."  It seems that someone seriously took up file sharing in the Nizhny Novgorod region, and the closure of all resources is not connected with a high load, but with the demand of the relevant authorities. <br><br>  via <a href="http://bgforum.ru/internet/p2p/">Nizhny Novgorod torrent trackers</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16322/</a></p>
