    <h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  I have never had an obsessive desire to truly immigrate.  Rather, get a European education and triumphantly return home (for some reason, then it seemed that everything would be just that way).  Therefore, when in the last year of university there was a question ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù, It was decided to get a master's degree in one of the universities in Sweden. <br>  Arguments: <br><ul><li>  free education; </li><li>  a huge number of master programs in English (including such interesting things as Nuclear Physics, Nanotechnology, Photonics, Cosmic Engineering, etc.); </li><li>  close to home; </li><li>  availability of suitable scholarship programs (for example, Visby); </li><li>  a high level of prevalence of English (in some companies, English is the official language); </li><li>  relative "not swelling" of life (Stockholm in comparison with Finland, say); <br>  + purely personal sympathies - culture, language, design, fashion, music, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  After choosing a country, it was necessary to determine the institution.  For technical specialties, the list of universities, which in my opinion should pay attention to the following: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/">Chalmers</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/">Uppsala university</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kth.se/%3Fl%3Den_uk">Royal Institute of technologies</a> (my current university) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.su.se/english/">Stockholm university</a> </li></ul><br>  Further action plan is as follows: <br><ul><li>  pass IELTS (usually Academic) or TOEFL; </li><li>  Since last year, the application procedure to Swedish universities is centralized and takes place through a single organization.  This means that you do not need to send your documents to all selected universities.  You just need to register on the site studera.nu </li><li>  From December 1 until January 15, select up to 6 master programs and prioritize them.  Program Database: <a href="http://www.studyinsweden.se/Course-search/">www.studyinsweden.se/Course-search</a> </li><li>  depending on the selected programs, collect a package of documents (usually a notarized translation of the diploma, a copy of a passport, an IELTS / TOEFL certificate, maybe a CV, Motivation letter (for each program is your own), I still needed Reference letters from teachers) </li><li>  send documents to the specified address so that they have time to come before February 1 and relax until May. </li></ul><br>  <em>(!) The most difficult and long point is IELTS / TOEFL.</em>  <em>If you suddenly decide to donate it now, you will get results after January 15th.</em>  <em>But even in this case, all is not lost!</em>  <em>You can apply as a "late applicant" or send all documents on time and send the certificate later.</em>  <em>My IELTS came only in April, but I was still credited.</em>  <em>So chat with program coordinators, call them, do not be afraid, many exceptions can be safely resolved.</em> <br><br>  <em>(!!) If you are a graduate student, instead of a diploma, you can send a translated academic certificate of academic performance at the moment.</em>  <em>This will allow you not to lose the year between graduating from Russia and studying in Sweden.</em> <br><br><br><h4>  Visa </h4><br>  After receiving an official confirmation of enrollment, you can proceed to receive a visa.  There are no special difficulties, except that the confirmation of financial solvency - for 2 years of study you need to submit a letter from the bank about the availability of 7,300 * 24 = 146,000 SEK in your account (based on 7,300 SEK per month).  1 SEK (crown) = 4.2 RUB = 0.098 EUR. <br>  <em>(!) Visa processing can take up to 3 months !!!</em> <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  As a rule, each university has several student residences in which, if you submitted an application on time (approximately, in June, depends on the university), you can get a room. <br>  The average price of a question is 2500 SEK for a small single student room with a kitchen for 10 people in the hallway. <br><br>  I recommend immediately, as soon as you have decided to go to Sweden, to register in the systems of accumulation of points-days <a href="http://www.sssb.se/">www.sssb.se</a> and <a href="http://www.sb.se/">www.sb.se.</a>  Having accumulated a certain number of points, you can qualify for a room or even an apartment in a better area or with better living conditions.  There are cases when people got an apartment in Gamla Stan (Stockholm Old Town), although they have been in the queue for more than 10 years ... <br><br>  In general, I must say, in Sweden it is not so easy to ‚Äúsnatch‚Äù good housing, if for some reason you don‚Äôt like living in student apartments.  It seems that there are also private announcements on rental sites, but having called, it turns out that you are already on the list and <em>maybe</em> you will <em>be</em> called back.  Or they will ask for an incredible deposit into the account as a guarantee, which is far from being for everyone.  Therefore, save points - it increases your chances. <br><br>  Depending on the area, for 3000 SEK you can rent 1 room in a multi-room apartment, or, if lucky, even the whole one-room apartment. <br>  For 6000-7000 SEK you can rent an apartment with 2-3 rooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6a/276/e5b/f6a276e5b29253a4d3e56cf5b130e5a7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here in these houses we lived for a year until they were demolished.  Studios for two, 1800 SEK / month per person. <br><br><h4>  Tongue </h4><br>  In my opinion, subjective opinion, the language is not so complicated (especially at the conversational level) and is easy to learn.  Swedish is such a mix from English, German and even Russian.  Therefore, if you own at least two of the listed languages, it will be quite easy to learn Swedish. <br><br>  On the other hand, in Sweden, without Swedish, it is quite possible to live as long as you want.  The entire population speaks fluently and correctly in English, and with a pleasant, almost British pronunciation.  This is due, not least, to television in the original language (that is, in most cases, in English), so you can not worry about how you go to the doctor or the hairdresser. <br>  <em>(!) √∂ppna d√∂rren!</em>  <em>(= Open the door!) What is this, as not corrupted English? ..</em> <em><br></em> <br><br><h4>  Study </h4><br>  I risk running into arguments, but studying in Sweden is pleasant and almost seamless.  Everything is very democratic.  Not able to understand the course for the allotted time?  Do not worry - take this course again.  Leaving home and not taking the exam in October - ok, take it in December or even next August.  Found a job (more on that below)?  Well, let's make an individual training plan.  So everyone can learn according to their desires and abilities.  In general, you have a number of required courses + several to choose from a given list (depending on the specialization) + from above you can take as many other courses as you want, even from other faculties and from other universities.  Some even managed to learn from two programs at the same time.  Those.  it all depends on you in the long run. <br>  <em>(!) Examinations, for the most part, are written, the Bologna grading system is in effect.</em> <br><br><h4>  Job </h4><br>  The work of the student to find quite real.  Of my fellow students who were looking for a job on the profile, most of them got Java-developers.  A few testers.  There were also ice cream vendors, sushi wrappers, assistants in the department, assistants to the disabled, and even an organist in the church.  Naturally, this is a part-time job.  But you can also work full time and take only one course in the period (a quarter of a year), i.e.  study according to the individual curriculum.  This will allow you to still be a student, but to really earn.  Completely without a Swedish job you can get.  But knowing at least the basics will significantly increase the chances.  There is another option (overheard in Accenture) - you are recruited, taking the promise that you will certainly begin to learn Swedish. <br>  <em>(!) By part-time, you can earn the very declared student living wage at 7300 SEK.</em> <br><br><br><h4>  miscellanea </h4><br>  The Stockholm metro, in my subjective opinion, is one of the best in the world.  Whatever may be said that the Paris is the cleanest, I will not believe.  There is never a crush in the Stockholm metro.  Even at rush hour, there is only a pleasant closeness to people.  At other times, you can always sit down.  Coming out of the subway, you do not feel dirty at all, as it usually happens after Moscow or even St. Petersburg.  In the Stockholm metro with ease to talk and listen to music.  And what kind of stations are there, especially on the blue line ... a free museum of modern art.  In general, I still have a lot of arguments.  Who was - he knows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aca/888/62f/aca88862f3e84b2ffc12802dc6cf40f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not exactly modern, but art at Kungstr√§dg√•rden station. <br><br><br>  In general, in Sweden there is a feeling of complete security.  All the rare fights that had been noticed were instantly separated from where the policemen who took it from.  To return the girl home to the sleeping area alone without an escort at 4 o'clock in the morning is not a horror story with a bad ending, but quite a normal thing. <br><br>  Being the capital, Stockholm has everything to move around big cities - concerts of world stars, shops of famous brands, good restaurants, but at the same time it has almost no disadvantages - hustle, bustle, traffic jams.  Here, somehow everything is very surprisingly balanced. <br><br>  Young people come to study in Sweden (and not so) from many different countries!  In addition to the Chinese and Indians / Pakistanis who are not very willing to make contact, you can get acquainted with a lot of students from Mexico, Iran, Germany, Mongolia, Spain, Bulgaria, Italy, Greece (this is only an approximate circle of my communication), etc., etc. with people from different parts of the world, you can cool up the geography and history in a "game form".  And just to spend 2 years in such an international environment is a very interesting and useful experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b2/182/420/2b2182420d7de0d34a04f663f54fe414.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Work on the project in a group with students from Iran, China and Thailand. <br><br><br>  My grandmother constantly calls and worries about whether we all froze here.  According to her, Sweden is a wild north and here everything is knee-deep in snow drifts and a blizzard is always blowing.  Meanwhile, the climate here is surprisingly mild.  Great hot summer and not cold winter.  Here you have snow there now, huh?  And we have +5!  Over the past winter the snow fell a couple of times, but immediately melted.  I had to celebrate the New Year without snowmen and other winter fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/594/5d8/e3f5945d86d11dbea8095556685a0e14.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Summer in Stockholm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4e/85d/664/c4e85d664a3f559ef331aff62f82cb63.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Rare snow. <br><br>  Sometimes a little surprising, if not annoying, Swedish blindly following the rules and lack of natural ingenuity.  I know it sounds like Zadornov‚Äôs jokes about the Americans from the ‚ÄúWell Stupid‚Äù series, but such a moment is really present.  As for the rest, the Swedes are the sweetest and friendliest people. <br><br>  Some prices (from what I remember): <br><ul><li>  subway fare - 20 SEK </li><li>  liter of kefir - 12 SEK </li><li>  juice - 15 SEK </li><li>  cheese - 140 SEK </li><li>  meat balls (a traditional Swedish dish. in IKEA this is cooked) - 50 SEK per kg </li><li>  Big Mac Menu at McDonalds - 55 SEK, Simple Hamburger - 10 SEK </li><li>  on the phone with moderate communication, about 150 SEK are spent per month </li><li>  a bottle of vodka (suddenly someone is interested) - 200 SEK !!! </li></ul><br>  And finally, a little about the female population.  Female population in Sweden for 5+.  In my opinion, again very subjective opinion, Swedish girls are the best at least in Europe.  Beautiful, slim, fashionable.  Blondes;) but there are also Swedish-Iranian brunettes.  So, there should be no doubt about this point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c63/19d/eaa/c6319deaa04b9617ee16f651822dfbde.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Seller-cashier from the supermarket. <br><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In general, Sweden is very good for both learning and living.  There are, of course, moments that are incomprehensible to the Russian mind, but they are well compensated by the comfort and organization of life.  And do not think that European education is possible only if Dad paid college in England.  European education is available !!!  Therefore, if you think that you need it, then do not look for excuses and act! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ad/4d1/a6f/0ad4d1a6fd6e33582e7f68f264ed01b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <em>Ps.</em>  <em>This article was written half a year ago, when suddenly there were rumors that a Swedish education was planned to be paid for, and therefore the article was postponed to a distant box.</em>  <em>But now there are rumors that they can not do, or do, but not now and so on.</em>  <em>So I urgently publish and hope that someone else will have time to take advantage of the kindness of the Swedish government.</em>  <em>Good luck!</em>  <em>Lycka till!</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75116/</a></p>
