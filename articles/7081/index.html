  <section class="page js-page"><h1>inscrutable ways of the Russian language</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The phenomenon of the distortion of the Russian language by slang expressions has long become familiar, the expressions themselves are understandable, and aFFTary do not tend to stand out with their help.  The original conclusion from this familiarity was made, apparently, by one (far from small and well-known) company, having posted on its website frankly illiterate in form and content description of projects.  In my opinion, this is a very successful advertising move: people notice mistakes, people talk about them, people, thus, create this company‚Äôs popularity for free. <br>  Below are some quotes, without references and titles, and my comments to them.  Immediately make a reservation, no phrases torn from the context - only whole sentences. <br>  See for yourself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>The main advantage of the resource was the ring of sites, consisting of more than 30 exhibition sites, held in ***, the list of which is constantly growing.</i> <br>  - it is not very clear why the advantage of a resource is the availability of other resources? <br>  - in the offer there are resources, exhibitions and sites.  What list of them is growing? <br><br>  <i>Exhibition participants can place an order for various services provided by *** within the organization of exhibitions directly from the pages of the site, and visitors can issue free invitations to visit exhibitions by filling out a special form.</i> <br>  - Wouldn't it have been easier to say that participants and visitors can use online services to design something there?  or split the sentence into two?

      <i>Visitors can take advantage of a very convenient route to the exhibition center, which makes it possible to choose the type of transport and route from different parts of Moscow, as well as the location of *** in relation to airports.</i> <br>  - probably, for visitors, using this scheme, it is very convenient to choose the location of the center in relation to airports.  the company has developed a fundamentally new service that goes beyond web 2.0? <br><br>  <i>Modern architecture *** is reflected in the main image block of the site, which on the main page depicts the panorama of the entire exhibition complex, and on the other pages - the image of the mirrored faces of Pavilion ****, which has long become a symbol of the exhibition center.</i> <br>  - The architecture is reflected in the image block.  the image block depicts a panorama on the main page of the site.  and on the remaining pages the image block depicts the image of mirror faces.  amazing beauty of the text design, very reminiscent of the M√∂bius strip. <br><br>  <i>The project not only tells the story of Santa Claus and Snow Maiden, but also provides for the opportunity to communicate with him and make wishes.</i> <br>  - even if you do not pay attention to the typo "with him (I)", then the project provides for the possibility of "making wishes".  another service that goes beyond web 2.0? <br><br>  <i>The original flash-animation on the main page conveys the feeling of a New Year holiday and a fabulous mood, as part of the fabulous character of Santa Claus.</i> <br>  - a fabulous mood, as part of a fabulous character?  and what other fabulous ingredients does he have? <br><br>  <i>Thanks to a simple and convenient site navigation, visitors can quickly determine the choice of the necessary insurance program, familiarize themselves with the insurance rules, get answers to the most frequently asked questions, familiarize themselves with the insurance terminology in the dictionary of insurance terms.</i> <br>  - everyone knows what happens if you repeatedly say the word ‚Äúrice‚Äù many times in a row.  and if the word "insurance"? <br><br>  <i>The main background of the site is a map of Europe, on which, depending on the section on which the visitor is located, the company's representations, partner countries and seaports through which the activity is carried out are displayed.</i> <br>  - continuation of the previous example, not otherwise.  I will tell you about the purchase, about the purchase, about the purchase ...?  (By the way, the version of the speleker in Word'e: the sentence contains simultaneously more than two definitive sentences) <br><br>  <i>The site is implemented in three versions - in Russian, English and German.</i> <br>  - in versions, but in languages? <br><br>  <i>The site design solved the image task - the atmosphere of the hunting lodge of the late XIX century and the detailed historical background of the creation history *** and the biography of its founder, the Moscow merchant ABV, create a historical perspective, sending visitors to the origins of the company.</i> <br>  - and the absence of some punctuation marks is intended, apparently, to recreate the desired emotional attitude of the reader. <br><br>  <i>The strict color scheme of the sites - gray and burgundy tones are enlivened by the bulk Group logo made using flash-animation.</i> <br>  - already familiar to us technique: the absence of some punctuation marks. <br><br>  <i>The clear, logical structure of the site makes it easy to find all the information of interest, aided by duplicate navigation - the information is placed on two principles: by client category (individual, corporate or VIP client) and by type of insurance.</i> <br>  - but with a clear, logical arrangement of commas, something did not grow together, in contrast to the described site structure. <br><br>  <i>Moreover, the visitor receives operational information about the availability of real cars in a real configuration, at a real price in a particular salon.</i> <br>  - real cars only for specific guys!  Hello to us from the 90s. <br><br>  <i>The site is dedicated to one of the activities of the company ‚Äú***‚Äù - office communications and is intended primarily for small and medium-sized business owners, private entrepreneurs, that is, for energetic, brave people who have unusual thinking and a burden to everything new.</i> <br>  - energetic and courageous authors once again unconventionally dispose of unloved punctuation marks. <br><br>  <i>The style and structure of the site ‚Äúgrew up‚Äù from the logo ***, schematic images of a person and a phone, and the slogan ‚Äú*****‚Äù - these two starting points and gave the direction of creative imagination of designers **, became the basis of the whole site concept, built on communicating three characters - man, phone and dog.</i> <br>  - The authors obviously borrowed this technique from Kalevala.  for sure, the numbers 4,5,6, as well as new characters: a cat, a mouse, a turnip ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7081/</a></p>
