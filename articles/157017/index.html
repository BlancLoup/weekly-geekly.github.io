And the author even named a couple of books. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7a/a78/9ac/c7aa789ac462ea53b7ec6f6238a6ff3e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>‚ÄúRead non-stop, read as much as possible.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You never know when new knowledge and concepts will be useful to you</i> <i><br></i>  <i>but you will be much better prepared for life's surprises. ‚Äù</i>

      Even now I have a little more, and when I was quite smaller, I read avidly, read everything that came to hand, except for any literature that was aimed at learning, unfortunately.  Either the books came across some kind of wrong, not oriented to my teenage mind, or I lacked the perception of such literature, but it didn‚Äôt go further than the textbook ‚ÄúMy first WEB-page‚Äù in '98, as it could . <br><br>  There are an incredibly huge amount of books now (I was surprised to find out that it is much easier and cheaper to order a book on ozone, for example, than to search for it in ‚Äúbook-eaters‚Äù and others like it), but it‚Äôs rather difficult, let's find it ( <b>to choose</b> ) a book on perl-y, which will teach me something more than to process massive log files, or start to finally learn some real language, not an interpreter, or a book on some self-development (I don‚Äôt know how to properly name such literature) which has always been treated in the wrong way  vym contempt, but that probably has a really sensible? <br><br>  The problem, maybe in perception, maybe in the language with which the authors are trying to convey their thoughts, maybe in something else.  But there are books that are really interesting to read, simple, and most importantly - really effective.  But from the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãall the others, choosing just such is a great luck. <br><br>  From here he dared to turn to the community in which, from those I know, all sorts of experts in various fields are most concentrated. <br><br>  All of you, undoubtedly, read and read something, all of you studied by yourself for some books, and some of them surely remember well how I read this html tutorial.  Could you try to remember a few such books and advise them to the younger generation, at the first level of comments? <br>  The area covered in the book by and large does not matter if this is not a guide on directing porn, of course.  The chance that there will be a reader for such advice is, of course, not great. <br><br>  I would be very grateful if the first level looked like, say, <br>  ‚ÄúManagement - Strategies that work.  Karl Stern <br>  ‚ÄúLearning Java - Sierra C. Bates B.‚Äù <br><br>  ps The name of the topic hints at my understanding that this is not quite such a post, as usual - not even a regular copy-paste of it-news from the tape, and all the possible consequences of this are realized by me: C <br>  In the end, it was in order to read that it was created :) <br>  pps The hub ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù is chosen only because it is rightly not allowed to write to any closer ones on the topic.  Not at all for now. <br><br>  I sincerely hope that among the critical commentators there will be people who will respond and help with their advice. <br>  Thank you very much. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157017/</a></p>
