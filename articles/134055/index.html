  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tehkranch-2011 - populous, politicized, ironic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today was the second in a row conference TechCrunch Moscow.  It's no secret that this event has been waited since last year, from the moment last year's Tekhkranch ended.  Why did it happen?  The surest reason is the level of this conference.  The completely natural, familiar and ordinary level of European and American conferences stand out very strongly against the background of domestic events.  It affects everything - the organization, the level of speakers, the choice of topics, the public.  Unfortunately, so far we have few such events.  The only thing that saddened today's visit is the incomprehensible PR of the ‚ÄúIslet‚Äù project.  Otherwise, everything was "on the level." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img title="techcranch" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/.jpg" width="461" height="307"></a> <br>  The program this year did not contain any unexpected surprises, but rather resembled last year‚Äôs one ‚Äî the same interviews of the same people, the same battle of startups and speeches by venture investors.  However, a lot has changed over the year, and in general it was interesting to listen and compare the speeches of Volozh and Grishin now and a year ago. <br> <a href=""><img title="Volozh" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/.jpg" width="403" height="269"></a> <br>  Armed not with a pen, but with a macbook, the TNW correspondent visited the ‚ÄúElectronic Commerce‚Äù section.  In my opinion, it was the most informative and fascinating among others at the current TechCrunch.  The speakers of the section were Lauren Le Moal (PayPal), Rob Cassidy (Ebay), Mael Gave (Ozon) and Ruslan Fazlyev (Ecwid). <br><br>  From the first minutes the Russian e-commerce market was diagnosed - it is one of the fastest growing in the world.  At the same time, during the section, it was impossible not to notice the smashing arrows in the direction of our e-commerce market and, nevertheless, recognition of its backwardness. <br><br>  Maelle Gave (Ozon) spoke about the charms of her own delivery service (while passing the hello to the Post of Russia) and stated that there was no demand for PayPal among the store's customers.  According to Gave, it is not profitable for a company to invest in the marketing of a credit card payment method, since 80% of purchases are paid in cash.  It didn‚Äôt do without an improvised sketch - Ozone and PayPal representatives bargained for the latter‚Äôs interest on transactions (the largest Russian online store chuckled and insisted on 1%).

    <img title="el com" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/-.jpg" width="538" height="358"><br><br>  Lauren Le Moal spoke about plans for PayPal to come to Russia on a large scale not only for transfers abroad and back, but above all for the domestic market.  In his opinion, the dominant payment of goods in cash at the moment in Russia hampers the development of e-commerce, and in the future it may continue, but to a lesser extent. <br><br>  Ruslan Fazliev from Ecwid spoke with his vision of the problems and opportunities, pointing out, first of all, the lack of infrastructure of the e-commerce market.  Other obstacles are the Russian Post, denounced by all (loss, theft of parcels), the need for a normal legislative system.  In order for Western models to work with us successfully, they need to understand our way of life (although, as we all know, ‚Äúyou can't understand Russia with your mind‚Äù). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIbeevsky‚Äù envoy Rob Cassidy, following PayPal, declared the Russian market one of the most important in the company's strategy (the guys are actively developing localization) and outlined the development trend of Ebay as a ‚Äúsocial business‚Äù - they experiment with social networks, open several coupon-discount services, made group purchase tickets on the site, spend a lot of tests in the social segment, and as a conclusion: there is a demand for this direction, but they have not yet found a universal solution. <br><br>  The speakers alternately answered the question from the audience about the rapidly growing turnover in the field of mobile sales.  For Ozon, this is an important trend, but from a financial point of view it is not confirmed;  obstacles - the high price of devices for the ordinary Russian citizen, the unreliability and high cost of the mobile Internet.  In short, the mobile revolution has not yet begun. <br><br>  Ebay is globally more interesting - about 5 billion dollars revolve in this segment, and it really is one of the main priorities.  But this rosy message does not apply to mobile commerce in Russia - here transaction costs are still too high. <br><br>  Loren Le Moal of PayPal predicted that sooner or later everything would change, first a sensible number of devices (iPhones, androids, etc.) should appear in Russia, then people will learn browsers and start paying through their mobile (it should be as easy as possible), and here there will be problems with delivery, they must be solved.  The pioneers in this area we need not just to write applications for mobile devices, but to understand how fresh and trendy html5 will affect interaction with users. <br><br>  This year, especially successful twitter-broadcast.  I can not fail to cite some of the brightest phrases of this day. <a href=""><img title="tv333" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/333.jpg" width="438" height="45"></a> <br> <a href=""><img title="tv66" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/66.jpg" width="483" height="35"></a> <a href=""><img title="tv555" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/555.jpg" width="509" height="40"></a> <br> <a href=""><img title="tv777" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/777.jpg" width="514" height="37"></a> <br> <a href=""><img title="tv888" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/888.jpg" width="564" height="55"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="tv444" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/444.jpg" width="508" height="54"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="tv222" src="http://ru.thenextweb.com/files/2011/12/222.jpg" width="515" height="122"></a> <br><br>  The rest - search by hashtag - <a title="#tcmoscow" href="https://twitter.com/">#tcmoscow</a> . <br><br>  Thanks for the photo <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.319487288064192.89175.100000087718024%26amp%3Btype%3D1">Andrey Yablonskikh</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134055/</a></p>
