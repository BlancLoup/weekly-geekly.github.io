This prize is given for ridiculous, at first glance, scientific discoveries, which "make you laugh first, and then think."  The task is to "attract attention and spur people's interest in science, medicine and technology." <br><br>  Seemingly funny discoveries can be of great practical importance.  For example, like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">the Danning-Kruger effect</a> (laureate of 2000), which explains a lot in shaping the social hierarchy of human society. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Or take this year's Nobel prize in the field of medicine.  She received a group of physicians from the Detroit Medical Center.  They found that in cases of certain blood clotting disorders (Glantsman's thrombosis), the tampon from slices of sliced ‚Äã‚Äãpork, such as those sold in a sandwich shop, stops the bleeding best.  In pork there are some substances that improve coagulability, and a large amount of salt absorbs liquid.

It turned out that they are prone to greater narcissism, more manipulative and psychopathic than people who regularly get up early.

They determined that dogs during bowel movements are arranged in accordance with the lines of the earth's magnetic field!  They deserved the award in biology.

This is a typical example of a discovery that sounds strange, but has great potential for practical use.

He has long been engaged in the search for a biocompatible lubricant for the human body.  This time, bananas are in his interest.

It turned out that if people see a face or any other unfamiliar object, their brain area is activated, which is responsible for face recognition (a prize in neurobiology).

There are certain signs that communicating with a cat is associated with a risk of depression. <br><br>  But there are no reasons for panic: ‚ÄúPerhaps the reason is the opposite: people with an increased risk of depression decide for having a cat,‚Äù explains Dr. David Hanauer from the University of Michigan Pediatrics Department.  ‚ÄúI by no means urge cat owners to get rid of cats.‚Äù  [" <a href="http://web.natur.cuni.cz/etologiecloveka/images/download/Flegr,%2520Havlicek%2520-%25201999%2520-%2520Changes%2520in%2520the%2520personality%2520profile%2520of%2520young%2520women%2520with%2520latent%2520toxoplasmosis.pdf">Changes in the personality profile of young women with latent toxoplasmosis</a> " Jaroslav Flegr and Jan Havlicek, Folia Parasitologica, vol.  46, 1999, pp.  22-28] [" <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051103000759">Decreased level of psychobiological factor" infected with the protozoan parasite Dopamine, ale link between schizophrenia and toxoplasmosis?</a> "Jaroslav Flegr, Marek Preiss, Ji≈ôi Klose, Jan Havlƒ±kekhela, Marek Preiss Vit√°kov√°, and Petr Kodym, Biological Psychology, vol.  63, 2003, pp.  253‚Äì268] [" <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%253Adoi%252F10.1371%252Fjournal.pone.0070585">Describing the Relationship between the Electronic Health Record</a> "; David Hanauer, Naren Ramakrishnan, Lisa Seyfried, PLoS ONE, vol.  8, no.  8, 2013, e70585] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237537/</a></p>
