There is a moment when the main character enters the store, and the windows begin to greet him, offer different goods, defining his preferences and tastes.  It looks like it is waiting for us in the near future, and some interactive boards can now be tested on yourself and your credit card.  If we talk in general about the category of digital signage, then today all digital signs, boards, multi-screen screens, both relatively simple and the most advanced, working with various interactive technologies and possessing integrated analytical systems, fall into it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my opinion, it is not surprising that many brands are interested in this topic, as interactive systems allow you to communicate with the viewer directly, involving him in the process, which has a direct impact on consumer behavior and consumer activity.  But last but not least, modern digital signage systems are able to provide valuable analytical information about the brand‚Äôs audience: the number of contacts, demographic indicators, the duration of interaction with a particular message.  As a result, the efficiency of funds invested in advertising is increased.  And the problem of performance evaluation has always been one of the painful points in the matter of investment in advertising innovations. <br><br>  And, finally, by the buyers who see the content that meets their interests, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdigital signage should be like.  Just imagine how much time you can save in the mall, if at the entrance you will be offered what you came for and you just have to touch the purchase, because even fitting and payment can be virtual.

      Whoever concerns the infrastructure of digital signage systems, I think, even readers of the Intel blog are not fully aware of its versatility and complex structure.  In the end, only one, small, part of this system faces the audience - this is the screen that displays the final picture.  Meanwhile, the issue of security and power consumption is no less acute here than in many other network and infrastructure solutions.  At the hardware level, Intel has developed technology vPro, which allows you to effectively manage the delivery of multimedia materials remotely, using secure protocols, in energy saving mode.  Naturally, all this reduces the cost of ownership of the system and the cost of maintenance.  At the software level, Intel uses the <a href="http://intel.cognovision.com/intel-aim-suite">Intel AIM Suite</a> anonymous video analytics technology, which can be integrated into modern digital display systems based on second-generation Intel Core processors.  The AIM Suite recognizes people who are in contact with a digital screen by gender and age, but does not identify the individual, and therefore does not use the personal data of visitors. <br><br>  You can see the technology in action on November 8-10 in Moscow at the 5th international exhibition <a href="http://www.isrussia.ru/">Integrated Systems Russia 2011</a> , where among the exhibits the most advanced developments in the field of embedded solutions are announced: touch screens, multi-screens, augmented reality systems (augmented reality), and The effectiveness of analytical tools in digital signage systems will be discussed.  And on November 7, a <a href="http://www.isrussia.ru/ds/program/">conference</a> will be held at the President Hotel, where Jose Avalos, General Manager, Intelligent Systems Group will speak about the latest Intel developments in the digital signage industry. <br><br>  The exhibition at the Expocenter will feature several Intel technologies for embedded solutions: <a href="http://edc.intel.com/Video-Player.aspx%3Fid%3D4586">Intel End Cap</a> is one of the most interesting Intel solutions for building interactive multimedia screens based on the use of second-generation Intel Core processors.  It is integrated and AIM Suite.  One of the interesting features of End Cap is the ability to establish a connection with the visitor‚Äôs smartphone, offering him bargains or coupons currently in force.  This idea is closest to implementation - systems similar to End Cap are now developing most actively, and very soon, going into the supermarket, you will not be looking for goods on the shelves, but choose from the list on the interactive screen. <br><br>  Another digital signage solution is the YCD MuVi Wall, which is a multi-screen video wall capable of supporting 3, 6 or 9 screens of streaming video of any size on any matrix.  The main advantage of this system is the principle of the designer, which can be placed as you like, or as required by the architecture of the room.  The video on the example of the Israeli cinema shows the influence of digital signage on the behavior of the buyer.  By the way, visitors to popular gaming conferences have already met with similar screens - igrodels love to create an atmosphere and presence effect using systems similar to YCD MuVi Wall. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AT5VnShJXD8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgMtKsV78Plgc5Ushc5cUFUf7X-Ww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAT5VnShJXD8%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">C-nario Collage Digital Sign</a> is the next level of working with video content.  C-nario technology allows you to display one picture on several screens of arbitrary shape and position, creating a collage effect.  In this case, it is absolutely not necessary to display one picture - you can combine different types of multimedia data, showing homogeneous, but not the same. <br><br>  And finally, augmented reality (augmented reality), already familiar to everyone and actively used on smartphones, laptops and computers.  Now augmented reality can even be seen in stores, and even Schwarzenegger can be seen near it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/10c035a9/fd3838e7/78c0f467/3701d325.png"><br>  <sup>Metaio</sup> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUuVvY4c4-A&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgA3P4eeXYPZbWblGxNeVChloDKEA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DmUuVvY4c4-A">Lego Digital Box</a> is an information stand that shows the toy assembled when you bring the box with the designer to the sensor.  It looks very cool, especially like children and sellers, because it convincingly sells more expensive models to parents.  This system includes the full suite of AIM Suite analytical tools and Intel vPro technology, and works on the basis of second-generation Intel Core processors, which provides a smooth image and animation. <br><br>  Definitely, this is not all new items that will be presented at the exhibition.  Come - it will be interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131682/</a></p>
