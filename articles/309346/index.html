  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT news. August</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Approaching the end of August was traditionally not too rich in high-profile news in the IT world, but several notable premieres and announcements did take place.  About the most notable events that could pass you, let's talk further. <br><br>  <b>¬ªAutomatic braking systems go to the people</b> <br>  In the USA, they took a radical step and obliged to equip 99% of all cars produced with the AAA system by 2020 ‚Äî automatic braking when a vehicle approaches a potential obstacle.  To date, only 9% of the entire global fleet has such a function, but already 21 automakers have officially committed to include it in the basic configuration in the near future. <br><br>  The essence of the system is to reduce the speed by half when approaching an obstacle or a slower vehicle.  At the same time, your AAA car will not stop completely, at high speeds it is fraught with drifts and other collisions.  So it is unlikely to reduce the number of accidents, but the reduction in mortality and payments of insurers is guaranteed.

Thus, very soon, autopilots will lie on the shelves of the stores, along with parking and speed sensors, which will make your old VAZ-2106 a real smart car. <br><br>  For skeptics, Delphi and Mobileye immediately announced that these would not be compromise options (for example, only rebuilding between lanes or maintaining speed), but systems corresponding to <a href="http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf">SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers)</a> level 4 and 5.  In other words, it is a full autopilot, but depending on the cost, it will be either a universal set or limited to a number of car models. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>¬ªThe first unmanned flying car</b> <br>  Not far from the topic of smart cars: the company Airbus, the world-famous manufacturer of aircraft, announced the release next year of a prototype of an unmanned flying car.  The project is named Vahana, there is no specific information, but most likely it will be possible to meet with the novelty at Le Bourget 2017, the traditional air show in Paris, which will be held early next summer. <br><br>  <b>¬ªAccelerate Wi-Fi 3 times</b> <br>  Scientists from the Massachusetts University of Technology have discovered a way to triple the data transfer rate and double the range.  A project called MegaMIMO 2.0 describes a way to synchronize the phases of waves of several smartphones (namely, the technology is aimed at them) so that they can transmit information to other independent receivers without interfering with each other. <br><br>  In general, the whole technology is a bit more complicated than it can be described in one sentence, so if you are interested, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DX_a9aLmwWpI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">video</a> or read the article ‚Äú <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm%3Fid%3D2934905%26dl%3DACM%26coll%3DDL">Real-time Distributed MIMO Systems</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>¬ªIDF-2016</b> <br>  In mid-August, a large forum from Intel took place, where developers were once again told about the future of virtual reality, and also presented some interesting gadgets.  We wrote about this in the article ‚Äú <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/posts/idf_2016">IDF-2016.</a>  <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/posts/idf_2016">Innovation Forum</a> . <br><br>  <b>¬ªInsecure Bluetooth Locks</b> <br>  At the recent largest conference of hackers Def Con 2016, many interesting things were cracked.  In particular, one of the points of the program was the control hacking of Bluetooth locks, which are gaining more and more popularity.  A sample of the 16 most popular models was created, and it turned out that 12 of them can be hacked in just a few minutes. <br><br>  However, as noted by the participants themselves, it is unlikely that the field of activities of burglar and hackers will intersect, unless there are secrets of state importance behind your door.  By the way, following the results of the work, the hackers prepared a presentation with which you can read the <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%2520CON%252024/DEF%2520CON%252024%2520presentations/DEFCON-24-Jmaxxz-Backdooring-the-Frontdoor.pdf">link</a> (PDF, 2 MB). <br><br>  <b>¬ªNew OS from Google</b> <br>  As you already know, this month the new OS Android 7.0 Nougat has been released.  You can read the official release on the <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/nougat-7-0/">official website</a> .  Now we will talk about another OS - <a href="https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror%3Fpage%3D3">Fuchsia</a> , the third operating system of Google. <br><br>  There is no official announcement that the system is owned by any platform, but judging by some last year's <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2999497/android/when-two-become-one-google-folds-chrome-os-into-android.html">news</a> , it will be a combination of Chrome OS and Android.  One system for all devices?  Somewhere we have already heard.  Let's see what happens this time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24d/b60/299/24db60299c1895b700a59da41ebd1c36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>"Russia finishes Google again</b> <br>  The Russian antimonopoly service continues to fight with the IT giant, collecting new fines from it.  This time, the Android manufacturer was accused of bundling (including third-party software without the user's consent) and fined $ 6.8 million. <br><br>  The amount is rather big, but compared to what the EU authorities requested from Google in May, it‚Äôs just ridiculous.  Then a ‚Äútotal‚Äù claim was filed for $ 3.4 billion.  And you know for what?  For the dominant position of the search engine.  This is what endless improvements lead to. <br><br>  <b>¬ªLong-awaited update</b> <br>  In early August, Windows received a long-awaited update package called Anniversary Update.  However, they were waiting for him not because of loud announcements, but because it marked the end of the free upgrade to 10 from previous versions. <br><br>  But there were some interesting improvements, here are some of them: <br><br><ul><li>  the Start menu has been modified, having slightly moved back to what was in version 8 of Windows; </li><li>  the opportunity to reset the pre-installed applications; </li><li>  The menu for displaying a mobile phone screen on a computer has appeared; </li><li>  Simplified procedure for using a computer as a Wi-Fi access point; </li><li>  new features for personalizing the OS; </li><li>  Edge browser has been improved (in particular, Flash no longer starts without consent, fast access to extensions is added); </li><li>  A new version of the Store, a lot of new applications (but still catastrophically less than in Google Play and the Apple Store); </li><li>  many innovations regarding security, speed, simplify access; </li></ul><br>  <b>¬ªAnother attempt by Nintendo</b> <br>  In the wake of Pokemon Go's success, Nintendo decided to accelerate preparations for the release of its new NX gaming console.  In general, the production should have started at the beginning of this year, however, this striving for perfection prevented it: the developers began to make changes in the design and hardware of the console. <br><br>  Now all the improvements have been completed, trial lots will be manufactured at the Foxconn factory, and console will appear on the shelves in early 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a4/cfb/8dc/7a4cfb8dcffcc28d8d2c5870489b6b5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And what became for you the main IT event of August? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309346/</a></p>
