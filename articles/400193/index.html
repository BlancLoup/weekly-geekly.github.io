True, we decided to publish the lake surface and jet skis not only in the dreams of summer: all attention is paid to Dell Latitude Rugged protected computers.  Impressions are shared by experts portal RuggedPCReview. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dell/blog/283872/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/000/d59/b26/000d59b26fb067ba5dffac85ccb521b1.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúDell is well known in the world as one of the three leading PC vendors: it supplies tens of millions of personal computers every year.  The recent purchase of EMC made a stir: this is the biggest deal on the IT market.  Perhaps less well known is that Dell releases secured laptops, transformers and tablets: for example, the Latitude 12 and 14 Rugged Extreme, the Latitude 14 Rugged and the Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a97/178/921/a97178921866d5593c3099c20d960d99.jpg">

      In Austin - the capital of Texas, a major center of high technology and the world capital of live music - we, the journalists of RuggedPCReview, came specifically for the protected line of Dell.  Usually, companies present their important innovations in well-conditioned conference rooms.  Therefore, the Dell-organized trip to Lake Travis - a picturesque pond in the vicinity of Austin, fed by the Colorado River - was a memorable exception. <br><br>  The shores of Starns Island, which is located in the middle of Lake Travis, have become the site of great field trials for protected Dell laptops and tablets.  When we got there, we ate sandwiches and finally got down to business. <br><br>  The degree of protection of Dell devices fully complies with IP65.  They are invulnerable to dust and can be poured from all sides with a stream of water.  Working in dust and dirt with such devices is no problem.  Even if someone accidentally drops a protected Dell laptop overboard, it will still work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a1/a3c/276/2a1a3c27623200f0d4292419c349cae8.jpg"><br><br>  Playing in the mud and throwing laptops, however, were not the main element of the show - they were jet skis.  At our disposal were two double cars, but not only for our pleasure.  Specialists from CartoPac, a partner company of Dell, attached Dell-protected tablets with special software to the jet skis. <br><br>  CartoPac specializes in installation and equipment support in the field.  Accurate registration of location, description of operating conditions, inspection, maintenance - all this helps companies to reduce risks, achieve operational efficiency and safety. <br><br>  Scott Croach, co-founder of CartoPac and its CIO-CTO, showed us the software for positioning and tracking CartoPac.  And all this - on a secure tablet Dell, on the lake, on a jet ski. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ffc/594/0c5/ffc5940c52ae764c173d98ce8e99641d.jpg"><br><br>  To install a 1.6 kg protected tablet weighing 1.6 kg on an Intel Broadwell processor is not an easy task, especially when these hydrocycles are rented and do not provide any installation equipment.  But this is not a problem.  A couple of meters of rubber harnesses, and the Dell tablet is firmly fixed to the center of the steering wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e24/760/86d/e2476086d59324c76644bab9dd78ed4a.jpg"><br><br>  It was much harder to teach land analysts and journalists how a jet ski works.  There are no brakes and gas pedals.  A small lever on the right grip allows you to start moving.  Free advice: never get up behind a jet ski when the instructor tells the newcomer how to control the gas - get it wet! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c8/88a/83f/8c888a83fa5fef1591b0c47109b80055.jpg"><br><br>  In the end, most of the members of our brave little group managed to ride a jet ski and hit the road. <br><br>  The first thing that we noticed when working with protected Dell devices, displays that are designed for outdoor use.  What makes the Dell screen so readable even in bright sunlight?  The material of any display is essentially a sandwich, each layer of which reflects the sun's rays falling on it.  In this case, the number of layers is reduced, and they are all as closely as possible connected to each other.  In combination with antireflection (AR) and antiglare (AG) coatings, all this gives impressive results: the display on the display is clearly visible even without a strong backlight, which quickly sets the battery down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7a/074/32e/a7a07432ec5417e7d1c8cac2e5794103.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52e/3b7/7e7/52e3b77e798fa455ea59ba74b1a5ade7.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the timid protests of our captain, who apprehended our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtaking pictures with his hands while sitting behind the wheel of a jet ski, we still took several shots with the Pentax underwater camera in one hand and the gas handle in the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5a/ae9/d93/b5aae9d9342dd9fa98382731fce54e14.jpg"><br><br>  At a speed of more than 70 km / h, the CartoPac program and the Dell tablet worked well and drove us along the intended course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/878/22e/cda/87822ecda9827b1b6102a4e43d90c391.jpg"><br><br>  A beautiful day at the lake is not only a pleasure, but also a unique opportunity to see how technology ‚Äúin the field‚Äù works that most of us use only in the office or see in the laboratory. <br><br>  The next day, the theoretical part of the program was waiting for us: Dell International Command Center, located at Dell Way 1 (Round Rock, Texas), opened its doors for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc0/3a3/486/bc03a34861f0529de2871a34af5185b4.jpg"><br><br>  Dell International Command Center looks majestic and impressive, in full accordance with its name.  It serves 113 million systems, annually processes 17 million calls, coordinates over 500 supply centers in more than 160 countries of the world, and provides support 24/7 in more than 50 languages.  When human lives depend on the smooth operation of Dell computers, failures are unacceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb0/c08/b08/cb0c08b08cb74a885fe264b808c3ac97.jpg"><br><br>  Next stop is Dell Technology Center.  Dell's experts on secure mobile devices: Drew Moore, Umang Patel and Patrick Seidenstiker - told us about the technologies that have been used in Dell secure computers for a decade: in various systems ATG, XFR, and now in Latitude Rugged and Rugged Extreme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/998/fb7/e21/998fb7e21ae3dabece37221b744a1207.jpg"><br><br>  According to Drew Moore, Dell‚Äôs formula for success is based on three principles: 1) using the resources of the Dell Latitude family with its comprehensive testing, a large number of devices manufactured and sold, a supply chain, and scale;  2) protection initially built into the design with an emphasis on stability, reliability and the elimination of everything that can go wrong and lead to problems;  3) use Dell's know-how in IP protection.  The best confirmation of the correctness of this approach is the consistently high customer satisfaction and low failure rate in comparison with competitors according to the results of the independent research ‚ÄúTechnology for Business‚Äù (TBR). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d3/337/921/1d3337921c032353654055d1cc871675.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the Dell Technology Center, there are test labs, which we in RuggedPCReview are affectionately called the ‚Äútorture chamber‚Äù.  Here, protected devices throw, fry, freeze, drown - in general, bring them to the limit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b30/096/481/b30096481fd2237b37b9b96e817ec15f.jpg"><br><br>  As Drew Moore noted, the laboratories were designed for demonstrations, benchmarking, component testing and empirical evaluation.  Own laboratories for internal testing help to identify potential deficiencies and problem areas of devices at the design stage, and not after the fact.  The actual tests MIL-STD, IEC, as well as certification are carried out by independent laboratories. <br><br>  The equipment in the Dell laboratories allows you to throw devices at the quality of tests, pour water over them, test the strength of articulations, set extreme temperature conditions, force dust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d6/104/68a/5d610468ac3fb5a3949543145d917fe3.jpg"><br><br>  Now it is clear that, compared with the program of laboratory tests for protected tablets Dell, our trip to the lake - just a jaunt.  Dell is providing enormous resources for building secure computers, and the results have impressed us. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400193/</a></p>
