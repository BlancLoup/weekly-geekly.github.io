The main idea is to help the user to get in shape, and a person may not know anything at all about training, fitness and all the rest.  The ex-employee of Apple and two former employees of Microsoft took part in the development of Moov Now. <br><br>  The previous model Moov has collected over a million US dollars on pre-orders, and is still selling well.  The Moov Now team hopes not only to repeat, but also to surpass this success.  By the way, at IFA 2015 Moov Now <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/ifa/top-tech-of-ifa-2015-award-winners/">became the best gadget in the category Sports &amp; Fitness</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is Moov Now? </h3>

      This is a sports gadget, but it does not look like gadgets manufactured by Fitbit and Jawbone.  The original idea is to use Moov Now as a personal trainer, but the device can also count steps, distance, calories burned during the day, and much more that ordinary fitness trackers can do.  With the help of a mobile application and headphones, this gadget is able to train the user, which will be no less effective than working with a human trainer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/121/5f4/88e/1215f488e2a294ffbf0843e25f4a8273.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  And here it means not only running, but also cycling, swimming and boxing. <br><br><h3>  What's new? </h3><br>  Moov Now is 44% smaller than the previous model.  The strap is now more ergonomic, and the battery life is extended.  In the original Moov, the battery was used, in Moov Now it is not there, instead, a regular ‚Äútablet‚Äù battery is installed.  This significantly increased the life of the device in standalone mode - up to six months without recharging.  According to the developers, this is about 100 hours of training, instead of 8 hours for Moov. <br><br>  The battery is normal here - it is used in standard watches or activity trackers from Gramin and Withings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f2/ce4/fbb/2f2ce4fbb6ce3dd829fbe1f8ae86cd51.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Moov Now can be worn all day, despite the fact that the previous model was designed only to work during training. <br><br>  Now Moov Now supports five applications, each of which is a ‚Äútrainer‚Äù for a particular sport.  This application is for cycling, running and walking, as well as for swimming and a total of seven-minute workout.  All this will soon be merged into one application, a fitness platform. <br><br>  The program is available for both Android and iOS.  The software also includes social elements, including a table of records for various users and the choice of training programs.  By the way, Moov will also be able to work with new programs. <br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  Moov Now needs to be worn on the wrist or ankle, depending on the type of activity.  Some types of training, for example, boxing, require the use of two Moov trackers at once.  At the very beginning, you need to carry out the procedure of pairing with the phone, after which Moov Now can immediately be used for its intended purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e49/027/c57/e49027c577c66f53e2772310e831c4fe.png" width="750"><br><br>  Moov Now workouts are designed for beginners who do not go to the gym and do not work with a personal trainer. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yWtx3-QNLw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi3md7Uq7BAWcWPL9HRbxKNywoDPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the process of training, the tracker adapts to its user, determining the characteristics of the human body, and gives individual advice. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/00pa676oiOg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiSG4ww7Vf-yeO2msprvAwpTWtMYg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Once the training is completed, you can see all the activity data in the panel.  For example, for a general seven-minute workout, data on activity, the number of exercises performed and the quality of their performance are displayed.  Of course, for different types of workouts different information is displayed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQsZbrpC2yI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiG3Pi8EAGd2mCbtymduCNXZ3EqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Moov Now features for different sports </h3><br><br><h3>  Swimming </h3><br><ul><li>  Training; </li><li>  Recognition of 4 styles; </li><li>  Detailed reports; </li><li>  We are engaged now, we synchronize data later; </li><li>  Counting reps (the number of swims on the track); </li><li>  Frequency of work with hands; </li><li>  The number of blows to the water; </li><li>  Distance per stroke; </li><li>  Turning time; </li><li>  Time relax; </li><li>  The number of calories burned. </li></ul><br><br>  By the way, Moov Now has many strengths, but now this gadget can also be used by professional swimmers, for whom it is important to know the smallest details of the training, considering many factors.  Now in the "trainer" Moov Swim we added automatic recognition of swimming style and hand strokes on the water.  This was made possible by analyzing the results of famous swimmers, plus the analysis of their swimming techniques. <br><br>  Now the swimmer can create a workout plan as a runner or cyclist does, and the gadget will automatically track the progress towards the goal.  Moov Swim divides the entire workout into separate stages, depending on the style, collects data on the distance covered and the total time for each group.  Analysis of all these data helps the athlete to train more efficiently, improving their capabilities. <br><br>  In order to start training in the pool, you need to wear a device on your wrist, and press "Rec".  Moov automatically determines when the user is already floating, and when he is resting on the "shore".  The countdown begins when the user begins to swim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48e/b2e/98a/48eb2e98a63aefa8d2e4355884c869c8.png" height="550"><br><br>  Moov Now collects data on your own, you can leave your phone in the car or in the locker room during class.  Here is an application for example. <br><br>  Here are some examples of the training report from the Moov Swim application: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d18/de6/44b/d18de644b3a0dfb2b8c42b69c0325858.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/05f/5c3/2cc05f5c36f6e592790f47c61bcd30aa.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10a/0eb/463/10a0eb4630f36210cb9a3d39a0ec502c.png" height="550"><br><br><h3>  Walking and running </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bc/93e/b40/7bc93eb40b5d43eaba22d18bc52cd017.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Real-time audio training; </li><li>  Various training modes; </li><li>  Level system; </li><li>  HIIT training; </li><li>  Elevation; </li><li>  Detailed reports; </li><li>  Cadence (step frequency in this case); </li><li>  Pace; </li><li>  Total distance traveled; </li><li>  The number of calories burned; </li><li>  Heart rate monitor support; </li><li>  Path mapping. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Cycling </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2da/c89/71a/2dac8971afc04d09a129a8b2b97fef77.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Audio and video training in real time; </li><li>  Path mapping; </li><li>  Detailed report; </li><li>  Elevation; </li><li>  Help with changing the path; </li><li>  Cadence (this is the frequency of pedaling, the number of revolutions of the pedals per minute); </li><li>  Total distance traveled; </li><li>  The number of calories burned; </li><li>  Heart rate monitor support; </li><li>  Moov Power. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Cardio boxing </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/f78/4ae/5e9f784ae5c94303a1d65d1564d2a831.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Audio and video training in real time; </li><li>  Video instructions; </li><li>  Training staging exercises; </li><li>  Detailed reports; </li><li>  Speed; </li><li>  Equipment; </li><li>  Strength; </li><li>  Time; </li><li>  Duration; </li><li>  The number of calories burned; </li><li>  Heart rate monitor support. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  General classes </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c64/d3d/42c/c64d3d42c8274738a99cb7d21e340050.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Audio and video training in real time; </li><li>  Video instructions; </li><li>  Level system; </li><li>  Total distance traveled; </li><li>  The number of calories burned; </li><li>  Heart rate monitor support; </li><li>  Exercise rhythm; </li><li>  The number of approaches and repetitions; </li><li>  Progress. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  application </h3><br>  The developers have updated the software platform for Moov, adding many new features and capabilities.
