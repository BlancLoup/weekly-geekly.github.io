  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Internet addiction is treated in China</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Internet addiction is becoming a new scourge of Chinese society.  Representatives of this nation are distinguished by tremendous perseverance and hard work, which leads to disastrous consequences in the event of any psychological dependence (probably, for this reason, gambling is strictly prohibited in China, while in the UK, for example, they receive government support).  Many Chinese simply can not break away from online games and pay for it with their lives - they die from exhaustion after a few days of intense play.  Just the other day there was <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/5349.html">another sad case</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Chinese doctors, about 13% of Chinese teenagers Internet users, that is, about 2.6 million people, have a predisposition to Internet addiction.  Psychiatrists say that one of the causes of this disease is a boring life.  Many people simply have nothing to do, and they spend the whole day in virtual worlds. <br><br>  A few months ago, the Chinese government opened eight specialized dispensaries to treat Internet addiction to fight a common illness.  The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/21/AR2007022102094_pf.html">writes</a> how harsh the conditions are in these places. <br><br>  Seventeen-year-old schoolboy Sun Jiting (Sun Jiting) was placed in such a clinic at the request of his parents.  They were concerned that the child spends 15 hours a day at the computer for 15 hours a day, noticing only the change of day and night.  Treatment was required immediately.  About a month he spent in the ward behind a metal grill, without the ability to communicate with friends, and his only interlocutors were psychiatrists, nurses and other patients.

      Specialized clinics open across the country as part of a national program to combat Internet addiction.  The communist government of China and the local Komsomol (Communist Youth League) do not cease to talk about the importance of this problem.  At the same time as the emergence of specialized dispensaries, the Chinese government restricts access of its citizens to ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù foreign sites (pornography, gambling, anti-communist propaganda). <br><br>  The largest and oldest clinic for the treatment of Internet addiction is at a military base in Daxing, a suburb of Beijing, and on normal days provides shelter for 60 patients, but at critical periods their number rises to 280. Patients age: from 12 to 24 years.  Only a very few of them came here of free will.  Almost all were brought by parents who pay for treatment in the amount of $ 1,300 per month (in China, with an average salary of $ 130, this is a lot of money). <br><br>  The dispensary was originally created to treat heroin addiction, but later it was reequipped according to new realities.  The treatment of online drug addicts is a more pressing problem these days.  However, psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, hypnosis and weak electric shock remain in the arsenal of local doctors, as well as military discipline and strict isolation of patients. <br><br>  There are ten large separate wards in the dispensary.  The whole clinic is painted gray-blue cold colors, and only in these rooms are walls of warm colors, with a lot of sunny color, in order to increase the level of serotonin in the brains of patients.  Morning begins at 6:30 am, when the usual soldier‚Äôs cry ‚ÄúThis is for your own good!‚Äù Was sent to the ward-chambers. <br><br>  On the third floor are wards for the most difficult patients, who are considered chronic Internet addicts, with experience of five years or more.  After a few days of treatment, these unfortunates fall into severe depression and refuse to meet with the doctor.  Chambers on the third floor are observed 24 hours a day. <br><br>  China is not the first country where Internet addiction is discussed at the state level.  In the past few months, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam have also taken steps to protect teenagers from being overly addicted to virtual reality.  As part of these measures, the admission of children to Internet clubs is limited and ‚Äúparental control‚Äù systems are introduced, which automatically terminate the communication session every five hours of online play.  But no country has gone as far as combating Internet addiction as far as China. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5083/</a></p>
