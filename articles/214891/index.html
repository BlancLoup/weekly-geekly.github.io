  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Olympic traffic: how and how much watched the Olympics on the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During the Winter Olympics in Sochi, CDNvideo was a partner of the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company.  All official broadcasts of Olympic events channel VGTRK led using our servers.  And we counted all the spectators and received interesting statistics. <br><br>  How many people work CDN.  Our client publishes a broadcast and places a player on its website.  All connections are processed by our servers, and the intelligent balancer determines from which node it is best to send the video stream for each specific site visitor.  This node will be closest to the visitor or least loaded. <br><br>  Thus, we could capture all the Olympic traffic up to the user, and we know how many people watched the Olympics, when, from where and on which devices. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Immediately make a reservation, we know nothing about those who watched the Olympics on regular televisions.  We have data only on views through computers, tablets, phones.  Through the TV too - but only if it is a Smart TV.  It is clear that the overwhelming majority of the population of the country watched the Olympics on TV, and we can judge the popularity of broadcasts from a sample of a few percent. <br><br>  Let's start with what devices Internet users use to watch sports events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/186/55d/686/18655d686bf36774267fad8c4879a089.jpg"><br><br>  Notice that iPad and IPhone owners are almost three times as many as Android lovers.  At the same time, Apple devices in Russia, on the contrary, are several times smaller than Android devices.  Now we know who the real athletes and patriots are. <br><br>  But the data on the shares of views by city.  It looks like the top ten: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d88/c67/4a5/d88c674a57c51659050a5cb5bed65123.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Least of all rooted for our in Kazan and Stavropol.  These cities took 0.1% each.  Almost complete indifference to the sport. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/c1a/96e/b9ec1a96e5189650fad571372f475541.jpg"><br><br>  1. Normal Friday evening.  Such is the attendance of our servers when nothing special happens in the country.  In this case, we recorded 31,263 simultaneous visits at the peak. <br><br>  2. The opening of the Olympics.  123,429 people went online to watch the opening of the Sochi games.  We raised the logs for the last year and found out that, for example, at the press conference of Vladimir Putin on December 19, at the peak, there were half as many users who visited - 63,724. <br><br>  3. The first competition in figure skating - 100 192 simultaneous viewing. <br><br>  4. A short surge in attention caused a competition in short track - 90 230 prosmor.  In the men's 1500 meters race, Viktor An won bronze for Russia.  He will still surprise everyone, and this will be seen on the graphs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cc/b9e/fa1/9ccb9efa1da0dcc09f302464f6aaa6a9.jpg"><br><br>  5. Interest in figure skating and hockey (although the Russian team did not play that day) gave a total of 99,906 views. <br><br>  6. The first staggering peak of views falls at the Russia-Slovenia hockey game - 220 301 (the Russian team won 5: 2).  This is about 44 times more than at the broadcast of the rock festival "Invasion", and at the time of closing, during the performance of the group "The King and the Fool".  However, the broadcast was then panoramic and in high resolution. <br><br>  The next day, American skier Gus Kenworthy sheltered five stray dogs from Sochi.  The dogs have already gone to the USA.  And on the traffic this day was the most unfortunate for the Olympics. <br><br>  7. The Russia-USA hockey match, in which referee Brad Mayer did not count the puck on the American team - probably the most scandalous episode of the Olympics, not counting Plushenko's confessions.  But for some reason, he didn‚Äôt evoke a resonance among Internet users - 80,164 views, something like women's biathlon. <br><br>  Offline match caused a resonance at the state level.  ‚ÄúThe pucks are incomprehensible, the judges are incomprehensible,‚Äù said Vladimir Putin after the match, who was asked to comment on what was happening.  By the way, his New Year's appeal in 2014 was watched with even less interest than the scandalous match - 77,428 views. <br><br>  8. Match Russia-Slovakia watched simultaneously 209 166 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/dfa/f15/d69dfaf154ce3a8bccca957c061dddf3.jpg"><br><br>  9. The match Russia-Norway has the peak of views for the entire Olympics - 225 091. The load on the channel exceeded 206 gigabits per second. <br><br>  11. The failure of the hockey emotionally charged so much that the remaining days of the Olympics attendance was on average about one and a half times more than in the first week.  The competitions in figure skating, which ended with Adelina Sotnikova‚Äôs victory over Yu Na Kim, were watched by 172,098 people at the same time. <br><br>  12. In addition to the existing bronze, Viktor Ahn won three more gold medals in the short track competition and set an Olympic record.  Internet users rating is 120 011 views. <br><br>  13. On the penultimate day of the Olympics, everyone watched biathlon - 170,002 views.  Gold in the relay 4 x 7.5 km among men. <br><br>  It would be appropriate to add here that in January 2014 there was the Biathlon World Cup, which was also broadcast through our servers.  At that moment, the number of views at the peak was 76,261. And here is another similar figure.  The victory parade on May 9 in 2013 gathered 72,329 views. <br><br>  14. Olympiad closing - 161,089 views </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214891/</a></p>
