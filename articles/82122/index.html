  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to be a good specialist or what has the (self) education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, in Habr√©, more and more articles about our education, about how bad it is, about what obsolete technologies we teach there, how to find a good job with such knowledge and so on.  So I wanted to write some ideas on this topic. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can argue about whether you need a higher education in order to get a good job, or you can just work, gain experience, and also achieve success.  Of course, there is no unequivocal answer to this question.  There are gifted people, everything comes easy for them, there are smart people, but they need to work on themselves to learn and achieve, there are those who have a dad who is a ‚Äúbig man‚Äù and they don‚Äôt need to achieve anything.  In any case, it seems to me that studying at the institute lays a foundation, a foundation on which everyone can build their house in the future.  As one of my teachers said: ‚ÄúAt the institute, you must learn to understand the task, and where to look how to solve it.‚Äù  One cannot but agree that there is some truth in this.  After all, it is impossible to know everything, but if there is an outlook, there is an idea about technologies, you can always choose the right direction for detailed study and as a result solve the set task. <br><br>  But something I'm not about that.  I want to say something else.  In the modern world, life goes at such a fast pace that you do not have time to notice how days, weeks, months, or even years pass by.  And the IT-sphere does not lag behind the ordinary life, and even goes ahead.  There are new technologies, standards, protocols, services.  And to be a good IT specialist you need to be well informed!  It‚Äôs not enough just to know one‚Äôs business well, because as the year or two pass, new technologies will appear, the existing ones may simply become morally obsolete - and then what?  We will have to study from scratch what could already be actively and successfully used.  Again, to make a successful project, it does not matter, your own start-up on the Internet, or a specific project at work, you must choose promising technologies, use already proven methods and techniques.  And where to get so much knowledge and skills?  Of course, it is possible to make a long and hard road through the invention of bicycles, through heaps of mistakes on my own experience.  And yes, without it will not work!  It seems to me that the answer to this question is self-education and intercourse, or it may even be easier to say easier - you just have to boil it in this mess.  Read regularly IT resources, discuss interesting topics, and even not only in a specific area, but in the IT industry as a whole, go to different conferences.  Maybe even communication should be put in the first place.  For example, when I go to a conference, first of all I go in order to communicate with people, find out what they think about certain technologies, what prospects they see, it is interesting to discuss how different people relate to certain things may even argue about something.  No wonder, after all, Socrates said that truth is born in a dispute. <br>  So read, study, discuss more!  :) </div>
