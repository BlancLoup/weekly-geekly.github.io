And we have one advantage that a few developer can boast of: <b>every employee of the company has a phone where it all starts.</b> <br><br>  That is, we can be sure that if tomorrow there will be an application release for inventory, then all users will receive it.  And will be able to instantly use. <br><br>  I want to tell about this ecosystem of applications and what employees do with them in the store and in the office.  This is how the phone screen looks like:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/44/a1/iv/44a1iv7pp7u_egi-gdyz_muadug.jpeg"><br><br>  As you can see, corporate applications are side by side with social networks, Telegrams and other ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù dialing.  We encourage the use of instant messengers and social networks from corporate devices.  In principle, we do not track users and do not use their data (French privacy policy in MDM is approximately at the level of GDPR). <br><br>  According to our observations, when an employee has a working Telegram and VKontakte on his phone, he begins to more effectively use the applications that he needs to work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  How did it all begin? </h3><br>  In 2017, we tested the introduction of smartphones for each employee at three stores.  These were the most basic applications and web versions of basic data from the portal. <br><br>  In 2018, there was a roll-out to all the shops of Leroy Merlin.  This is a project in which they gave each employee a phone with basic applications. <br><br>  The buyer‚Äôs retail application was first installed: the customer went to the store with him and showed him to the sellers and consultants what he wanted.  Sometimes the employee did not know how to quickly view a particular product on the site.  With the application it became possible to quickly navigate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/m6/go/shm6goiksnnqmn5r39uxrkgurmw.jpeg"><br><br>  The second application was with support contacts: you click on the icon, the phone comes out, where to call in what situation. <br><br><h3>  What is the set worth now? </h3><br>  <b>Application for surveys.</b>  This is the realization of direct democracy: sometimes we need to interview each employee to make a decision.  For example, which is better - a complete, but not very large set of social guarantees with gym compensation or incomplete, but with the ability to choose one or two directions, where to invest funds from unused opportunities, etc.  For example, to issue voluntary medical insurance to children, abandoning the gym and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/mc/of/zymcof6ovgjkvmfa3u4mqrakicy.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Retail app seller.</b>  There is no training on the product, which will not become obsolete in a month.  A client came, he asked.  The seller can get the unit from the data on the product (where, how much, for example, location in the warehouse, on the storefront, in the drive) and can accurately answer. <br><br>  The application allows you to see the availability, characteristics, price of goods, including purchasing, availability of goods in a nearby store, issue a document of the sale day.  You can see the delivery plan, sales history, create a move from the warehouse to the sales area.  You can calculate the amount of goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/ol/rf/lcolrf4isdlzgcfu7jlejmrmj0a.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Making a move when you are standing right in front of a shelf is priceless:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/7f/hy/sc7fhygarm-78gzvsqavhljwoeq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Whatsapp</b>  It was decided that the fight with messengers is not just useless, but also harmful.  As a result, employees now communicate through their relatives and friends and at the same time very quickly receive data from the store, any operational information and mailings from the HR team.  The stores have created groups by department.  Current issues are promptly discussed there - for example, ‚Äúspecial delivery is delayed,‚Äù someone asks where to get which document, and so on.  Someone does this in the Telegram, someone from Vatsapa-ration, when it is inconvenient to type.  All this helps a lot in work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/w5/wb/ncw5wbocd3dxgwqfjr9zr0fsd_c.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Training and knowledge base</b> - you can search for any information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/2q/ll/uj2qll4vzlntjku2u5agf6rfamu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Mini-inventory</b> (reliability of inventory).  A higher-level system generates a list of products with anomalies (for example, they are registered but not sold for quite some time), and then one of the employees falls to the task of investigating the incident.  Or the stock of the goods went into the negative - you need to figure out what happened.  The employee goes to take into account the goods, and the phone can be used immediately as a barcode scanner (I had to climb into the application to a low level of work with the camera so that it worked really quickly). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/gr/gv/dhgrgvt2c_bg-zcxu5vawmxlqvw.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Large inventory and stock adjustment:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4d/qd/sn/4dqdsn3tvrslrmqp04pvxm2bg8a.jpeg"><br><br>  A large inventory is held in the autumn, once a year.  Last year, parallel TSDs were used - pieces of iron with a distant laser scan: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/kr/iw/b_kriwoyokxhujxcwnu-mprnee4.jpeg"><br><br>  But they have a restriction on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse, so several shops (three test operation points) also used telephones.  The next large inventory will be conducted with phones in all stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/ts/rk/p1tsrk9sagko2tgp2t734oecz8y.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Social network.</b>  They help to increase the level of computer literacy of users.  When a person will confidently figure out how to communicate with relatives via the VKontakte application, he will receive a certain background of pressing different buttons, controlling different interface elements, and so on.  It is clear that the office does not need it, but in stores, the level of ownership of a corporate phone rises sharply. <br><br>  Any unit can make a mobile interface for its tasks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/ef/h8/oyefh8cl4yjno8por9d8r0uwcma.jpeg"><br>  <i>So you can find a person on the portal.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/rc/lp/vmrclpoeduariihuqnmojnv0hvg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Or see the status.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/ze/gj/iizegjhfr2yyeif7bszfu7cei4u.jpeg"><br>  <i>Or calculate the repair at the client.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_0/y5/j5/_0y5j5traxu7aijat_blf4vqdc4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Payment of lunch from a corporate card.</i>  <i>You can keep track of your expenses.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/fm/cy/jdfmcy4ghynnsqvgbskjviel0rc.jpeg"><br>  <i>The results of checks by the secret buyer.</i> <br><br><h3>  What happened next? </h3><br>  In addition to the access point to the company's services, we also received the opportunity to instantly inform employees.  They thought it would be centralized, but it turned out to be even more interesting. <br><br>  The employee enters the store group in the messenger and is always in the topic of what is happening in the store.  In the subject of new collections and products.  This is a free opportunity to learn, because they see each other's questions and answers.  See what questions customers will ask at the meeting. <br><br>  Many stores conduct master classes on goods, and they go live on Instagram.  Any customer can watch a birdhouse, a cat house, or an analog liquid computer from a sewer pipe (not really reached this point).  And their own employees join such broadcasts for training. <br><br>  Phones help to update the store's social networks: employees show that something interesting has appeared in the store right now. <br><br>  In general, besides the obvious results in the spirit of ‚Äúaccess to IT services for everyone‚Äù, we got a lot of unobvious good. <br><br>  It started with the fact that we have a lot of employees without computers who go shopping and touch goods.  It was quite difficult to come up with a mobile terminal for each case of life, so we gave everyone corporate smartphones as jobs.  And now I confidently say: they have become truly mobile jobs.  And not only. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454062/</a></p>
