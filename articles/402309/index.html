Before turning to them, I will not restrain myself, and I will give a photo of the subject of the dispute and a quote from the wiki: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/675/015/efc/675015efca3975503e80ad6dd72e6529.png" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  The official classification as a destroyer-helicopter carrier does not correspond to the real combat capabilities of the ship.  The ship significantly exceeds the destroyer-helicopter carriers of the preceding types in terms of displacement, has a continuous flight deck and a relatively large air group, which makes it possible to classify it as a light aircraft carrier.  An authoritative naval guide <a href="https://www.ihs.com/products/janes-fighting-ships.html">Jane's Fighting Ships</a> classifies him as a helicopter carrier </blockquote>  <sup>[one]</sup> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Photos of triangles-ship immediately impressed me.

Or maybe floating irons? </h3><br>  In 2012, the Norwegian seismic exploration company <a href="https://www.pgs.com/">Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS)</a> placed an order for the construction of two (and later a couple) Ramform-vessels of the W-class.  The order was placed on the Japanese company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.  Ships are representatives of the Ramform series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f58/644/15f/f5864415f3af66615d49d80fc5c5e176.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I can assume that the prototype of this engineering and design approach was the vessel Maryata III, built by the shipbuilding company <a href="https://www.nrk.no/telemark/oppsigelser-ved-tangen-verft-1.313103">Tangen verft</a> especially for reconnaissance purposes, with such a calculation that the low noise of the mechanisms and travel is ensured.  Silence and invisibility are necessary, so as not to interfere with the recording of measurements and other sonar and electronic systems.  The vessel has high stability, which facilitates the operation of sensors on this stable platform.  To achieve high stability of the vessel, it was made in the form of Ramform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/840/2fc/398/8402fc398be7b37563c12862aafce1e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Large width affected the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">metacentric height of the vessel</a> , which was about 16 meters.  The vessel is so ‚Äútenacious‚Äù that it can continue to function even with significant damage to part of the internal set.  Naturally, the ‚Äúnorthern package‚Äù is also present: prolonged exposure to low temperatures or large amounts of water / ice on the deck is not a significant problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6c/8bb/2b2/c6c8bb2b2a6954a3210ec9b81b4b3cba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The ship is equipped so that it can operate in the northern polar regions without interruption for a very long period of time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64e/0bf/883/64e0bf883f8ed5b22ceea68c4b0d2b86.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  FS Marjata is a vessel for long-range sonar observation and reconnaissance, built for the Norwegian Navy back in the 90s.  specifically to participate in the project <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/misc/assets/files/elint.pdf">ELINT</a> . <br><br>  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of the reconnaissance ship of the Naval Forces of Norway "Maryat III" is located between 34 - 36 degrees east longitude - an area located in close proximity to the border of the territorial waters of Russia.  More precisely - only about 30-40 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from the coast of the Kola Peninsula. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee8/20a/e40/ee820ae40a2692386e079ddea0a2b979.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The insides of ‚ÄúMaryaty‚Äù are literally stuffed with expensive electronic filling and intelligence innovations. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKpPDmBojfg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote>  In the Northern Fleet of the Russian Navy, almost all Russian sailors are familiar with it and even gave it diminutive nicknames like ‚ÄúMashka‚Äù, ‚ÄúMarusya‚Äù and even ‚Äúiron‚Äù, because of their similarity to this household item. </blockquote> <sup>[3]</sup> <br><br>  Returning to Ramform, it can be noted that the appearance of these vessels cannot be confused with anything, it is strikingly different from other geophysical vessels. <br><br>  As the company PGS notes: ‚ÄúSSS Ramform‚Äù type ships are the most powerful and efficient ships for marine seismic surveys ever.  They are also the widest. <br><br>  In these vessels, all the most advanced marine technologies and opportunities in the field of marine seismic survey GeoStreamer are joined together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41a/2e8/7d7/41a2e87d7cd727fa652660810f532953.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The stern of the vessel, 70 m wide, is equipped with 24 drums with seismic streamers.  They can pull a seismocos network, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 12 km <sup>2</sup> (equivalent to 1,500 football fields or three and a half Central Parks in New York). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/553/78b/896/55378b896994e29bf0677fe337276211.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The increased working space and unique equipment makes operations involving the ship safer and more functional. <br><br>  For both PGS and its customers, faster deployment and removal of equipment, as well as increased duration of stay at sea, means faster completion of seismic exploration and an increased rate of continuous operation in adverse weather conditions.  What affects the cost of seismic exploration and its safety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53d/b41/e16/53db41e166a806982c97293cac044e94.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The autonomy of ships is 120 days without refueling, they are all-weather.  The interval between calls at the service port can be increased by another 50%. <br><br><h3>  In November 2015, the vessel Ramform Titan set a record when shooting in the Bay of Bengal </h3><br>  18 seismic mowers were involved, each 7.05 km long, with a distance of 100 m between them. Together, they formed a 1.7 km wide strip, and the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe network was 15.6 km <sup>2</sup> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fb/9a7/353/3fb9a7353843299e27206a27120a7013.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For the first time, a seismic survey of such volume was carried out from one ship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90e/87e/c24/90e87ec2449d0ab7e4259802db05dca8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The vessel takes on board more than 6 thousand tons of fuel and equipment.  When conducting exploration, it tows a network of several hundred thousand seismic sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e3/3ab/bd2/0e33abbd2c00331e53155f4be0f972ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SSS Ramform type ships provide safe and comfortable accommodation as well as a working environment for 80 crew members.  On board there are 60 single cabins, as well as 10 double cabins for visitors with separate bathrooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/937/5a0/651/9375a06512459c5d1bf43c749c41659e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúRamform‚Äù type is distinguished by an unusual Œî-prominent hull shape in plan with a wide stern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/670/ebc/8e1/670ebc8e1529e43fd15bd96de26071ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ships themselves go under the Flag of the Bahamas, as well as their many ‚Äúbrethren‚Äù, who suffer to save on taxation and port dues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/502/a4d/9a0/502a4d9a06578d255cbd4b6b61cbeb8e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  More information about the technical characteristics of the ships Ramform class Titan can be found through the infographic posted on the <a href="https://www.pgs.com/contentassets/2407eafa7625492b9772dbcde7f80755/ramformtitan-infographic-a3-landscape.pdf">website of the company PGS</a> . <br><br>  The fourth ship of the Titan class, the Ramform Hyperion, is to be launched in 2017. <br>  Video from the PGS website gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe concept, application and prospects of such vessels: <br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8vN35C7_qz8">The fleet to beat</a> <br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BkcrfwcQLsI">Ramform Titan - Instrument Room</a> <br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFrvrHqnPVk">Ramform Titan In Operation</a> <br><br>  Live ship video: Camilla Aadland = Ramform Titan visited Bergen <sup>[6]</sup> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5fSZG9zl58w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Returning to the Japanese shipbuilding industry (and MHI in particular, where Ramform-class ships are built and built) I will quote: <br><blockquote>  Japanese ships can be distinguished by the ideal state of the decks and sides.
