You can make the application in 1 day, look at the reaction of the audience and continue to work.  If nobody is downloading your application, everything is clear, the idea or its presentation failed, you need to change something.  But if thousands of people start to download your creation - ‚ÄúAlarma!‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet undressed and start working‚Äù! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/599/9a6/ea1/5999a6ea1ec2af00a33a5e3c26ca44df.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that I saw on the Internet a few pictures showing interesting facts with the addition of light humor.  Then I contacted the author of these drawings for permission to publish them as a mobile application.  The author is used to the fact that his works are often used all over the Internet and therefore allowed to use his works free of charge. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/115/9e0/d10/1159e0d1049f1cbf743e8187a1846ff2.jpg"></div><br>  For 1 day, an application was made in Unity3D, in which it was possible to pass a questionnaire on the knowledge of certain facts.  In early 2015, I released this app.  Several thousand people a week began to download the application without any advertising or other promotion.

Either a good name, or an eye-catching icon (the left side of the mermaid‚Äôs torso from the first image).  But since  The application worked poorly and I did not add new facts, the rating of the application began to die along with the downloads. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6f/d59/656/d6fd59656fb9b5bf51740f9f5a146be4.jpg"></div><br>  For almost two years, I did not attach importance to how often the application swayed, and during this time more than 50,000 people downloaded a one-day hack. <br><br>  And now, after so much time, I have released a new version of the application.  New facts were drawn for about a month by different artists.  The application itself was developed and tested on different devices for about 3 weeks.  Waiting, starting, failing ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fef/d1a/026/fefd1a02606196fcfcefe364fdc29490.jpg"></div><br>  When the second version was created, I thought that success could happen again.  Even if it were repeated, an army of artists was ready, ready to draw new facts every day.  After launching the application, it did not receive thousands of downloads.  Almost 200 people downloaded it in a month.  Few downloads, but a lot of good reviews.  It turned out a good product, but not popular. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f86/79c/6f7/f8679c6f78964334b5c9920df997aca5"></div><br>  The statistics above shows a new application.  Bottom is old.  In two years, a lot of things could change.  For example, Google could change the search algorithm and recommendations of new applications, users could change interests, the application market could be saturated with analogues.  All this influenced the lack of users Wow effect. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52d/080/f0f/52d080f0fbc606aa5ae05791ed0b1815.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Even when starting simple projects, you need to have a plan in case of its success.</b>  Of course, after the first thousand downloads in a few days, it was necessary to start creating new facts and gradually improve the quality of the application.  But since  this did not happen, then all users were lost.  It's a shame.  But this is a lesson that helped in other one-day projects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b02/d53/efe/b02d53efe5cafe46041470317aa07838.jpg"></div><br>  I will tell about one of such successful projects in the next article.  And how often do you shoot projects collected on your knee? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372901/</a></p>
