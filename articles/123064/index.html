  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4road.net vs RosYam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The state of roads in Ukraine and Russia leaves much to be desired.  And even though Ukraine has been preparing for EURO 2012 for a long time, a lot of repairs, expansion and construction of roads are underway, still driving a car does not bring any pleasure, but only annoys and ‚Äúhits‚Äù afford. <br><br>  In the spring of this year, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/crowdsourcing/120286/">Alexei Navalny presented an Internet project for dealing with pits on the roads</a> , and in Ukraine, the <a href="http://4road.net/">4road.net</a> project appeared quietly and unnoticed.  Two sites designed to help citizens deal with <s>corrupt officials</s> potholes and pits on the roads.  Because  I am a citizen of Ukraine, then I tried to use the site 4road.net and, after loading the first pit, I realized that it was far from ideal and looked like RosYam only an idea. <br><a name="habracut"></a><habracut><br>  I will begin my comparison of these two sites by entering them.  4road.net does not allow to enter under the login of popular social networks or services.  "Well, okay," I thought, and spent a minute registering.  Next, follow the algorithm: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be3/0d8/0be/be30d80be4f2b719961cca0f0801c8de.jpg" alt="image">

      or <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6d558455/8327ec21/e92faf7a/004d1488.png" alt="image"><br><br>  if you are using ross. <br><br>  The pits photos were prepared in advance, but 4road.net does not allow uploading files larger than 1 Mb, i.e.  If your mobile or PDA with a 5 MP camera takes a photo, for example, 1.02 MB you will have to spend time reducing it.  At the same time, RosYam allows you to upload photos up to 2 MB and not one, the main thing is not to exceed 8 MB total size. <br><br>  Next you need to specify the address of the pit.  And on 4road.net for this there is a drop-down menu for selecting a city and text fields for specifying a detailed address.  Seems like enough.  But not everyone remembers the names of the streets where they drove and took pictures of the pits.  The built-in Yandex map would be very helpful in this matter. <br><br>  After downloading the file to 4road.net, your pit is assigned a rating.  According to the rules of the site, it is impossible to vote for your pits (this possibility is excluded), only a registered participant can vote, a participant cannot vote twice for the same pit.  In the rules for evaluating and counting the ratings of 9 points.  And there are four types of competition: <br>  1. Competition for the worst rated pit on the road in Ukraine; <br>  2. Competition for the worst pit in each city separately; <br>  3. Competition for the most active participant in Ukraine (by total rating); <br>  4. Competition for the most active participant in each city (by total rating). <br><br>  As for me - this is absolutely useless thing.  Moreover, the rating is considered incorrect: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9565fbc3/bbe58e55/29c754db/7e0c7e27.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Of course it's nice to get a prize, for example, for the worst rated pit on the road of Ukraine.  But it is better to let it be patched faster, and I will never remember about it again.  Both projects were created with the aim of driving along good roads as quickly as possible - this is the best motivation for citizens using these sites. <br><br>  I will pass on the review from the Russian site.  At Rosiam, I filled out this form: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ad950c2b/6590ffaf/b9a6d28e/5ef099de.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Data from which allowed to generate a PDF-file.  It remains only to print it and send / carry it to the traffic police.  Full name of the chief was substituted by the automatic machine.  Address - from the previous forms.  None of this on 4road.net yet.  I sent a letter to 4road@list.ru with the subject ‚ÄúWhere is the automation on the site?‚Äù.  From this address, two completely opposite answers came.  The first option was sent by the Administration of the portal 4road.net: ‚ÄúGood afternoon. <br>  I promise solemnly: not today or tomorrow such an option will appear.  I just want to do it more simply, more universally, to connect with many databases.  But due to the fact that requests like yours have become frequent and come in batches, we will add as they are, and we will gradually improve. ‚Äù  Further, the text of the nuance of my pit, a link to the <a href="http://4road.net/news/Obschestvennyj_kontrol_dorog_v_ocherednoj_raz_na-006318/">text of the complaint in the traffic police on the pothole (pit) on the roadway of the city road</a> and the attachment <a href="http://files.mail.ru/15PGLM">Skarga GKS.doc</a> is the complaint template in FSW.  Accurate recommendations and addresses where to send a complaint did not write to me.  The choice can / should be in the traffic police, city council, FSW.  You need to google yourself. <br>  The second option came from 4road: ‚ÄúGood day.  No automation yet.  There are forms that are published in articles.  You must enter the name and address.  We are working on automation, but this is not in the near future. ‚Äù  Without links and attachments.  The same opposite answers from the same address came to the request to increase the size of uploaded files up to 2Mb. <br><br>  Here is another positive thing that the Ukrainian project does not yet have.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/120737/">Rosyama on Android.</a>  It is really very convenient to post pictures of pits directly from the streets or being in a traffic jam. <br><br>  I am very glad that in Odessa there were people who created the site 4road.net.  The beginning is half the battle.  And I hope that my comments will be taken by the administration of 4road.net not as a reproach.  I really want to create a complaint was easy and fast.  For mass effect, simplicity and speed are important.  The RosYam website thanks a lot for the example ‚ÄúHow to implement projects‚Äù.  Thanks to my brother for the picture of the pit in Belgorod.  In his words, finding it was not an easy task, which means that in the same city of Russia, the RosYam site was no longer needed. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> The link ‚ÄúPrint the text of the complaint‚Äù appeared in the pit card.  But the complaint itself climbs to the printer without a cap (the name of the official, the recipient's address). </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123064/</a></p>
