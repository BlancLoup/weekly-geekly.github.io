    <h4>  Determine the specifics of trade </h4><br>  The first thing that should be done to those who decided to create a platform for online trading is to decide what kind of trade they are going to carry on: an online storefront or a full-fledged online store. <br><br>  <b>An online storefront</b> is not a business, but a point on the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù called the Internet.  There is a website, and there are 1-2 people who carry out activities related to the transportation of goods from the supplier‚Äôs warehouse to the end customer: taking orders, advertising, bookkeeping, and delivery. <br><br>  <b>An online store</b> is a trading business that differs from other types of business in that the main sales channel is carried out using a website on the Internet.  As in any business, in the online store the main problems (which are not in the online storefront): logistics (and not delivery), employees, macroeconomics of the company, warehouse, strategic marketing, integration and interaction of various software.  Usability, design, advertising somewhere deep in the rear in importance. <br><br>  Just do not be fooled, if you flatter yourself, it will cost thousands of dollars in losses.  Do not be afraid to answer soberly, almost everyone once started with an online storefront. <br><br>  I do not touch the question: ‚Äúhow to determine when an Internet-shop window develops into an Internet shop‚Äù.  I can only say that the manager himself or the owner, when this happens, understands this quickly enough. <br><br><h4>  Do you understand what TK is (technical task)? </h4><br>  The majority of businessmen at the time of creating an online store do not understand why they need TK, and if they do, they don‚Äôt know how to make up and what should be in it. <br><br>  No TK - no problem.  You have 2 choices: <br><ul><li>  Hire experts who make it up.  Good TK is not cheap, but worth it.  It takes 2-4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the project (the deadline for negotiations, negotiations, etc.) is included in the preparation time.  A must for online stores! </li><li>  There is no money for TK, and so is figs with it.  Suitable for online storefronts. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What comes first: the developer or the platform? </h4><br>  Having TK on hand, send it to different agencies.  As a result, we get the CP (commercial offer).  We estimate the cost of implementation and the cost of ownership (subsequent development) of the proposed solution.  The development of a full-fledged online store based on TZ is a large separate article.  Here are some tips to get you started: <br><ul><li>  Personal communications should not affect contractor selection. </li><li>  Contractors should specialize in developing online stores, or who have a decent number of online stores in the portfolio.  It is imperative that in the last year there were 2-3 online stores. </li><li>  Select those who ask questions about the TK and give comments on it.  These are the most competent and efficient contractors. </li><li>  It matters which internet platform you are offered. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Further information only for online storefronts. </h5><br>  You do not have TK, you do not know what to include in it.  But you know that you only need an online storefront.  You are on the right track! <br><br>  For you, the primary platform.  You do not have the money to hire good developers, so you‚Äôll get by with freelancers, cheap contractors and acquaintances, all in turn.  This will cause your online store window engine to become an impassable swamp.  99 out of 100 that this will happen.  But it will be a rewarding experience. <br><br>  <i>Remember, there is no best CMS for online store.</i>  Everything is subjective.  Here is a guide for you on how to find the most suitable CMS. <br><br>  Do not pay attention to the number of functions in the CMS.  With your experience you will use only the basic set of functions.  The rest is not enough knowledge and time.  I guarantee. <br><br>  The best option is to rent an online store.  Spend less money, they help you to customize the system for you, for a short time you will understand what's stopping you, what is missing and what is really your ‚Äúperfect‚Äù online store. <br><br>  Or choose the base packages from the most popular CMS.  See the demo version with your set of products, choose the one that you prefer.  Anyway, the CMS shoals (and they definitely are) you will understand only with time in work. <br><br>  Open source engines.  Also an option, but finding an intelligent contractor for them is more difficult than for paid ones.  This is the best option if you are a programmer yourself. <br><br>  The list of engines with which you should NOT work at this stage: <br>  Bitrix <br>  Magento <br>  Why?  They eat a lot of resources, are heavy in settings, developers are expensive, redundant in functionality, like an iPhone for grandmothers - they would only have to call large buttons. <br><br><h4>  Determine the cost of ownership and the number of developers selected CMS </h4><br>  Stopped for 3-4 CMS? <br>  Go through the forums and communities, see what they say about the selected CMS, what problems and what people have been finalizing. <br><br>  Remember, whatever CMS you choose, every month you will be working on something.  It is necessary to determine how much it can cost and how many programmers or companies work with these engines.  The task is to determine how much typical designs cost.  See what you would like to finish, and go with it to the freelancers' exchange or in the company.  Let them count.  Estimate the cost and quantity of offers.  Naturally, the more and cheaper - the better. <br><br>  Look on the Internet - now for many CMS there are paid modules that solve many problems.  This is a good sign. <br><br>  <b>Since the lists of CMS, which I personally recommended, caused controversy - here I delete them.</b> <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Choosing a CMS at the online storefront stage is the choice of a more convenient administration panel and the most user-friendly user interface template (the design you most likely will draw based on this template) is for you.  Do not break your head what kind of CMS to choose.  All the same, after a year and a half, if you develop much, you will have to start an online store with different requirements from scratch. <br>  As one of my colleagues summarized, after this article: ‚Äúyes to ** y, which CMS‚Äù. <br><br>  UPD.  Much time has passed since the writing of this article.  Not only has the approach to opening an online store changed, but new, more convenient tools for opening online storefronts have emerged.  Now most of the stores are opening for rent: the sales model, product, and market are quickly being tested.  Now developers and designers are not required, and the store can be made in 3 days.  What should NOW pay attention to when choosing a CMS for an online storefront is <a href="http://www.cs-cart.ru/blog/cms-dlya-internet-magazina-kak-vyibrat/">well described here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141403/</a></p>
