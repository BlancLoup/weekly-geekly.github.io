  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Elevator Pitch or competent presentation of the project in 60 seconds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell you about how to create a competent Elevator Pitch - a one-minute presentation of the project to a potential investor based on my own experience.  When you have only one minute to present the project, you must clearly understand how to spend these precious seconds. <br><br><h5>  Brevity is the soul of wit </h5><br>  To begin with, try to describe your project and meet 150-200 words, while it‚Äôs necessary that these 200 words fit the description of the main idea, its uniqueness and consumer benefits, your market assessment, team composition and experience, current project status and the amount of desired financing.  Since you can not meet the minute, when you retell this text, try to put all the important things in the first paragraph and the first 20 seconds of the presentation. <br><br><h5>  First impression </h5><br>  The first phrase is the most important, try to write several options, show these options to the older generation, if they do not understand you - rewrite.  Repeat the exercise until most of you see the text for the first time, it will not be clear. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Clarity </h5><br>  Use as few terms as possible and try to use a language that everyone can understand.  For a better understanding, try creating a visual image of your story with your listener. <br><br><h5>  Timing and speech </h5><br>  Record yourself on a webcam and watch your pitch with friends.  Check to see if you have completed in 60 seconds, if you sounded confident, collect their tips on what could be improved. <br><br><h5>  Dry residue </h5><br>  After testing your speech on friends who are not familiar with the project, ask them to tell in their own words what exactly they learned from your speech.  What, from their point of view, is your project, what is unique in it, why it is worth investing money and effort into it. <br><br><h5>  Collect the best </h5><br>  Write and record a few options on your camera, go back to work on the text the next morning, choose the most vivid, understandable, well-meaning phrases, remember and try to take into account all the tips and wishes of friends and colleagues, and create a new, even brighter version. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  If you have completed this exercise correctly, then you will be able to grab the attention of investors in 1 minute and convey the main points of the project so that they want to start asking you questions. <br><br><h5>  An example (not from life, just a good idea, which I personally would be glad to see realized) </h5><br>  Football Player is a mobile application that allows football fans to watch the video broadcast of a match on a mobile phone screen and at the same time communicate in voice and chat with their friends.  Now, if you, for example, got stuck in a traffic jam and do not have time for the match, you start the Footballer and watch the match, along with your friends, commenting on the course of the game with them.  There are millions of football fans, but there are no applications that allow broadcasting and support both group and text chat. <br>  Our team agreed with ESPN about a fixed price for the right to broadcast matches through our application, we have already launched an alpha version with text chat and a video stream with ESPN (look at my phone) and fans of the local football team are already conducting in our application 2 hours a week. <br>  We have 3 web developers in a team, one designer and I are the project manager who has already launched 2 successful projects before. <br>  If we get funding, we can start working on this full-time project, finish the final version of the iOS / Android mobile app and blow up the app market for football fans. <br><br>  PS This is not a translation of someone else's article, but the rules by which he himself prepared the elevator pitch of his own project this week. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132396/</a></p>
