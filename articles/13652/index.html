  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Present a prototype!, Crooked mirrors of a business plan and where does the startup money come from</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In times already distant, at the time of my Soviet youth, I sometimes dropped into one ministry.  The name of most of my readers will not say anything.  But the ministry is quite typical.  What did I do there?  Punched a new topic.  Now I would say the "project".  The first thing that the responsible official asked me was: ‚ÄúDoes the proposed system have a prototype?‚Äù.  Of course, this meant a prototype with a decaying, as it was then said, West.  That is, by default, as they say, it was believed that (1) our specialist cannot offer anything original and (2) nothing suitable for comparison in the country of victorious socialism can be found.  The second thing they immediately asked the new Kulibin, is the Feasibility Study (TEO).  Then such a beautiful name as the Business Plan was known to very few people.  And they presented these same Kulibin documents, where they proved with the help of digital calculations how good it would be for all the people if their projects were realized. <br><br>  There is no longer that country, most of the ministries of those times turned into closed or half-open joint-stock companies, a new generation of specialists has grown, but ... traditions, unfortunately, have remained, perhaps, in all its former space.  Present a prototype, and better than American origin.  And, of course, business plan do not forget.  This will be said to any ‚Äústartup‚Äù looking for material support for some of its undertakings. <br><br>  I propose to talk a little about the prototype and the Business Plan - these two magic ‚ÄúOpen Sesame‚Äù, with the help of which sometimes you can get to the vital source of the desired investments.  We will also talk about where startups take money from ... in America.  But for this purpose, first about what I usually talk about in the heading " <em>See who is going ...</em> " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost one after another, articles and notes about the problems <strong>of the Web 2.0 social networking business application</strong> and how to solve these problems have begun to appear in the American press and blogs.  As part of what is commonly called <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D6915">Enterprise 2.0</a> .  I have already commented on some of these materials, for example, <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D31882">here</a> .  But two very fresh ones: <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D33638">1</a> , <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D37075">2</a> .  And, finally, the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D36941">most recent article</a> from <em>Information Week</em> , clearly indicating that it is already quite on the way.  It's about:

      <strong>SelectMinds</strong> and <strong>ConnectBeam</strong> are two social resources that focus on corporate use and combine the capabilities of FaceBook, LinkedIn and Digg. <br><br>  New sites are still just coming out, but the startups developing them have already received, for the development of their projects, respectively, $ 5.5, and the second, $ 3.3 million.  The main conclusion of the article is that <strong>investors have finally understood the promise of using social media in business and started investing millions in this area.</strong> <br><br>  <em>Well, now, just and you can return to the promised questions.</em>  <em>About prototypes, business plans, angels and sharks of venture capital, as well as why Runet has become a country of clones, with all the necessary links, read my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D38897">blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13652/</a></p>
