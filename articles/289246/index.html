      Digital marketing has become our everything, and everyone is eager to touch his greatness. <br><br>  But going online is the easiest part.  But keeping a strong and effective online presence is another story, one in which the web developer takes the role of the main character.  Web development is a mechanism on which digital marketing is moving, and if the mechanism is broken, then nothing works. Not every marketing problem can be solved with the help of high-quality web development, but many of them are still possible.  If you have encountered any of the problems listed below, deft machinations with web development may be useful to you. <br><br><h4>  Problem: Poor Rankings by Search Engines </h4><br>  If you systematically post content that is rich in keywords, but you don‚Äôt see the desired results, the problem may lie in the architecture of the website. <br><br>  A good web developer can use search engine optimization (SEO), making sure that the company's presence on the web is built on the same principles of design and technology. <br><br>  This can ensure that all content is well formatted and well presented for indexing by the search engine. <br><br>  A website that loads quickly and displays accurately on all types of devices has an advantage in terms of the number of users and traffic.  More traffic affects the ranking of search results.  In addition, more traffic is great anyway.  Traffic in the trend, if you want. <br><br><h4>  Problem: Rare content </h4><br>  Solid, unique content, such as articles, blog entries and infographics, increase traffic and customer conversions, but without a built-in content management system (CMS), in which it is easy to post such content, many companies have difficulty updating.  This is the case when a web developer has the opportunity to prove himself, either by incorporating an existing CMS (WordPress, Joomla) into the site layout, or by creating a special CMS for a particular company. <br><br>  CMS simplifies the process of publishing and updating content, as it does not require any programming knowledge.  You no longer need to spend man-hours on updating the content, tracking the only developer in the company to make it change the code - using the CMS, anyone can publish the desired content in two clicks <br><br><h4>  Problem: No user information </h4><br>  The average marketing specialist in your company may not see the difference between asking the user to login using their username or using their email address.  Ask the user to enter your email address on the registration page - this is the easiest way to make a list of email addresses, and one of the least complicated methods of obtaining information about users. <br><br>  However, the role of the web developer is not limited to the knowledge of these methods.  He or she should also know how to integrate such elements into registration forms, social media plug-ins and special windows so that they do not spoil the experience of user interaction. <br><br><h4>  Problem: Web Analytics Failure </h4><br>  Experienced market participants understand how to translate analytical data on the network into effective marketing solutions, but what if they don‚Äôt have, in fact, such data? <br><br>  Good web developers know how to build a strategy for obtaining analytical data on the network in accordance with their commercial goals, providing comprehensive, accurate and targeted data for the work of market participants. <br><br>  Using Google Analytics code on your page is baby talk.  The developer can ensure that the company receives such data: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Conversion Level <br>  ‚Ä¢ The effectiveness of advertising banners <br>  ‚Ä¢ Email Campaign Performance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Referrals and Social Network Activity <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video interaction and engagement <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mobile websites and apps <br><br><h4>  Problem: Outdated Marketing Techniques </h4><br>  Developers are always up to date and can be the first to get acquainted with a new social tool, a widget for processing content or a strategy to attract users, as well as the latest changes in best SEO techniques and web analytics trends. <br><br>  For example, a developer competent in matters of trends can tell the team the following things: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Building a marketing campaign on impressions and clicks is no longer relevant.  Now everything is based on conversion. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The main parameters of social networks (number of users, likes, reposts) do not constitute an adequate basis for decision-making and must be confirmed by conversion and relative parameters for a more accurate assessment. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Impersonal content with scattered keywords is less effective than useful, whole and well-written content. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Your website may be penalized for breaking the rules of the main search engines.  Doubtful methods such as black SEO optimization, IP fraud and redirects should be avoided. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  To maximize the effectiveness of your digital marketing efforts, integrate web development into your strategy from the very beginning.  The cause of many digital marketing problems is rare content, lack of analytical data and unsatisfactory search engine rankings that can distract from the development of solutions, and improving the quality of web development means the difference between success and failure of a marketing campaign. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful Paysto solutions for Megamind readers:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Get paid by credit card right now.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Accept payments from companies via the Internet.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">Acceptance of payments from companies for your site.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">With document circulation and exchange of originals.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Automation of sales and service transactions with legal entities.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Without intermediary in the calculations.</a> <br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289246/</a></p>
