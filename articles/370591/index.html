We want to share our joy: the Russian developer of energy storage and storage systems LLC TEEMP (included in the Renova group of companies) launched the production of high-performance supercapacitors and modules based on them in Khimki, Moscow Region.  Every year, a new enterprise will be able to produce up to 200 thousand supercapacitor cells.  The development of electrolytes for supercapacitors was carried out by the National Research Technological University "MISiS" - one of the key partners of the company "TEEMP". <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/421/e64/ef9/421e64ef92fa78fe5535dd8c2349eac8.jpg?1493024754123821" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Starter starting system based on super capacitors TEMP</i> <br><br>  Traditional batteries (lead-acid, lithium-ion, etc.), despite all their advantages, have one serious drawback.  They are able to accumulate a large amount of energy, but this process takes a long time;  accordingly, they are not able to discharge instantly.  Someone successfully compared the batteries with a bottle with a narrow neck: a lot of water will enter, but you have to wait to pour or pour.  Meanwhile, in the modern world, batteries are often required that can instantly charge and discharge.  They are called supercapacitors, and if traditional batteries are compared with bottles, then supercapacitors are glasses.  With a relatively smaller capacity, they are able to almost instantly accumulate a large amount of energy and just as rapidly return the accumulated charge. <a name="habracut"></a>  This property is actively used, for example, in hybrid cars, because, for example, during braking, the energy spent on acceleration is meaningless - it just goes into the atmosphere as heat through the heating of pads and discs.  Supercapacitors help save it and, well, the resource of these two types of devices differs fundamentally: there are more than a million cycles for supercapacitors and several thousand for rechargeable batteries.

      Until recently, there was no domestic production of modern supercapacitors in Russia, but at the beginning of the summer of 2017 the situation changed: the TEEMP company launched the production of high-performance supercapacitors and modules based on them in Khimki, Moscow Region. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe creation of energy storage systems is one of the world trends, which in the near future will determine the next technological order.</i>  <i>That is why Renova Group of Companies is investing in this area now.</i>  <i>Super capacitors "TEEMP" and their production technology - the development of Russian scientists.</i>  <i>The company's intellectual property is protected by Russian and international patents.</i>  <i>The production line of the enterprise is unique - its equipment is manufactured according to our technical specifications, and often, according to the company's own drawings</i> , ‚Äùsaid <b>Mikhail Lifshits</b> , <b>Director for Development of High-Tech Assets of Renova Group of Companies, Chairman of the Board of Directors of ROTEC JSC.</b> <br><br>  Products "TEEMP" unique in many ways.  Supercapacitor modules of the company successfully operate at temperatures up to -60 ¬∞ C.  They are characterized by low internal resistance, which means they can provide high impulse currents.  Own construction of cells and modules allows reducing weight and size of super-capacitor assembly by 30% compared with similar devices. <br><br>  The key partner of the company "TEEMP" in the project for the production of Russian supercapacitors is the National Research Technological University "MISiS".  In particular, the Department of Physical Chemistry of the University, which is headed by <b>Doctor of Chemical Sciences, Professor Mikhail Astakhov</b> , has developed an original technology for producing electrode materials from organic fibers. <br><br>  The main element of the Russian supercapacitor was the nanocarbon material obtained by the university‚Äôs research team with a uniquely developed surface structure with a maximum area per unit volume.  In scientific slang, this structure is called "whiskers" or "whiskers". <br><br>  This organic fiber carbon material has unique properties - high current conductivity, increased specific energy consumption - up to 8 Farad / sq.  see - and low production costs, which is very important in industrial innovations.  In terms of aggregate qualities, the new material successfully competes with graphene and nanotubes, and several times surpasses them in cheapness: a gram of graphene costs about $ 1,000, a kilogram of carbon whiskers - $ 20.  In contrast to two-dimensional graphene, ‚Äúbackends‚Äù are three-dimensional nanostructures with a given pore distribution (3D), which provides a unique ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù and ‚Äúcompactness‚Äù of the material. <br><br>  The new material provides more efficient storage and accumulation of braking electricity in electric or hybrid cars with its subsequent use during acceleration.  This material can be used in stationary energy, pulse technology, and even in medicine - for pacemakers, tomographs and x-ray machines. <br><br>  A similar material, but with significantly lower performance in specific capacity, was tested on several E-mobile variants, and in August 2015 in energy storage devices for urban hybrid buses with a total voltage of about 900 V. The efficiency of the heat exchangers was confirmed by actual running tests. <br><br>  Research on materials for chemical sources of current began at the Department of Physical Chemistry at NITU ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù back in 2011, when the E-mobile developers turned to scientists with a proposal to develop supercapacitors for the energy recovery system of hybrid cars.  One of the problems encountered in the development of a domestic hybrid car turned out to be the high cost of foreign-made supercapacitors, as well as the complexity and high complexity of assembling components.  Later work in this direction was continued in cooperation with LLC TEEMP. <br><br>  <b>The project manager from the TEEMP, Vladimir Tumanov,</b> said: <i>‚ÄúOur team proposed a fundamentally new design ideology and technology for assembling modules of supercapacitors, thanks to which the laboriousness of manufacturing drives was reduced by almost an order of magnitude.</i>  <i>At the Department of Physical Chemistry of NITU "MISiS", which is headed by Mikhail Astakhov, at the same time at least the original technology was proposed for producing electrode materials from organic fibers.</i>  <i>Together, these two ideas make it possible in the long term to reduce the cost of manufacturing the energy storage device almost 3 times</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The proposed drives can be used in various branches of technology: environmentally friendly personal and city transport, subway, load-lifting construction equipment, elevators, uninterruptible power systems and energy quality control, as well as in pulse and medical technology.  The developed device of the launch system is capable of operating autonomously, does not require a power network, and, in the charged state, is able to start, for example, 10 times in a row, a heavy dump truck at temperatures from -40 ¬∞ C to -60 ¬∞ C. The launch system can be used to launch small aircraft aviation, which require high power in a short period of time, which quickly disables conventional batteries. <br><br>  UPD: <a href="http://teemp.ru/images/uploads/2017/06/datasheetmlsk-167-48.pdf">Some performance characteristics from the site TEEMP</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370591/</a></p>
