  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All rental in one place</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I will tell you how a team of 3 people came up with and implemented an Internet project in 3 months.  Our idea is to create a platform for placing announcements about the rental of any things, starting with vehicles and ending with garden tools.  This idea came up with the two founders almost simultaneously, which is why we picked it up and got to work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is worth noting that we had little experience in developing Internet projects and mobile applications, namely two sites, one of which completely failed according to the idea and six applications.  We did all these projects during the year, it was a very valuable experience for us, because before that no one had come across the development of mobile applications at all. <br><br>  So, we had a general idea that everyone understood the same, this is a very important point, since the absence of problems with the project‚Äôs vision helps to shorten the discussion time during the development process.  Having discussed the structure of the project, we proceeded to the sketches. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In order to get down to the technical side of the project as soon as possible, all the most important pages were drawn as quickly as possible: <br>  - The main; <br>  - Page with the announcement; <br>  - Adding ads; <br>  - Editing profile. <br><br>  The overall visual concept of all pages was immediately accepted.  After that, we jointly wrote a short TZ and gave it along with sketches to the development. <br><br>  In turn, the designer continued to finish the rest of the pages and look for pleasant visual solutions, which in turn would be easy to implement.  That's what he did. <br><br>  <i>Home page</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/526/ff6/8b5526ff63da4432a7d89fd04f60a7f5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Page with the announcement</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/f86/527/1ddf8652741e437a8070fc38ac01c0c6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In parallel with the design, work has begun on a rubricator.  The rental market was analyzed by googling rental companies and compiling, on the basis of their catalogs, capacious sections, which eventually turned out to be 11. <br>  Transport and accessories <br>  Hobbies and leisure <br>  Childen's goods <br>  Clothing, shoes and accessories <br>  For business <br>  Celebrations and holidays <br>  For home and garden <br>  Construction and industry <br>  Health <br>  Animals <br>  Electronics and Technology <br><br>  Some sections were further divided into categories, and these categories into headings.  In general, it turned out about 367 rubrics.  On the one hand, this is incredibly much, but on the other hand, it turned out to divide the goods in such a way that the punchers do not lie on the same shelf with tennis rackets. <br><br>  The first menu designs appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6cc/d62/357/6ccd62357b894ab9ace098628d661f07.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The resulting menu was reminiscent of the Amazon.  Immediately I remembered an old article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171905/">The Mystery of the Amazon drop-down list</a> ". <br><br>  In order to somehow facilitate the search for the necessary sections and headings when adding an ad, it was decided to select them semi-automatically based on the keywords from the title. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85c/81c/6a9/85c81c6a9e9141e3abe47d214531cbc2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This required collecting keywords related to products from all available headings.  For example, for the category "Water Sports" we picked up the following keywords: <br>  wakeboard, wakesurf, wakesurfing, wakeskate, windsurfing, kiteboarding, kitesurfing, nibord, sailing board, flyboard, aquaskiper, pedalo, jet ski, surfing, water skiing, hoverboard, parasailing, sailing <br><br>  Next to this list are added duplicates with the letter "e", where it occurs, the case, as well as units.  and many others  number.  The search is a full match with the keyword, if a match is not found, then the entered header is sent to the admin panel and we manually decide which word to put in the key. <br><br>  Sections, categories, headings, keywords and SEO were collected in one table, which we then parked and substituted for the previously prepared base of cities for SEO.  By the way, from the SEO, on the recommendation of 1ps.ru, the meta keywords tag was excluded. <br><br>  Counting on the fact that not only companies, but also just people can become our users, we have prepared a special lease agreement, which everyone can edit and change at his own discretion.  You can download it by <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/E8ZiC-3jg6sH3">reference</a> or in your profile, after registration. <br><br>  A few words about the technical side: <br>  Interpreter: Python 2.7 <br>  Framework: Tornado <br>  Database: MongoDB <br>  Database Driver: Motor <br>  All this business is launched through supervisord and proxied to nginx. <br><br>  So, we were approaching the launch of the project.  At the very beginning, we thought about promoting the project, all this time, while the main development was going on, we were collecting ideas for promotion, now it is time to draw up a promotion program from your ideas.  Since everyone was very busy, we thought to look for a PR man, offering him some share in the project.  Requirements for the PR manager were as follows: <br>  - from Omsk (since we are in Omsk); <br>  - education or experience in PR; <br>  - undisguised interest in Internet projects; <br>  - knowledge of SEO (desirable); <br>  - knowledge of English (preferably). <br><br>  Only 3 people responded to the vacancy, although the cumulative review exceeded 600. The vacancy was compiled as openly as possible, we showed the project presentation, told at what stage of development we are and what tasks are facing the future partner. <br><br>  The first meeting with each of the candidates was promising.  All of them were extremely interested, full of ideas and enthusiasm, but only one had experience in working with public relations.  Nevertheless, we asked each of them to prepare a brief program to move the project to the next meeting.  To <br>  the conversation on it went on in more detail, we issued and painted in more detail all the ideas we had on promotion.  A few days later it turned out that the task turned out to be unbearable for 2 of 3. The remaining candidate brought to the meeting a program focused on offline events, for example, there were such points: <br>  - distribution of leaflets on mailboxes; <br>  - souvenir products for rental companies; <br>  - graffiti in an urban environment; <br>  - shooting a promotional video; <br>  - advertising on regional TV. <br><br>  Considering the budget, we decided that this format does not suit us, and, frankly speaking, we were convinced that at first we should be moving exclusively online, with which our candidate did not agree.  This cooperation has been completed. <br><br>  PR responsibilities were divided between two team members, and we were three again. <br><br>  Here we come to the launch of the project, which quite accidentally coincided with the birthday of Runet. <br><br>  In the following articles we will describe how to launch the application for iOS.  And reveal the secret of the promotion program. <br><br>  Team waving <br>  <a href="http://rentalist.me/">Rentalist.me</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289758/</a></p>
