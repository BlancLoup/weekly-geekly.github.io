It would seem that their time has passed long ago, and if you can still buy such a device for children and people of advanced age, you don‚Äôt want to go with something like that yourself.  However, skepticism usually disappears in the summer, when it‚Äôs just uncomfortable to carry around two large smartphones.  At other times of the year, this is easier, because there are jackets with vast pockets, but in the three hottest months, and with my ‚Äúlove‚Äù for every kind of handbag ... In short, I usually rearranged one of my two SIM cards closer to summer. - voice - to the Samsung Keystone 2 phone. This is such a ‚Äúcall-only‚Äù device.  In the two years of his life, he was well-worn out, and something extremely unpleasant happened to his speech speaker - you hear the interlocutor through time. <br><br>  In general, I thought about replacing.  Samsung did not want to take it (not at all because of doubts about reliability, but because of the craving for something new), Nokia, all the more so since the recent ultra budgetary people of the Finns with ‚ÄúAmerican citizenship‚Äù are not very intriguing.  I did it simply: I went to the Svyaznoy website and set the price ‚Äúfrom 0 to 1,500 rubles,‚Äù and then I began studying the sample.  In addition to low-cost models by Samsung, Nokia, Explay, and a couple of other brands unknown to me, I found a Lexand Mini model priced at 1,290 rubles.  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt look at the characteristics very much - I took it exclusively for the design, which is fundamentally different from what can be seen from other models for comparable money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fb/166/02f/6fb16602fbf755fcc315fb2f0b148f68.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  So what is a Lexand Mini? </h4><br>  The developers say that this is the smallest phone in Russia.  To confirm or deny this statement, digging in millimeters, I will not.  I will note only that the device is really very small - at first glance it is perceived as a key ring with keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/525/16d/f67/52516df679b2e931d8146c9456d8164d.jpg"><br><br>  There are three options to choose from - white, black and orange.  I took the last one myself, because it is the brightest and, let's say, ‚Äúsummer‚Äù.  The remaining two bought for a gift to friends.  By the way, the role of the gift Lexand Mini is very good - the device will not leave anyone indifferent to any iPhone user, or the owner of a mature device on Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/5ef/5a5/b915ef5a5911f6c5ae06e81251f05769.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a80/117/ff9/a80117ff99f17cc9b769e5886b5b99f8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  About the body and design </h4><br>  By design, the Lexand Mini is most reminiscent of Vertu buttons, only three times smaller (model dimensions are 93 x 39 x 15 mm) and 200 times cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/030/ae0/272/030ae02729d7c93364b8576ee3a28e45.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4d/9ff/e40/f4d9ffe404e305a5838410f1a924bb38.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f7/335/567/1f7335567eb9a8a5896f62f0b7fbea4d.jpg"><br><br>  It would seem, from what material can the phone be made for 1 290 rubles?  ‚ÄúNaturally plastic,‚Äù the reader will say.  And make a mistake.  Since the Lexand Mini is almost entirely made of metal - with the exception of the keyboard.  The metal here is not at all for a tick, it is rather thick and well felt by the fingers.  By the way, the use of such material is explained by a weight large enough for such dimensions - 75 g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d62/671/145/d62671145a466d5b9c187a4893a710a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/656/1b2/4ea/6561b24ea27e4d15e6d3e7749dbd477c.jpg"><br><br>  Separate parts of the Lexand Mini case are painted (metal case of the case + plastic keyboard), while others are decorated in chrome and shiny.  Are these the most brilliant parts scratched?  Yes, but in moderation.  For example, I carry the device in a special pocket on jeans, where the Zippo lighter was previously stored.  The phone goes there perfectly, but friction with takanyu still has a place to be.  So, unlike the lighter, which is very quickly rubbed because of such contacts, the Lexand Mini looks like new.  That is, there are a couple of scratches, but only that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7be/109/bad/7be109bad70e9ce90f4ff50fe1607ca6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b6/d67/44c/3b6d6744c2d74519df03dcfd3f7945b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dc/0d8/70b/6dc0d870bd2f046ba27c483e01ae8c6f.jpg"><br><br>  Build quality is excellent - the device is actually monolithic.  The back cover - also metal, by the way - can be easily removed, but it sits very tightly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/ee1/778/ae7ee1778bb9824ef94a1a5850179305.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/112/447/002/1124470020a9428fb6ee016dc1134873.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard and navigation button are very small, so writing messages from the Lexand Mini is quite difficult.  Yes, you can get used to it, but you cannot count on comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f36/294/f45/f36294f4531b973a71c5b56873d9ab96.jpg"><br><br>  Among other elements on the case, I will note the MiniUSB port, intended both for connection to a computer, and for a complete headset, and for a charger.  It is a pity that the developers did not put a more common MicroUSB in the Lexand Mini. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d7/28d/7f0/3d728d7f0a3a02cf9f4fe9d61c2c717a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  About phone functionality </h4><br>  Lexand Mini supports work with two SIM-cards.  At first it seems that one SIM card will hardly fit in the device, not to mention two.  But no, there are two nests, moreover, the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù MiniSIM format.  For each of the cards has its own "green tube". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/c8b/b86/37dc8bb86a941780ef5a81dcc671aa7d.jpg"><br><br>  With the quality of communication, everything, alas, is not too stable.  If you direct the speech speaker directly into the auricle, then you will hear the interlocutor well.  If you make a mistake and arrange the device crookedly (and this is quite real due to the small dimensions), then certain problems will be observed.  I also note that in windy weather, the Lexand Mini sucks noticeably - strong gusts of air dampen both your voice and your interlocutor's voice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe3/881/fc1/fe3881fc18c14aeee1d27d077c6d94c3.jpg"><br><br>  Each contact from the phone book can be set up to 5 numbers, which is not bad, since budget models are often allowed to enter only one phone.  It was nice to find in the Lexand Mini a blacklist - there are a number of subscribers that I don‚Äôt want to hear. <br><br>  You can put an MP3 file on the call, and the multimedia speaker is loud enough - of course, for such a little one.  The sound is audible within the room; you will also most likely learn about the call from the next room.  But from the other end of a three-room apartment - hardly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71e/3d9/b00/71e3d9b003650ba75e01da521f7d0448.jpg"><br><br>  Here I will add that the Lexand Mini is not friendly with the Internet in any way. <br><br><h4>  About the rest of the functionality </h4><br>  I will list the capabilities of the device with explanations. <br><br>  The interface is designed as a carousel with ‚Äúvoluminous‚Äù pictograms.  It works smartly, and indeed with performance Lexand Mini, apparently, everything is fine.  (Although why in this case this very performance is needed is an open question.) The Spreadtrum processor is installed in the device;  when I inserted a Sony RX100 camera flash drive into the phone with several 20-megapixel frames weighing 6-9 MB each, it opened them without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/758/943/55e/75894355e16ff9d506207c357d682fa8.jpg"><br><br>  A standard set of functions is also present: a calendar, a calculator, a file manager, an e-book reader, and a Snake game.  There is no Java support, so putting any other toys here will fail.  Especially grieving because of this, however, is not worth it. <br><br>  There is a voice recorder with WAV recording, the quality is surprisingly good. <br><br>  The Lexand Mini has a music player.  The sound quality - well, you guessed it ... it won't be much to experiment with headphones, since there is no 3.5 mm connector on the case, there is a MiniUSB port for the headset, which I mentioned above.  For audiobooks, the complete headset, in principle, is enough, but for music, alas.  Any files will have to be stored on a flash drive (up to 32 GB microSD supported), since the built-in device only 60 kb. <br><br>  FM radio is available, you need to connect a headset to work. <br><br>  There is a 0.3-megapixel camera, which also records video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/025/f88/57d/025f8857d5ae8b01cdc7a5aef6642d0e.jpg"><br><br>  For the order I will give a couple of shots, and the reader will make conclusions on his own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d26/660/97b/d2666097b735161267ee7b2ef0bafe3f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/701/e7a/51a701e7ab71534e2eda9c04caffba4b.jpg"><br><br>  Video model can also play.  But on the screen with a diagonal of 1.44 inches and a resolution of 176 x 144 points from this is not hot and not cold. <br><br>  Battery capacity is 400 mAh.  5 days the device works, but no more.  Count on a couple of weeks, as in the case of some ultra-simple models, not necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/a7e/a43/83da7ea4355fba20103e96f420465a9a.jpg"><br><br>  There is support for Bluetooth - you can connect a wireless headset (by the way, one of the ways to deal with the wind) and share files. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In my opinion, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lexand Mini is different.  The device looks really cool and causes a fit of delight in almost everyone who sees it.  All three options - orange, white and black - look nyashno and equivalent in their visual properties.  Add metal here, the price is 1 290 rubles (cheaper than most of the Nokii of the first series) and get a potential hit - especially in the summer, when many would like to temporarily ‚Äúpeel off‚Äù from smartphones.  What did not like?  Well, the camera is bad, there is no Internet, I would like to work longer ... On the other hand, all this could be expected - the main efforts of the developers were focused on the hull materials, design and miniaturization.  And for the dialer, in my opinion, these parameters are much more important than the rest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dda/250/e69/dda250e697a690f1a107fbbafde7687b.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226497/</a></p>
