It often happens that you participate in several chat rooms where the number of participants exceeds 10, which actually leads to the fact that on the desktop and in the tray the number of new messages is constantly updated, as well as notifications in the form of pop-up messages, now imagine that you have 3 chat windows with friends, 1 with your boss, another with a girl - all together it starts to confuse, distract and sometimes annoy.  I would like to prioritize ...

      Previously, I most often configured the "policy" of notifications only through the global settings of the program <br>  It happened that I learned that commands can be used in every skype chat window, for example, <b>/ alertsoff</b> will disable notifications for a particular chat window, respectively <b>/ alertson</b> will turn them on. <br>  Looking for a bit, I stumbled upon some kind of <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10042/What-are-chat-commands-and-roles">how-to</a> , there are quite a few text commands on skype chat, something like IRC commands.  Then I tried to try all possible of them on the two platforms I have, as it turned out, not everything and does not work everywhere ... I ask for cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two platforms - Windows and Linux, in this review, Windows 7 build 7600 + skype 4.2.0.169 and Ubuntu 10.04 + skype 2.1.0.81 were used.  If anyone finds out how these commands in skype behave in other versions, for other platforms or will give some more details on these commands (unfortunately, not everything was resolved) - I will be glad if you inform and add to the topic. <br><br>  So: <br><br>  <i><u>Note that you do not need to use square quotes around the text after writing the command.</u></i> <br><br>  <b>/ help</b> <br>  Displays a list of commands with some descriptions. <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ add [Skype_Name]</b> <br>  Adds a Skype_Name user to the chat. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - it works, while if the chat was originally with 1 partner, the group chat is created in a new window, otherwise the contact is added to the same window. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - running group chat is created in the window in which the command was entered. <br><br>  <b>/ alertsoff</b> <br>  Disable chat notifications. <br>  It works both in <i>Win7</i> (in win version via GUI settings) and in <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ alertson [text]</b> <br>  Allows you to specify the specific words or text for which notifications will be included, for example your name. <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ call [Skype_Name]</b> <br>  Judging by the description, this command should make a call. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - does not work, shows a list of commands as well as the / help command and all other commands or words in the format "/ ^ \ / ([a-zA-Z]) + $ /" that is, if the command is not known by skype, it will issue a list of "known", but as it turned out, not everyone works <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - almost does not work, the call starts to be made and immediately the status becomes Canceled.  As for the rest of the arbitrary writing "/ ^ \ / ([a-zA-Z]) + $ /" does not cause the help list - it simply displays the text entered by the user. <br><br>  <b>/ clear</b> <br>  Deletes chat history.  Cannot be undone. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - does not work. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works, but it looks like it just clears the chat window, the story is saved. <br><br>  <b>/ find [text]</b> <br>  Register independent search for the first occurrence of text in the chat. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works.  The <b>/ fa</b> command also works. <br><br>  <b>/ get banlist</b> <br>  View a list of users who are prohibited from joining the chat. <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ get allowlist</b> <br>  View a list of users who are allowed to join the chat. <br>  I believe that this is an inverse form of a ban list, that is, everything that is not allowed is prohibited. <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ get creator</b> <br>  View information about the creator of the current chat. <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> . <br><br>  <b>/ get guidelines</b> <br>  Viewing instructions, or rather the rules for this chat, you can write something like: "in this chat is prohibited, etc.". <br>  It works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> .  It was a set parameter, and I didn‚Äôt understand how to look through this guideline. <br><br>  <b>/ get xguidelines</b> <br>  I did not find a specific description, the situation is in use as well as with the previous command. <br>  Works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> <br><br>  <b>/ get options</b> <br>  View installed options.  During the review I found only one, which is described at the end of the article. <br>  Works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> <br><br>  <b>/ get password_hint</b> <br>  View password hint, failed to install or watch. <br>  Works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> <br><br>  <b>/ get role</b> <br>  View your chat role. <br>  Works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> <br><br>  <b>/ goadmin</b> <br>  <s>Places tags next to the creators of the chat author name.</s>  <s>I did not understand and could not use it.</s> <s><br></s>  <s>original - <i>Puts a Creator tag next to the chat creator's name.</i></s> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/leonard/" class="user_link">leonard</a> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/leonard/" class="user_link">Places a</a> label (tag) "Creator" next to the name of the creator in the chat. <br><br>  <b>/ history</b> <br>  Loads the full chat history into the active window. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - does not work. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - downloads the whole story. <br><br>  <b>/ htmlhistory</b> <br>  HTML history file that should appear in the browser window. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - does not work. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> is not working. <br><br>  <b>/ info</b> <br>  Displays the number of people present and the maximum possible number of people for this chat. <br>  Unfortunately I did not know how to change the quantity, I did not find the option. <br>  Works in both <i>Win7</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> <br><br>  <b>/ kick [skype_name]</b> <br>  Removes a user from the chat. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ kickban [Skype_Name]</b> <br>  Removes the user from the chat and prevents him from returning there.  Regular users can not return the user to the chat, as well as edit the banlist. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ leave</b> <br>  Leave the chat.  Impossible if you are the creator of the chat. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works.  Even if I am a creator, I managed to leave the chat. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> is similar. <br><br>  <b>/ me</b> <br>  Displays your name in the message text, can be used for example in this case: "/ me thinks that this should be so, and not otherwise." <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ set allowlist [[+ | -] mask]</b> <br>  Sets the appropriate list of users. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ set banlist [[+ | -] mask]</b> <br>  Sets the appropriate list of users. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ set guidelines [text]</b> <br>  Sets the chat ‚Äúrules‚Äù line, which I never saw how to view without using the / get - / - commands. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ set xguidelines [text]</b> - simply did not find it, although it is strange that the reverse / get command for it exists. <br><br>  <b>/ set options</b> <br>  Sets chat options. <br>  <i>USERS_ARE_LISTENERS</i> is the only one that I know, but most likely there are more. <br>  This option prohibits all users from writing messages in this chat, but this option does not affect all users, below is a hierarchy of roles with a description.  Already managed to make fun of friends using this feature. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ set password [text]</b> <br>  Sets the chat password (spaces are not allowed). <br>  <i>Win7</i> works, but it's not clear where this password needs to be entered and to whom. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> is similar. <br><br>  <b>/ set password_hint [text]</b> <br>  Sets the password hint. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ setpassword [password] [password hint]</b> <br>  Sets the password and hint with one command. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  <b>/ setrole [Skype Name] MASTER |</b>  <b>HELPER |</b>  <b>USER |</b>  <b>LISTENER</b> <br>  Allows you to set the role of the user in the chat description of the roles below. <br><br>  <b>/ topic [text]</b> <br>  Changes the text of the chat topic. <br><br>  <b>/ whois [Skype_Name]</b> <br>  Shows all sorts of information about the user Skype_Name. <br><br>  <b>Description of chat user roles</b> <br>  <i>CREATOR</i> <br>  The member who created the chat.  There can be only one created for one chat.  Only the creator can assign the role of MASTER. <br><br>  <i>MASTER</i> <br>  The description sounds like ‚Äúchat hosts‚Äù, I believe that this is some kind of main role, something like moderators in chat, I know only limitations.  Master cannot assign other users as masters. <br><br>  <i>HELPER</i> <br>  Semi-preferred member of the chat.  These users will not be affected by the USERS_ARE_LISTENERS option.  Helpers are not allowed to change user roles. <br><br>  <i>USER</i> <br>  A regular chat user (the default role if you are not the creator) allows you to do everything that you usually do in a chat.  Also do not have the right to change the role of users (not yet verified). <br><br>  <i>LISTENER</i> <br>  A user who can read messages from the chat, but has no right to write messages to this chat. <br><br>  <i>APPLICANT</i> <br>  A user who is waiting for approval to get into the chat.  The user can not be demoted to this role if he was accepted into the chat.  (until the question is resolved, rather, this role is received by a user who has been invited by a user with a low-level role). <br><br>  In conclusion, I can say that I will not use all these commands, but it was interesting to meet you and I will definitely put something into service.  Judging by the differences in the reaction to commands in different versions, I can assume that evolving skype gains more graphical interface and loses the ability to execute some text commands.  Again, my suggestion is that in earlier versions of skype, support for chat teams was more kosher.  Anyway, there is still time to take advantage of this not all known functionality.  I was glad if it opened for someone something new, thank you for your attention! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> below will be updates on the topic. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alice2k/" class="user_link">alice2k</a> told: <br>  <b>/ get uri</b> <br>  Returns a link to the chat in the form of <u><i>skype:? Chat &amp; blob = smth</i></u> , with a click on which you can immediately join the chat. <br>  <i>Win7</i> - works. <br>  <i>Ubuntu</i> - works. <br><br>  Thank you, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/almalexa/" class="user_link">almalexa</a> , for the hint.  The following options are still possible to use: <br><br>  <i>JOINING_ENABLED</i> - When disabled, new users cannot be added to the chat. <br><br>  <i>JOINERS_BECOME_APPLICANTS</i> - If enabled, new users will wait for confirmation to add them from the MASTERS or CREATOR group. <br><br>  <i>JOINERS_BECOME_LISTENERS</i> - If enabled, new users can only read messages but not send them. <br><br>  <i>HISTORY_DISCLOSED</i> - If disabled, new users can see messages added earlier than these users joined the chat.  Limit 400 messages or a period of 2 weeks (depending on what is achieved earlier) <br><br>  <i>TOPIC_AND_PIC_LOCKED_FOR_USERS</i> - If enabled, users cannot change the subject and image of the chat <br><br>  While it was not possible to test the Mac platform 06/30/2010.  (I think either someone from the community will help, or I will have time and opportunity) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97561/</a></p>
