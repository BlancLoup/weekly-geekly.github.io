The campus is very beautiful, one-on-one resembles the Princeton University campus from the movie "Mind Games".  In general, the French are strange people: the registration for the conference began at 8 in the morning.  Crazy time by our standards :) Because I had to wake up at 7 am. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c80/b8b/bb2/c80b8bbb2abebb6ba948eac7820e2b37.jpg" alt="image" title="Parisian morning"><br><br>  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt really imagine what exactly I want to get from this conference, rather it was a heavenly adventure.  Well, I wanted to see the development team alive, and in particular, Fabien himself. <br><br>  French razdolbaystvo - not fiction, instead of the promised 8 am registration began at 8-45.  Before that, everyone was standing and stupid in the hall of the main building. <br><br>  They gave out a badge and non-braces: a vest, a bunch of stickers, some announcements, coupons for a discount on trainings, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b28/f8b/45c/b28f8b45cf99ea65a2e01ff5e0a2afe1.jpg" alt="image" title="Hall near the conference hall"><br><br>  Behind the scenes you could eat every liver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2b/d44/bd9/f2bd44bd90b896eb0dcbc786de0b8196.jpg" alt="image" title="Programmers eat liver"><br><br>  Hall: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbc/006/284/dbc006284f84baeef43b0cb715750009.jpg" alt="image" title="Empty conference room"><br><br>  Scene: <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3loprygI/AAAAAAAADDE/QgYWKrYxUT4/s640/P1000168.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Fabien with some assistant: <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3dBBNvHI/AAAAAAAADC4/d3X03NZbtXg/s640/P1000171.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Fabien gave an introductory lecture, mostly org. Questions.  It should be noted terrible wifi in the room, the bandwidth is clearly not enough, the connection system is extremely inconvenient.  Why it was impossible to make an open grid - a mystery. <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3b9FKM-I/AAAAAAAADC0/wVlzQr4zxUQ/s640/P1000172.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The first speaker, Frenchman Thomas Rabaix, followed Fabien.  Topics: internationalization and transliteration.  Muddy report, did not tell anything about the case. <br><br>  Further, the Englishman John Cleveley talked about the use of the admin generator of the symphony, that in the current development, separately about embed forms.  The report was truly interesting to most listeners and produced success.  Separately noted the London accent of the speaker, because  by the time i'm for example tired of the french accent.  And I think I'm not alone. <br><br>  John reveals an internationalization catalog that seems to be a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D1%258B">Vulcan</a> language. <br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3a4UxbkI/AAAAAAAADCw/gs0nAdI8hSc/s640/P1000173.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In the most productive time, the guys from Microsoft came in, who said that php support was introduced in windows asure.  Most of the participants simply ignored this topic, some pointedly left the hall. <br><br>  Guys from microsoft and elePHPants :) <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3OtW768I/AAAAAAAADCU/P0x5Jlk6NlQ/s640/P1000181.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Geoffrey Bachelet spoke about the internal structure of the symphony, but the report was not popular, because there were clearly no programming noobs who already knew about the design patterns and the internal structure of their favorite framework. <br><br>  Specially wore habramayku, you never know habralyu meeting.  I did not meet, but I taught two Frenchmen and an Englishman to pronounce ‚Äúhabrahabr‚Äù :) At least some use. <br><br>  Dennis Benkert talked about migrations for the 1st branch of the doctrine.  I liked it much more than <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropelMigrationsLightPlugin">sfPropelMigrationsLightPlugin at</a> least because it automatically changes the scheme.  He promised to keep silent about the promised lime tests. <br><br>  The next report was truly a bomb.  Jonathan Wage, a leading doctrine developer, talked about the changes in the second version of the doctrine.  The hall exulted.  They removed the inheritance from the base classes, optimized the code, made it all spin 40 times faster.  Impressive result! <br><br>  Thomas Parisot showed the offline admin panel created by him using Google Gears.  As it should, she did not earn a presentation, but an impressive amount of work.  He designed it in the form of a plug-in, I will indicate the name as I recall. <br><br>  Next, a small report about the community: who to contact, how to help and so on. <br><br>  And at the end of the meeting was a live chat with the whole team.  Very sensible part of the conference, but unfortunately the hall is already tired by this time.  Fabien talked a little about symphony 2.0, but the main topic of this will be today.  It is also important to note that in the symphony the zend cache will be used, which has come to replace the symphony cache system. <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_O6hyJzeNc2M/S3r3KSN0WtI/AAAAAAAADCI/HhUEW89Uwpo/s640/P1000184.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  5 minutes ago the first topic of the second day began. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> : <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/user1491208/videos">first video</a> <br><br>  <b>upd2:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/symfony/84571/">Day two</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84522/</a></p>
