  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All-In-One Note: All Inclusive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuing the cycle of our reviews, we came to the desktop.  Already decided that most devices are end devices.  So, what we have today is a piece of hardware, a monitor and so on.  The power of the computer is almost redundant, that is, the tasks that are performed - go to the Internet, watch a movie, etc., do not need such power.  Next - all media streams become digital (television, radio, etc.), that is, they can be transmitted via the Internet. <br><br>  <i>TV + PC = Internet</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  We see that such two directions as televisions that connect to the Internet, and computers that themselves become uninteresting and boring, like a piece of hardware, and stop developing (desktop sales are falling) - they start to grow together somewhere single device.  This device is All-In-One.  In practice, this is a computer that has a mobile platform, such as a laptop, and laptops have very powerful ones.  Technologies have already advanced so that, firstly, processors and their cooling systems spend little energy, and secondly, there are already passive and noiseless ones. <br><br>  <i>Video without borders</i> <br>  Third: video cards are gradually integrated into the core (same Intel Corporation).  Someone may not have enough power for all the tasks that exist today, but for an ordinary person, she will have enough of her head.  An analogue tuner for television is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, because even here in Ukraine, it has already been announced that analogue television is being stopped.  For the poor and the poor, 350 million UAH were allocated (a line was written in the budget) for the purchase of boxes that turn an ordinary TV into the same All-In-One, since this digital stream is included and digital TV comes out of it.  It is impossible to accept terrestrial analog television.  For the computer, for All-In-One there is no such problem - you can put the program, you can put this box (to include it).  So, it has a design like a TV - it can be hung on a wall, put on legs, but at the same time it is a computer.  All the tasks that a computer performs are easily performed on such devices - the Internet, digital telephones and television, etc.

      This is a ready-made consumer device that replaces a computer, a TV and anything else.  That is, for example: take the standard situation.  A young man or teenager: you need a computer, some kind of TV is in the room.  Having bought one device, all questions are closed.  Plus, at the same time, it is upgraded as a computer, repaired as a computer, because the motherboard is there, the screen burns extremely rarely, and it changes easily, that is, it has a rather long lifespan, and therefore they are very, very actively starting to be sold. <br><br>  For example, in China today they occupy 40% of the market.  In 2011 - during the year they took 40% of the market.  This is a huge number of devices.  This is more than 500 million units.  Personals do not develop that way.  Personals didn‚Äôt develop because they were personals.  Because with them - each person thought out the algorithm of use for himself.  Here the algorithm is simple - you want to watch TV, you want to sit on Facebook, you want to collect documents, you want to Odnoklassniki, you want to play toys at all.  The question that is often asked about the All-In-One: can I put a discrete graphics card?  In principle, yes, but no.  Why?  Because a powerful graphics card when installed in a PC is needed for what?  for toys?  - so, modern games require tremendous computing power, that is, a computer assembled for modern games is not a personal computer, it is a self-made game console that has special cards.  Which costs up to $ 1000, has special cooling systems, special cases, has its own subculture, its own mice, which are configured as a weapon for each movement, special keyboards, where there is a speed of response, etc.  This is a business that is not related to PC.  By and large, you can easily connect the PlayStation, or xBox, or whatever, any game console, and play any games at your discretion, because the device has a screen diagonal from 18 to 24 inches (we offer 21 ,five).  This is the size of a good TV. <br><br>  <i>Gaming computers ‚â† PC</i> <br>  A gaming PC, we take out the brackets.  That is, it is a separate consumer group, a separate highly specialized group of goods to which we do not have a relationship.  We produce high-quality, relatively inexpensive mass product.  That is, the cost of All-In-One should be equal to the cost of an average self-assembly computer with a monitor, without laces, without anything, with higher consumer qualities.  Today we already have such devices - one of those will soon be habroobzor. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131909/</a></p>
