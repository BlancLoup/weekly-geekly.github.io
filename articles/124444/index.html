  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paymentwall adds seventy-fifth direct payment method and announces the opening of new offices in Germany and Turkey</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While several monetization platforms provided their services as a result of the Facebook Credits entry into force on July 1, 2011, Paymentwall strengthened its position in the international market by adding seventy-fifth payment method and signing agreements with new advertisers receive payments in China, Brazil and Russia.  Paymentwall also announced today that in the coming months two new offices will be opened in Germany and Turkey to provide even better service to their customers around the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CEO of Paymentwall, Inc., Onor Gandey, commented on developments in the monetization market: ‚ÄúMany companies serving the gaming industry were funded mainly by investments from venture capital firms and, to a large extent, relied on Facebook.  After the introduction of Facebook Credits, many companies were in a difficult position and gradually lost all hope of success.  As a result, developers who publish their games outside of Facebook have lost the ability to monetize virtual currency, merchandise and subscriptions, and suffer significant revenue cuts.  So now we are happy to provide our services for developers who want not only to restore, but also significantly increase the monetization of their products, to achieve the desired stability with full transparency. " <br><br>  Through one basic integration, Paymentwall provides developers with simple (two clicks) credit card processing, 75 local payment options worldwide, as well as monetization based on CPA advertising.  Paymentwall's global coverage of payment systems allows users to access local payment methods, process local credit cards, and access to local advertising offers from recognized brands.  And all this is presented in local currency, with support for the local language.  Paymentwall supports more than 50 currencies and localizes the product in 20 languages.  Some developers have reported a tenfold increase in conversion in Southeast Asia, Turkey and Brazil thanks to the Paymentwall monetization platform.  In Western Europe, such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain, by optimizing popular local payment methods, low commissions and improving ease of use, Paymentwall partners felt a 30% increase in conversion for both individual gaming sites and local social networks. networks. <br><br>  <strong>About Paymentwall</strong> <br>  Paymentwall is a new generation solution for global monetization of digital content, virtual currency, virtual goods, and subscriptions.
