      Although I am not a psychologist, however, I will try to draw some elementary conclusions from generally available theoretical materials and observations.  I urge not to skip right to the last section, otherwise the srach of the prophets Apple will be here, and the post is not about that at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I will quote compiled and partially rephrased quotes so that you can follow the train of thought. <br>  In general, there are four main levels of development of the psyche of living organisms: irritability, sensitivity (sensations), the behavior of higher animals (externally determined behavior), human consciousness (self-determining behavior).  It should be noted that each of these levels has its own stages of development. <br>  Only man possesses the highest level of development of the psyche.  But man is not born with a developed consciousness.  The formation and evolution of consciousness occurs in the process of the physiological and social development of a particular individual.  Therefore, the process of the formation of consciousness is strictly individual, due to both the peculiarities of social development and genetic predisposition (Piaget's theory). <br><br>  From the moment of the emergence and development of primitive people, their survival depended to a large extent on such a property of the psyche of the ‚Äúlower‚Äù order as sensitivity.  Sensitivity characterizes the general ability to feel.  This means that in the process of evolution, higher animals with a more developed psyche are able to obtain information about the world around them, analyze it and react to the possible impact of any surrounding objects, both biologically significant and biologically neutral.  The simplest example is when the presence of sensitivity determined survival: a person had to defend himself against the attacks of enemies and predators and, therefore, track changes in the environment. <br><br>  Centuries passed, the stone age was replaced by a bronze and then iron, and now, finally, the industrial age was replaced by the information age. <br>  During these epochs, human life, compared with primitive people, became calmer, and the number of irritants in the environment gradually decreased. <br>  It is known that if a skill or ability not to be used for a long time, it becomes dull and degraded. <br>  But the other side is also known, namely, the need to satisfy the basic needs of the psyche (not to be confused with the basic needs of a person according to Maslow).  For example, in the development of children there are so-called sensitive periods (M. Montessori), and one of the characteristics of any such period is the existence of a need, and the child must satisfy this need. <br>  A modern person living in the information age, whose working day is at the computer, has extremely reduced external irritants, but sensitivity, as a property of the psyche, has not disappeared.  And if there is a sensitivity, there is a need to satisfy it. <br><br>  <b>Information Age</b> <br><br>  I will not go deep into history, but if we talk about ‚Äúrecent‚Äù events, before the transition of mankind into the information age, people used printed materials (books and newspapers) for mass information transfer, and since people still lived in the industrial age - they somehow enough external stimuli to meet the needs of the psyche in sensations. <br><br>  Then came the TV.  I don‚Äôt know whether it was revealed as a result of special scientific research, or just empirically, but the fact is that TV, on the one hand, now allows a person to satisfy the need for sensations (even though it is a palliative), but on the other hand, more importantly - the TV is just exploiting this ancient human need for the presence of stimuli.  The TV keeps the viewer's attention, replacing frames every 3-4 seconds (I'm not talking about the frame rate). <br>  Conduct an experiment: try to hold on and not take a single glance at the working TV screen. <br><br>  The Internet has appeared, more precisely - web-pages.  At first, they were static, read-only, so to speak, because only certain people, with appropriate knowledge and skills, could create pages and fill them with content.  And it was an analogue of newspapers, only in a more beautiful and digital form.  But, since such ‚Äúnewspapers‚Äù could not satisfy the need for the constant presence of an irritant, the mass consumer of content still watched TV.  Around the same time, various Internet messengers began to appear, and perhaps one of the first was ICQ (ICQ).  It is impossible not to notice the blinking daisy in the corner of the screen, especially - if it is also accompanied by a corresponding sound.  But it was just a one-on-one chat, and not something group and massive. <br>  Internet pages of this period are called WEB 1.0. <br><br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br><br>  In this period, no one could generate enough content for the mass consumer to stick to the screen in the hope of satisfying the need for sensations. <br>  But technologies have evolved, blogs, wikis and social networks have appeared, and now we need to constantly check what's new on Facebook, who likes what, who is friends with and generally what's wrong on the Internet.  Push-notifications from various programs, social networks clients and mail clients fall on our smartphones.  Users now generate content themselves, no matter how good or bad, and the important thing is that the mass consumer has now made an unconscious choice between the TV and the computer in favor of the latter.  Welcome to Web 2.0 <br><br>  <b>Where is the money?</b> <br><br>  There are a lot of social networks and blogs, powerful servers are used to ensure their efficiency, a huge amount of traffic is paid for, technicians are hired - so where does the money come from?  From advertising, of course (in fact, not a secret).  If to compare with the TV, then there was a one-way connection - the audience was given an advertisement and they went and bought (or did not buy) the goods.  And in Web 2.0, users generate content, and they are shown advertisements for this, which, according to advertisers, based on the content created (and discussed) by the user, should interest them and encourage them to buy. <br><br>  <b>Web 3.0</b> <br><br>  But I was distracted, I wanted to write about what Web 3.0 will be, and no matter how it will be called. <br>  Web 2.0 now exists on computers, tablets, smartphones.  People always have some kind of device at hand, and from the side of advertisers this is a very good result.  But not perfect! <br>  A person may be busy with something (for example, washing dishes) and not hearing how a push-notification has come to him, a person can leave a smartphone in another room, or even accidentally go outside without him.  And at this time, it turns out, does not consume and does not create content!  So, you need to make such a device that would be smaller than a smartphone, and be sure to mount on the person and allow to consume and generate content. <br>  Yes, we already know about these devices. <br>  These are google glass glasses and smart watches. <br>  It's funny that Eyephone from Futurama made google (and the trend was felt by a person who was far from IT). <br>  Google glass is a cool device, but it is expensive. <br>  Nobody knows what exactly Apple will do, but I am sure that it should be a device that fits into the concept of Web 3.0, and, apparently, it will be a watch. <br>  Predicting anything about Apple is a thankless task, but I will still say a few words. <br>  The delay with the clock, I think, is caused not by technological problems, but by research - how far a person is ready to let this kind of toy into his private life.  Well, in addition, Apple did a great job - they forced all the other market players to make their models of smart watches, and now they have the opportunity to study the reviews.  But, as always, this is a double-edged sword - now they will have to do something extraordinary. <br><br>  Anyway, whatever the devices, they will allow the person to be even closer to the content.  And you can say otherwise - they will allow you to more firmly tie a person to the content. <br>  Why these new devices will be successful - because a person has a need, and he wants to satisfy it.  This is not Google and Apple has come up with new types of interaction, they just simply felt for this need.  A person will receive and consume content instantly, almost at the moment of occurrence.  The clock will vibrate, squeak, offer something to read, show that in the evening the temperature will drop by 1 degree, notify about new SMS, email, personal messages and social networks in general, will perform their function - annoying.  Google glass is doing the same thing - only there is a visual irritant added. <br>  In the opposite direction, these wearable devices will be able to transmit photos, video and audio, parameters of the vital activity of the organism (I don‚Äôt remember in which story there was a greeting ‚ÄúTell your life parameters?‚Äù). <br>  That is, the content will increase.  And developers, apparently, should keep this in mind. <br><br>  But will we be happier with this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209000/</a></p>
