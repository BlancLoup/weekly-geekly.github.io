You can get free coffee if you have money on the Jonathan Stark card.  You can find out if there are any funds on the account, following the latest tweets of the project ( <a href="http://twitter.com/">@jonathanscard</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/27809d5b/24f32166/a77fbf8e/e7666e77.png"><br><br><h4>  Where did Jonathan Stark get so much money? </h4><br>  <b>The answer</b> : nowhere. <br><br>  The fact is that the whole experiment is built on the principle of ‚Äútook the ruble - leave the ruble‚Äù (in this case, ‚Äútook the coffee - served coffee‚Äù).  The map is replenished with volunteers, and, as you can see, there are any - there are already 2116 messages about the operations in the twitter account.  Instructions on how to fill up the card is <a href="http://jonathanstark.com/card/">here</a> . <br><br>  The author also invites developers to join the project by implementing their own ideas, using data on the movement of funds on the account, which can be obtained using the <a href="http://jonathanstark.com/card/">API</a> . <br><br><h4>  Was there Jonathan? </h4><br>  Jonathan definitely was!  This is not the point. <br>  Since the launch of the experiment, the Starbucks brand‚Äôs popularity and discourse has grown noticeably: every discussion of the Jonathan card is accompanied by a debate, is the coffee company really not involved in what is happening? <br><br>  On the page of the card, the ‚Äúexperimenter‚Äù twice denies its cooperation with the company: <br>  "For the record, Jonathan's Card, Jonathan Stark (me), this site, or anything else is not affiliated with Starbucks." <br>  "This site is totally not affiliated with Starbucks." <br><br>  Should I believe the bare statements?  The network has a lot of investigations of what is happening. <br>  The first thing that is alarming for ‚Äúdetectives‚Äù (as the voluntary investigators are called) is that the concept of the Jonathan Card is very similar to one of the Starbucks marketing campaigns conducted <a href="http://www.coffeestrategies.com/2007/12/20/to-serve-free-coffee-its-a-coupon">earlier</a> .  The campaign was built on the same principles: fabricated history, the use of people's passion for freebies. <br><br>  Further.  In the blog of one of the "detectives", some users tried to refute his reasoning, advising to back up the speculation with facts - the IP addresses of the advisers belong to Starbucks ( <a href="http://www.coffeestrategies.com/2007/12/20/starbucks-pr-deception-practices-intensify">IP: 199.233.178.253, sbuxhost204.starbucks.com</a> ). <br><br>  The third fact that introduces skepticism about Jonathan‚Äôs statements about his innocence: <br>  The guy works at Mobiquity Inc, which is fully affiliated with Starbucks - is engaged in behavioral modeling: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e1544d02/724c204b/7646cc43/c5aa47f3.png"><br><br>  <b>The picture was extracted from Google's search cache, as miraculously the <a href="http://mobiquityinc.com/clients/">page disappeared from</a> Mobiquity Inc.</b> <br><br>  So, even if you believe the facts that lead "detectives", I remain in the opinion that the "great evil Starbucks" had a great campaign! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : <br>  I sat down to write a post last night, the @jonathanscard account had 9400 followers, now it's 12000!  Great! <br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> <br>  I accidentally deleted during editing a note that payment by barcodes only works in the States. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126060/</a></p>
