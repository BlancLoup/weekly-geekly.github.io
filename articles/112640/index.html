  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Leak rate - what can be done with the flow of information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/z65H.jpg">  Information in our time is not just a lot, it's just a huge amount.  And, in order to do everything for everyone, you need to open a bunch of tabs in the browser, to switch furiously between them, and absorb, absorb, absorb!  But. <br><br>  There is such a simple question: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Is it really necessary?  Is it necessary?  Yes interesting.  Yes, I want to keep up with the mainstream, I want to always be aware of all the news.  This is where the main problem lies.  And to solve it, it must first be realized. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Let me give you a simple example: in</b> order to find something really good and useful in our time, it is necessary to filter out a heap of slag, to pass through tons of information.  Yes, there are convenient tools, there are news sites, rss and other delights, there is an almighty Google.  But is it worth the time spent on this result?  Most often not.  Well, you found, say, a new firmware, downloaded yourself.  And, joyfully rubbing the hands, you think: ‚ÄúWell, here it is with me, cool!  Found, downloaded!  Then, when I have time, I‚Äôll update. ‚Äù <br><br><h6>  And the time is two in the morning, I want to sleep.  And you go to sleep.  And the next day you will find a lot of things, and, God forbid, some forgotten and very urgent task will emerge.  And that's all - all things are thrown, attention is distracted to the decision of the more important! </h6><br>  And here it is time to ask a key question.  When, when will this happen?  Most often, never.  And here are scored multi-terabyte media, waiting in the wings.  And the hour does not come.  And what to do?

      There is such a thing as a focus of attention.  Those interested can google, yeah.  A bunch of books like ‚Äúhow to write a bunch of tudos and do everything on time‚Äù was written.  Planning, staging, focus, horizons ... blah blah blah.  And how many similar books have already been read?  And how much is just downloaded and ‚Äúwaiting in the wings‚Äù?  What is not funny?  So it‚Äôs not funny to me. <br><br><h4>  Therefore, I decided for myself: to do only what is important to me.  Really important.  Do not waste time.  No, I, of course, spend time.  I read news, download something, relax, watch movies, do nonsense.  But I do it consciously, not fooling myself. </h4><br>  <i>As a bonus, I will cite several useful tips that will help those who have already accumulated so much in their screw that more than one generation of descendants will have to spend more than one life to absorb the accumulated information.</i> <br><br><h2>  Tip one: </h2><br>  <strong>All you can download is to remove from the screw!</strong>  <strong>Without regrets and hesitation!</strong>  In the era of the Internet, fear of losing information is ridiculous.  I watched the movie - delete it!  A software in six months will already be completely outdated, why keep it?  It is clear that every IT person has a small archivist with all the necessary.  This is what should be limited.  No more.  No ‚Äúlater‚Äù! <br><br><h2>  Tip two: </h2><br>  <strong>Think of a system that will not allow the accumulation of trash!</strong>  If there is no good habit to immediately put everything ‚Äúwhere it is necessary‚Äù.  I do this: I put everything downloaded into a special folder, the contents of which is deleted by krone once a month.  There is enough time to understand whether it is necessary or not.  What I managed to disassemble, evaluate and leave, I put them in a special archive folder.  What did not have time - well, so dog with him.  The archive is also deleted every six months.  It is clear that there are things to which this does not apply.  Personal photo archive, for example.  Let everyone decide for himself. <br><br><h2>  And a bit more: </h2><br>  <strong>- Do what you do with full responsibility.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>- Break into stages if the task is big.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>- Do not be afraid to give work to another - it will only speed up the receipt of the result.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>- Do as well as possible.</strong> <br><br>  And the most important thing: information is, of course, the greatest value, but one should not make this cult and turn into Plyushkin. <br><br>  <b>I do not urge to immediately remove everything that has been accumulated by overworking - no!</b>  I just once again want to remind you of the uselessness and uselessness of a rather large part of what constantly accumulates among many users. <br><br><h4>  I hope that this will be beneficial and will force some people to establish a radical order not only on the screw.  Happy cleaning! </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112640/</a></p>
