      2,000 North American respondents from among the participants of GDC 2014 noted a decrease in the number of developers engaged in publishing their own projects, as well as an increase in the number of guest publishers. <br><br>  Comparing the results of 2013 and 2014, it is worth noting a 6% increase (29% against 23%) in the number of developers who used the services of third-party publishers as part of their latest projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A more modest increase of 3% (31% vs. 28%) was noted in the camp of developers who plan to use the services of the publisher to implement future projects. <br><br>  And although due to the relative insignificance of the time interval and a number of reservations, it is too early to judge the formation of a more or less specific trend, we cannot help but wonder about the growing role and importance of video game publishers. <br><br>  Literally during the year between the two polls, the video game market almost exploded.  As already reported last year, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217675/More_games_have_released_on_Steam_so_far_in_2014_than_all_of_last_year.php">in the period from January to May 2014, more games were released</a> than in the whole of 2013 as a whole.  Mobile app stores are literally bursting at the seams, dragging the growing digital distribution market, targeting next-generation consoles. <br><br>  Developers are aware that they can release games on their own.  However, they also realize that in recent years the market has been literally flooded with new games. <br><br>  Publishers (again?) Held in high esteem. <br><br>  Game industry veteran Mike Wilson, whose Devolver Digital company has worked on publishing such indie projects like <em>Hotline Miami, Luftrausers and The Talos Principle,</em> claims that video game publishers have always played an important role in the market, just recently they have lost some influence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a95/7f3/238/a957f3238ece9db174952efceefbf586.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <strong><em>Road not taken</em></strong> <br><br>  ‚ÄúPublishers have always played an important role.  The problem is that they have often seriously overestimated their influence on the market, ‚Äùsaid Wilson.  "Most of the developers we work with do not even realize that they need a publisher ... However, in an open and balanced business relationship based on mutual respect and trust, it makes sense." <br><br>  Devolver is positioning itself as a publisher of indie games, not only because it publishes games from indie developers, but also because it deals with the same low overheads.  To be successful, it does not need to sell millions of copies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis model cannot be perceived if we consider it from the point of view of an overly bloated company that makes money from publishing, guided by the principle‚Äú who pays, he orders music, ‚Äùsaid Wilson. <br><br>  Chris Harris, one of the oldest video game developers, founder of the Positech individual enterprise.  He developed and published such games as <em>Democracy</em> and <em>Gratuitous Space Battles,</em> but recently switched to publishing indie projects, the first of which was the <em>Redshirt</em> game from Tiniest Shark. <br><br>  It should be noted, however, that the surge in its publishing activity at Positech is associated with the promotion of its own services.  He also said that ‚Äúcompared to previous years, an increasing number of developers are turning to indie project publishers for help.‚Äù <br><br>  Harris remarked that the position of publishers had noticeably strengthened following the rapid growth of the video game market.  ‚ÄúThe main problem of indie projects is their recognition and availability on the market.  Previously, it was all about financing and competent marketing, now the main task is to attract the target audience, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost novice developers have a poor understanding of marketing and advertising.  In addition, they have heard about the sad experience of colleagues whose games remain unclaimed among gamers. ‚Äù <br><br>  Studio Vlambeer, being the brainchild of Rami Ismail and independently publishing such games as <em>Ridiculous Fishing</em> , also used the services of the publishing company Devolver, for example, when working on the project <em>Luftrausers.</em> <br><br>  Being a sophisticated indie developer, Ismail notes an increase in the number of publishers in the industry, but he is not sure that this is necessary. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe problem of accessibility and recognition lies in the fact that today there are many more games released than before,‚Äù he said.  Attracting publishers will not allow "magically" to solve the problem of overcrowding in the video game market.  "Despite the fact that publishers help smooth out some corners, they, in fact, occupy the same niche that we - the developers." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69c/a49/625/69ca49625c47791fc34eb6a41422eb50.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <strong><em>The talos principlele</em></strong> <br><br>  The choice to work alone or in a pair with a publisher, ultimately, depends on what services the developer needs to successfully promote their product on the market.  It is necessary to carefully weigh the pros and cons and determine whether it is worth sharing the profit with the publisher. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI still believe that unique and high-quality projects do not need the involvement of third parties for their promotion in the market,‚Äù says Ismail. <br><br>  Anyway, the unequivocal answer to the question ‚ÄúDo I need a publisher?‚Äù Does not exist. <br><br>  "It is reasonable to note that today it is more difficult for developers to publish their own games ... Two years (and even more than four years ago) it was much easier," says David Edery, a venerable representative of the gaming industry and CEO of Spry Fox, the developer of the game <em>Road Not. Taken.</em>  His studio was engaged in both independent publishing of games, and cooperation with publishers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe need to attract a publisher is still dependent on the specific situation,‚Äù he adds.  ‚ÄúDespite the growing competition from mobile applications, developers of compact, original and well-thought-out projects without claims to huge profits may well do without the services of the publisher.  Much more important here is a good relationship with Apple and Google. ‚Äù <br><br>  For Edery, the need for a publisher is primarily related to the scope of potential risks.  ‚ÄúIn projects with a high risk / reward ratio, it‚Äôs better to resort to the help of the publisher.  This will create a financial safety cushion, analyze the project, get competent advice on the development, as well as increase revenue by attracting the target audience.  Projects with a low risk / reward ratio may not require the help of a publisher. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375769/</a></p>
