Very soon, it will quickly become clogged in the form of dust into the air ducts, cover the antennas and get where it is possible and impossible. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Tower </h3><br>  The region has rather high groundwater.  In addition, the tower can flood during high water, it is always under strong wind, there are a lot of other factors.  You need a solid foundation that will not move with the sand on the surface.  Therefore, we hammer piles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb4/07e/b00/bb407eb0077041a1a1aee069d33401fe.jpeg"><br><br>  Bottles are here to not stumble by chance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/239/45a/9ab/23945a9ab6f14b73ac031fbfafcf4c95.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/ef3/0f0/a96ef30f068447afa7846218e452e881.jpeg"><br><br>  Then comes the turn of the designer "Collect yourself a tower yourself": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d54/e52/c47/d54e52c474cf4170a8ead3ef8dbc53ec.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbf/cea/c63/dbfceac6337e4ca397d36378360b81cf.jpeg"><br><br>  It is delivered as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a93/3d0/108/a933d01088264c339e78bf7ca2b69c3a.jpeg"><br><br>  It is necessary to bury and weld just such a cell, the purpose of which you can easily guess: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/a6a/1bd/129a6a1bdb944877aa7b6d7d6a643fe3.jpeg"><br><br>  Part of the tower assembled: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfc/389/5f7/dfc3895f77a64c7f9e146898357643df.jpeg"><br><br>  The tower is assembled: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/808/e93/ad9808e9363e40c7a88350274e10aed3.jpeg"><br><br>  We install a BS container in which the base station itself, the equipment of the transport network, a reserve for power, cooling, monitoring (fire, penetration, flooding, equipment telemetry) and other devices.  Usually RRU-units are mounted on the tower.  There are no RRUs here - this can be seen from the feeder track, as well as sector mounted panel antennas and RRL antennas mounted on the tower.  Connect the power and run all the tests and voila! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d4/679/30e/0d467930e14f4f0d8263dc255efad469.jpeg"><br><br>  Perhaps already familiar to you from the previous post of BS Sazaniy angle is running. <br><br>  <b>Towers are not always like that.</b>  <b>Here is another installation - BS "Military town":</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f23/d6b/25b/f23d6b25bbbb44ccba5996473d728198.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/ec0/c7a/b8cec0c7a56245d3a0014e563607893c.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc6/f57/2b9/fc6f572b9e284ac5b90e80b09c540951.jpeg"><br><br>  But the tower, from which the kittens were removed (just in the process): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76a/72c/97d/76a72c97d8d74fb3bb11c722ee20615b.jpeg"><br><br>  That's how field mice gnaw cable.  Sometimes even before the commissioning of the position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d91/23a/c7f/d9123ac7fe2e4c39a7c7ee1522b06e2a.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is how the delivery of air conditioner with free cooling to BS Lotos during floods looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cd/d3b/c06/9cdd3bc06c9646868ff4dbec32d053f0.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Providing cellular services to a shopping center with non-standard solutions </h3><br><br>  On the roof of the shopping center "Fair", visible RRU and two sectors: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ec/88f/c05/8ec88fc05dc349fab88c8594e81524c4.jpeg"><br><br>  The main problem of modern architecture from the point of view of the signalman is the windows with aluminum powder in the glasses.  In Astrakhan there are a lot of such people, because the extreme heat (by the standards of the central regions) does not surprise anyone here.  I don‚Äôt know how about the sun, but here the radio signal on our frequencies accurately reflects and suppresses.  If you thought about foil hats, start with windows. <br><br>  The mall is usually built from pre-fabricated structures.  Simply put, inside there is a huge pile of fixtures, from which even the ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù compass deviates quite well.  And the glass through which it is very difficult to break through the signal. <br><br>  That's just such an object, and we appeared three years ago. <br><br>  To our happiness, the shopping center favorably differed a big hole inside.  It was built like a pie: the outer frame and a fairly wide space in the center for escalators, elevators and main aisles.  Most modern shopping centers in the regions are built in the same way. <br><br>  That is, we had a radio-opaque square with a hole inside.  And if it were possible to shove the signal exactly in this hole, the connection would be inside everywhere.  Well, or almost everywhere, because the walls are made of drywall. <br><br>  To begin with, it was decided to organize a standard BS deployment scheme.  It was clear that the coverage on the second and third floor would be unsatisfactory.  Therefore, we made separate sectors and connected several antennas on each floor through dividers. <br><br>  There were options to push the feeder with pin emitters like in the subway, arrange the micro-cells or stick repeaters.  But purely for practical reasons, we decided to establish additional sectors, the benefit was access to the object at the construction stage. <br><br>  But according to the calculations, the loss in the feeder on the first floor was too great, so I had to place separate RRUs directly under the ceiling <br><br>  Not far from the shopping center, we have an important transport network node, so optics were led to the building.  Next came the question of connecting subscribers to the services of wired Internet and local telephony.  Usually such TCs were connected via DSL, but here we went along the Ethernet path.  Because we understood that our subscribers in the future will need significantly higher speeds.  Then we went to the agreement: every meter of cable, every box - all this required signatures.  Engineers had to go to the position many times, just in order to understand what is being mounted to. <br><br>  Then, in the process, the concept of aisles changed: in addition to departments, ‚Äúislands‚Äù appeared, one of which was Sberbank.  They needed food (it was held in the floor), and we were able to agree immediately on laying our twisted pair.  This helped a lot, because there was no other way to get a fast connection from the ‚Äúislands‚Äù. <br><br>  Here are the sections below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/366/66f/9ec/36666f9ec4b744fc9d8b5b66a6fd7afd.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is the coolest room of the building, the server room.  The engineering staff is hiding here (our closet did not get into the frame): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83a/87b/b04/83a87bb04ff9438789655c13f420949d.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is a thermobox in which the main BS equipment is located: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08f/0a9/bc3/08f0a9bc38e0433ca7edd9a641d57281.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  At last </h3><br>  We are beautiful.  Especially after successful installation.  Here are the views from some regional BS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/91e/ad8/81091ead87254df388b93872c998b1c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd1/397/203/cd1397203540413b86931749d009af15.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/054/e5c/a45/054e5ca45aef4160b74f85293e33492e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/762/ac3/8f5762ac381e4112803228ca15f24515.jpg"><br><br>  If you want to learn more about mosquitoes, snakes, dust, wind, heat, LTE and Corbin - this is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/234441/">my first post about Astrakhan region</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234651/</a></p>
