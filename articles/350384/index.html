It is impossible to predict the attack, and some of them can be really powerful and reach 300-500 Gb / s.  In order to protect yourself from DDoS-attacks, you can use the services of specialized services.  Not all site owners know where to run if they came under attack - so I decided to put together several options in one topic. <br><br>  <i>Note: in preparation for the post used English-language materials and publications on Habr√©</i> <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Cloudflare </h2><br>  One of the most famous defensive services.  When <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/">using</a> FREE and PRO tariffs, you can count on basic protection against DDoS attacks.  For more reliable protection against attacks of levels 3, 4 and 7, you need to connect a business or corporate account. <br><br>  In Cloudflare, a fixed payment, that is, no matter how many and what levels of attacks, the client pays the same amount.  Among the clients of this service are such large companies as Nasdaq, DigitalOcean, Cisco, Salesforce and Udacity. <br><br>  Cloudflare network is represented in 102 data centers with a bandwidth of more than 10 Tbps and is able to eliminate any attacks, as well as repel <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning">DNS</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Smurf-attacks</a> .  The service also has a 24-hour emergency service, which can be addressed during an attack. <br><br><h2>  Incapsula </h2><br>  This service offers comprehensive protection against attacks of various types.  The service can run continuously or on demand and detect any attacks.  The Incapsula network consists of 32 data centers with a bandwidth of 3 Tbps.  Incapsula has a trial version for business with SSL protocol, CDN and WAF, which will protect against DDoS attacks. <br><br>  In case the attack has already been made and the account goes on for a minute, you can use the emergency service <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/under-attack-contact-us.html">Under Attack</a> . <br><br><h2>  Akamai </h2><br>  This <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/resources/ddos-protection.jsp">service is</a> one of the leaders in the field of security and CDN.  According to the statements of Akamai management, the service <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/">can cope</a> with an attack of 1.3 terabits per second. <br><br>  This service is built on Akamai‚Äôs intelligent platform and provides support around the clock.  You can protect sites from all known attacks, including encrypted traffic.  Akamai has 1300 network addresses in more than 100 countries. <br><br><h2>  Qrator </h2><br>  One of the most <a href="https://qrator.net/ru/solutions/ddos/why-qrator">famous</a> Russian anti-DDoS resources, maintains a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/qrator/">blog on Habr√©</a> .  A feature of the system is ‚Äútransparency‚Äù for legitimate users - it is detected by using intelligent filtering algorithms, without forcing you to enter a captcha or otherwise confirm your ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition, even if it is necessary to repel an attack at the application level (level 7 of the OSI model), no fine tuning of the product is required - when an attack is detected, the system will switch to the desired mode automatically. <br><br>  To enable Qrator security, you need to change the A-record of the site.  The disadvantages include the rather high cost of using the product, but the company provides an SLA (if the level of the service is not provided, it is not necessary to pay) and a free test period of seven days. <br><br><h2>  AWS Shield Advanced </h2><br>  The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/shield/">Shield</a> service is designed to protect applications running on the AWS platform.  It is free, however, for advanced protection it is worth switching to the Shield Advanced tariff.  The advanced version adds a check of the network flow and monitoring application-level traffic, protection against more attacks, blocking unwanted traffic, post-attack analysis and around-the-clock operation time. <br><br>  All of these DDoS protection services are designed for bloggers, e-commerce, small and medium businesses.  For a larger business, there are other services, with a higher level of protection and greater functionality.  Here are some of them: ARBOR, Neustar, Rackspace, Akamai, F5 Silverline and Radware networks. <br><br><h2>  King Servers Anti DDoS </h2><br>  One more Russian <a href="https://www.king-servers.com/servers/antiddos/">project</a> with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kingservers/blog/">blog on Habr√©</a> .  Since King Servers is a hosting provider, the protective tool of the company is also ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for the needs of hosting users.  Protection is provided in two options - when you rent equipment in a certain data center, it immediately falls into the filtering zone (secure hosting).  If the site in this zone is not suitable for some reason, there remains the option of remote protection, in which the company does not need to place equipment in the data center. <br><br>  The company guarantees security from SYN Flood, UDP / ICMP Flood, HTTP / HTTPS attacks, filtering dirty traffic up to 1 Tbit / s - net traffic is allocated and sent to the user's site.  Users do not need to deal with the settings themselves; this task is taken over by the round-the-clock support service, which also fulfills requests for customization of the service. <br><br><h2>  BeeThink Anti-DDoS Guardian </h2><br>  This tool <a href="http://www.beethink.com/antiddos.htm">protects</a> Windows servers from most DoS and DDoS attacks: SYN, IP flood, TCP flood, UDP flood, ICMP flood, HTTP-DDoS, level 7 attacks and many others. <br><br>  BeeThink is compatible with Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows 2016, Windows 2012, Windows 2008, Windows 2003, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Vista. <br><br>  In addition to protecting against DDoS attacks, the service real-time monitors network operations, supports various IP address formats, supports black and white sheets, searches for remote IP addresses and information about their owners.  Base fare is $ 99.95. <br><br><h2>  Sucuri </h2><br>  This service <a href="https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/ddos-protection%3Fclickid%3D1XTRVc1iWSXxS8RQB50Z2XDUUkjxuf3RjUPjy00">provides</a> protection for any sites: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, Microsoft.Net and others. <br><br>  Sucuri provides antivirus and firewall for sites with DDoS protection.  Also, the service detects and removes malware, improves the performance of sites, protects against brute-force attacks and protects against bots.  The minimum cost of a monthly rate is $ 19.88. <br><br><h2>  Cloudbric </h2><br>  This tool <a href="https://www.cloudbric.com/">works</a> with sites on all platforms.  It is very easy to use, has an intuitive interface, and its settings take three minutes - you just need to change the DNS settings.  Information about the level of protection is displayed on the work pane, which allows you to quickly identify and eliminate the threat. <br><br>  The developers guarantee protection against all cyber attacks.  Among the clients of the service are such large companies as Samsung, ING and eBay. <br><br>  The cost of use depends on the amount of traffic, so for 10 GB you have to pay $ 29, and for 100 GB $ 149.  If the amount of traffic does not exceed 4 GB, the service can be used for free. <br><br><h2>  Alibaba Anti-DDoS </h2><br>  The Chinese Internet commerce giant's service <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ddos-pro">will help</a> to cope with attacks up to 2 Tbps and supports all protocols: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS. <br><br>  The service can be used not only to protect sites hosted on Alibaba, but also hosted on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and others. <br><br>  Also, Anti-DDos Pro works around the clock and in case of problems, you can contact the support team from security experts. <br><br><h2>  Stormwall pro </h2><br>  This <a href="https://stormwall.pro/en">tool</a> protects against any levels of DDoS attacks and supports websites on Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Bitrix, Magento, PrestaShop and other CMS platforms. <br><br>  StormWall data centers are located in the USA, Russia and Europe and operate with minimal latency.  Setting up the system will take only a few minutes, and in case of difficulties, this can be done by company managers.  Any technical problem that may arise during the work will be resolved in a short time - the technical support response will have to wait no longer than 15 minutes. <br><br>  The cost of using the service depends on the number of visitors to the site.  So, for $ 69, you can protect the site with 5,000 visitors per month, and for $ 300 you can buy unlimited. <br><br><h2>  Myra </h2><br>  Myra DDoS is fully automated and <a href="https://myracloud.com/en/ddos-protection/">designed</a> to protect the site, DNS servers and web applications.  The system is suitable for all types of CMS and online stores. <br><br>  The headquarters of Myra is located in Germany, so all data is processed according to the privacy law of this country. <br><br><hr><br>  I propose to collect in the comments a more complete list of useful tools for protection against DDoS.  What services do you know? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350384/</a></p>
