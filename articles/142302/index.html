  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are friends with Thinstation 5.0 and VMWare View 5.0 client with full USB-redirect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of the year, I started trying to start a VMWare View client in Thinstation and this text is the result of my work.  This is more likely a note than a full-fledged article, as the scribbler of me is unimportant.  Who is interested - read on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prologue </h4><br>  Initially, I suffered from the VMWare View Open Client, until I realized that it basically does not support the PCoIP protocol.  After several days of searching, the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vmware-view-client/">official VMWare View client</a> was found in the ubunt repositories.  After some time I managed to finally build and run it.  At that time, it was version 1.3 (under View 5.0), which worked very well, but to my regret I was able to Tech Preview without the so-called ‚ÄúUSB port forwarding‚Äù. <br>  In an attempt to find some more information on the subject of interest to me, I first found the .deb package of VMWare View version 4.5, then version 4.6 for HP thin clients, and also came across an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/133033/">article from the</a> user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/m0ps/" class="user_link">m0ps</a> .  I tried to repeat too, but already in the Thinstation 2.5 environment with the implementation obtained earlier - I managed to launch the client.  This solution was already something working, but was not satisfied with the fact that there was no support for low-bandwidth connections, the session was torn when the connection was lost, and even little things. <br>  Another attempt was made with the official client version 1.4 from the ubunt repository, but again the client was without USB support. <br>  And here it is a long-awaited happiness: on April 13, HP releases a <a href="http://bizsupport1.austin.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp%3Flang%3Den%26cc%3Dus%26prodTypeId%3D12454%26prodSeriesId%3D3996169%26swItem%3Dvc-104231-1%26prodNameId%3D3996170%26swEnvOID%3D4030%26swLang%3D13%26taskId%3D135%26mode%3D3">software update</a> for its thin clients based on linux!  The necessary .deb package was picked out, everything was assembled in the right form in less than 15 minutes and pleased me with its full-fledged work :) <br>  And here I am, to share with you the recipe for cooking Thinstation 5.0 and VMWare View 5.0 with full USB-redirect support, which was impossible to do literally until today. <br><br><h4>  Actually, the recipe </h4><br>  In the legality of using this method, I am unsure, everything described below was done for self-study, so you do everything at your own peril and risk. <br>  I hope you already have <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/138231/">Thinstation 5.0</a> and <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/view-50/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/view-50-installation.pdf">VMWare View 5.0</a> installed and still want to get USB support in your thin clients? <br>  Then let's go: <br>  1. Download the package, unpack the contents in the directory /thinstation/ts/5.0/packages/ <br>  2. Go to the build subdirectory. <br>  3. Run the script ./dep_view5.sh. <br>  4. Add the line ‚Äúpackage vmviewpcoip‚Äù to build.conf <br>  5. Putting the image <br>  6. PROFIT! <br><br>  Some cautions about the build process: <br>  1. It is necessary to run the script (p.3) only after entering the Dev mode (./setup-chroot in the / thinstation directory) otherwise the ar command for unpacking the .deb package will not work and you will not receive a working package <br>  2. Archive with a script must be unpacked under Linux (so as not to fly right) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In case of successful completion, the dep_view.log created next to the script will be ~ 24kbyte.  Otherwise, analyze it to understand where you have a problem. <br>  And if we also correct thinstation.conf.buildtime, we get autoloading of the client after starting the thin client system.  Example: <br><br> <code>SESSION_0_TYPE=vmviewpcoip <br> SESSION_0_AUTOSTART=on <br> SESSION_0_VMVIEWPCOIP_SERVERURL=https://vmware-view5-server <br> SESSION_0_VMVIEWPCOIP_FULLSCREEN=true <br> SESSION_0_VMVIEWPCOIP_DOMAINNAME=example.com</code> <br> <br>  The resulting image is loaded on the old iron on PXE.  The end user needs only to enter his domain login + password and start working in his usual environment. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  <a href="http://ifolder.ru/29991245">The package itself</a> .  Also, the bundle left the old version of the script for collecting package version 4.6 (./dep_view4.6.sh) as a bonus and a stripping script (./clean_dep.sh). <br>  Probably, after some time, you can find it in Thinstation 5.0, which is called out of the box, as well as separately the script itself and a description of how to use it in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/%3Fgroup_id%3D80408">Thinstation mailing list</a> . <br>  I take this opportunity to say hello to wfx, tiv, Petry Roman, as well as to other foreign colleagues from the #thinstation channel, who helped me in collecting all this grief of mischief. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142302/</a></p>
