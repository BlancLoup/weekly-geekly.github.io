      Among the priority and most popular motifs among students are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ compulsory post-higher education, characteristic of some fields of activity (medicine, for example); <br>  ‚Ä¢ salary increase due to increased attractiveness as a labor resource; <br>  ‚Ä¢ advancement through the career ladder by gaining knowledge of the highest level; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the opportunity to gain access to the latest technologies and processes in research activities (for example, for microbiologists). <br><br>  Thus, the popularity of studying in a magistracy abroad is unlikely to ever be less.  Given the need for high-tech solutions in various areas of life, as well as the globalization of the world economic space, highly qualified specialists who have received a high-quality, effective education will be in demand in the labor market more and more. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#0071c5">Steps to Education</font> </h1><br>  <b>Choosing a university for graduate studies</b> <br><br>  To navigate in the options of educational institutions, where you can apply for admission to the magistracy, you should refer to the ratings.  The most influential of these are the generally recognized <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management-2014">Financial Times</a> , <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/">Shanghay Ranking</a> , <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings">QS World University Rankings</a> and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education">US News</a> . <br><br>  The best-known national rankings of higher education institutions abroad are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges">America's Best Colleges</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://mup.asu.edu/">The Top American Research Universities</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/">Maclean's University Ranking</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.studentsreview.com/college_rankings.html">SR Monthly Undergraduate College Rankings</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.researchinfosource.com/top50.shtml">Top 50 Research Universities</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx">Princeton Review College Rankings</a> . <br><br>  Each listed ranking has its own methodology for assessing educational institutions.  Criteria for scoring are taken a variety of: the level of teaching, the number of teachers, the quality of research, the percentage of students and other deductions. <br><br>  It is worth remembering that ratings are not compiled for a foreign student.  Therefore, it is imperative to learn to ‚Äúread‚Äù them with maximum benefit for themselves.  The main rule is that one should be guided in the choice not by the total number of points scored for the evaluated criteria, but by the specialties for which undergraduates are trained.  It is also worth noting that the ratings often do not include specialties that are currently in great demand, for example, ‚Äúclothing design‚Äù, ‚Äúinterior design‚Äù.  The choice of the institute, in which you would like to enter the magistracy, according to these specialties will have to be carried out according to other criteria. <br><br>  We recommend to submit not less than 3 - 5 educational institutions, due to this the likelihood of enrollment will increase, you should always have a fallback.  Of course, this list will include the university that you would like to enroll the most, but you always need to have alternative options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/956/47d/98e95647d9244757be51dfa25b92656a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  <font color="#0071c5">Entry Requirements</font> </h1><br>  In order to study abroad, it is necessary to pass tests: analytical or on the profile of the chosen specialty ( <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/chto-takoe-test-gre/">GRE</a> or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/gmat-obshchaya-informatsiya/">GMAT</a> ), knowledge of the English language ( <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/test-toefl-obshchaya-informatsiya/">TOEFL</a> or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/test-ielts-obshchaya-informatsiya/">IELTS</a> ), as well as, if necessary, pass an interview at the selected university. <br><br>  GRE and GMAT - adaptive tests in English, which are designed to assess the analytical skills of the future master or graduate MBA program.  Choosing GMAT or GRE, you should pay attention to the mathematical component of the exam.  In the first test, this section is more complex and more rigorously evaluated; in the second case, the student will need a general level of knowledge in geometry and algebra corresponding to the basic school curriculum. <br><br>  A necessary condition for admission to a foreign magistracy is a confirmed high level of knowledge of English.  For this purpose, the TOEFL and IELTS tests are used - these are international exams, which determine the level of English proficiency of candidates who are not native English speakers. <br><br>  In addition to tests, in order to enroll in a magistracy abroad, you must provide a package of documents, which consists of: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ summary; <br>  ‚Ä¢ a motivation letter answering the questions ‚ÄúWhy exactly this university?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is unique in my experience and education?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow will the chosen magistracy affect the realization of my goals?‚Äù; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 recommendations from teachers and employers, which reflect the personal qualities and abilities of the applicants to the magistracy; <br>  ‚Ä¢ a transcript of a higher education diploma with a supplement with grades (or an academic extract if the diploma is not yet in hand); <br>  ‚Ä¢ TOEFL / IELTS and GMAT / GRE certificates. <br><br>  To send the entire package of documents, you must register on the website of the selected university, fill out the application form and attach all documents. <br><br>  Please note that test results are usually sent directly by the organization that conducted the exam in electronic format. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#0071c5">Scholarships</font> </h1><br>  In order to reduce the cost of training in the magistracy abroad, you should try to get a scholarship.  They vary by source of funding.  So, allocate national, private, university scholarships.  There are also international scholarships, as well as payments provided for certain social or national groups of students. <br>  Scholarships are also distinguished by their scope.  There are those that allow you to cover the entire cost of studying abroad, and there are those that will allow you to pay only part of the course.  Scholarships that cover the entire amount of the master's degree education usually include payments for living, insurance and student meals, which is important for those who want to save money on a magistracy abroad. <br><br>  In terms of funding for education, look at the Presidential <a href="http://educationglobal.ru/">Global Education</a> program.  The program is gaining momentum, it is designed to pay for tuition (and additional expenses) of citizens of the Russian Federation admitted to leading foreign universities, subject to returning to Russia and working in the specialty within 3 years. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#0071c5">Internships</font> </h1><br>  Another reason why Russian students choose to study in a magistracy abroad is the opportunity to have an internship in a foreign company or on the basis of the university where the training takes place.  This experience is invaluable and opens up new opportunities in terms of career start and growth. <br><br>  Thus, a magistracy abroad is a new horizon in science, work, business, which you can discover for yourself, making every effort in terms of passing exams and choosing a university to get a master's degree. <br><br>  <i>There is another article in our blog that will be useful to all those who <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/7-veshhej-o-kotoryh-mne-hotelos-by-znat-pered-postupleniem-v-magistraturu-aspiranturu-za-granicej/">enroll in a magistracy</a> abroad - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/7-veshhej-o-kotoryh-mne-hotelos-by-znat-pered-postupleniem-v-magistraturu-aspiranturu-za-granicej/">‚Äú7 things I would like to know about before entering the magistracy / graduate school abroad</a> . <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/7-veshhej-o-kotoryh-mne-hotelos-by-znat-pered-postupleniem-v-magistraturu-aspiranturu-za-granicej/">‚Äù</a></i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283902/</a></p>
