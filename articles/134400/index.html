  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Higher education as an important stage of personality formation, or testing under load</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a start, a simple life example.  Childhood and deep youth, when any motivation is expressed only by the word "I want."  It is not yet supported by the knowledge and capabilities to achieve the desired goal, which, because of this, seem to be unattainable.  Adult life, when to realize almost any youthful dream (within reasonable limits) is as easy as just clicking your fingers.  Now that ‚Äúthose‚Äù goals have been achieved, they do not seem so unattainable, but the present goals are just the opposite, beyond the limits.  But as soon as we conquer a new summit, we start to get lost in bewilderment: ‚ÄúWell, why did I think earlier that this, if not impossible, is too difficult and difficult for me (!) To master it?‚Äù <br><br>  Interesting?  Wellcome under the "cat". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Needless to say, the human brain is a complex mechanism, which apparently defaults to an adequate perception of human capabilities, thereby protecting it reflexively from deep disappointment.  This so-called protection, which is laid down to us in childhood, is intended to temporarily (!) Protect the fragile person from the destructive for her, and the very painful reaction that occurs during life faults and failures.  The mechanism for removing this shell has been developed over the centuries, and the authorship belongs to natural processes that are individual in each individual society.  Therefore, it does not matter what example we will consider the development and formation of the personality.  Both in the development of the young one and in human development there are steps that are commonly called maturation.  We will go over them. <br><br>  Step one, childhood.  Parents are trying to keep us in the illusory ideal world for as long as possible, diligently hiding temporal worries from children's curiosity, protecting one and only one correct answer to all of our why: ‚ÄúIf you grow up, you will understand!‚Äù

      As we grow up, we go through the stage of street education, someone has a kindergarten stage, but the next important stage is probably to provide a school.  At school, we are hammered into a bunch of unnecessary knowledge, most of which will never come in handy in adult life.  But nevertheless, the school solves such problems as the formation of the concept of the essence of the world and answers to the part of the same children's ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.  It helps to reveal what we like and what we hate, it shows us that there is a place for injustice in the world and that evil will not always be punished.  In other words, it begins the process of removing the very protection that was mentioned at the beginning.  And so, what is worth noting, depending on many factors that help, or vice versa, interfere with the removal of this natural defense, we get a huge variation in the quality of personality formation.  This is the reason for which there will always be a category of individuals who are actually adults and developed over the years. <br><br>  Moving on.  The army and whether the university.  And the one and the second is an ideal place for further development of the personality, only the first one for many reasons works fundamentally wrong, and in this aspect, as it is now, turns into a serious test for unformed individuals.  In the absence of comprehensive facts, all military units that would allow to analyze, compare and evaluate each separately will talk about universities that are more of the same type and differ to a lesser extent, regardless of location. <br><br><h5>  What gives us a higher education? </h5><br>  Now we come to the delicate question of what gives us a higher education.  Answer me a simple question, and how did you imagine a higher education while you were still a schoolboy?  I will not try to guess, but I suppose that at that age the tower seems like some kind of special, important and complex knowledge that makes people much smarter.  Do you know where these thoughts come from?  Everything is simple, the presence of higher education is what distinguishes teachers, engineers, employees of banks, directors of enterprises and deputies of the State Duma from ourselves.  After all, we cannot know that some of them never studied at the institute, and some of them graduated from only nine classes of secondary school.  And therefore we automatically attribute to them the presence of a tower. <br><br>  For the same reason, we are eager to get a diploma and relevant knowledge that will allow us to self-actualize, but who said that the knowledge gained up to this point was relevant? <br>  But nevertheless, let's get closer to the very process of getting higher education.  Here the way of presenting information is qualitatively different from teaching at school.  There are lectures that read as if this is a regular news bulletin, but the investigation, the facts and the details will have to be found out for yourself.  And here opens the main law of higher education, which is that you yourself can choose where you need to know this minimum, and what interests you more and more.  And this is just fine, otherwise everything would be decided for us by others, which, I think, nobody wants. <br><br>  Naturally, now someone will have an objection: "If I chose the profession of economist, then I want to be taught to understand the economy."  But only in reality, everything is a little different.  There is minimal and stable knowledge on which everything else is built.  And there is a category of recent advances in a particular area.  All that is between them is a temporary information field, the relevance of which is changing so quickly that it makes no sense to prepare people who will teach him.  The study of this part of the information is always assigned to those who really need it. <br>  And now about the relevance of knowledge that gives higher education.  The fact is that the depth of this knowledge eliminates the need for their 100% relevance.  Any programmer or coder will smile at the complexity of those labs that students do in html, c ++, Delphi, MATLAB, and so on.  And with other items as well.  In fact, if you stop deceiving yourself and confess to yourself wholeheartedly, then real learning of what allows you to pass a session without any problems does not take as much time as we imagine.  And in fact, time for self-development is more than enough. <br><br>  If absolutely frankly, then at university you have much more time to learn important and necessary things than in real life.  If students read this article, then I would like to emphasize: if now studying at that university minimum takes you a lot of strength and energy, if under this load you are not able to engage in self-development and self-study of what you really want to do in this life, say , please, how will you manage to do this by getting a job?  Perhaps I‚Äôll disappoint someone, but if you don‚Äôt find time to work on yourself in a university, then a few years after graduation you suddenly notice that you are hopelessly behind the times. <br><br>  Everyone probably knows, every teacher likes to emphasize the fact that the university does not provide knowledge, and he teaches them to receive.  So, this is really a correct dictum, and it is worthy for the teachers to speak it to their students more often. <br><br>  On this, perhaps, I will finish, since the writing of the publication took more time than I expected, but I hope that I answered some of the questions that the young student brain worries from time to time.  Thank you all for your attention, the continuation is not excluded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134400/</a></p>
