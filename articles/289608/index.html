To convert visitors to customers, they must first be attracted.  Therefore, we open a cycle of posts about high-quality channels to attract leads.  Let's start with shareware - with search engine promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/576/192/94b/57619294ba8d4b248b818186ba142c5a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Search traffic is still the most cost-effective sales channel for many sites.  If you plan to use it for a new project - read the recommendations of experts on promotion.  We learned from them the most significant mistakes, because of which the young project risks falling out of favor with users and search engines.

It is not right.  The page optimally advances in 1-2 requests, no more. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5a/632/b49/c5a632b499be4f0497a7aa0c71e1a817.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Dmitry Shakhov</b> <br>  Director of the group of companies "Remarque" <br>  <a href="http://remarka.info/">remarka.info</a> <br>  Dmitry succinctly gave us the following facts: <br><ul><li>  The most common mistake of the owner of the site - an unsuccessful structure of landing pages. </li><li>  The most common mistake of a developer is hard packing of the site elements.  This makes it difficult to quickly change the structure and modify the resource with ‚Äúlittle blood‚Äù. </li><li>  The third most common mistake - the reluctance to change anything on the site.  After all, "he had been torturing himself for too long, and we do not have the strength, time, money and desire to change something." </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a6/d9e/e51/2a6d9ee51e454c57bd9265a0ab94c76e.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Alexey Panshin</b> <br>  General Director of Panshin Group <br>  <a href="http://apanshin.ru/">apanshin.ru</a> <br>  Alexey succinctly noted the most common mistakes: <br><ul><li>  Imperfection of the layout of the site: disability, lack of development, the lack of technical "buns" (bread crumbs, micro markings, etc.). </li><li>  Unreasonable sites: errors in logic when building a structure, lack of usability, selling elements, etc. </li><li>  Lack of or low quality content. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e4/0fd/031/1e40fd031e1b45ceaad13107055f8a18.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Expert site analysis Siteclinic</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.siteclinic.ru/">www.siteclinic.ru</a> <br>  The most common mistakes in the promotion of new sites: <br><ul><li>  Incorrect distribution of requests by pages. </li><li>  Hurry with the purchase of links. </li><li>  Technical errors. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de4/477/fdf/de4477fdffc8431ca66f20080bc7f30d.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Mikhail Tuknov</b> <br>  Founder of the online marketing agency Infatex.com <br>  <a href="http://www.infatex.com/">www.infatex.com</a> <br>  Michael commented on the main mistakes on the promotion: <br><ul><li>  Website owners expect instant results from SEO.  Search engines take into account the history of the resource, but not yet.  You need to start marketing with PPC.  After 2-3 months, search engines begin to take into account behavioral factors.  We recommend to install Google Analytics and Yandex Metric. </li><li>  The hunt for quick links.  Many site owners are impatient and want to quickly get the fruits for their work, return and increase funds.  They are trying to get as many links as possible.  They do not care that the links may not be of high quality.  In addition, the rate of growth of the reference mass is taken into account by search engine algorithms.  You can not chase the number.  Links must be of high quality.  Everything should be done gradually and naturally, without arousing suspicion on the part of search engines.  Link quality is measured by how often it links to your site. </li><li>  Many project owners and webmasters do not see the picture as a whole.  They create a site, focusing on search engines, not realizing that this is only a tool (intermediary) between the site and the user (potential buyer).  Conducting resource optimization and the use of dark methods of promotion does not carry anything of value for the interests and convenience of the user on the site.  At the same time, resource owners forget to add useful articles, videos, auxiliary elements.  But it is the content that allows the user to get the necessary information.  And there is a mistake here too.  There is a savings in content: it is copied from other sites and do not think about why search engines should rank the new resource above that from which they have just borrowed content.  SEO is a complex and time-consuming work.  There are no quick tricks.  This is real marketing, these are not toys. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/4d2/527/e134d2527f0140d3a4a0b349eac77cfa.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Dmitry Udimov</b> <br>  CEO Topvizor <br>  <a href="https://topvisor.ru/">topvisor.ru</a> <br>  Dmitry draws attention to the lack of proper analysis and control over such parameters: <br><ul><li>  Position and traffic dynamics. </li><li>  Outbound links and site changes. </li><li>  The uniqueness of the texts. </li><li>  Server errors </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c94/89f/747/c9489f7473b640fea2d938466bc6a1bb.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Ilya Rusakov</b> <br>  The owner of the studio online advertising Im-pulse.pro <br>  Posted by <a href="http://seoinsoul.ru/">seoinsoul.ru</a> <br>  Ilya pointed out the following main errors: <br><ul><li>  Work only on external factors.  Now you can not make the site somehow and pull it links, as practiced earlier.  It is necessary to work on internal optimization, which gives good results without external factors. </li><li>  Creating an information page for commercial requests.  According to the old memory for most groups of requests, people create landing pages in the form of an article of 2-3 thousand characters.  In this case, do not pay attention to commercial factors, but in vain.  Often for some requests it is enough to specify the list, prices and all.  Put yourself in the user's place.  Imagine what you want to see on the page, as well as analyze the resources of competitors from TOP. </li><li>  The age of the new site is a deterrent to promotion.  But it is not taken into account, starting aggressively promoting a resource in anticipation of a quick effect. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/968/0e7/99f9680e7acc408880096f2611781d79.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Kirill Lakimanov</b> <br>  Author of popular SEO blog <a href="http://www.lucky-seo.com/">www.lucky-seo.com</a> <br>  Kirill pointed out the main optimizer errors: <br><ul><li>  Quick and aggressive purchase links to the young site. </li><li>  Lack of structure and full number of landing pages. </li><li>  Self-reliance and hope only on ‚Äúverified‚Äù payment schemes for entering the TOP.  That is, they checked TOP-10, analyzed the text parameters, title, the number of external links from competitors ... They did everything the same way or even better, but there is no TOP.  Modern SEO is increasingly moving away from the "language of numbers": you must first focus on the user.  At the same time, one should not forget about social networks and attracting traffic from thematic resources. </li></ul><br>  Webmasters are also wrong: <br><ul><li>  They think their site is the best, so they don‚Äôt want to change anything and follow the advice of the optimizer. </li><li>  They are missing technical issues: they forget to set up robots.txt, check for duplicates of the site, the main and internal pages, do not indicate the main mirror. </li><li>  They ‚Äúoverload‚Äù the site with ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù attributes: call buttons, online consultants, a bunch of social buttons in unnecessary places. </li></ul><br><hr> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d79/663/5e6/d796635e66ca48b1aca627e6f1af3e33.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>George Ivanov</b> <br>  The author of the popular SEO-blog <a href="http://zenpr.ru/">zenpr.ru</a> <br>  Georgy noted three fundamental mistakes: <br><ul><li>  Believing in% seoguruname% as your savior.  SEO for webmasters has become a belief system.  Plus, the ‚Äúrotten info‚Äù of many years ago is also worthless. </li><li>  Brain overload information.  There are webmasters who read rubbish on blogs and forums for years.  He gives no benefit, only harm.  They themselves complicate things, and then they are afraid to work.  Hence the results ... </li><li>  Few really work properly with keywords.  Search for "fat" keywords - this is 90% of the success of the site. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/968/0e7/99f9680e7acc408880096f2611781d79.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Sergey Shelvin</b> <br>  The author of the popular SEO blog <a href="http://shelvin.ru/">shelvin.ru</a> <br>  Sergey points out such promotion errors: <br><ul><li>  The created resource completely repeats the already existing site without any innovations and differences.  In the case of content, not only its uniqueness in anti-plagiarism is necessary, but also originality in meaning. </li><li>  The lack of stability in the performance and updating of the site.  For example, hosting is constantly falling, and the materials are published, then no. </li><li>  Social promotion is not used.  Sometimes they even forget to put buttons on VKontakte and Twitter so that people can easily share the content they like. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/388/f72/69c/388f7269c7ba4e9f9ae275ffb8af2216.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Rashad Bakirov</b> <br>  Development Manager megamind.ru <br>  <a href="http://rashad.su/">rashad.su</a> <br>  Major errors: <br><ul><li>  Not thought out site structure.  Pages are created in a chaotic manner with the hope of correcting in the future.  And such changes cause problems with redirects and new url. </li><li>  When designing the site does not take into account the requirements of search engines.  Therefore, often have to create "crutches". </li><li>  Too much focus on the promotion, which "should" replace the problems with the lack of quality content and service.  If you do not have them, then there is nothing to promote. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/968/0e7/99f9680e7acc408880096f2611781d79.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Igor</b> @altblog <br>  The author of the popular SEO blog <a href="http://altblog.ru/">altblog.ru</a> <br>  Promotional errors: <br><ul><li>  Initially low quality articles.  Cheap articles are used from the principle that ‚Äúthere will be no one to read them, and when there are many visitors, then we will publish high-quality texts‚Äù.  The same applies to design.  Therefore, we must immediately do everything qualitatively. </li><li>  Wrong selection of semantic core.  Emphasis is placed on the most popular requests for which the new site is difficult to take a leading position. </li><li>  Insufficient budget for advertising. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4eb/f7a/8a1/4ebf7a8a16e0453e8a0567f535223943.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Igor Bromot</b> <br>  The author of the popular SEO blog <a href="http://www.2millionera.com/">www.2millionera.com</a> <br>  The most important thing that hinders the promotion of new sites is the lack of high-quality content or re-optimization: <br><ul><li>  The lack of quality content - web studio makes the design, and the customer, mentally counting millions from sales, is in a hurry to fill the online store with photos of the goods.  They are taken from other sites, without descriptions, they &lt;price&gt; price and wait for when they start to buy.  It takes a week / month / half a year and the site owner somehow understands that just the fact that the online store is present on the network is not enough for potential buyers to know about it.  Here begins the search for the optimizer ... </li><li>  Re-optimization is also a common problem.  Get &lt;turnkey website cheaper&gt; - the dream of any inexperienced user.  Often, this approach translates into the more or less strained design and texts of the type: &lt;Somehow the SEO specialist comes in a bar, restaurant, buy alcoholic beverages, clubs, the best bars in Moscow, order a banquet in a restaurant&gt;.  This has to be redone.  And often it costs money, for which the client could make another site.  But the most valuable resource that is lost is time.  That it allows you to gain an advantage over competitors ... </li><li>  The skill level and integrity of SEO-specialists.  Sadly, many are still in 2005.  I still observe how some &lt;specialists&gt; strictly require you to write anchors to links like &lt;buy water towers Moscow&gt;.  As for the integrity of SEO-specialists, somehow I found that SEO-studio trades links on customer sites.  Yes, it was like that.  When I pointed it out to them - the ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù, to put it mildly, lingered :). </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cb/801/81c/0cb80181c4744278bc63d4535b8bb4a5.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Sergey Sosnovsky</b> <br>  The author of a popular SEO blog <br>  <a href="http://sosnovskij.ru/">sosnovskij.ru</a> <br>  Sergey pointed out such errors: <br><ul><li>  The emphasis is on external advancement, not on internal optimization.  Some site owners are looking for a panacea in the purchase of links, cheating behavioral factors, social signals.  But for a young project, competent internal optimization is more important. </li><li>  All at once.  Here is a re-optimization.  Frequent use of keywords on the page, highlighting in bold (strong), spam constructs in the title tag and subtitles.  Excessively wanting to help the resource, it is easy to overreact in optimizing the site. </li><li>  Use of various runs, registrations in catalogs and so on.  If the manual registration in a couple of dozens of high-quality directories will still make some sense, then the flow of this business is better not to put. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/825/8e8/ab3/8258e8ab3b6b4703bc9cb6c90f769aa3.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Sergey Koksharov</b> <br>  Author of the most popular SEO blog <a href="http://devaka.ru/">devaka.ru</a> <br>  The most frequent mistakes in the promotion of new sites: <br><ul><li>  The release of the unfinished version of the site, when they didn‚Äôt really perform the tests, when a bunch of broken links ‚Äúget out‚Äù and multiply duplicates.  The idea that we first launch, and then we will understand what to leave, what to delete, what to redo or optimize, leads to a great waste of time and resources. </li><li>  Any kinds of markups (links, texts or clicks).  The whiter the site and methods of its advancement in the first months, the more likely it will be to have a good perspective.  Search engines do not like abrupt changes in signals or lack of correlation between different signals. </li><li>  The lack of a common strategy for the development of the site.  Many popular resources reach the traffic ceiling only because they no longer know what else to implement ... If a young website does not have a development plan (content, improvement, optimization), then its ceiling will come at an early stage. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br>  <b>Given the importance of texts for the site, we have compiled a minimum checklist for determining their quality.</b> <br><br>  First of all, the article should have been a complete response to the user's request.  If a paragraph is deleted, and the essence of the text does not change from this - it means you need to throw it away.  Squeeze the "water".  If the article ‚Äúhow to make a roof with your own hands‚Äù does not allow the user to realize this, then the value of such a ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù is not high. <br><br>  In addition to the benefits of the text, which the user needs in the first place, there is also the simplicity of perception of the material.  How to provide it?  In order not to be mistaken in the quality of texts, check them for these requirements: <br><ol><li>  In two adjacent sentences there should not be repeated words.  The so-called lexical repetitions.  This is not to mention one sentence!  A simple example.  If the text is about "promotion" - this does not mean that in every sentence there should be the word "promotion".  When it occasionally slips or is needed within the meaning, this is permissible.  But pretty often you can't do that.  From here also notorious "nausea" undertakes. </li><li>  We avoid the words ‚Äúpractically,‚Äù ‚Äúvery,‚Äù ‚Äúenough,‚Äù ‚Äúown, own, own.‚Äù  The word "may" also try not to use.  After all, it may or may not be.  Only specifics and facts! </li><li>  Avoid stumbling and passive voice.  Can not "make the design, and the floor to be repaired," only "people make the design or repair the ceiling."  Yes, only experts will bring the site to the top of search engines :) </li></ol><br><br>  The list of requirements and rules is easy to issue on several pages: about weeds in the text, proper structuring, short sentences and paragraphs, subtitles and bulleted lists ... But this is a topic for a separate publication. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  To get high-quality free traffic from search engines, you can not make mistakes, which are pointed out by experts.  It is necessary to initially create high-quality sites with good content, design, usability and the right semantic core.  It can not be postponed until later.  But first of all think about the users, not about the search engines.  This is a guarantee of stable organic traffic and a direct increase in site conversion. <br><br>  <b><i>What were your mistakes that prevented you from receiving search traffic?</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289608/</a></p>
