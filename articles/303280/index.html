  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reasons for leaving Amazon, Northrop Grumman, Salesforce offline server farms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Accidents, even in the most reliable data centers, occur regularly.  As a rule, owners of server farms are very reluctant to share this information.  According to statistics, the average size of expenses due to downtime on server farms only grows, the figure increased by 41% compared with 2010, now the amount of costs is almost $ 8,000 per minute (report of research companies Ponemon Institute and Emerson Network Power).  Lost money, the image of companies hurt, reputation tarnished, because the reliability of the computing infrastructure of the company - the first indicator of high technology of the same company.  But as practice shows, no one is immune from accidents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43f/26d/037/43f26d03702e493f96c44e8bd0d2056b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Data Center Northrop Grumman </h3><br>  At the end of May, almost 60 state organizations in Virginia (USA) could not reach their IT systems for several hours.  It was caused by the shutdown of the local server farm, which is owned by Northrop Grumman (data center in Chester). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfd/09c/3cd/dfd09c3cd4584370b21871a54c48e293.png">

      A faulty network switch that caused a power outage is the cause of 5 hour downtime.  The problem was eliminated by replacing the faulty equipment with a backup from the test site.  The exit from the switch operation led to the disconnection of outgoing and incoming traffic within the framework of the information technology infrastructure of the executive authorities.  All this further aggravated the already difficult relationship between Northrop Grumman and the authorities.  Not so long ago, there was an initiative to terminate the contract for the provision of IT services by Northrop Grumman.  This contract was signed 10 years ago for a total of $ 2.3 billion. <br><br><h3>  Amazon </h3><br>  Last week, the official web site of Amazon Web Services (AWS) published an apology for the downtime that had occurred, which had led to the inaccessibility of many sites.  AWS client sites were offline, including news resources, streaming media content and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/083/76b/7e6/08376b7e65a8427c9fd17360c6f0ee47.png"><br><br>  The reason was the emergency power outage due to a large storm that hit the south-east coast of Australia.  Offline cloud server farm in Sydney.  Storm has become one of the most powerful this year.  The stormy wind, heavy rain and flooding patted New South Wales, the elements caused interruptions in public transport, streets were flooded.  Nearly 9 thousand houses in Sydney, Central Coast were left without electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/3a8/3f0/9403a83f0cd04603b3bf075c176363ac.png"><br><br>  It took less than two hours to troubleshoot the data center.  Australia is characterized by such extreme weather conditions, it is not rare that this causes server farms to go offline. <br><br><h3>  Salesforce </h3><br>  The server farm of the cloud giant Salesforce in the city of Washington (DC) went offline for almost a day.  This American company was founded back in March 1999, with headquarters located in San Francisco, regional in 25 countries around the world.  Initially, the company specialized in CRM-systems. <br><br>  The reason is considered a short-term power outage due to the failure of the circuit breaker, which led to the manifestation of a previously unknown firmware bug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b3/9b6/d14/9b39b6d1458046329ff9e446bcf870c4.png"><br><br>  Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, apologized to customers via Twitter.  I apologized for the damage, promising that if something like this happens in the future, the problem will be fixed much faster. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303280/</a></p>
