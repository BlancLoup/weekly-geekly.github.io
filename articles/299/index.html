  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five ways to increase productivity.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At first, I thought it would be just a translation of one <a href="http://skwpspace.com/2006/10/03/five-ways-to-get-insane-productivity-boosts/">very funny text</a> .  But it turned out that he was very bad, therefore only theses were left from him. <br><br>  Let's immediately agree - these tips are mainly for programmers, and, let's say, very technical people.  Let us ask ourselves what is ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù?  I do not know about you, but I put a very simple meaning in this word.  A person is productive when he performs the actions he needs with minimum effort for himself and maximum return for others.  In the case of a programmer, an ideal person is a person who easily and naturally writes good code in minimal time.  Enough words - here are some tips: <br><br>  1. Never look for the eyes, use the search functions.  Always, always use search if you type quickly.  A good example is opening a file in the editor.  Use search or compl (depending on the editor) and you will see how much faster it is.  The same applies to choosing a taba / buffer, if the editor does not allow you to go to the required buffer - throw it out, otherwise see item 4. The ideal editor works like this - press a button (in my case, Ctrl-X + b) and enter the first in the input line several letters open in another tab file.  We finish everything by pressing tab and enter.  This way I switch the open buffer in 0.2 seconds.  With the mouse and eyes, I switch it in 1.4 seconds.  Which leads us to the next item.

      2. Do not repeat anything more than 10 times.  This critical number is different for everyone, for me it is exactly ten.  Automate.  More.  More often, but not carried away by globalism.  And not only in the code, in the editor, in the environment, but also in life.  Need to break 20 chicken eggs?  Make a box with holes and cut off the sharp part of the egg.  11 times to write trigrammaton on the fence?  Make a template and buy paint with paint.  Do not forget that keyboard shortcuts are in almost all software.  Every time you take your hands off the keyboard, you lose time. <br><br>  3. Learn scripting languages.  Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, Javascript, CMD, VBasic.  Just grab the one that is closer to you and write-write-write.  It is clear that it is easy to choose if you are working in windows - for you only CMD and VBasic.  Unixoids are available a little more, I think this is one of the reasons why geeks are so actively transplanted to Linux.  I know that learning is not easy - but necessary.  There is one strange recipe - try to work from the console for 2-3 weeks.  No, you do not need to give up windows and TP - just open a terminal window or cmd and work from it by running the script interpreter you need.  And for God's sake, no far / mc / nc and so.  - your goal is to learn how to write scripts.  After these 2 weeks, you will return to your familiar environment with quite a lot of knowledge about how the scripting language works.  Let me remind you that for python and ruby ‚Äã‚Äãthere is ipython and iruby.  For perl, there is mshell, the rest are interpretable by themselves. <br><br>  4. Examine your IDE as much as possible.  Ideally, discard the IDE in favor of a good text editor.  I mean the <b>editor</b> .  For example, ViM or Emacs.  MacOS users can use TextMate, but it seems to me a pitiful likeness of the left hand (a weak parody of <a href="http://uemacs.tripod.com/">MicroEmacs</a> ).  Yes, and I assure you - both editors, and ViM, and Emacs have as many features as no other has ever dreamed of.  At the same time, both of them work fine without any configuration, although I prefer Emacs.  Of course, many people still remember that Emacs is decoded as Eight Megs And Constantly Swaping, but 8 meters of memory have long ceased to be something out of the ordinary.  Okay, back.  Select an editor.  And now use it wherever possible.  Beat in your head - you use ONLY this editor.  Because it is not good enough to know two editors.  Experts say that working with your editor to the fullest you get a boost to performance of 200-500%.  And looking at <a href="http://bacek.livejournal.com/">Bacek</a> , for example, I believe in it.  And the only disadvantage of this knowledge is only in one thing - you cannot get rid of it. <br><br>  5. Learn technology and write small programs.  Allocate yourself 20-30 percent of the time for picking in new engines or databases.  Yes, twenty to thirty percent of the time.  I know that usually there is less for this - but I don‚Äôt have to be deceived, I‚Äôm myself, and I know how many percent of the time a programmer writes code.  Move a little bit of the time you spend reading <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> and dig in on your elbow in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> .  Or sit down and write a script for spinning votes on <a href="http://habr.ru/">Habr√©</a> .  In general, have fun and good time.  This greatly helps to relax at work without losing pace.  And the main thing is that it has a very good effect on the structure of your code - now you know how others do it. <br><br>  In general, what I want to say.  It should be a little tense, and your code itself will fly out from under your fingers.  This is not to mention the fact that your hair will become clean and silky, and the girls with the reception desk will come running to you themselves.  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299/</a></p>
