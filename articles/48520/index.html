  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buy an idea - results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/48444/">post</a> in which I proposed to implement someone‚Äôs idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup and take this person to share.  Let you down the results because they are rather curious. <br><br>  In total, I got something about 20 ideas.  Showing respect for their authors, I will not describe these ideas.  However, none of them was worthwhile.  It was a little more or less reasonable, but rather weak, in my opinion - I replied to such authors that I did not like the idea subjectively. <br><br><h3>  What conclusions can be made? </h3><br>  Firstly, it is obvious that people who are not developers themselves have practically no ‚Äúright‚Äù ideas.  Understanding the environment and its internal processes is necessary to assess the viability of the idea.  In addition, there is still less awareness - the developers themselves are much more aware of the projects appearing on the network: they follow them, they read the hacker news, tekkranch and just communicate with each other.  Therefore, it is easier for them to sort out and screen out nonsense. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      Secondly, I practically did not receive letters in which the second condition of my proposal would be observed - a clear monetization scheme.  Most of those who wrote to me hoped that it somehow monetized itself and believed in the bright future of the idea.  This can be considered a direct consequence of paragraph 1. <br><br>  Thirdly, in the post, people were noticed who took the title very close to their heart and decided that the ideas are really worth something or that I have to provide some guarantees that I will really take you to share.  I would like to remind you that my proposal is an isolated case: no one has ever done something that would not give you guarantees, but would not even offer 49% simply in words.  Ideas are not your personal achievement.  Be sure that as soon as the idea came to you, the exact same idea had already appeared a bit earlier in hundreds, and maybe thousands, of people all over the planet.  The question is not to invent it, but to correctly and smarter than others to dispose of it.  Tell us your idea: it is better to listen to the criticism and find out that the idea is shit than all your life to think that you are an unrecognized genius.  Only in this case can you finally find the right idea and the right people to help you realize it. <br><br>  Fourthly, to all minus posts, I had a question: what did not suit you?  Yes, I am looking for a good idea.  This does not mean that I do not have my own.  But what if there is something better, what can I spend my time on?  Who will lose if we do a worthwhile thing and earn it? <br><br>  So the offer remains open. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48520/</a></p>
