We are sure that our idea is one of those, however, this has not affected the sales level yet.  And the reason is not the quality of the idea, but the uncertainty in its commercialization.  On the one hand, our idea is interesting and people use it, but on the other, it is completely unclear for what money can be taken.  By the way, looking ahead, we will be grateful to those who can help with advice on the issue of converting ideas into money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Relevance of the issue</b> <br>  It would seem that recently the world community predicted the emergence of social networks.  Today, when communication more and more goes online, the appearance of various rating systems is expected.  Systems that could already rank, not sites but network users.  This idea will not seem so absurd if we open the discussion of popular events on any news resource.  Different people enter into fierce controversy with each other without even seeing who is at the other end of the "wire".  The question arises.  Why?  After all, if in real life a homeless person approaches you and offers to discuss the situation in Syria, you will ignore it.  Or try to imagine in real life a situation when a seventh grader enlightens a professor of history about the political situation in the country.  In life, it looks wild, the network meets all the time. <br><br>  It is absolutely clear that when communicating online we cannot identify a person by age, dress, social status.  This means that in order to maintain normal communication there should be a unique assessment, a certain rank that will allow everyone to show the importance of a particular user. <br><br>  I must say that this idea is not original.  Already it has been discussed repeatedly <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8022/">here</a> and in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/118053/">Habr√©</a> .  At the same time, some systems already exist, but for the time being they mainly estimate only social connections, the number of friends, etc.

      <b>Simple approach</b> <br>  We decided to create a system that would immediately understand who you are dealing with.  A system that would take into account your outlook, education, the presence of prof.  skills etc.  And most importantly, a system that would allow to identify talents and transmit them to society.  Today, unfortunately, this is another problem; in the age of information overload, real talents with significant achievements are lost among posts about pussies and food photos. <br><br>  <a href="http://levelpride.com/">LevelPride.com</a> is essentially a portfolio.  It is intended mainly for the educational community: schoolchildren, students, teachers, but anyone can register and contribute their achievements to the system.  These may be certificates, certificates, winning contests, etc.  Portfolio page can be viewed by all network users.  For each achievement made to the system, a certain amount of points are awarded to the user. <br><br>  In total, all points for one user make up his so-called LP ‚Äì level.  Thanks to this level you can build different ratings.  User rating of an educational institution or a rating of educational institutions on the basis of students' achievements, or to identify the most sporting, or the most scientific student in a particular university or city. <br><br>  Unfortunately, this whole thing is being implemented by only a few people, whose knowledge is not enough to implement all that was planned, and for all this time not a penny of investment was attracted.  However, despite this, the idea, like any good idea that can change the world for the better, works. <br><br>  <b>Who uses?</b> <br>  Today, some universities use the system to identify the best students and assign them to increased scholarships.  There is no need to work out the data of all applicants, it is enough to take as a basis the rating provided by the system.  At the same time, everything is transparent, anyone can see what a scholarship has been awarded to a particular person. <br><br>  In addition to universities, the system is used by schools, viewed by employers. <br><br>  It conveniently holds various competitions, to identify the best in a particular area.  Broadcast talented guys, for example, employers, or applicants to broadcast universities. <br><br>  <b>Mission</b> <br>  The main mission of ‚ÄúPride‚Äù is to identify and transmit talented people to society.  To do this, we implement various projects.  For example, for two years in a row we have compiled a <a href="http://levelpride.com/best_students_2015.php">ranking of the best students</a> .  More than fifty Russian universities participated in the ranking for the last time. <br><br>  On the eve of the receiving company we create and publish a catalog of talented applicants.  Universities watch this catalog and invite worthy applicants to come to themselves. <br><br>  However, with obvious utility, the answer to the question of commercialization is not obvious. <br><br>  PS This article is a message to the discussion on the existence of rating systems in general and this system in particular.  How do you see their future?  What they can be, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295486/</a></p>
