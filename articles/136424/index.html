The post even collected enough votes so that the UFO would allow me to invite someone to Habrahabr. <br><br>  It should be recalled that <a href="http://cssr.ru/simpliste/ru.html">Simpliste</a> is just such a template.  And now the work on its development will go at full speed. <br><br>  One of the advantages of Simpliste I consider the availability of ready-made themes.  Immediately, at the time of launch, there were 3 themes.  Gradually, I created some more. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      It is already clear that for users of the template so many topics will not be enough.  Therefore, the open-sourced project Simpliste announces a set of participants who want to create themes. <br><br>  I am sure that creating a topic or two is a great opportunity for designers and layout designers not only to do useful work, but to practice skills that may have been asking for attention for a long time. <br><br><h4>  Designers </h4>  Creating a minimal design is not as easy as it sounds.  It requires both taste and professionalism.  So when creating a theme, you can practice by spending not too much time on each individual design.  Moreover, there is a <a href="">layout of a standard theme</a> , in which there are all the elements of the template.  So it will only make their own changes.  If you also write CSS, then the project can open up even more possibilities for you. <br><br>  Design for mobile devices from you is not required, most often it is recreated without any extra effort. <br><br><h4>  Maker-ups </h4>  In essence, you don't need to typeset anything.  There is an HTML page that is immutable and there is a standard theme CSS file that can be redone to recreate a new design. <br><br>  Simpliste simplifies the life of the encoder by the fact that there is no need to chase the old versions of browsers.  The main thing is to have access to information, and the design is created using the features of CSS3, and he has a lot of opportunities that we want to use. <br><br>  For mobile devices, most often do not need to change anything.  But check the behavior of the layout at different resolutions does not hurt. <br><br><h4>  To help participants </h4>  Specially created a <a href="http://cssr.ru/simpliste/create/">page with the rules</a> to be followed, there are the necessary links. <br><br><h4>  What does it give </h4><ul><li>  Project open-sorsny.  Someone your work can help </li><li>  Practice existing skills </li><li>  The practice of new skills, especially interesting features of new browsers. </li><li>  Respect and respect </li><li>  Potential opportunity to learn new colleagues, find customers </li><li>  Opportunity to get on Habrahabr * </li></ul>  * For the last item.  I have already mentioned that the last post brought an invite.  I am ready to give it to the one who will bring the greatest benefit to the Simpliste project.  But I hope that if among the active participants there are a lot of people unregistered at Habr√©, then there may still be those who want to share invites. <br><br><h4>  How do we do that </h4>  I suggest everyone who has a desire to contribute, leave in the form of comments or the fact of the desire to impose ready-made designs, or give screen shots of designs created by you, and those who can do the layout will contact the author of the design, not forgetting to start work by layout.  If you want to create both design and code, then the link to the <a href="http://github.com/rafikov/Simpliste">project on Github</a> can be useful, or send topics directly to the post office. <br><br>  Those who are not registered on Habrahabr, send to my mailbox either a screenshot of the design so that I can post it here, or a message with the intention to impose a particular design, with reference to a comment with a screenshot of the design. <br><br>  Each author will be mentioned in the copyright file styles.  The most active participants will receive thanks in the information about the project.  I <em>invite the</em> authors of topics and layout designers <em>to leave links to their portfolios</em> , it is very possible that someone will be interested in your work. <br><br><h4>  What then? </h4>  The task of the minimum is to bring the number of finished topics to 20 by the end of this week.  At the end of the week I will summarize and name the best in several categories: <br><ul><li>  The most productive designer </li><li>  The best coder </li><li>  Jack of all trades </li><li>  The most original solution </li></ul>  If you have tips, ideas or the opportunity to test topics, I will be grateful for the help. <br><br>  upd In the comments there are pictures with screenshots of the themes, but for some reason they stopped loading, although they lie on Habrastoija recommended by Habrahabrom.  It was decided to post all screen shots on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ruSimpliste">Facebook, the Simpliste page</a> was also created <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ruSimpliste">there</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136424/</a></p>
