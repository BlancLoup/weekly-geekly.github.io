      <font color="#3b5998">Aleksey Aleksandrovich Lustin was born in Anadyr in 1980 and studied at the Voronezh Technical University with a degree in CAD Engineering.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">Since 1995 - IT-specialist.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">He started out as a 1C programmer in the city of Lipetsk, was engaged in the automation of business processes in the Yuterra network.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">Since 2008 - leading specialist Java, Rails.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">In 2008 he moved to Moscow.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">From 2012 to 2014 - Deputy Head of the Department for Innovative Development and Systems Analysis at the Svyaznoy Group of Companies.</font>  <font color="#3b5998">Currently he is a technical director, trainer, architect-consultant of the Silver Bullet company.</font> <font color="#3b5998"><br></font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">Alexey, for a start, I suggest you to tell a little about yourself in order to designate what we will talk about in the future.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">It is quite difficult, like any beginning.</font>  <font color="#000">In short, I speak about myself in such a way that I was born in Chukotka, far, far away, near the Arctic Circle.</font>  <font color="#000">IT has been doing it since 12 years, that is, in fact, not 20, but in my opinion, already 22 years old.</font>  <font color="#000">He has gone from the usual refilling of cartridges, the operator for filling out incoming invoices, to the architect, technical director and so on.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">How did I go through it?</font>  <font color="#000">Here, probably, it is necessary to tell longer.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">I came from Chukotka in 1997 to go to college, because the main group of good teachers was concentrated in the central region, and not in the Far East.</font>  <font color="#000">Maybe even in Novosibirsk, but in general, at that time, high-quality IT education could be obtained in technical cities - either in Moscow, or in Voronezh, or, of course, in St. Petersburg.</font>  <font color="#000">Unfortunately, this was not the case in the Far East.</font>  <font color="#000">To provide myself with money, and the time was hard, I took on any work on IT.</font>  <font color="#000">This is the administrator of a computer club, and a collector of computer equipment, and the developer of 1C, oddly enough, even in the old-old version.</font>  <font color="#000">I also tried my hand as a Java developer, when it was just beginning to develop, and as a Clipper database developer, who still remembers such things.</font>  <font color="#000">For those times it was fun enough.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">And after the end of the student phase, serious life had already begun, and there I went a different way: I was both a programmer and a project manager, depending on what the global goal of the employers I worked for (business owners, IT directors or IT executives in general).</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Well, and then, in Lipetsk, I worked for the company Yuterra - this is a fairly large Russian holding company that combines a network of non-food goods stores - at that time there were about 112 supermarkets from Blagoveshchensk to Kaliningrad.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">A little later, in order of my own development, I moved to Moscow on my own initiative, closer to the grandees of our industry, in order to really gain experience and share my approaches.</font>  <font color="#000">So I got to Svyaznoy and worked there for about 4 years.</font>  <font color="#000">I was there both a leading programmer and an internal technical leader; last year my role in the company was called ‚Äú1C Competence Center‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">So you understand, there are about 200 specialists in 1C.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, knowing the Messenger, I understand the level, yes.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes.</font>  <font color="#000">Here is a way of life.</font>  <font color="#000">In terms of my personal relationship with him.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">IT paradigms from the four authors</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">So, in the 95th year you started as an IT specialist.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Do you think that the model of an IT specialist of the 95th year differs from the IT specialist of 2015?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">In general, nothing has changed, in my opinion.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">But what about the changes in paradigms, in concepts, in technology development?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Paradigms have not changed.</font>  <font color="#000">All the paradigms on which we are now parasitic, invented by the four authors - this is Brooks, Wirth, Ward and Hyudak.</font>  <font color="#000">In fact, they invented these paradigms in 93-94 years (I am not talking about software engineering, which was invented in the 70s).</font>  <font color="#000">Everything that is happening with technology is laid there.</font>  <font color="#000">Nothing changes.</font>  <font color="#000">On the other hand, only the practice of applying these paradigms is growing, that is, an IT specialist who started in 95th year has, conditionally, 20 years of experience in applying these paradigms.</font>  <font color="#000">This is his only competitive advantage over a person starting in 2005.</font>  <font color="#000">Just a person starting in 2005, has 10 years of practice.</font>  <font color="#000">That's the whole difference.</font>  <font color="#000">And the paradigms are the same.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Good.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">And let's remember the 95th year.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Still, IT people then - these are people who loved IT, they came to this field at 12, at 15 years ... It is no secret that now some of IT people choose IT only because it is fashionable.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, now really big fashion for IT.</font>  <font color="#000">But then they chose, because it was fashionable.</font>  <font color="#000">For example, you can recall the ‚Äúdotcom boom‚Äù of 2000, which affected Russia, because even then there was a fashion for IT.</font>  <font color="#000">Yes, and 3 years before, in '97, the fashion for engineering specialties was also very large.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">I will explain why.</font>  <font color="#000">In Russia at that time there was a general lack of IT specialists of any nature.</font>  <font color="#000">For a good IT-specialist were willing to pay big bucks.</font>  <font color="#000">They were no longer willing to pay for lawyers, economists, but they were ready for IT.</font>  <font color="#000">It was quite an interesting time.</font>  <font color="#000">If we recall that in the 93rd year, the passing score for engineering specialties was 9 - three triples, then in the 97th year for engineering specialties related to IT, the passing score was already around 14-15 - one four, two fives.</font>  <font color="#000">This is an indicator.</font>  <font color="#000">And, in my opinion, this passing score is still not reduced.</font>  <font color="#000">That at the beginning of the two thousandth, that now the passing score and requirements for IT-specialties remain at the level of 97, 98, 99-ies.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">On the other hand, and then in IT they went, including for fashion.</font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, now many of those who started back then are no longer IT specialists.</font>  <font color="#000">Some of them are businessmen, someone became an economist, someone left.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">There were not those who came for fashion, but those who really loved it.</font>  <font color="#000">And if we see an IT specialist with ten years of experience, then he most likely went through all the crises of this growth - 1, 3, 5 years.</font>  <font color="#000">As in family life, you married IT, then a year later you realized who you married, after 3 years you had a falling out, and after 5 years you finally reached a certain ‚ÄúZen‚Äù when you understand that you are from each other need to.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Such a philosophy.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">You have a rather interesting experience, but you cannot say that you are an IT specialist, although you yourself insist on it.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Why?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I have two theses that reflect my experience and the general concept of what I am for a specialist: this is Overskilled ‚Äî the so-called ‚Äúskill overkill‚Äù (there are too many), and at the same time Troubleshooting is a ‚Äúperson - problem solver‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">I usually say that I can solve any problem in IT.</font>  <font color="#000">Due to the experience, due to the technique, due to the developed algorithms - in general any.</font>  <font color="#000">Because any problem can be solved.</font>  <font color="#000">It doesn't matter if this problem is related to 1C or not.</font>  <font color="#000">There can be no unsolved problems.</font>  <font color="#000">This is the first.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Since I live with such an approach for a very long time, can you imagine how many problems I have already solved?</font>  <font color="#000">That is why, in fact, I am overkill on skills.</font>  <font color="#000">I can solve the problem with Ruby, with C ++, with the Assembler I can even, if there are problems.</font>  <font color="#000">With 1C, of ‚Äã‚Äãcourse, with business applications, with applications written by third-party developers, with OpenSource, Commerce applications.</font>  <font color="#000">I have just experienced it all.</font>  <font color="#000">Cartridge accounting?</font>  <font color="#000">Yes please.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5">‚ÄúCANNOT BE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS‚Äù</font> </h4></blockquote><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Business Application Specialist</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Then I have a counter question.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">My career began in the distant two thousandth, and I started exactly with 1C.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">But after 6-7 years, I stopped being a single member in the truest sense of the word, although, probably, somewhere deep down in my soul, I still program at the seven.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">But why are you with such a rich technical experience still consider yourself to be one?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">In fact, I usually call myself a business application specialist.</font>  <font color="#000">And in Russia, and not only in Russia, it is impossible to create business applications without the 1C platform.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Can we say that in this case 1C is the most common platform for creating business applications, at least in Russia?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">1C is an implementation of the concepts of a problem-oriented language.</font>  <font color="#000">Let's go back to the 95th.</font>  <font color="#000">There was a problem.</font>  <font color="#000">There are a lot of businesses.</font>  <font color="#000">Imagine how many configurations are now in Russia, written from scratch, without taking into account the typical.</font>  <font color="#000">That is, de facto, we can say that every 1C specialist wrote his configuration from scratch.</font>  <font color="#000">Bad, good is not important.</font>  <font color="#000">On the <a href="http://infostart.ru/">INFOSTART.RU</a> portal, 450,000 active users, 1C specialists are now registered, that is, we can say that each of them has written his own configuration.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5">‚Äú1C IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROBLEM-ORIENTED LANGUAGE CONCEPTS‚Äù</font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">You know, I will not go far, for example, I have 4 full-fledged software complexes.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">This is not counting the minor developments and reports.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I am usually a supporter of saying that how many 1C specialists are, so many atypical 1C configurations written from scratch.</font>  <font color="#000">And how many businesses in Russia?</font>  <font color="#000">They are much more.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Probably all the same business models?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, business models.</font>  <font color="#000">Most often, the business architecture is directly proportional to the architecture of the team creating this business.</font>  <font color="#000">There is no the same business and the same process also does not happen.</font>  <font color="#000">Even if they are based on the same principles, the concrete implementation is always different.</font>  <font color="#000">We must accept this.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Where did the 1C platform and its language for developing business applications come from?</font>  <font color="#000">All this appeared in response to the problem that the business grew in Russia - there was a transition from the old system to the new: many small enterprises appeared, the growth was very rapid.</font>  <font color="#000">There were many small businesses.</font>  <font color="#000">They could not all work on "template" business practices ("bestpratiksam").</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">Then there were no such practices as such in Russia.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, there was no consulting as such for this market yet.</font>  <font color="#000">But it was necessary to somehow work.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">There is a need for a language to quickly describe business processes.</font>  <font color="#000">Because you will not find in any platform a language in which you can write ‚ÄúDocuments. Entry Bill. Pass ()‚Äù (register, print, send to printer, read off sale and so on).</font>  <font color="#000">And it had to be described.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Conventionally, the idea was that even an accountant would be able to describe his business process.</font>  <font color="#000">It didn‚Äôt quite work out - anyway, special people were needed who had an algorithmic base and could describe business processes in a special DSL language (problem-oriented language).</font>  <font color="#000">But this way it was possible to reduce costs and quickly automate any business from 5-10 people.</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/328/f60/002/328f6000267a446d998afd34926ece7f.jpg"><br><br>  <b><font color="#000">In essence, this saved time and expenses for the creation of these base classes, base models, because they were already in fact.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, it was a huge leap.</font>  <font color="#000">The fact is that at that time, in the 95th year, the main language for developing business applications was C ++, which had a low level of abstraction.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Then on Clipper a lot was written, as I recall.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Clipper was too low-level language.</font>  <font color="#000">Then Java just appeared, as a kind of framework that raised the level of abstraction.</font>  <font color="#000">But he raised this level only up one stage - he allowed the component model to build, and 1C jumped right up through 5 levels, immediately to the level of a businessman.</font>  <font color="#000">Even now, after 20 years, neither abroad nor in Russia there is still no such language that would allow to describe business processes directly.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Now banks are trying to create a language for automating traders and describing their algorithms in a certain DSL language - they are trying to do this in the Java world (or, more precisely, in the functional world).</font>  <font color="#000">And we have such a language, conditionally, has existed for 20 years, so we are in a favorable position here.</font>  <font color="#000">And it is unlikely that a language of the same level will appear there in the near future, making it possible to level up the system‚Äôs work at basic levels so effectively that at the first stage it is possible not to dwell on problems with the code, memory, so that you can immediately think about the benefits of business.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Remember, why did you come up with Agile?</font>  <font color="#000">In order for developers on third-party platforms to start thinking about the benefits for the end user.</font>  <font color="#000">They didn‚Äôt do space memory management algorithms, but thought how these algorithms can be useful for business.</font>  <font color="#000">Not a businessman in a shirt (the owner, who invests money in it), but the end user - the storekeeper, the operator, the accountant.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">There is still such a moment: how to justify for a business the need to optimize some algorithm in order to win one and a half megabytes of memory?</font>  <font color="#000">In C ++, it is almost impossible to prove the feasibility study of such optimization for a business.</font>  <font color="#000">And with this it‚Äôs easier, his tasks are close to business goals, so he can explain what will become faster, what will improve (and he can implement the optimization from memory just with C ++).</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">And if you go back to why I consider myself a 1C specialist - I always work with businessmen.</font>  <font color="#000">Initially, 20 years ago, I started at the Mandatory Medical Insurance Fund.</font>  <font color="#000">My first task was to automate the collection of payments on CHI.</font>  <font color="#000">My first customer was the head of the OMS Fund, he explained the strategic business goal: why does he need it and so on.</font>  <font color="#000">And the technical implementation and the technical risks associated with it were completely on my side - the choice of platform, whether it would be Access, Clipper, and so on, completely fell on me.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">This was my first task - at that time I was 15 years old and there were no specialists in our city in databases at all.</font>  <font color="#000">Besides me and Andrew, my colleague is a good C ++ programmer.</font>  <font color="#000">And in our team there was a ‚Äúsenior comrade‚Äù, a radio technician of 35 years old - he explained to us how to implement everything technically, and then ‚Äúcombed‚Äù what was done.</font>  <font color="#000">And we, the young guys, took the strategic goal of the person who was responsible for all district compulsory medical insurance, and tried to implement it.</font>  <font color="#000">Bad, good, with errors - it doesn't matter anymore.</font>  <font color="#000">Probably, if he sees us now, he will say that we all did badly there.</font>  <font color="#000">But it normal.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Is it possible to say that it was for you that you decided then that you need to develop, that by setting your goal at the head of your work, he gave you an impetus to further development?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, of course, then we were strongly influenced by what he believed in us.</font>  <font color="#000">We were young tenth-graders, we won at the Olympiads, such IT specialists to the bone marrow - but, in fact, we were boys with no work experience.</font>  <font color="#000">And he took a chance and gave us the opportunity to try to do something.</font>  <font color="#000">And we tried, yes.</font>  <font color="#000">In order to be close to computers and generally be close to everything.</font>  <font color="#000">It was such a good motivation.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Different levels of abstraction</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">I remember the beginning of my career - it was Vodokanal, there was 1C.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">I found 1C under DOS version 2.0, then moving to 7.5, to 7.7.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">But when I started writing something under 7.7, I very quickly realized that I was missing the very accounting background.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">I then went to a three-month course, and this, for me, probably, on the one hand, served as an impetus for further development, and on the other hand, it served as a kind of click to get me to start moving from programming further into the depth of business processes.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Is it possible that IT-specialists who write programs or applications for various business tasks will move to get away from programming and move to adjacent planes, to other platforms, for other tasks or to another area in general?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, it usually happens.</font>  <font color="#000">The world is divided.</font>  <font color="#000">At first you just have some programming skills.</font>  <font color="#000">You can write on Pascal, on C ++ something, some algorithms.</font>  <font color="#000">This is a basic skill - at this stage you have no experience in working with business problems.</font>  <font color="#000">But you get 1C-platform.</font>  <font color="#000">You try to solve business problems with it, pass it through yourself and your first level appears.</font>  <font color="#000">And what next -

so that you don‚Äôt waste time, but immediately start coding.</font>  <font color="#000">In the same way, you can deploy Bitrix locally on your virtual machine, or somewhere in the cloud - yours, if you have one, or in a private one - whatever.</font>  <font color="#000">As a result, we operate with these small virtual operating systems that come preinstalled to you and are automatically updated.</font>  <font color="#000">Such a trend is everywhere.</font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, the word 1C is removed - this is everywhere now.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">This reduces costs.</font>  <font color="#000">For example, to buy iron.</font>  <font color="#000">Because if we imagine some ideal stationary computer of the 1C developer, then it will now cost, probably, about 40 thousand rubles, if you buy it very, very cheap.</font>  <font color="#000">Although at current prices even, probably, already 60. There should be something like i7 (multi-core), 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte SSD screw to work with the configurator cache so that everything fits.</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, yes, software requirements are growing faster.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, and it is necessary to recoup 90 thousand rubles.</font>  <font color="#000">If you work in Moscow, you can somehow do this, and in the region 90 thousand rubles, even with a loan, is quite difficult to recoup.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">And when using a remote environment, you just need a browser or some stationary client that will work with it over the network.</font>  <font color="#000">With the development of communication channels (and they are still developing), this will be quite good and convenient.</font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, it is a really interesting trend.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">And how in your case with the cloud configurator will the speed of the channel be affected?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">It seems clear that this will affect the display of the picture, but how good will the performance on the cloud side be?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">And what will it depend on?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">From practice - the performance there will be 3-4 times higher than, say, on your local machine, even with an SSD.</font>  <font color="#000">Because the performance of the solution itself is already dependent on the supplier of this solution.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">All of our final business solutions, final consulting, practices, we still sell.</font>  <font color="#000">But the tools for people to develop, we lay out in OpenSource.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">How was our community formed?</font>  <font color="#000">We shared our tools, our work.</font>  <font color="#000">Yes, and Infostart was so formed.</font>  <font color="#000">All tools are laid out.</font>  <font color="#000">So we, it turns out, are debugging it.</font>  <font color="#000">The toolkit (the same Snegopat), is in many ways more productive than 1C, several times.</font>  <font color="#000">Working with the configuration, working directly with the 1C storage is also implemented there several times faster than regular work.</font>  <font color="#000">Due to the fact that there are good C-shniki, assemblers sometimes come across.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, yes, Mercedes AMG, he, of course, better than just a Mercedes, because it is brought to mind.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, for example, there is an opinion that 1C on virtual machines slows down and reduces the performance by a factor of two.</font>  <font color="#000">But there is another opinion that if properly configured virtualization, it will not lose in performance.</font>  <font color="#000">And if you correctly configure the parallelism of the threads, that is, to implement the code of the internal tooling in a slightly different way, parallelizing the streams, then you can win in two and a half times in comparison with the usual typical machine.</font>  <font color="#000">This is from practice.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, the performance there actually turns out to be higher than on the local machine due to the fact that you implement this multithreading or, in other words, the MapReduce approach, when we parallelize the stream and then finally only collect.</font>  <font color="#000">That is, only the flow of the assembly occurs synchronously, and the load distribution should occur horizontally.</font>  <font color="#000">But this is a zone of architecture.</font>  <font color="#000">Approximately the same and 1C cluster works in 8.3.</font>  <font color="#000">All code must be asynchronous, must be executed in several threads so that it can be parallelized, memory managed, and so on.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About experts in the world of 1C programming</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">You say that 1C is naughty when they say they know only 1C, because besides this they also know other programming languages.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Does this mean that we are on the verge of a turning point?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Previously, 1C-nickname was the one who programmed in 1C.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Now, he should understand virtual machines, know XML, understand how to configure Postgre servers for Linux ...</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">What you are talking about is called a "Performance Expert".</font>  <font color="#000">He likes to understand how 1C behaves in a Linux environment or in a Windows environment.</font>  <font color="#000">He studies performance on different servers - on Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 - they cost different money.</font>  <font color="#000">Some of them are more convenient for him, he can work with it.</font>  <font color="#000">He does not do business automation at all, but still he is a 1C specialist.</font>  <font color="#000">This facet is leveled.</font>  <font color="#000">He is just a specialist, an expert in infrastructure, environment for 1C.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">You put such a person, for example, a Tomcat application server in Java, and he says: ‚ÄúOh, some kind of regular servant, not 1C-ny, well, yes, in Java, but behaves the same way‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">And he suddenly becomes an application server infrastructure support specialist.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Do I understand correctly that, unlike the IT specialist of the 95th year, who set 1C himself, and then in two days gave the business some half-working, but working solution, the current 1C-nick, in the narrow sense, plays the dominant role, and the remaining 2 development department perform a supporting function?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Does it not happen that due to this we come to ‚Äúworld peace‚Äù?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Maybe so, but there is another question.</font>  <font color="#000">Again in the money.</font>  <font color="#000">God bless him, with technocracy, technical issues are all settled there.</font>  <font color="#000">Now the question is how to monetize it and how to make money on it.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">So now, when switching to the ‚Äúservice model‚Äù, a new fashionable topic begins - these are microservices, microcommands.</font>  <font color="#000">People start to talk about the fact that IT suddenly becomes not a cost center (as a support service), but a center of earnings.</font>  <font color="#000">According to the new ideology, any IT-service should earn, therefore, in fact, we should hang up the billing (benefit calculation) for internal service, and conditionally 1C-nick buys some of its services from the dotnetchik.</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5">"NEW FASHIONABLE THEME - MICROSERVIS, MICROCOMANDS"</font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">In fact, some internal cost accounting.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, and if each microprocess there will make a microinstruction, then they simply buy these services from each other on partnerships.</font>  <font color="#000">Moreover, the model of franchising and model ‚Äúupdate‚Äù is also just one of the services.</font>  <font color="#000">For a business customer, he looks like a typical 1C-nickname, who arrives, updates ITS, can talk heart to heart with an accountant, tell him about the innovations that he read on ITS.</font>  <font color="#000">This is a service, support for basic money.</font>  <font color="#000">But this service also provides project activities, because if you have a service for such support, then the development department also develops as a whole as well, because the actual requirements of the business customer are actually brought by the employees of this service. with users heart to heart talk.</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c1/71c/6d9/1c171c6d9bf8b9b7b4771dab62695ffc.jpg"><br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Can we say that this is, in fact, some kind of technical support?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">It is impossible.</font>  <font color="#000">Technical support are those that techie and do nothing else.</font>  <font color="#000">In reality, this is not the case.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">The following happens: the person went, updated the ITS, spoke with the payroll accountant, and returned back to the development team.</font>  <font color="#000">At this point, the accountant sent for the development of the requirement to add props "Daisy" (this is a real requirement, it really sounded like that).</font>  <font color="#000">This developer looks and indignant: what a props "Daisy", what is it all about?</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">And here that ‚Äúrenovator‚Äù comes to them, and explains that, in fact, the problem is this: a large staff rotation, a person can quit and return next year, they are called ‚Äúdaisies‚Äù in the jargon.</font>  <font color="#000">Because they have two employment contracts, and a certificate 2-NDFL one.</font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, they asked to add such a requisite to the staff directory so that there were no problems with tax.</font>  <font color="#000">It turned out that they talked about this "over tea" during the update of ITS.</font>  <font color="#000">Consequently, it is not necessary to refine anything, because it is already in the standard ZUP functionality.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">As a result, it turned out that this person made an analyst here, who traveled and talked.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">But this again, provided that he knows the typical configuration well, and generally understands the essence of the problem, as well as the specifics of the business - that is, it must be 1C-nickname of a certain level.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes.</font>  <font color="#000">But he must reach this level.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">By itself.</font></b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the transition period</font> </h1><br>  <font color="#000">The problem of people who do not develop can be solved in two ways.</font>  <font color="#000">What is happening in the market now?</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">There are people like us and you who are developing themselves, realizing that there is no other way.</font>  <font color="#000">On this occasion, there is Moore's law, which says that the further development of technology is faster and faster.</font>  <font color="#000">So, we need to accumulate basic tools in order to keep up with development, to be faster than development.</font>  <font color="#000">And then we can be in the trend and level these risks, because now we are thinking about what will happen tomorrow.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">And there are other people who are already forced by the platform.</font>  <font color="#000">You do know that many people left the 1C world just because they heard that 1C platform is bad and so on.</font>  <font color="#000">But in fact, they could not restructure from approach 7.7 to approach 8, from approach 8 to approach 8.3.</font>  <font color="#000">I often say that the approach of 8.3 in the Java world (and not only) is the de facto standard: a three-way call from the client and executed on the server.</font>  <font color="#000">If someone from Java developers would come to 1C development now, then in 1C 8.3 he was on a horse, because here everything would be familiar to him</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">I remember when I switched from Delphi to programming in the seven, I probably programmed for several months as follows: first I formed the code in the English version in my head, and then translated it all into Russian code on 1C.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">And the error caught exactly the same way.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Well, these are the costs of the transition period.</font>  <font color="#000">The goal is good.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Yes, the output was good.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">And the second type of people are those who do not keep up with development (development goes on continuously).</font>  <font color="#000">And as a result, they are either thrown out of the market, or substituted, or reclassified, or dismissed.</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">Either you are developing, or you are developing, or do you even fall out of this scheme?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes.</font>  <font color="#000">You can generally leave, run away.</font>  <font color="#000">In my memory there was a case, as an IT specialist went to the ‚Äúwilderness, to Saratov‚Äù and became a farmer.</font>  <font color="#000">He got tired of it, he realized that IT is not his.</font>  <font color="#000">And this is also normal.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">We say that any problem can be solved - sometimes the problem can be solved simply by ‚Äúfixing losses‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">If we understand that IT is not ours, we can sometimes (very rarely) fix losses and say - that's all, I am not an IT person.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">This is in any field, in principle.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, the word IT is removed, and in fact, there is a fixation of losses in any methodology.</font>  <font color="#000">It happens, it's not scary.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">I used to be an orthodox too.</font>  <font color="#000">For example, when I was yaver, I was negative about 1C.</font>  <font color="#000">When I was 1C-nick, I thought Java was too slow.</font>  <font color="#000">But now, after I visited ‚Äúon both sides of the barricades‚Äù, I came to a certain heterogeneous approach (to a certain ‚ÄúZen‚Äù), that there is no ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù, but there is a problem, there is language and there is a solution.</font>  <font color="#000">The main thing that a person wants, what he feels love, desire, and so on.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5">‚ÄúTHERE IS A PROBLEM, THERE IS A LANGUAGE, THERE IS A SOLUTION‚Äù</font> </h4></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">"For the love of art"</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">We return to the fact that the priority is given to those people who love what they do.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Their main motive is not money, but love for work and self-development.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">They develop.</font>  <font color="#000">They are usually at the hearing and see the result of their work.</font>  <font color="#000">And there are those people who do not want to develop and perform some routine work.</font>  <font color="#000">I will not say that I agree with their views, but such people are also necessary.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">We are talking about development and about different types of people.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">As far as I know, you are a member of various communities, including 1C-s.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">We just talked about changing paradigms, concepts.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">In your opinion, will there be any change in the communities themselves?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Will they somehow be rebuilt, for example, the same Infostart, will there be a change of the composition, the audience?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Infostart in any case will develop.</font>  <font color="#000">Where it goes, it has been developing since 2006.</font>  <font color="#000">I registered in the Infostart community in 2007.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5">‚ÄúINFOSTART WILL DEVELOP IN ANY CASE‚Äù</font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">We are the same age with you.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Before that, I spoke on 1C ProClub and 1C ++.</font>  <font color="#000">I didn‚Äôt like Mysta very much, because there was little practice there, I didn‚Äôt develop there.</font>  <font color="#000">It was probably possible to talk there, but this conversation did not develop me at all.</font>  <font color="#000">And on the 1C ++ forum there was more professional communication and the authors of this component taught me a lot.</font>  <font color="#000">Therefore, I communicated with them on the forum, learned from them, and they taught me.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">By the way, do you know how we came to Infostart?</font>  <font color="#000">Just at some point in 2007, we decided to publish our work there -
