The whole thing went through in Fiuggi, Italia (Fiuggi, Italy).  This event is aimed at collaboration in the field of computing and embedded systems, sponsored by European funds and large companies.  It is usually attended by students and graduate students of European universities, teachers, interesting courses are read here and student / graduate projects are discussed.  This is more an educational event than a scientific one; its main task is the exchange of knowledge between representatives of related specialties.  An important part of this event are poster reports (poster section) - the presentation of their projects by students. <br><br>  And now about everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Where?</b>  <b>When?</b> <br><br>  This event took place from the 8th to the 14th of July in Italy.  Organizer: 7th network.  Sponsor: Google at al.  There were about two hundred people present, most of all were representatives of the UK.  There were two of them from Russia: your humble servant and another young man from Intel in Nizhny Novgorod.  Participation fee: 800 euro double room, 1000 - single.  Plus flight.  Plus a visa.  Plus insurance.  Plus a beer.  It was possible, of course, to rely on a grant, which, by the way, received 50 people (out of 150 who requested), but there was a need for motivation or posters.

      <b>What happened?</b> <br>  The whole summer school consisted of four parts. <br><br>  1. Educational.  Four blocks during the day, in each of which it was possible to <a href="http://www.hipeac.net/acaces2012/index.php%3Fpage%3Dlecturers">choose</a> one of three courses.  I chose: <br><br>  Antonio Gonzalez - Processor micro architecture <br><br>  Katherine Compton - Resource management in reconfigurable computing systems <br><br>  Natalie Enright Jerger - Networks-on-Chip: communication challenges for many-core architectures <br><br>  Ted Huffmire - Hardware support for trustworthy systems <br><br>  The first lecture was given by a peasant from Intel Intel, read fairly quickly and with a characteristic Spanish accent.  A brief excursion into the superscalar microarchitecture.  The second course was reconfigurable hardware, and without knowing it, I discovered a new world for myself.  The American read it, quite interestingly, starting each lecture with a very useful brief <a href="">excursion</a> into Italian.  In her lectures there was a lot of paper reading with discussion. The third course - network on chip - was read by an American.  Very fast and not very interesting.  The questions she raised were, of course, multi-core processors, but not two or four.  Ted Huffmire is a very interesting and pleasant lecturer, telling quite interesting things.  Each lecture began with a <a href="">Disclamer</a> .  When I asked him about whether it was possible to come to their university for an internship, he said - no problem.  But having learned that I was upset from Russia, he said that he would have big problems with the security manager. <br><br>  2. Poster section.  Students submit their work.  Remarkable event: after online stores, which I regularly see on university exams, real projects.  This is heaven and earth.  Can students do such a thing?  For example, we now have engineers for a salary doing a crypto accelerator, and doing not the first month.  The project of a similar crypto accelerator was <a href="">presented</a> here by a student.  It is regrettable that our students do not even reach a total of such students as one-tenth of a percent. <br><br>  3. Networking.  Between the lectures there were breaks of half an hour or more, 2 invite, a party and the poster section.  This is all a place for discussion.  It‚Äôs pretty hard for a Russian person, it‚Äôs probably so easy to dive into an open communication environment, but from the outside it looks very exciting.  A huge swarm of 200 people is divided into groups and all the time discussing something. <br><br>  4. Food and spa.  We were fed in a large restaurant with (surprised) Italian cuisine.  No pizza or lasagna, a lot of everything else that I have never eaten (I still don‚Äôt know what <a href="">it is</a> ).  Pasta was, but on the table of vegetarians.  The average duration of a lunch / dinner is an hour during which it is necessary <a href="">to communicate</a> .  As with SPA, these are all elements of networking.  Wine was set for lunch and dinner, plus a mini-track.  Coffee / tea / other - in the bar after dinner.  <a href="">Pizza</a> could be bought on the street, very juicy and tasty.  Like ice cream.  <a href="">A huge chunk</a> for 3 euros. <br><br>  <b>Poster section</b> <br><br>  In the trend - all sorts of applications for GPU computing, pattern recognition, all types of power management, modeling, parallelization problems, network on chip for a large number of cores, etc. Materials will have to be published on the site.  I liked the interest with which the students discussed each other's work and talked about their projects. <br><br>  <b>About patents</b> <br><br>  The event was attended by representatives of the European Patent Office.  They listened to lectures, asked questions, talked with speakers.  I overheard one such conversation with my ear.  The little man asked very practical questions on the merits of the lecture, was interested in the projects of the lecturer and asked how he was doing with the patents.  It turned out that everything is good with patents, I already have some work done, and I am preparing it for the current work. <br><br>  <b>Brainstorm on technology for 5-10 years</b> <br><br>  Since your humble servant was a company representative (we recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144025/">recruited</a> students for our summer system programming school), I was invited to take part in a brainstorming session on technology development.  I happened to take part in a number of Russian farcites, so it seemed to me extremely important to participate in it.  Generally, when you sit at the table and calmly communicate with representatives of ARM, Intel, professors from leading universities, you realize how far our fantasies and copy-paste technologies are from this open, equal, truly creative world. <br><br>  The content of the brainstorm was without a methodology, just everyone expressed their thoughts.  No one climbed into space: the next decade is a decade of mobile and embedded systems, audio / video recognition, smart things.  They are preparing for multi-level heterogeneous systems on a chip, wild concurrency and multi-core processors. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  I tried very hard not to turn this report into a story about what is there and what is not there.  Those who know what they have here can perfectly think of it themselves.  I really liked to communicate with such open people, I would be very happy if our students would do such projects, and such teachers would give lectures.  It seems to me that the issue of European scientific integration and cooperation is extremely important; without this, our ‚Äúscience‚Äù and ‚Äúeducation‚Äù will have no place in the future.  And such events allow somehow to create international scientific relations.  I can not invite everyone to hipeac events.  willkommen </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148857/</a></p>
