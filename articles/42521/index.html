  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual worlds - some thoughts and statistics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time, in the 60s, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa mobile phone seemed ridiculous.  Imagine a person from that era, to whom a young boy runs up and says that in 40 years everyone will have some kind of ridiculous device that can be carried around and talk to any person anywhere in the world.  I think people did not believe.  And indeed, who wants to have a device with which you can find anywhere in the world and bother you with various issues.  In addition, the analogy with the phone of that time made it impossible to imagine that this device could be so small that it could be carried around.  95% of the population would send this boy to look for a normal job. <br><br>  Let's remember the beginning of the 90s.  Could anyone then think that there could be a company that could make money online?  And in general, to make money is that it really does not exist!?  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling something on the Internet seemed terribly ridiculous.  Who wants to give money to someone you don't even see?  However, eBay and Amazon appeared.  And how do you get the idea that a huge corporation, such as Google, can exist on advertising revenue on the Internet.  Did you think about it in the 90s? <br><br>  However, in the courtyard of 2010, the Internet in the form in which we know it, has existed for quite some time, and, probably, something new awaits us on the threshold.  And this is not web 3.0!  Let's look around and start noticing things like Second Life, Project Wonderland from Sun, Lively from Google and others.  Just as people did not believe in the power of the Internet, people do not believe in the power of virtual worlds.  Analogies of the sea, people do not believe and can not understand how it can be used.  They also resist the arrival of virtual worlds, as well as the arrival of mobile phones.  The growth of users in the virtual worlds is going on at a tremendous pace: 7.000 in 2005, 15.472.696 in 2008. Does this look like the advent of the Internet?

      For those who do not believe - more statistics as a gift: <br>  In Second Life has its own economy, in which, at the moment there are 5.486.900.000 L $.  The exchange rate at the moment is about 266.8 L $ for 1 $.  This is $ 20,565,592 that people spend in Second Life, paying for services and goods that do not even exist in the real world.  You do not want parts of this cake? <br><br>  PS I do not claim that Second Life is waiting for us to come.  On the contrary, I believe that this is just the first, clumsy steps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42521/</a></p>
