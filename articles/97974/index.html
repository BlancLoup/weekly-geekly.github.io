  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Usability is not a hindrance to design</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Few students happen to pass the exam for "excellent" and also get prizes for it.  The students of the Internet Technologies Management Program of the <b>RMA</b> Innovation and Educational Company last Tuesday not only brilliantly defended creative projects, but received awards from the selection committee: on this day, the results of the competition for the best website design project were summed up. <br><br>  Such a competition for RMA students is not new, but this year, members of the jury say, it has really reached the professional level.  Maybe partly because the participants faced the task of developing a design not for a conditional site, but for the actual operating site, the <b>KupiVip.ru</b> shopping club <b>,</b> which RMA listeners also worked on to promote. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conditions of the competition were simple, but the creative task for the participants was not easy: the students of the program "Management in the field of Internet technologies", having joined forces with the designers, had to develop a project of not only the original, but also a convenient site interface.  Moreover, functionality and convenience for users have become one of the main criteria in the evaluation of works, the jury admits. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe evaluated the work from the point of view of users,‚Äù said <b>Andrey Udalov</b> , head of the interface and interface design department at <b>Softkey</b> , RMA-GUU, a program manager in the field of Internet technologies.  ‚ÄúAfter all, it‚Äôs on users who primarily aim at any Internet project, and the tasks of its design should not contradict the tasks of functionality, that is, the ability to quickly and easily access sections of a site.

      For more than a month, the contestants brought their design ideas to life.  As a result, five projects were presented to the jury, each of which, according to Andrey Udalov, could be rated as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  Nevertheless, the project of the winners turned out to be slightly better and received from the jury a ‚Äútop five with a plus.  Students of I-6 group of the faculty of Management in the field of Internet technologies RMA Alexander Orlov, Alexander Khlevnoy, Denis Yesakov, Dmitry Zhukov, Anna Kazakova and Olga Kiryushina successfully coped with the task of the competition, but also presented the project in the form of an original presentation on two screens at the same time.  The jury appreciated both the project itself and such a non-standard approach: <b>Anton Teslenko</b> , a designer who worked with the winning team, received a licensed version of the <a href="http://www.softkey.ru/cs5">Adobe Creative Suite 5 Master Collection</a> from the Softkey online supermarket. <br><br>  In addition, all students of the RMA Internet Technologies Management specialization who participated in the design project received certificates for 3,000 rubles from the KupiVip.ru shopping club, and the winning team received 6,000 rubles certificates. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis year is a jubilee year for RMA,‚Äù says Andrei Udalov, ‚ÄúThe center is 10 years old.  For an educational institution it is, in fact, not such a long time, but even during this time the level of preparedness and even similar exam papers of its students has noticeably increased.  And this means that the current creative competition was far from the last. <br><br>  <b>Photo report:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a07/f02/91a/a07f0291aefb769af7737053978f274e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/571/933/c49/571933c493e7ba35cb0ef902a1a8e22f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f0/d8f/6f9/4f0d8f6f96ba5a44907fd939864918b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/bf8/596/d25bf8596a14cbd4c49cdffddd7f14a5.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97974/</a></p>
