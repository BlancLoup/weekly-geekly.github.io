Also there are a lot of guides and manifestos to organize the perfect support.  You can even find materials from 2011, which tell the principles of the regional organization of the technical support service of leading companies (the very Indians who will not help, but sympathize).  However, there is a big but ... <br><br>  All arguments in favor of effective technical support come up against simple and subjective phrases: this is better for users, we are the face of the company, we will not allow the spread of bad rumors about us.  But there are absolutely no numbers that sometimes make you think. <br><br>  1) A prompt response to a user's question increases by 19% the probability of receiving a second request from him.  And, as a rule, such a request is able to be solved by the user himself, devoting 3-4 minutes of his time to this.

      People do not want to think, sometimes they just want to shift their problems to others, and most importantly: demand, demand and demand again. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2) In small enterprises, the decision to purchase any software or to connect any service is made 35% more often in the evening than in large companies. <br><br>  This pushes us to the fact that in the evening, and sometimes at night, there must always be a sales manager or night support.  Do you think that a night manager just spends your money?  And in vain! <br><br>  3) About 60% of respondents trust companies that have problems, but effectively solve them.  Than companies without a single technical error. <br><br>  Such a result is caused by a person‚Äôs fear of the unknown: ‚ÄúWhat if a program stops working?  Will they fix it? ‚Äù <br><br>  4) One of the most common ‚Äúoff-topic‚Äù questions for technical support girls: ‚ÄúCan you connect me with an engineer?‚Äù <br><br>  But most of all the oil pours into the fire that such a question in 3 out of 5 cases is asked by other women! <br><br>  5) In the period from 20-00 to 24-00 the largest number of calls in which the client not only wants to solve his problem, but also to get acquainted with the girl from the support. <br><br>  Unfortunately or fortunately, similar cases with respect to men from technical support were not noticed.  Probably not considered promising guys from support. <br><br>  6) A polite and tactful specialist of technical support when talking with a client via the phone spends 20% more time than his straightforward colleague. <br><br>  This is explained by the fact that almost always a person responds faster to direct questions and commands than to offers and requests. <br><br>  7) If a company offers a trial period of any software and a person has any questions about configuration and implementation, then, as a rule, it is the technical support specialist who becomes the key person who helps the client to make the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù in favor of their software. <br><br>  People do not always trust salespeople and want to get approval for their choice from a technical specialist. <br><br>  8) On average, every third specialist who tries to work in technical support after a month receives the disease ‚Äúthe fear of a phone call‚Äù and is looking for an opportunity to change their activities to a calmer one. <br><br>  And who said that working in a support is comfortable and fun? <br><br>  And it's all.  Stay with us and make your life better! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233635/</a></p>
