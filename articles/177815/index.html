Hands-On Labs on PHDays are practical exercises that take place under the motto ‚Äúless words, more action‚Äù.  Under the guidance of information security gurus from around the world, students are deeply immersed in the topic and do practical tasks in the field of information security with their own hands.  To take part in classes, you just need to have basic training, a craving for new knowledge and bring a laptop with you. <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/177815/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e35/207/037/e352070374b54538ff8a73f1969543f4.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How to develop a secure web application and not go crazy? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e52/c36/b8f/e52c36b8f7ef08a2c9a06b0a09c5151b.jpg" align="left">  The master class is dedicated to ensuring the security of web applications throughout the development cycle.  During the lesson, practical approaches to identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities in the code developed in accordance with the recommendations of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle will be considered.  The practical lesson will be interesting for web application developers and researchers who want to gain skills in constructing secure code and analyzing the security of complex projects using the white box method.  The master class is based on Microsoft ASP.NET (Web Pages, Web Forms, MVC, Entity Framework, SignalR), however, it contains a minimum of environmental specifics and will be of interest to specialists who work with other web technologies stacks.  Different classes of vulnerabilities will be presented on examples of zero-day vulnerabilities in popular products, web engines and web-based training applications. <br><br>  In the course of the practical part, the most interesting attacks will be demonstrated, as well as all the considered techniques and methods of working with the code.
