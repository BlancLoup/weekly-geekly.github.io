  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 ways to stand out from the crowd of faceless competitor outsourcers (with examples)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In a competitive market of custom development, you need to have a highlight in order for a potential customer to want to write exactly your company.  I collected the raisins and now I will tell about them with examples of headings and texts for the landing pages. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/068/0fd/678/0680fd678757444db34997bc3ce03554.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  So, the possible benefits that you can roll out on the site to cling to potential customers: </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="1-u-nas-deshevle">  1. We have cheaper </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : developers are monstrously expensive. </p><br><p>  In one form or another, this advantage is used by almost all southern outsourcers.  But ultimately this is the path to nowhere: </p><br><p>  1) Hindu and Pakistani prices do not interrupt.  There is a limit to go below which - to work at a loss. </p><br><p>  2) Relevant customers flock to low prices.  Good development companies are doctors who can cure a client's pain.  And few in the case of a serious illness will look for the cheapest doctor.  Why are there a doctor, you can save even more by contacting the nurse.  Or consult a freshman honey.  I wrote more about this in the article <a href="https://neprostack.com/solutions-not-hands/">"How to get more leads and increase the bid, promoting solutions, and not the hands of developers</a> . <a href="https://neprostack.com/solutions-not-hands/">"</a> </p><br><p>  And yet, if in your company lovers of masochism have gathered and at an incendiary BDSM party in this honor, it was unanimously decided to fight at the price, the proposal might look like this: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed8/808/8cc/ed88088cc741418da4d1a7c7c4f78285.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="2-my-na-svyazi-v-vashi-rabochie-chasy">  2. We are in touch during your business hours. </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : the project is delayed due to disgusting communication. </p><br><p>  For many customers, the time when they can intersect with developers is critical.  And if with Europe everything is more or less ok, because the time zones are similar, then for a US customer this can be a serious deterrent. </p><br><p>  Of course, you can‚Äôt build a big competitive advantage on sleepless nights of developers, because there are Latin American countries whose time zones are the same. </p><br><p>  And yet, if you somehow solved this problem (night support, shifted schedule, etc.) - do not forget to mention it: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/b77/042/af3b77042d1b4953aadeb0f14b6395ad.png" alt="image alt text"><br>  <em>Not a fountain, of course, but nothing compared to India.</em> </p><br><h2 id="3-my-horosho-govorim-po-angliyski">  3. We speak good English </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : even if you perfectly know the requirements for your project, they cannot be conveyed to the deaf-and-dumb developer. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1eb/69e/bde/1eb69ebdebd94c95b5f50cfff34be552.jpg" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  The eternal trouble.  The advantage is also not very big (as it goes without saying that you need to know English), but it is worthy of mention if the company has solved the problem. </p><br><p>  Of course, statements alone will not be enough here.  It would be good to present evidence like "90% of Our Developers have a foreign language (TOEFL)". </p><br><h2 id="4-u-nas-kachestvennee">  4. We have better </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : after months of development, there is a product that cannot be used due to bugs. </p><br><p>  To refer to quality is a popular advantage, which is called by everyone who does not want to be "cheaper", but has not invented anything else. </p><br><p>  The problem here is clear: the word "quality" is abstract.  Each has its own.  For some, this is zero bugs, for others - "we are trying."  Therefore, do not be like this: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/f79/0e1/e46f790e142d4c9b838aa23005a708aa.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  How to prove that your company is not only in the words of Leo Tolstoy? </p><br><p>  Options: </p><br><p>  1) The company is certified for any standard: <br>  Top Mobile App Developers.  Quality confirmed by ISO-xxx standard. </p><br><p>  2) The company has good grades in an independent rating: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/598/a60/4a0/598a604a0e9c4cd1b5a32b5276acbce3.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  3) Any other indicators with numbers that indicate good quality.  For example, in TopTal: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/633/719/5bd633719ed8472ead3b32546f7d4b3f.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="5-my-delaem-bystro">  5. We do fast </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : the development is so delayed that the project loses its relevance. </p><br><p>  The speed is good, if the main customers are startups in the early stages, for which it is important to enter the market as quickly as possible.  Here is how the headline may look like: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/580/866/0a4/5808660a46b14afcbe738940ce815b9a.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="6-my--izvestnaya-i-respektabelnaya-kompaniya">  6. We are a well-known and respectable company. </h2><br><p>  <strong>Customer pain</strong> : I do not want to trust an obscure contractor who is the first day on the market. </p><br><p>  A well-known name allows you to establish trust, put up higher prices and entertain self-esteem.  Of course, building a brand is a long, painful and expensive process.  And the brand is not a five star rating at Apvorka.  Life hacking: </p><br><p>  1) Show a list of famous clients.  With this we pinch off a piece of their glory: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a4/3c3/a2f/4a43c3a2f6684a0e807b3de861966232.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  2) Show the block "As seen on" (or "Featured in").  In this section there are logos of authoritative media in which they wrote about you.  Or at least mentioned.  Or at least referred to one of the articles.  Like this: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/8db/0dc/5698db0dca884c6e914d10eeea62fb54.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  3) Mention partnerships with well-known companies: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2b/542/277/b2b54227724a4e67927b296ae64bdbce.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="7-my--nadezhnaya-kompaniya-orientirovannaya-na-dolgosrochnoe-sotrudnichestvo">  7. We are a reliable company focused on long-term cooperation. </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client</strong> : the contractor will disappear with a prepayment or make nonsense - and look for his fistula later. </p><br><p> For enterprises, there is nothing worse than hiring developers who go into the sunset at the first opportunity. </p><br><p>  How to designate that you are not such: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bb/591/745/9bb5917454064b508a1592b7f4eccc38.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="8-opyt-v-vashey-industrii">  8. Experience in your industry </h2><br><p>  <strong>The pain of the client:</strong> developers will have to pay for the time while they will enter the scope of the customer. </p><br><p>  This is a serious advantage: </p><br><p>  1) The customer understands that someone else has paid for the bumps you have stuffed. </p><br><p>  2) You can better understand business goals and speak the same language with the customer. </p><br><p>  Usually, the narrower the specialization, the higher the conversion to leads and orders (but also the fewer potential customers).  At the same time, no one bothers to be positioned by experts in several areas at once (if there is a relevant experience).  How it might look: </p><br><p>  A) Industry / Domain Expertise.  For example: healthcare, logistics, marketing: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3f/af7/226/c3faf72267bf49e6a7aa7b8e9379345d.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  B) Focus on a narrow niche: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/456/cee/231/456cee23112b4643aa0c306ae2e31e1a.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="9-opyt-v-produktah-i-tehnologiyah">  9. Experience in products and technologies. </h2><br><p>  <strong>Client's pain</strong> : to hire freshly hatched chicks who are only capable of Hello World. </p><br><p>  Stab-rattling is a traditional advantage, which is often not an advantage at all, but simply the first thing they talk about and demonstrate to customers: </p><br><ul><li><p>  "We develop iOS Apps since 1892" </p><br></li><li>  "Each of our developers has 40 years of experience in Ruby on Rails" </li></ul><br><p>  The problem of this positioning - so they all do.  As a result, exposing the experience of working with most standard technologies as an advantage is the same as a runner showing off the presence of two legs. </p><br><p>  What to do?  To act as experts in more rare products and technologies. </p><br><p>  There is an easy way to find out which technologies and products are growing in interest.  Here it is: Go to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> and drive in the keyword of interest to us: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce5/0f5/2f8/ce50f52f8f334a8d8c4bc287b6fb3e1a.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  This way you can catch growing directions.  Of course, Google Trends only show the relative popularity of queries.  You can find out the exact numbers by typing a request into the AdWords Keyword Planner: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/306/4c1/5bb/3064c15bb0254edebe89cf8d96576315.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="10-my-reshaem-problemy-biznesa">  10. We solve business problems </h2><br><p>  <strong>Customer pain:</strong> developers only think about the beauty of the code.  And the fact that the result will be from the point of view of the user, they do not care. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d56/8d2/a60/d568d2a60b014825a86c74bbbda79c61.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><p>  Here is an uncultivated field in order to become different.  Software is not ordered just like that, it should always solve some business problems.  Although, of course, sometimes the problem is how to cut the budget. </p><br><p>  And just in this work with the true needs of businesses (and not just with the cut), many outsourcers are weak - they would have to float the javista of T &amp; M for years, and there the grass will not grow. </p><br><p>  How to do here: </p><br><p>  1) Make a list of business problems that are solved by software developed by you. </p><br><p>  2) To tell on the website, in the blog, in cold letters that you know how to solve these problems.  For example: </p><br><ul><li><p>  We help Logistics companies reduce labor costs with custom resources planning systems </p><br></li><li>  We help retailers increase online sales by developing mobile apps: </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/750/fe3/60b/750fe360b6534889ae5b53e42a28cf53.png" alt="image alt text"></p><br><h2 id="vyvody">  Findings: </h2><br><p>  <strong>1.</strong> In a competitive market, it is important to properly positioned to separate from the crowd of faceless competitors. </p><br><p>  <strong>2.</strong> The emphasis on low prices and abstract "quality" is not the best way to stand out. </p><br><p>  <strong>3.</strong> Even if you have already figured out what to bet on, you need to properly pack your positioning in the texts and presentations. </p><br><p>  <strong>4.</strong> But just packing is not enough either.  The stated benefits must be consistent. </p></div>
