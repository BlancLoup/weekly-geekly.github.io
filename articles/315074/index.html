But, perhaps, I‚Äôm still taking the risk and will continue. <br><br>  So, continuing to argue on the topic ‚Äúwhy we are not doing what we ourselves should be doing,‚Äù I came to one more conclusion: we are not doing what we planned because we are trying to do more than we are capable of at this stage of our development. . <br><br>  In short - we set ourselves too difficult tasks, even when it seems to us that this is not so.  And in fact, we now want a lot more simple things.

      I understand that, perhaps, you consider your tasks and so not too complex.  But the facts suggest otherwise.  If the tasks were not too complex, you would not have problems to deal with them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, everyone would like to instantly become overactive workaholics (by work here is meant not necessarily work, but in general any activity in which you want to succeed).  However, unfortunately, this does not happen.  Each person is at a certain level of development and can not jump over the steps.  It should start with something small enough and accessible to you. <br><br>  That is, trying to choose a task that you definitely want and will do - start with the simplest.  At least, with more simple than you now plan to do, but do not start. <br><br>  Such an approach will in fact greatly facilitate your life.  He will allow you to live without strain, without knowingly unsuccessful struggle with yourself, without losing time on useless attempts.  Agree, it is better to start doing simple things than not doing anything at all. <br><br>  And, of course, you will not have to remain at a primitive level forever.  As you master this level, you will become more accessible.  And you already really want to master it, and begin to master it. <br><br>  And I repeat once again - do not consider yourself supermen.  No one ever became super-efficient or super-difficult instantly, no one jumped over his head, no one was recognized as a genius from infancy.  A teacher who tries to interpret a first-grader to a higher mathematician, without training him enough even in arithmetic, would be quite rightly considered a fool. <br><br>  Start with what is available to you, no matter how primitive it is.  And then you will discover what is currently unavailable to you. <br><br>  Just not right away. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315074/</a></p>
