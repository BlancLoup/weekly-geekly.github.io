  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Possibilities of outdoor 3G / 4G antennas for increasing data transfer speed in mobile networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day, we had the opportunity to test 3G and 4G antennas near Peter, which we decided to use. <br><br>  We have a good signal of the mobile Internet, but only on the second floor of a private house, and since the office is downstairs on the other side of the house, it was not very inconvenient to use mobile benefits.  Therefore, it was decided to investigate the capabilities of modern equipment, namely, to check the capabilities of remote 3G / 4G outdoor antennas in obtaining a higher-quality communication channel between the nearest base station and a USB modem, then transfer it to a Wi-Fi router for distribution, and start using a cable in the office to the main computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the equipment in the experiment took part: <br>  - Antenna street / room panel URSA 4G (2300-2700 MHz, 18 dB, 31 * 31 * 2.2 cm, N-female); <br>  - Antenna street parabolic LIBRA 3G (1920-2170 MHz, 21 dB, 90 * 60 cm, N-female); <br>  - USB-modem Megaphone M-150-1; <br>  - 5 meter cable assembly 5D-FB with N-connectors, Aileron 5m-5D-FB; <br>  - Pigtail adapter for Aileron-CRC-9-N-female modem. <br><br>  Much has been written about the modem, a good model, we like it with the ability to connect MIMO antennas, but in our antenna test without support for MIMO capabilities.

      For the 4G range, we will use the URSA 4G antenna, compact, neat, mounted on the bracket in our case, there is a bracket under the mast.  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/966/ec5/7b8966ec50ba40489730b63b0b085a2d.jpg"><br><br>  For the 3G range, we use the huge parabolic antenna LIBRA 3G, it resembles a military locator with a width <br>  lattice 90 cm!  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a78/ee6/012/a78ee60127844936b6bd98fa961ec7e1.jpg"><br><br>  Technical access to the facade / visor of the house was possible only from one side, which limited our ability to select the base station of the operator, but judging by the open information from the resource OpenCellID.org, 4 km from the installation point of the outdoor antenna there are several base stations of the operator Megaphone -SZ.  We are completely satisfied with this option, because the theoretical coverage radius of 3G / 4G is 8-10 km, which means we are 100% in the normal coverage area, below the map. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73d/935/db7/73d935db727e41bfa7ba77972477695d.jpg"><br><br>  You can also use FindTower applications for the iPhone or the Internet resource netmonitor.ru. <br><br>  The main goal and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãall these resources is to show users the location of the equipment of mobile operators on a map of the area. <br><br>  Before starting our dances with tambourines, I would like to say a few words about the mobile Internet.  Few people realize this, but mobile Internet traffic for cellular network operators is not a priority activity, moreover, in some cases the transfer of digital data, the Internet or video is a zero-income business for them, and sometimes even unprofitable.  The main source of income for them is voice connections, everything else is additional options, marketing moves and prestige positions.  That is why the operators set up all their equipment so that, first of all, they meet the needs of voice connections, and the rest is already allowed on Internet traffic, etc., moreover, the operators capture the traffic of their base stations and its consumers, therefore, when you get access to mobile Internet, use it wisely, because the operator can selectively limit your speed, or the number of digital channels in your base station sector and will be absolutely right, as its technical capabilities, costs and  moves he can be considered the best of us. <br><br>  So, before connecting the portable parabolic antenna LIBRA 3G, we had the following picture with the connection and data transfer rate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e00/37c/4dd/e0037c4dd5224ff190a23b92252c90a1.jpg"><br><br>  Before connecting the URSA 4G panel antenna, we had: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/605/279/5bc/6052795bc9f04b75ad39740d3468425b.jpg"><br><br>  The antenna placement is a very important and crucial task; ideally, this should be done with a manual spectrum analyzer in order to see the live signal, so to speak, identify your base station and tune to the maximum level.  If there is no radio spectrum analyzer, you cannot do without a tambourine, modem and cell phone.  We had a small distance from the base station, so we coped with the choice of the angle and direction using the built-in utility in the megaphone software, this turned out to be enough.  But if the signal level is weaker, look for a spectrum analyzer. <br><br>  So, in the end, we got on the 3G band: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/e8e/cf6/ad5e8ecf6414493ab32e2b1af173e758.jpg"><br><br>  And on the 4G range: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f3/255/b67/1f3255b67c3b4b1ea577e410c4af444f.jpg"><br><br>  We were pleased with the results, especially considering the compactness of the 4G antenna and the resulting speed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249737/</a></p>
