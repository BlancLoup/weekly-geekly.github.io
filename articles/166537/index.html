An expert in a subject area uses a visual tool (similar to PowerPoint or even a converter from PowerPoint) to create a small training course and a final exam (with automatic or manual verification of results).  The training application is packaged and made available for download to customer devices.  For each of the platforms, a single application player is implemented, which is also a client for the Knowledge Market (the working title of the project).  The client provides decoding, offline tutoring, payments, integration with social networks and other services. <br>  The market provides ratings, reviews, reviews, advertising courses, free samples, partner and corporate programs, custom courses, etc. <br><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody><tr><td>  Comparison </td><td>  &lt;Platform&gt; Store </td><td>  Knowledge market </td></tr><tr><td>  Lecture hall </td><td>  Platform Users </td><td>  Users of all platforms </td></tr><tr><td>  Developers </td><td>  Platform Developers </td><td>  Domain Experts <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Threshold of entry </td><td>  Tall </td><td>  Low </td></tr><tr><td>  A variety of visual tools </td><td>  Unlimited </td><td>  Limited </td></tr></tbody></table><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Project idea </h4><br>  Create a market for learning applications, then - tutorials / courses that can be created by experts in applied areas with the help of a visual tool, analogue of PowerPoint. <br>  At the first stage of the project development, a converter from PowerPoint can be used.

    <h4>  Distinctive features of the project </h4><br>  It differs from existing application markets: <br><ul><li>  lack of requirements for the author of knowledge of technology development </li><li>  low course creation costs </li><li>  simplified moderation scheme </li></ul><br>  It differs from online training courses markets: <br><ul><li>  a small amount of educational material in one application </li><li>  low prices </li><li>  lack of requirements for the purchase of specialized tools for creating and hosting courses </li><li>  low course creation costs </li><li>  wider range of knowledge and skills provided </li></ul><br>  It differs from the service of publishing presentations and podcasts: <br><ul><li>  availability of infrastructure and commercial model of remuneration of authors </li><li>  encryption, proof of authorship and copying restrictions </li><li>  the presence of a developed system of knowledge control, learned by the consumer </li><li>  possibility to order required courses </li></ul><br>  From paid gifts in social networks, the market for gaming items, the Bitcoin market, the market for sekulek: <br><ul><li>  independent potential value of the purchased product </li></ul><br><h4>  Commercial model </h4><br>  Authors can publish their courses, users can buy the right to use courses.  The server and client parts provide encryption and protection of courses against pirated copies.  The author may provide additional, interactive services to the course (for example, manual checking of answers and reviewing). <br>  The author receives most of the payment made by the user of the course. <br>  The author can independently distribute advertising for his course. <br>  The market provides paid promotional tools for promoting courses. <br>  The market provides a rating service for courses, authors, students.  Provides feedback gathering, moderation courses.  Provides free zone self-moderation. <br>  The market provides free limited piloting courses. <br>  The market publishes free, shareware, donated courses, courses with advertising. <br>  The market allows you to publish orders for courses with different payment models. <br><br><h4>  Protection against unauthorized copying </h4><br>  For copy protection, the course is encrypted for each client with an individual key.  The player provides decoding and playback of the course. <br>  Information about the successful completion of the course is stored on the server and is published using widgets to selected online services by the user (so-called aivki).  Accordingly, even if the course is copied by pirates, the user will not be able to get marks about the course due to the absence of a mark about payment on the service.  The services provided by the author of the course are also unavailable to pirates. <br>  For greater protection, processing of answers to the examination part can be carried out on the service side, by transferring unique encrypted packages by the client, which eliminates successful certification on pirated courses. <br>  This protection scheme is patented. <br><br>  The million in the title is an estimate of the initial investment.  Turnovers in this market will be billions of dollars. <br><br>  And what course could you personally create? <br><br>  UPD.  Friends, please answer the survey, I want to understand what I don‚Äôt like - the idea itself or the article in general and the fact of its appearance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166537/</a></p>
