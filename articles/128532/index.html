  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of educational social network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article inspired me to write the current one.  Let me remind you that it said about the optimization of the educational process, its improvement, or rather, even that the approach to education is outdated.  However, first of all it was not to this that I noticed, I did not think about it.  And over, "how with the help of the WWW to carry the <i>desire to learn</i> to the masses?" <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is to use social networks in some way, since it is in them that schoolchildren and students spend most of their online leisure time (or just free time, who else).  But the second thought supplants the first, saying that this task is too voluminous. <br><br>  Well, then you have to create your own educational social network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br><ol><li>  I think everyone knows how important education and breadth of horizons are, because we leave the first paragraph conditionally empty; </li><li>  No matter how silly it may sound, but this resource will be especially useful for pupils of lower grades.  Registering a fifth-grader and his activity in the future will provide an opportunity to see his disposition to something.  The overall picture will be clear and before your eyes.  This will facilitate the task of entering universities, and the likelihood to open up and do your favorite business will increase; </li><li>  As already mentioned, the task is quite voluminous.  I would even say, it is proportional to the number of sciences, pseudoscience, morals and religions combined, because it does not fit in user javacript or in the Vkontakte application </li></ol><br><h4>  What will be in it? </h4><br><ol><li>  Profile and the opportunity to be friends.  Where do without it? </li><li>  News feed; </li><li>  Forms of choice of familiar sections of science, studied laws and theorems, up to the knowledge of the method of solving certain types of equations; </li><li>  The ability to celebrate the knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äãup to the studied rules of grammar; </li><li>  Read books, both art and technical or popular science; </li><li>  Books with which the user is familiar, unfinished books; </li><li>  Familiar religious tenets; </li><li>  Famous user biographies of famous figures; </li><li>  Historical facts known to the user; </li><li>  Clickable, for example, laws and theorems with reference to Wikipedia or other resources for the possibility of detailed information. </li></ol><br>  Of course, I am not able to describe all the content in several points, so we‚Äôll stop.

      Some of these pieces of knowledge (for example, Newton's laws, as they are in ordinary and differential form) are proposed to be assessed on a scale.  I think it is best to use a three-point one: bad, medium, good.  Although the assessment will be subjective and exaggerated, it will contribute to the most adequate display of the actual knowledge of the user. <br><br><h4>  How? </h4><br>  Details of the technical implementation omit.  Much more interesting is how to solve a series of problems listed below. <br><br><h5>  How to attract an audience? </h5><br>  First of all, you need to introduce a fashion for the mind, to destroy the old school stereotype of the ‚Äúbotan‚Äù.  This is almost the most important and most difficult task.  When a resource is working, it can be solved only after some, most likely large, period of time. <br><br>  Perhaps it is absurd, but parents can help with this, namely with their still great influence on the children's mind.  And to direct the advertisement of the resource to the parents, reflecting the usefulness of registering their child on the site. <br><br><h5>  How to motivate a user to fill out their profile and learn? </h5><br>  I think that original instructions can help here.  For example, the user noted that he learned Newton's first law.  Immediately there is a notice: "There are 2 laws left before mastering the basics of classical mechanics."  A kind of achivment.  I believe that congenital curiosity will force you to look at the other 2 laws, but the matter will not end there.  A notice will immediately appear: ‚ÄúYou have mastered the basics of classical mechanics.  This makes it possible to study the law of conservation of energy. ‚Äù  As a tree of character development in the game. <br><br>  Another lever of influence is character traits.  For example, boasting: ‚ÄúLook, how cool I am, I know what the principle of superposition is!‚Äù Or the desire to be first: ‚ÄúYeah, he read‚Äú The amount of technology ‚Äù.  I need it too".  Or something else. <br><br><h5>  How to check the accuracy of the information entered by the user? </h5><br>  No  This is basically not necessary.  After all, the main goal is to draw a person‚Äôs attention to information, to knowledge, to its abundance, so that the user drowns in it, to view it day after day.  And so that one day he did find the knowledge that he was really interested in. <br><br>  Everything is damp, only thoughts.  Perhaps nonsense.  But nobody canceled the discussion, did it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128532/</a></p>
