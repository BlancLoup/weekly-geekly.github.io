There are a lot of articles and a thousand examples on the Internet on this topic.  But it seemed to us that nobody said the most important thing, and therefore we wanted to make for you detailed, intelligible, and most importantly, honest leadership. <br><br><h1>  What to write </h1><br>  In Western culture, CV is called CV - Curriculum Vitae, then translated from Latin means ‚Äúbiography‚Äù.  And the truth is: from your resume, a potential employer should form an impression not just about your previous career path, but also about what you are as a person.  On the other hand, the interest in this very person from a person who reads your resume is by no means idle.  It is important for him to understand whether you are up to the <b>spirit of the</b> company, whether you can share its <b>values</b> and cope with your future <b>responsibilities</b> .

      <br>
      Try to reflect <b>not what you did, but what you did</b> - talk about the result, about your achievements.  And you need to focus on specifics, ideally - on numbers.  For example, write not just "He was the SMM-manager of several Vkontakte groups", but bring proof of his professionalism: "Over the week, I increased the number of subscribers by 10 thousand people."  If you worked in consulting, remember everything and write: "Successfully implemented 9 consulting projects: 5 for FMCG companies, 3 for oil and gas enterprises and 1 pro bono for city administration." <br><br>  What to do to those whose work was routine and by definition could not bring tangible results?  Focus on the fact that you performed everything <b>perfectly</b> .  For example: ‚ÄúDuring my work as an assistant accountant, the company has successfully passed 2 audits‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, your CV should reflect: <br><br>  1. <b>First Name and Last Name.</b>  You do not have to specify the age, but can you be shy?  Specifying the floor usually looks ridiculous, because most often it is easily established from the name, and still occupies an extra line. <br><br>  2. Here, closer to the beginning, indicate your <b>contacts</b> - telephone number, e-mail address (decent, strict, established on a good postal service).  A sign of good taste will be left here and a link to your business profile on LinkedIn.  By the way, <b>give a link to your profiles on Facebook and Vkontakte</b> - if, of course, they are generally decent.  Most likely, your name will be ‚Äúpushed‚Äù through social networks - so why not make it easier for an HR manager to work? <br><br>  3. In the <b>experience</b> block <b>,</b> place all your past posts in reverse chronological order.  Write not only the names of companies and their positions in them, but also, very briefly, your official duties without any extra ‚Äúwater‚Äù, only the most important experience that can be useful to you in a potential new job.  Be sure to specify the duration of stay in each position.  But bear in mind: non-permanent workers, who often jump from place to place, cause only distrust in the personnel department - therefore, if you have changed eight places of work over the last year, tell me only about a couple of the most important ones.  This is not a lie: you just singled out the key and did not divert attention to the insignificant. <br><br>  4. Give information about your <b>education</b> - do not start with a preparatory school, indicate at once the key one - bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees, maybe even your academic degree.  Try to fill in the <b>additional education</b> column - courses, webinars, summer schools that gave you the right experience.  Here it is necessary to note that you participated or even won in specific case-championships - the HR of large companies are increasingly paying much attention to this. <br><br>  5. If you still have very little experience and achievements, tell me about your <b>skills</b> .  Describe what software you can work with, what languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou speak and what work you do best. <br><br>  6. Pay close attention to the preparation of the section on <b>hobbies</b> .  It is he who best describes you not as an employee-machine, but as a versatile, talented person with whom it will be interesting to work.  Be careful not to point out here frankly marginal and socially dangerous hobbies (Although who does not have them? A joke).  But do not try to fit everything into a job - in the resume of the trainee in the audit department, the line about love of paragliding will look much brighter than a hint that you like calculators.  Potential colleagues are pleased to learn already at the summary stage that you can discuss the best slopes for riding on the board, for example, or where it is better to show.  In addition, it is no secret that many hobbies will tell more about you than you do.  Consider for yourself what the phrases from the summary ‚ÄúThe winner of the marathon We Run Moscow 2014 at a distance of 10 km‚Äù can say to you or ‚ÄúI take a great interest in gadgets.  Disassembled and assembled iPhone 6. Works. "  The main rule is at the very end and briefly. <br><br><h1>  How to structure </h1><br>  The most important aspect of your resume is its structure.  It must be very clear, logical and practical.  How to achieve this? <br><br>  Especially for you, we have drawn a perfect layout from the point of view of the structure of the resume - look at the picture carefully, remember well and use this template as soon as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3b5/3de/7a5/3b53de7a58c64e107f25ccdb68503340.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And now we will explain in more detail: <br><br>  1. Immediately after your name and contact information, bring <b>Career Summary</b> : an excerpt from all that you write below.  In this column you have to answer the questions: who are you, what are you doing and what are your advantages?  Few add a Career Summary to your resume - and that‚Äôs what it will show you is a competent person who can highlight the most important and respectful HR staff. <br><br>  2. Next comes the <b>Work Experience</b> block.  In it, you must indicate in the reverse order your previous jobs.  It should look like this: the name of the company, your position in it, years of work;  scope of the company;  your achievements in the company. <br><br>  3. Then, also in the reverse order, tell about your education.  The structure is about the same: university, your degree, years of study, your specialization. <br><br>  4. Finally, go to <b>Additional Information</b> .  First of all, tell about your leadership qualities and participation in various clubs and student organizations (relevant for a vacancy, of course).  Indicate which contests and case-championships you took part in and what you achieved in them.  Tell us about your level of knowledge of languages, and then go to the hobby.  And remember: structure, structure, clear structure! <br><br>  Board of HR-director of Changellenge &gt;&gt; Elena Chizhenkova: <br><br><blockquote>  Your resume will read until the end of 10% Eycharov.  Therefore, immediately start with the main and write about key and relevant things.  In other words, if you want to become a strategy consultant, you should not write in the first lines of the summary that you have led projects in operational consulting.  Write about your experience in strategic consulting at the very beginning, even if its volume is less than in the operational one. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  How to make </h1><br><br>  There is nothing worse than an unstructured summary with a broken narrative logic.  Although no, there is: an unstructured summary with disturbed logic of the narrative and an ugly layout.  Half of the time you spend on a resume should go to his ‚Äúcombing‚Äù - formatting and strict decoration. <br><br>  What to do: <br><br>  1. Fit everything <b>into one page</b> .  It is necessary that all your undoubted merits are easily seized by one quick glance, without turning the page.  With a probability of 99%, no one will see the second page of your CV at all. <br><br>  2. Make sure that the font is readable and pleasing to the eye, so that the line spacing does not change from line to line, and the alignment of the text in different paragraphs is the same.  In general, <b>format</b> everything so as not to irritate the reader's eyes. <br><br>  3. Add stylish, but strict <b>details</b> that will distinguish your resume from a bunch of others.  No kittens, monograms and colorful ornaments, unless you pretend to the position of the main creative artist - but in this case, it is better to show your creative beginning in the attached portfolio.  Add a couple of bright accents, concise dividers - and the page will take on a much more professional look. <br><br>  4. If you want, insert a suitable <b>photo</b> - the text with illustrations is better fixed in the memory of the reader.  You do not need to use your child‚Äôs snapshot from the zoo or scan passport photos.  Just insert a photo that best expresses all that you wrote in the text itself. <br><br>  5. When it seems to you that the resume is already completely ready, <b>set it aside for a couple of days</b> , and then carefully deduct it.  Most likely, you will find a couple of typos and absurdities that you will not see right away. <br><br>  Take a look at the illustration below - we give it as an example of a resume, very successful for those who are just starting their careers.  It is very visual and infographic, and, moreover, it is well structured and tastefully decorated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f09/7ac/989/f097ac98985c72da7f6e72328450867b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The strengths of this template is to take advantage of those who still have little experience of real work.  Here a lot of attention is paid to specific skills, personal qualities, experience of part-time work and listened to courses.  Such a resume describes its owner as an accurate, thorough person who knows how much and is already ready to become a full-fledged employee of the company. <br><br>  And another important note: the author of the example we cited is remarkably laconic - which means that he is able to single out the most important thing and appreciates the time of his potential employers. <br><br>  Board of HR-director of Changellenge &gt;&gt; Elena Chizhenkova: <br><br><blockquote>  Use simple words and constructions, and people will reach for the phone to call and meet you.  Find everyone understandable easy words, replacing professional terms.  Time to boast that you know them, you will have an interview.  Take it as a rule: one sentence with a maximum of one line.  Thereby you will reduce the risks that a person will not understand the essence of what has been written and will not finish reading to the end.  And simplicity and ease - it's just nice. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  How to send </h1><br><br>  When sending your resume, remember that it is only attached to the letter.  If you incorrectly write the letter itself, it may not be read, not opened at all, or simply not seen in the mail.  Do not forget to indicate in the subject line that you are applying for a certain position. <br><br>  The main part of the message will be a cover letter.  Don't be a spammer who makes up one resume, copies one letter and sends it to everyone.  The spammer‚Äôs approach will, of course, give you more reach, but you will get significantly less feedback.  It's simple: your letter makes it clear how much time you spent collecting information and preparing.  And this, in turn, demonstrates the motivation and ability to analyze.  In general, if the summary is done somehow, and the letter says simply ‚ÄúI will come to you,‚Äù they are unlikely to be answered. <br><br>  Approach each letter individually, behave not as a spammer, but as a marketer.  What is meant by this? <br><br>  1. Do not write a letter in the style of "Dear editors!".  Call <b>by name</b> to the person who will read the letter - for example, the director of the HR department.  Finding out what his name is today is easy - look for a name in the job description, on the company's website, conduct a micro-investigation on Facebook and on LinkedIn. <br><br>  2. Show that you are interested <b>in this particular job</b> .  Key points that prove that you are an ideal candidate can be duplicated in the subject of the letter.  No need to write about the fact that you have always dreamed of connecting your life with the sphere of taxation: less pathos, more pragmatics. <br><br>  3. Explain why you would like to start work <b>in this company</b> .  Unobtrusively demonstrate your awareness of her position in the market, status and bright cases, but in no case do not begin to sing the praises.  The one who will read your letter should understand that you are well-versed in the matter, respect the company and want to cooperate with it. <br><br>  4. The same <b>individual approach</b> must be applied when adjusting your <b>resume</b> .  Before each dispatch, make sure that your resume is the most suitable for a specific job.  Depending on it, bring one experience to the fore, emphasize certain skills.  Even the section on your personal qualities and hobbies should periodically undergo some adjustments depending on the corporate values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company.  Your emotionality, artistry and ability to sing will be useful for the creative department of an advertising agency, but Eichar of a commercial bank is unlikely to like them. <br><br>  5. Let's return to the letter.  Just in case, we remind: be <b>polite and benevolent</b> !  Do not forget to say hello, say goodbye and generally behave decently - oddly enough, a number of candidates do not understand the importance of this aspect at all.  But do not go too far, do not scatter in apologies and all sorts of "many thanks in advance, have a good day, evening and the next night."  All this is a superfluous text that does not have much meaning, but it tires the person who reads it. <br><br>  Board of HR-director of Changellenge &gt;&gt; Elena Chizhenkova: <br><br><blockquote>  Invest time in exploring corporate chips and company features, including researching a recruiter's profile on LinkedIn.  This will give you a lot of information to create an effective tool, and besides, you will have reasons for additional communication with the same recruiter or company managers, say, at the bottom of a career. </blockquote><br><br>  We deliberately do not offer you ready-made solutions: ready-made means universal, that is, devoid of individuality, meaningfulness, and none at all.  Practice, make in view of our advice not one resume, but three, five - each next will only be better.
