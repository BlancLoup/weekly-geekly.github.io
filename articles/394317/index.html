  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to stay in shape while working in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Stories about cheeses of 500 hryvnia, luxury-lunches and night parties as components of the life of a typical representative of the IT-industry are greatly embellished.  Rather, it is worth talking about coffee on the McDrive, late dinners and the incessant flow of deadlines and all sorts of household and household concerns.  If you still manage to find time for a snack, then nothing remains for the sport: just a few minutes, 50% of desire and 25% of forces.  As a result - health problems that negatively affect not only the workflow, but also the quality of life in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/228/e05/359/228e05359a1547c19bd4d2668395393c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Riddle number 1: why in 27 years, I feel at 72?</b> <br><br>  <i>Alexander Bogoyavlensky, Director of Health Care Department in Plarium:</i> <br>  ‚ÄúHypodynamia (low mobility) and poor nutrition are one of the main causes of disease among IT specialists.  Most often, there are back problems, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular system, decreased visual acuity and dry eye syndrome. 
      <br>

      <br>
      And the most important thing that hypodynamia is dangerous is the diseases of the musculoskeletal system: spinal curvature, osteochondrosis, as well as inflammation of the tendons of the hands and fingers, as a result of working with the keyboard and mouse. <br><br>  <b>Riddle number 2: what if I'm allergic to sports?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúBefore embarking on sports activities, it is necessary to do a cardiogram and undergo a comprehensive examination by a therapist.  According to the results of the examination, the doctor will either give access to attend training sessions, or schedule additional consultations with other specialists. <br>  If there are no contraindications, you can safely start classes.  The main thing to remember is that training should be comprehensive, it is imperative to include a warm-up and preferably cardiovascular exercise. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Riddle number 3: how to improve health quickly?</b> <br><br>  With this (well, almost) question, almost 50% of all employees address our trainer, Cyril.  They have a vacation, sea, beach or an important event ahead of them, on which they want to look and feel 100%. <br><br>  The trainer develops the course individually, depending on the medical indicators of human health and the goals he sets for himself.  If there are no contraindications, and you want to get (or regain the lost) fitness, you need a couple of months of training and a special set of exercises. <br>  We were not the first to equip the gym directly in the office.  But in order for classes to bring results and enjoyment, everything must be carefully considered: from organizing comfortable changing rooms and showers to consulting with doctors and a trainer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99d/fdb/18c/99dfdb18c12e4e3ba6b92aa270d5625a.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Cyril Rudenko, Coach in Plarium:</i> <br>  ‚ÄúI advise both boys and girls to circular training.  It will help in a short time to lose weight, gain muscle relief and just feel toned.  And all because in one workout all the major muscle groups are worked out. <br><br>  In addition, this method is effective for both beginners and experienced athletes who are focused on solving various problems: drying, the development of endurance and strength.  One round consists of 6-10 exercises that are performed sequentially in a single approach.  Exercises develop different parts of the body, each of them has a certain number of repetitions or is performed for a certain period of time. <br><br>  Between the exercises of one lap, take a 20-30 second break, and after completing each lap, rest for 2-3 minutes and recover your breath.  One workout can include from 2 to 6 laps and last from 30 to 60 minutes. " <br><br>  A set of exercises for guys and for girls is somewhat different: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Example of training for a man</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>1. Twisting in a simulator for the press (x20).</b> <br><br>  Work straight and oblique abdominal muscles. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: you are sitting on the machine, your legs are under the roller, your arms are bent at a right angle and hold the handles; <br>  ‚Ä¢ while exhaling, twist the torso smoothly; <br>  ‚Ä¢ while inhaling, return to almost the initial position, but not to the end. <br><br>  Important!  During the exercise, do not relax the press completely, but rather ‚Äúslow down‚Äù the movement back with the abdominal muscles and, again straining it, move down. <br><br>  <b>2. Squats with a barbell on the back (x12).</b> <br><br>  Work the gluteus maximus, quadriceps, the posterior group of the thigh muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscle. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: place the heels at a distance slightly wider than the shoulders, turn the toes outward by about 35 degrees; <br>  ‚Ä¢ place the vulture on your shoulders, holding it with your hands at a distance wider than your shoulders, your elbows back; <br>  ‚Ä¢ move the shoulder blades; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when squatting, the body flexes in the pelvic and knee joints, the back is moved forward, and the weight is transferred to the heels; <br>  ‚Ä¢ tighten the press (to support the back); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Return to the starting position. <br><br>  Important!  Control your breathing throughout the exercise.  When lowering down, we try to move a little slower than up, while taking a deep breath, and when moving up a sharp exhale - this allows us to work out the respiratory muscles and expand the volume of the chest. <br><br>  Also make sure that the back always remains straight and there is a slight natural deflection in the lower back.  This allows you to reduce the load on your back and transfer to the gluteal muscles and quadriceps. <br><br>  <b>3. Bench press on a horizontal bench (X12).</b> <br><br>  The following muscle groups are involved: the pectoralis major, the front bundle of the deltoid muscle, and the triceps. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Starting position: Lay down on a horizontal bench, buttocks should be pressed to the surface of the bench.  Put your feet on the floor; <br>  ‚Ä¢ independently or with the help of a partner, remove the bar from the racks; <br>  ‚Ä¢ with a smooth, controlled movement, lower the barbell to the middle or upper chest; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when contacting with a powerful breast, squeeze the barbell upwards; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Complete the scheduled number of reps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61c/e93/dc8/61ce93dc8af74712861903618b0ac5bf.jpg"><br><br>  It is important to have three points of support: heels, buttocks and shoulder blades.  Be sure to warm up well before exercise, and do heavy weights only with insurance. <br><br>  <b>4. Rod rod to the belt, rod rod handle or T-neck.</b>  <b>(x12).</b> <br><br>  Work the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, round, posterior bundle of the deltoid muscle and biceps. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: stand with an inclination of a completely flat back and preservation of the natural bend in the lower back, with slightly bent legs at the knees: <br>  ‚Ä¢ on the inhale (effort) we begin to pull the neck towards us; <br>  ‚Ä¢ at the end point, you need to squeeze the muscles of the back, connecting the shoulder blades; <br>  ‚Ä¢ exhaling, it is necessary to slowly return the weight to its original position, not allowing it to touch the floor / platform of the simulator. <br><br>  Note: if the exercise is performed with a conventional barbell, it is worth taking a bottom grip to shift the emphasis on the biceps and back muscles, rather than work, loading the forearm and hand while working with the top grip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/904/8dd/3e19048dde8f4dbba3c81a24321aa308.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. Leg press in the simulator (x15).</b> <br><br>  Quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscle work. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: back and buttocks pressed to the bench, knees bent, feet pressed to the platform; <br>  ‚Ä¢ down - deep breath and slow lowering of the simulator; <br>  ‚Ä¢ up - strong exhalation. <br><br>  Important: do not tear off the spine and buttocks from the bench, but do not pull your knees down or straighten them to the end. <br><br>  <b>6. Dumbbell bench press on the bench at an angle of 35-45 degrees (x15).</b> <br><br>  The exercise involves the middle and anterior bundle of the deltoid muscle, the triceps, and the pectoralis major muscle with an emphasis on its upper bundle. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: back and buttocks pressed to the bench, knees bent, feet pressed to the platform; <br>  ‚Ä¢ bend arms in elbows, at the same time spreading dumbbells to a level below the bench;  concentrate on the load in the pectoral muscles; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when moving dumbbells down, take a deep breath, up - a sharp exhalation. <br><br>  Important!  Hands and forearms when lowering should be at right angles to the floor. <br><br>  <b>7. Pull-ups on the horizontal bar (x15).</b> <br><br>  Work the biceps, the latissimus dorsi, large round and trapezius muscles. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ pull-ups should be performed with a wide grip; <br>  ‚Ä¢ up - take a deep breath, down - exhale; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Strive to get your elbows back and flatten the shoulder blades at the end point, concentrate on the back muscles. <br><br>  Pay attention: at the initial stage it is enough to start the chin behind the crossbar, but ideally you should pull up to the level of the clavicles. <br>  Do 3-5 laps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d2/384/5fc/6d23845fcb1140d6aea669022f8d1b5a.jpg"><br><br>  Remember: the result also depends on the regularity of training, your diet and focus on results! <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of female training</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <b>1. Twisting on the bench for the press (x 20).</b> <br><br>  This is a basic exercise for training the press.  The hip rectus and the abdominals (straight, oblique and serrated) work. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ go down on the bench, but do not lie down completely, your legs are under the roller; <br>  ‚Ä¢ on the exhale, slowly rise up; <br>  ‚Ä¢ while inhaling, lower yourself down, but do not fully straighten your back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/201/aea/0bd201aea6a143dbb2039187d8cbf829.jpg"><br><br>  Important!  Perform the exercise smoothly, without jerks.  Keep your back slightly rounded. <br><br>  <b>2. Squats with an empty neck (x 15).</b> <br><br>  The most effective exercise for the legs and buttocks.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what the goal is - slimming or gaining muscle mass.  The result of training is influenced, above all, by nutrition. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: place the heels at a distance slightly wider than the shoulders, turn the toes outward by about 35 degrees; <br>  ‚Ä¢ place the vulture on your shoulders, holding it with your hands at a distance wider than your shoulders, your elbows back; <br>  ‚Ä¢ move the shoulder blades; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when lowering down, the body flexes in the pelvic and knee joints, the back moves forward, and the weight is transferred to the heels; <br>  ‚Ä¢ look straight and do not lift your head up, as this can lead to stretching, and keep your neck in one straight line with your spine; <br>  ‚Ä¢ tighten the press (to support the back); <br>  ‚Ä¢ inhale and sit down; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Make sure that the knees do not go beyond the feet, and moved apart; <br>  ‚Ä¢ on the exhale, return to the starting position; <br>  ‚Ä¢ When lifting, pull up your chest, not your forehead. <br><br>  Important!  Keep your back straight during the exercise and maintain a slight natural deflection in the lower back. <br><br>  <b>3. Pushups on the bars in the gravitron (x 15).</b> <br><br>  Useful exercise for the muscles of the chest (at the bottom of the amplitude) and triceps (at the top of the amplitude). <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ being in emphasis on the bars, bend your elbows to 90 degrees; <br>  ‚Ä¢ while lowering the chassis down slightly forward; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when moving down, take a deep breath; when lifting, exhale. <br><br>  <b>4. Deadlift on straight legs (x 15).</b> <br><br>  Great exercise on the back of the thigh and buttocks. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Starting position: stand up straight, feet close, pick up the barbell.  The weight of the bar should not be very large; <br>  ‚Ä¢ keep your back straight and lean down; <br>  ‚Ä¢ look ahead; <br>  ‚Ä¢ bend down to such an extent that the bar is at a level just below the knees, with the legs slightly bent; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Return to the starting position. <br><br>  Important!  The first and most important thing that you need to pay attention to when performing an exercise is posture.  The back should be perfectly flat.  The legs, despite the name of the exercise, are slightly bent at the knees, and only at the very end you need to straighten them. <br><br>  <b>5. Pulling in on the TRX hinges (x 15).</b> <br><br>  The inner part of the broadest muscles of the back, paravertebral muscles, trapezius, large, round.  This exercise is very useful for the back and makes you work more muscles than a standard exercise on the simulator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/012/f35/ece/012f35ece6d641d0b31a6a9602109f67.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ grasp the handles and hang on the hinges, moving your legs forward; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keep your arms completely straight and do not bend at the waist; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when pulling down the shoulder blades, pull the handles towards you on the sides of the chest; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Return to the starting position. <br><br>  <b>6. Lunges from one foot steppe (x 15).</b> <br><br>  Work the press and back muscles, as well as almost all leg muscles - from the buttocks to the calf. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: stand directly on the stepe, take dumbbells in both hands; <br>  ‚Ä¢ with your right foot take a step forward, while the left foot should remain on the stepe; <br>  ‚Ä¢ squat on the inhale, keeping your back straight and not bending down in the lower back; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the knee of the foot that is in front must not go forward by the sock; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the shin of the leg, which is in front, is placed perpendicular to the floor surface; <br>  ‚Ä¢ make bends with one foot, then change the leg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/8da/a75/5698daa751674a7da2395271867f6fa3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>7. Lifts the legs in elbows (x 20).</b> <br><br>  The main working muscles: direct and oblique abdominal muscles. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ starting position: stand on the equipment, lean your back against its back, take an emphasis on the elbows, legs slightly bent at the knees and do not fully extend during the exercise, otherwise the load from the abdomen will go to the legs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ while inhaling with the power of the abdominal muscles, raise the knees slightly above 90 degrees relative to the body; <br>  ‚Ä¢ at the highest point, maximally tighten the abdominal muscles and stay in that position for one or two seconds; <br>  ‚Ä¢ slowly lower your legs. <br><br>  Perform 3-4 laps. <br></div></div><br>  <i>Pavel Matlashov, Director of Game Server Development Department in Plarium:</i> <br>  ‚ÄúWhen you are a department director and you have a huge responsibility, you somehow forget about health.  I constantly postponed the sport for later, but as they say, 130 kilograms and poor health crept unnoticed.  And if earlier I made excuses that there was no time for training, then with the advent of the gym in the office I firmly decided: it‚Äôs time!  I think that minus 30 kilograms in six months is the result.  And if in the spring I shook 20 kilograms, now I can talk about 95. And most importantly, I feel great, and now I constantly want to give myself new challenges.  For example, a summer hike across the Carpathians is ahead. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/396/259/ac0/396259ac00f9443b8458d08266880c04.jpg"><br><br>  <b>General recommendations:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ work out regularly (visit the gym at least 2, and preferably 3 times a week); <br>  ‚Ä¢ always warm up (for example, 10-15 minutes on a treadmill or orbitreke); <br>  ‚Ä¢ drink clean, non-carbonated water throughout the workout; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Eat a balanced and on schedule. <br><br>  If the goal is set - you will reach it. <br><br>  What exercises would you recommend?
