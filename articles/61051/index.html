  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World creation. Vzgyad IT-Schnick</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I do not know if you are playing games, but in computer games there is such a genre RTS - Real Time Strategy.  On an artificial map, units run, collect firewood, gold, fight.  The player controls them, directs where to run and what to do.  But they themselves can perform some actions without the participation of the player.  For example, their reason is enough to cut down one tree, start chopping another, and when killing one enemy unit, look for a new one in battle.  For example, take a look at the game Age of Empires. <br><img src="http://www.projectrussia.info/images/photos/149.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Peer at the picture.  Now imagine yourself in the place of a unit.  So you are there inside this game.  You looked around, lead a tree, a mountain.  You can go to the right, you can go to the left.  You lead a number of other people from your village ... Perhaps you wonder where all this came from?  Start exploring this world.  But can you ever imagine that everything you lead around appeared in one second when the player launched this game on his computer? <br><br>  Imagine now that mankind, through many many centuries, invented computers a million times more powerful than today (maybe faster, it is quite real), and decided to build an artificial world.  Well, for the experiment, for example.  The best programmers worked on the program, and now it is ready, you launch the first version, and begin to observe how the world develops.  Sometimes you have to interfere in the process, correct mistakes, release new versions of the world.  At first you made the sky solid, then the person wanted to fly, you had to create an atmosphere, then space and the universe.  Dinosaurs began to exterminate people, had to destroy them (extinct).  People are spoiled, you have created the Flood, that would clean the base of bad people.  But, in general, you do not interfere, give the world to develop independently. <br><br>  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Create such a world, really even now.  Just do not have enough computer power to make it quite complicated.  But progress does not stand still, sooner or later we will be able to create our own world.  And then what?  How will people feel in this world?  Will they believe in us?  Or invent a theory of evolution?

      It seems fantastic to us that God once created the world.  We are ready to believe in the creation of the world billions of years ago, from nothing, from a singular state, without reasonable intervention, simply because it seems to us that it is not fantastic.  And the creation of the world by God is fantastic for us.  Why?  After all, everything is so simple to explain and submit.  We are now regularly creating more and more new worlds.  Every year they are getting harder, and units are getting smarter.  In games, there is even such a term AI, meaning artificial intelligence.  And each new game, in the brochures, claims that their AI is the most advanced.  The first RTS appeared just then in 1983.  Just 26 years ago!  Look at the screenshot: <br><br><img src="http://www.projectrussia.info/images/img/www.projectrussia.info/148.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  See how the detail of the world has changed !?  At the same time, the Age of Empires game is quite old (2005) year.  Imagine what will happen in 30 years? <br><br>  I have described a completely unrealistic scenario that explains the creation of the world by God from nothing.  I do not claim that it was so.  This is very simplistic, this is a model.  It is simply to clarify that it would be easier to understand the principle itself.  But this principle explains that the biblical story about the creation of the world itself can be not a fairy tale, but a reality.  There is nothing supernatural, nothing explicable from the point of view of our current knowledge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61051/</a></p>
