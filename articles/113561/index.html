New interfaces demonstrate exactly the same (if not worse) user experience as the old ones. <br><br>  But we all believe in a miracle a little bit :) Why not try to help Sberbank, since they are so persistently asking?

      Dear quality service, I (and with me, I think, the majority of those present) would very much like to convey to you one simple thought: you need to optimize exactly ONE parameter - TIME.  TIME CUSTOMER.  Everything else - marketing ryushechki that nobody dug anywhere, except for marketers.  If you can make your customers stop feeling that they have just wasted two hours of life, they will forgive you for everything. <br><br>  Under the cut - a small guide to action, how I see it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A. Make a list of reasons why customers are forced to lose time.  Offhand: <br><br>  1) QUEUE; <br>  2) non-obvious scenarios of actions; <br>  3) incompetence of staff; <br>  4) incomprehensible interfaces; <br>  5) delayed execution of operations; <br><br>  You can throw a lot more to your taste. <br><br>  B. Find the MEASURABLE parameter that describes each item in the list.  Measurable normal, understandable figure, but rather a few.  For example: <br><br>  1) the average time spent in the queue;  queue length; <br>  2) the average number of actions required to perform standard scenarios (open an account, connect online banking, withdraw money, etc.);  average number of calls for help;  the number of transitions from one operator to another; <br>  3) the average response time of the staff to the client's question (the client, not those of your decoy ducks!), The average percentage of correct answers;  average response time;  average search time for information about where to go for help; <br>  4) the average time spent on filling out one form or another;  the average number of failed attempts to perform an action; <br>  5) the average execution time of an operation, ESPECIALLY the execution time of operations that correct the errors of the bank / operator! <br><br>  B. Measure all of these indicators on a representative sample (s).  Ideally, make separate samples for large branches, small branches, Moscow branches, rural branches, etc. <br><br>  G. Sit down and VERY carefully look at these numbers.  Analyze the causes of client time wasted in each specific case. <br><br>  D. Make a plan.  What numbers do you want to lead to some targets.  Choose priorities, choose short-term and long-term goals.  Ideally - PUBLISH and current performance, and plans. <br><br>  E. To act according to goals.  Analyze every reason for stealing time and try to find solutions. <br><br>  If the customers do not understand the algorithm of actions in a typical situation - sit down, think with your head, imagine yourself in the client's place, modify the algorithm. <br><br>  If you need to take 10 steps to complete the operation, sit down and think about which ones can be combined without damage to the client, and which ones can be thrown out.  Forget about all these internal rules of yours, which are already fifty years old - it should be convenient for the client, not for you! <br><br>  Sit down and think about what information would be of interest to the client ON EACH STEP of the operation.  Sit down and think about how to provide it so as not to take time away from the client.  Sit down and think - is it possible to change the operation so that the client no longer needs this information? <br><br>  Sit down and think - what information YOU require from the client at each step of the operation.  Understand - why the bank this information and whether it can get it automatically.  Do not care about these your regulations and schedules - it should be convenient for the client, not for you! <br><br>  And so on.  IN EVERY PRIVATE CASE, PRIVATE SOLUTIONS are needed.  No revolutions are needed.  If in point D the plan was drawn up correctly, then even small changes in the bottlenecks of the system will lead to a noticeable improvement in the main indicator - CUSTOMED TIME AT YOU. <br><br>  Rather, lying.  One revolution must be necessary - ALL WINDOWS IN A BANK MUST WORK.  If there is a queue of more than three people, the head of the department is obliged to at least have a carcass, even a stuffed animal solve the problem.  When I read on the Internet for the first time that the head of such a department was fired for not taking any measures when there was a queue in his department before the door, the Sberbank rating in my eyes will skip to beyond-the-heights. <br><br>  G. Try to implement solutions in a test form.  It‚Äôs not necessary, for God's sake, to experiment on the whole network, until all indicators have been removed and you are not sure that the proposed change is correct and necessary. <br><br>  H. Measure indicators.  Measure the indicators personally, otherwise on the ground you will draw any numbers. <br><br>  I. If the numbers are good - implement. <br><br>  From myself, as a client, add.  I deeply on the drum, your employees smile at me or not;  do they know all these credit programs by heart?  I don't care if there is a gradient on the buttons in the ATM interface or not.  In general, I don‚Äôt need the managers in the service process to tell me what promotions and new programs you have there. <br><br>  I need, in general, one thing: to stop feeling like an idiot - from the fact that I definitely need to somehow figure out which window I need to get up (and generally from the fact that different operations are performed in different windows);  from the fact that I am not able to find where the balance in your ATM is;  because I'm wondering how to fill your damn form and why I need to fill it in at all;  because I don‚Äôt understand what to do next - and your employees look at me as a moron.  And so on and so forth. <br><br>  UPD.  Offer from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/badlittleduck/" class="user_link">badlittleduck</a> <br><br>  I propose to move from words to deeds, i.e.  to the organization.  You can work on improving user experience jointly and collectively (crowdsourcing).  Big brands have long been working with such a source of knowledge and ideas.  One example of a Starbucks project is <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/">mystarbucksidea.force.com</a> .  Much of what has been suggested is implemented by Starbucks. <br><br>  Feedback and ideas that can be obtained in this way can be useful not only for Sber banks, but also for any bank. <br><br>  It is worth starting with collecting ideas, problems, suggestions and descriptions of experience.  I suggest that anyone who is interested describe it in this form <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdDlVY3dES0sydGQ0a255SXZwcERDbVE6MQ">spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDlVY3dES0sydGQ0a255SXZwcERDbVE6MQ</a> <br>  You already write a lot of stories in the comments.  This form allows you to collect and store them centrally, which is convenient for subsequent analysis and processing. <br><br>  After collecting information (ideas. Feedback, suggestions and descriptions of problems) they need to be sorted and analyzed. <br><br>  Further development of the project may be different.  You can transfer the analyzed knowledge base to the bank or share it in public access, or you can unite and continue working on the project - conduct usability testing, redesign the interfaces, etc.  (Activities may be different). <br><br>  If you are interested in participating in this project, then you should fill out this form: <br>  <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdDdnWkktWHNFcWVwUjYyY1JCc1NZM1E6MQ">spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDdnWkktWHNFcWVwUjYYY1JCc1NZM1E6MQ</a> <br><br>  The main thing is that it was interesting, it took not much time and was useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113561/</a></p>
