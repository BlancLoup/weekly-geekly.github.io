Once again, welcomes you, in our corporate blog, the HackStore team.  It has been a long time since there have been no new posts about our application, so I will not long and tediously talk about the little things and the troubles that have happened to our company during 2014, but will immediately turn to the essence of this article. <br><br>  Last year we planned a global update of our store, which includes a new design, new features, and many other interesting things that we have come out of it, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The whole of 2014 was quite difficult for us, we made a not very successful high-risk investment in the application and burned out, almost all the autumn months closed debts and rather strongly reduced external costs.  But let's not talk about it, perhaps this is a topic for a separate article.  By 2015, we came up in all weapons.  For several months, our designer and developers have done a great job on the application and related services.  Perhaps the most noticeable change in our store is a completely new design. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

    <h2>  Design </h2><br>  We tried to make the new design for the application as intuitive as possible and take into account all the irregularities that were in the old design.  In short, it was like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29b/6ff/788/29b6ff788bbb4ad5a9534edaef298f41.png"><br><br>  And so it became: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c09/53a/c62/c0953ac626ca4af4b714e807f6b6fc10.png"><br><br>  But today I would like to touch upon the topic of rebranding our company in more detail, but I would like to write a separate article about the design and new features of the application, which we will soon write :) <br><br><h2>  Rebranding </h2><br>  In the wake of the change in the design of the application, it was decided to do a rebranding of everything related to the HackStore project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d8/2ea/ea3/9d82eaea3705460884346c764821f0e1.jpg"><br><br>  (New logo and new website design) <br><br>  Their appearance has changed the logo, site design, business cards and letters of newsletters for users of the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/446/e1f/3be/446e1f3be2b44b9e97cb1384feaeaa05.jpg"><br>  (New business card) <br><br>  The logo has become relevant in style, in contrast to its predecessor, departed from the similarity with the App Store, the official store of Apple.  Now it will be more understandable as a store and the most terrible interpretation of the logo will be reduced to the H-Store, which undoubtedly will not affect the meaning either.  HackStore is named so not because we have Hack-Eersk (or broken) software, no, but it is named so in order to give freedom to novice software developers under Mac OS X which for one reason or another failed to settle in the official Apple store.  We have no strict restrictions in the AppStore, we are more friendly in this matter and provide a platform for the implementation of developers completely free of charge.  Light tones for this and selected, air, freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/848/55d/7f0/84855d7f0696426687291cd5e080db7d.jpg"><br><br>  Inspired by the logo, it was also decided to change the site design, because  new sections and functionality will be added, including the Developer Center, in which every developer, beginner and with experience will find a lot of useful information for themselves.  They will also register or enter our store where they can add their own applications, view statistics, new comments, and track profits if the applications are commercially available.  In general, he did not lose his lightness and lightness, but at the same time he became more modern and informative.  The Developer Center is currently under 98% availability and will soon be available at <a href="https://hack-store.com/for-developers">https://hack-store.com/for-developers</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce7/d05/584/ce7d055849c8418ca043ab4a921b770b.jpg"><br><br>  In general, a new direction of corporate identity was created, which will now be traced in all the developments of our team. <br><br>  Of course, if you look at the design of the application and the updated style, but without an armed look, the connection is not traceable, this is due to the fact that the decision about the re-trend was made spontaneously and after the appearance of the new application was formed.  But in the next updates, HackStore will be transformed, become more convenient and functional.  Similarly, the development of the team and the development of new features such as MacBoost and Collapsar. <br><br>  As before, we will be happy for your comments, suggestions and advice, write - we always answer! <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://hack-store.com/">hack-store.com</a> <br><br>  We are in social networks: <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/HackStoreTeam">Our Twitter</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HackStoreTeam">Our FaceBook</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/hackstoreteam">Our VKontakte</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289642/</a></p>
