Now for $ 15 a month, everyone can get unlimited, where you can download a movie in 15 minutes. <br>  But, with one caveat. <br>  If you live in a high-rise building. <br><br>  This does not apply to residents of the private sector.  Many living in the cottages are forced to use 3G whistles.  Which even in some places promise no limit, but either expensive, or slow, or no limit. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Perhaps the arrival of LTE will fix the situation, but we have too ‚Äúsmart‚Äù government.  The frequencies on which this equipment could work are given to the monopolistic use of ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù companies, and they are not interested in new technologies.

      Yet again.  If I want to become a WISP.  Tobto wireless internet provider.  You need to buy a frequency, you need to buy a license, you need to rent a tower, buy equipment.  In general, immediately invest about $ 50K. <br>  No one is interested in making such investments without a guaranteed subscriber base. <br>  Further, these same investments should pay off.  It meant either in the cost of services, or in the cost of connection. <br>  With a connection cost of $ 1000, you will not collect a large subscriber base. <br><br>  It turns out that we have a niche that is not occupied by providers, and in which it is not at all interesting to work with licenses. <br><br>  But there was a way out.  It all started with the usual wi-fi on d-link-ah.  Moreover, even serious companies tried to organize services on this consumer goods. <br>  But, for many reasons that I will not yet describe this technology has died. <br><br>  Now there is a company ubiquiti, which for cheap sold compact all-weather stations with integrated antennas. <br><br>  It turned out quite simple.  We hang one station on a high-rise building, the second on a mast at home.  And we get 10-15-20 Mbit in a private house.  The cost of connecting equipment for $ 200 for a loner ... And you can also connect the same wires and neighbors, and divide into all. <br><br>  Such a thirst for easy money gave rise to hundreds of "pioneers" who put on the station's roof at maximum power.  And zagadidi ether to each other. <br>  Fortunately, the system was self-regulated.  Noisy air forces the use of narrow-directional antennas that collect less noise, and less noise is created by others. <br><br>  The ubiquiti company is cool, it has created quite good devices, but it has redefined advertising.  They stated that they sell carrier-level equipment with TDMA protocol. <br>  Actually, it‚Äôs still far from the operator‚Äôs level ... and there‚Äôs no real TDMA in the fixed wi-max ... <br><br>  Airmax allows you to conquer some children's wi-fi sores and work where the Wi-Fi would die. <br><br>  Ubiquiti has a major competitor.  Mikrotik. <br>  But, Mikrotik only recently began to make compact all-weather stations.  And before that, I basically did the elements of the designer.  Separately, a radio card, separately, board, antenna, pigtails, case. <br><br>  Such a designer is obtained in some places slightly, and in some places 2 times more expensive than an analogue from ubiquiti. <br>  What is he attractive?  And the fact that Mikrotik implemented its polling protocol Nstreem and a newer NV2.  They didn‚Äôt shout the cherished word TDMA, but, oddly enough, a polling from a microtic works better than a polling from ubiquiti. <br><br>  Thus, it turned out, again a self-regulated system.  A pioneer starts with UBNT, eventually he understands that he cannot connect more than X people to one house, switches to a microtic (well, or hangs a dozen stations to a neighboring house). <br>  Over time, he will likely grow to the level of WISP and will think about buying licenses, or maybe someone who grows earlier will buy its subscriber base. <br><br>  Who is in the black?  Ordinary people who for cheap get even in some places and not very, but for the most part high-speed Internet. <br>  Who is in the red?  Providers who bought frequencies in 2.4 GHz.  They now have only one way out.  close.  The problem is not only in the pioneers, but especially in frequency and home routers. <br>  2.4 passes through walls quite strongly, and although it is difficult to connect to a point through the wall, millions of routers in users' homes create very stable noise. <br><br>  The range of 5 GHz is much more interesting.  At 5 GHz absorption is much higher.  Where the disturbance has appeared, there she dies.  As a result, the broadcast is an order of magnitude cleaner, the station coverage is smaller.  So you can work at lower power.  In addition, in two smaller wavelength leads to a decrease in the physical size of the antenna, which means that the antenna of the same size will have a greater gain, a smaller sector of work.  More antenna gain - less power is needed at the transmitter.  Less noise we create. <br><br>  the combination of these factors leads to the fact that it is almost impossible to make a secret of 5 GHz with at least some competent approach. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141134/</a></p>
