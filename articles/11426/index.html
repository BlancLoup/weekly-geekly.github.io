  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tale of how I built a sand castle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to build a sand castle.  I found a sandpit, I started to build, but here in the local media the information flew by - they built a new sandbox in the neighboring yard, it is more convenient to sand in it and it is more convenient to mold from it.  Went to see.  And for sure!  The sand is good, slightly wet stuck with a bang.  And in my sand some kind of something different, and I didn‚Äôt have time to mold anything, I decided to build a castle in the new one.  Even an explanation was found, almost scientific - ‚ÄúHere is more promising.‚Äù  True, in the new, sandbox everything is not so smoothly turned out.  I had to go to another yard.  He walked for half a day, but it‚Äôs not for nothing that he spent his time - he finally found the best of them all.  Everything's OK!  Well, I think, now I will be engaged in construction of the sand castle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I got down to business, but it turned out to be not convenient to dig with my hands - we need a shovel, a bucket and other stuff.  And which spatula is better?  What bucket to take?  Where is better to dig?  In order to deal with all questions, I climbed into the Internet, there surely I can choose the right tool. <br><br>  And it began - My shovel is the most shoveling shovel in the world, I don‚Äôt have it, I‚Äôve got the shoveling shovel in the world, because I also attached a flashlight to it, now you can dig at night.  There are so many sentences that eyes run up.  The blessing is smart people, bloggers are called.  It turned out that every second collects all kinds of information about the blades and pails, who has green, who has red, who has little, who has more.  There are plenty to choose from, it‚Äôs hard to dwell on one thing, but thanks to the guys, I figured out what was happening.  Chose everything you need, even more, you never know what is needed during construction. <br><br>  Now you can get down to business!  But bad luck, I do not know how to dig.  Once again, the Internet was rescued, there were a dozen methods for better digging, and the bloggers helped, thanks a lot to them, every third person compared, analyzed and produced the best method.  I now have everything and a sandbox with a cool sand, and a shovel, and I know even a dozen methods of how to dig. I can proceed.

      Started with enthusiasm, work is in full swing!  Half done, a little bit more and build!  At work, he did not notice how it got dark, tiredness came over, so much had to learn new things in a day.  Okay, I think I'll rest and tomorrow I will definitely finish everything!  Returning home, in the neighbor's yard, in the very sandbox, where there is no sand at all, I saw a beautiful sand castle.  Done well, exactly.  I looked closely.  Aha  The author of this creation is immediately obvious - an amateur, a scoop uses the old one, released earlier that week, digs in the old manner, clearly does not know anything about modern methods.  Tomorrow I'll be back, I'll finish my castle, and see who is better. <br><br>  I returned to my sandbox the next day, I took it into action, and then the local media spread the news - a lot of sand was brought to the neighboring yard.  The sand is good, it is twice as fast to sculpt from it as from mine, and even here I did not have time to build anything, I decided to go and see what a miracle sand is like. <br><br>  A week later my castle was never ready, I had a lot of blades during this time, I know now how to dig in all the details, the experience is great!  Confidently now I feel, I immediately see in blogs who understand the business, and who so, bears the gag.  I am going, I enjoy life, still, I am a specialist now in the construction of sand castles.  I looked in the sandbox, where before one castle stood, the whole city was already formed around.  I went over and looked, everything was molded according to the old method, the old spatula ‚Äî nothing new.  Here I think, the profane author, how much time builds his castle, and never learned anything. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.codeart.ru/">codeart.ru</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11426/</a></p>
