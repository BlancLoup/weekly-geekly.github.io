In this article we consider in detail the main way to increase the average number of items in the basket - cross selling. <br><br>  Cross selling (cross selling) - literally: cross selling.  The effectiveness of this method in the West has long been known.  So, in 2006, Amazon reported that 35% of all sales accounted for exactly the cross. <br><br>  The essence of this method lies in the fact that the user who buys a particular product is invited to buy a number of additional products that meet their interests.

      How to use this tool correctly: what to offer, to whom to offer, under what circumstances and in what form?  Answers to these questions require an understanding of how cross-selling works, and knowledge of how to implement it.  So, what do you need to know in order to develop an individualized strategy for effective cross selling? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  How does cross selling </h2><br><br>  The determining factor in the effectiveness of cross-selling is - the relevance of the proposal.  The concept of relevance can be defined as follows: <br><br>  <b>Offer the right user the right product at the right time in the right place.</b> <br><br>  Any visitor to the online store is at one of the 3 conditional stages of solving their problems or meeting the needs: <br><br><ol><li>  Training (finding solutions to a problem or satisfaction of a need) </li><li>  Selection (evaluation and analysis of the found solutions to the problem) </li><li>  Purchase (purchase of goods). </li></ol><br><br>  Obviously, the most promising for cross-selling visitors belong to the third group - those who have already decided on a way to solve their problem and are about to make a purchase.  The product they are going to buy is a pointer to the problem or need present to the visitor.  Knowledge of the problem and the needs of the user allow you to pick up the actual goods for the cross-sell offers. <br><br>  We conditionally divide the goods involved in cross-selling into complementary and spontaneous. <br><br>  <b>Supplementary goods or services</b> <br><br>  As the name implies, complement the selected product to complete the most complete "solutions" to the problem of the user.  For example, Natalia buys a SLR camera.  The list of recommendations for Natalia will include a lens, a memory card, a cover + a tripod.  An example of such a solution is the cross sell implemented in the Svyaznoy store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/47b/02b/ff047b02b5b14ec8f3454b583da2c3d8.png"><br><br>  <b>Spontaneous Products</b> <br><br>  These are goods purchased under the influence of emotions.  Such products do not directly complement the purchase, but are indirectly related to it. <br><br>  For example, Ivan plans to buy a boat.  He is recommended to purchase a pump (complementary product), garden roller, grill, spinning and picnic set (spontaneous goods) to the boat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bea/794/088/bea794088b1f5504876ed3677b3282a5.png"><br><br>  When implementing cross selling, priority is given to complementary goods and services that can make up a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù.  If the target product does not provide supplements, then goods from among spontaneous ones are used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98a/a12/4fe/98aa124fe6f6cdb6c60678cc59d6380f.png"><br><br><h2>  Layout options for cross selling widgets </h2><br><br>  According to the established traditions of online merchandising, a cross selling widget is located on the product page, in the shopping cart, on the confirmation page for adding the product to the cart and in the e-mail mailing letters.  The choice of a particular location is determined by the user scenarios of a particular online store. <br><br>  Let us consider examples. <br><br>  <b>Cross sell on the item card and in the basket</b> <br><br>  Eldorado offers additional products in the form of a set of additional products on the product card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/850/038/80685003894e6c8cf529064371ed5767.png"><br><br>  The second attempt to capture the user's attention is made in the basket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47d/0ba/e71/47d0bae71e9b85a661a26624e333a2b5.png"><br><br>  Similarly designed card Sotmarket.  To keep the block's contents unnoticed, cross sell is placed before the bend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f33/489/1e1/f334891e185e9995c211f0f9b452ca94.png"><br><br>  In the basket, we are met at once by two blocks of cross selling: the right slider, which reflects the recommended kit for a particular product and the general block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a83/528/cd9/a83528cd9d1202e38586aa4a5f466a05.png"><br><br>  When a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù offered to a client consists of several groups of goods and services, it is possible to use labeling - a multi-component widget in which the user can independently choose a complete set. <br><br>  Example: the user buys the first bike, and he needs to purchase related products.  Cross sell acts as a consultant, organizing and recommending the necessary "solution". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b96/bd9/efa/b96bd9efa173c1fb001efd7a8af44342.png"><br><br>  The labeling of goods or services makes it easier for the user to select, but without the guarantee of compatibility of the recommended and target goods, it is not worth doing. <br><br>  <b>Cross sell on the order confirmation page</b> <br><br>  Some companies use a confirmation page for cross-selling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d3/bc7/483/8d3bc7483dd478dbfebf6bd930ae90cb.png"><br><br>  As a rule, this method is duplicated with other placement options for the cross sell widget, since the user may accidentally close this window. <br><br>  OZON does not use an intermediate pop-up window, but when you change the status "in the basket", a notification appears recommending a suitable product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/336/221/ada/336221adad758a51c1c894fffa497274.png"><br><br>  <b>Cross sell in the e-mail marketing system</b> <br><br>  Cross sales in the online store can be taken out of the site.  For example, in the e-mail newsletter.  The ideal option is cross sell in the official letters of the order confirmation, executed in the one-click order format. <br><br>  This is how the OZON solves this problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a4/d46/205/5a4d462054477c3020d5dd1366c84f7e.png"><br><br><h2>  Cross Selling Strategy Tips </h2><br><br><ol><li>  Use user preference data <br>  Information about browsed pages, pending goods and so on. </li><li>  Be timely <br>  The road is a spoon for dinner, and cross products until they are bought elsewhere. </li><li>  Motivate <br>  Use discounts, special delivery terms, expert advice, and other social evidence to create additional value cross-goods. </li><li>  Measure and analyze results <br>  Capture all changes in the cross selling strategy.  Leave the most working results. </li></ol><br><br>  Finally, I will share my observations on the implementation of the cross sell widget in the online store: <br><br><ol><li>  The cross selling widget should be seen, but should not distract attention from the target product. </li><li>  The widget should not be overloaded with information. </li><li>  Recommendations should meet expectations, and ideally warn them. </li><li>  With a large assortment of cross products, labeling is appropriate. </li><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚Äúsolution‚Äù rather than the product (use user stereotypes) </li><li>  Use personalized recommendations for returning a client through an e-mail marketing system. </li><li>  Use high margin products for cross selling. </li><li>  Use the alternation principle so that it does not merge with the up-sell widget. </li></ol><br><br>  Remember, cross-selling is a continuation of custom scenarios that are unique to each store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226825/</a></p>
