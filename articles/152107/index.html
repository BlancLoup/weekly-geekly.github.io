  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From the history of trade invites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A small preface. <br><br>  The existence of closed trackers has always spawned many topics for discussion, from ‚Äúwhy they are needed‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to get there‚Äù to security measures related to their work.  One of these topics is invite trading.  It is not a secret for anyone that it exists, but none of those who are in any way involved in this is in a hurry to talk about it.  On closed trackers, the sale, exchange, and purchase is considered an equally serious violation and is called in one word: trading.  Today, with the consent of the author, I am publishing a translation of one story on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  === start translation <br><br>  Disclaimer: there is no confidential information about the methods used by trackers to catch traders.  It is rather a psychological story about a man who framed himself.

      <br>
      I like plots with ‚Äúpsychological portraits,‚Äù about how the police are trying to get into the minds of criminals to catch them.  Here is one of them, about how a trader was caught.  Let me start by introducing myself to such a ‚Äúpopular psychologist‚Äù and try to analyze the mindset of a typical trader.  In my experience, such people usually do not really help their fellow trackers, most often they are selfish.  Such people are prone to dishonesty in business, and often willing to lie to anything to hide who they are.  And most importantly, they suffer from the need to boast of their "e-dignity."  In other words, when they receive rare invites, they are not satisfied with the fact that they have them, most often they try to publicly announce that they have become members of such trackers.  And so, these traits sometimes lead them to failure.  Now see. <br><br>  Once we caught a trader in our ranks.  We received information from the management of one tracker, with evidence, and we immediately banned it.  Instead of quietly leaving, he tried to ask for help from us to be restored.  But his mistake was that he spoke to several administrators, and told them different stories about why he could be mistaken for a trader.  As a result, these contradictions served as just another proof of his guilt, and he remained banned. <br><br>  After some time, he returned, creating a new individuality for himself.  He had a new e-mail address, a new IP address, new accounts on closed trackers.  He came to our community as a new person in the world of torrents, and his new personality had no coincidence with the old data. <br><br>  But remember, what I wrote above about traders?  Features of his psyche and burned him.  One of the first things he did was ask me to remove his photo from the site.  He said that the man (formerly banned) published a photo on which his acquaintance got, and therefore he wants to remove it.  It seems to be an innocent request, but it was already a clue to who he is.  Later, he came to the support channel under the old name and asked to remove his other posts and photos (more evidence indicating that he tried to wash off his past, but not enough to prove that it was him).  Then he gradually began to earn a name for himself in the world of torrents, and under his new name he was invited to some trackers.  He was active on the forums and IRC channels.  He talked so much that he eventually gave us new clues to who he really was, and in the end on one of the trackers a ‚Äúclear evidence‚Äù surfaced that completed everything. <br><br>  In order to finally decide his fate, he accomplished something that made it easy to calculate.  At one forum, he listed the trackers on which he was (here it came out, the desire to boast) and described in detail how he was invited there.  Armed with this information, tracker administrators were able to easily find and ban it. <br><br>  What is the conclusion?  He framed himself.  Every thing he did was not in itself evidence that he was a trader, but when they came together it became obvious.  He even provided us with information so that we could globally ban it in the world of trackers. <br><br>  === end of translation <br><br>  In conclusion, I will add a few words from myself.  I have always had an ambivalent attitude towards these global bans.  Of course, he was again found and caught, but nothing will prevent him from receiving a new IP, and everything will be repeated again.  Maybe you need to tighten measures and ban at the first suspicion?  On the other hand, there is always a chance that someone will be blamed by mistake, or slandered, and what then will such a person do?  To put up with a ban, or take a path similar to that of a trader, that is, get yourself a new address, start everything from scratch and then hide it all your life?  Therefore, I would like to hope that the united community of the world of trackers will make fair decisions and no one will be in such a situation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152107/</a></p>
