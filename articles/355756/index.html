  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The OAC of Belarus has divided the domain of the country's second most popular site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This afternoon, the second most popular <a href="http://onliner.by/">Onliner.by</a> website has become unavailable.  As reported on the website of the Operational Analytical Center under the President of the Republic of Belarus, the domain name of the resource was divided due to violation of the law on trade.  The initiator of the decision was the Ministry of Commerce of the country. <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://oac.gov.by/news/301.html">In connection with the</a> violations of trade legislation by the owner of the Internet resource onliner.by <a href="http://oac.gov.by/news/301.html">identified by the</a> Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Belarus, including regulating the procedure for the sale of goods (works, services) using the Internet, and the failure to take measures to eliminate them at an earlier time, December 20 In 2014, a decision was made to exclude the corresponding domain name from the registry of the national domain zone. <br></blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  BelTA <a href="http://www.belta.by/ru/all_news/economics/Mintorg-Belarusi-priostanovil-rabotu-13-internet-magazinov_i_690024.html">reports</a> that, in addition to Online, twelve online stores were closed.  Most likely, this measure was taken against sites that did not want or could not, in the period established by the Ministry of Trade, transfer price tags from conventional units to Belarusian rubles.  This is exactly what the Ministry of Trade <a href="http://www.mintorg.gov.by/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D2123%26pop%3D1%26page%3D0%26Itemid%3D30">warned the</a> owners of online stores on December 19. <br><br>  The deterioration of the economic situation in Russia and Ukraine led to problems in the economy of Belarus.  Yesterday, the National Bank of the country announced the introduction of a 30% fee for the purchase of foreign currency, thereby essentially conducting another devaluation of the ruble.  Obviously, the state authorities of Belarus expect that if all online stores indicate prices in Belarusian rubles, this will lead to greater confidence in the national currency.

      Onliner.by has been operating since 2001.  Originally created as a catalog of mobile devices, it now includes a news feed covering the majority of topics related to life in Belarus, maintains an online shopping catalog, a forum and a private announcements section.  The on-lineer positions itself as a ‚Äúresource out of politics‚Äù, although its journalists view a significant number of socially significant topics. <br><br>  The OAC is the state body that regulates the activities of ensuring the protection of information containing information constituting state secrets of the Republic of Belarus or other information protected in accordance with the law from leaks through technical channels, unauthorized and unintended effects. <br><br>  On December 17, Belarus <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243257/">adopted amendments to the Law on Mass Media</a> , which significantly strengthened the state‚Äôs ability to block Internet resources.  Yesterday, many popular resources of the country, hosted both in Belarus and abroad, experienced problems with access, which <a href="http://beltelecom.by/news/company/v-svyazi-s-ddos-atakoi-na-oborudovanie-tsod-rup-beltelekom-vozmozhny-zatrudneniya-s-dos">were explained by a DDoS attack</a> on the infrastructure of the state Internet provider RUP Beltelecom. <br><br>  Upd.  About an hour after the separation, the Onlayner returned to the new address <a href="http://www.online.by/">www.online.by</a> , after which it thought carefully and redirected to the address <a href="http://onliner.ru/">onliner.ru</a> .  That, it should be noted, is also not a panacea. <br><br>  Upd2.  Apparently, the domains of the <a href="http://belapan.by/">news agency ‚ÄúBelapan‚Äù</a> and their news site <a href="http://naviny.by/">Navina.by were also delineated</a> . <br><br>  Upd3.  The on-lineer responded to the situation with a <a href="http://people.onliner.ru/2014/12/20/press-reliz/">press release</a> in which he said that he was working to implement the changes prescribed by the Ministry of Commerce. <br><br><blockquote>  Onliner.by stands for the development of civilized online commerce and consumer protection.  We are a 100% Belarusian company, and all our work for 14 years was aimed at improving the quality of life of millions of Belarusians.  We regularly pay taxes in Belarus and help develop the business of thousands of Belarusian enterprises and private entrepreneurs, create jobs throughout the country, including for companies that produce goods and services in our country. <br><br>  Onliner.by does everything to meet the requirements of the Ministry of Trade, including the promotion of domestic goods.  We quickly implement a number of changes on the site, prescribed by the Ministry of Commerce. <br><br>  Onliner.by is always ready for further cooperation.  The company's team, our visitors and customers hope for the earliest resolution of the problem situation. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Upd4.  The websites of the Belapan news agency and the Belorussky Novosti online newspaper (Naviny.by) are again available.  The Belapan Agency <a href="http://belapan.by/archive/2014/12/21/748596/">issued a press release</a> , where it reported that the organization had not received any official warnings and will continue to understand what happened. <br><blockquote>  BelaPAN did not receive any official warnings or notices of a blocking being prepared. <br><br>  Amendments to the law on the media, allowing the blocking of sites, will enter into force only on January 1, 2015, but even after that, legal grounds will be needed for blocking.  In the present conditions, the blocking of IP addresses of BelaPAN, as well as other independent Internet media, we regard as a rough encroachment on freedom of speech and the media in Belarus. <br><br>  We are taking all measures in order to obtain from government agencies comprehensive information about who and on what basis made the decision to block our sites. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Upd5.  Deputy Trade Minister Irina Narkevich <a href="http://news.tut.by/society/429087.html">explained</a> exactly which actions of the site led to its closure.  According to the official, Online is charged with dishonest advertising, refusal to cooperate with competent in the field of Internet business by government agencies and the creation of prerequisites for unfair competition.  The conflict between the Ministry of Commerce and Onlayner lasted more than a year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355756/</a></p>
