      Experts at one time expressed the opinion that email had come to a sunset.  But the crisis forecasts did not come true, because email marketing has become smarter and stronger than ever to deliver the right content at the right time. <br><br>  For users, this is a convenient and fast way to send and receive messages, including advertising.  <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/">72% of</a> users prefer to receive promotional emails than from social networking pages.  And for marketers, email remains the most affordable and effective marketing channel, because each $ 1 spent on email marketing generates an average of $ 44.25. <br><br>  And this is what world experts in email marketing say about trends for 2017. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 1. Chad White, Litmus </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HnLQ1e2.jpg" alt="litmus"><br><br>  Data science will bring automation and personalization of email marketing to a new level.  But it is necessary to understand that working with big data (big data) does not occur according to the principle ‚Äúset up and forget. <br><br>  2017, marketers will devote to the processing and application of data from the email distribution settings office.  The focus will be on data and patterns of user behavior that lead to valuable insights.  Data from the mailing list settings will not be applied at the level here and now, but will form the basis of long-term strategies.  You can say goodbye to the old "set up and forget" principle. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 2. Alex Williams, Trendline Interactive </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdS6Lag.jpg" alt="trendline interactive"><br><br>  Email marketing is developing well in the face of growing mobile market.  More than 68% of e-mail users open from mobile devices, and it is clear that email is forever connected with them. <br><br>  I predict that the development of mobile payments will reach users' mailboxes.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to be Android or iOS first, but I think we‚Äôll see integration with fingerprint technology based on these operating systems for Gmail / Apple Mail.  This will make it possible to confirm the payment in 1 click via email in 2017. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 3. Matthew Smith, Really Good Emails </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8FogGc5.jpg" alt="really good emails"><br><br>  I sincerely believe that the next wave of innovation will come to an adaptive design, and make it an integral part of the creation of letters. <br><br>  Designers, developers and content creators will work together on a convenient email campaign launch system with ready-made templates and content modules.  This approach will help save time and spend less effort on the development of design, in return, you will be able to focus on creating relevant content. <br><br>  Opportunities for fancy design templates should be present in every email service, but do not forget that most companies use only the minimum set for their email newsletters. <br><br>  I believe that email services should provide users with a suitable balance of flexibility and limitations in email templates. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 4. Daniel Caudell, ZURB </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ig6vcBk.jpg" alt="zurb"><br><br>  The key to email marketing success lies in three components: the right content, the target segment and the right time to send.  Marketing automation takes into account all three principles.  In 2017, automation technology will become even smarter.  As a result, we will get even more functions with progressive segmentation and optimization of the time of sending the message. <br><br>  I think that email marketers will begin to use the potential of SMS, because this is an ideal accompaniment to launching email campaigns.  Moreover, the automation technology makes it possible for SMS to come at a time when the audience is located to read them. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 5. Andrea Wildt, Campaign Monitor </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XucfG0l.jpg" alt="campaign monitor"><br><br>  I predict that marketers will integrate customer behavior data from their devices.  Google Home and Amazon Echo - this is only the tip of the iceberg of new devices from which users google, leave likes and dislikes. <br><br>  Based on information about user behavior on new devices, marketers will be able to win real and potential customers and build stable and manageable relationships. <br><br>  As consumers increasingly use mobile devices, marketers try to extract as much information as possible from there: viewed sites, downloaded applications, games, etc.  - all in full view. <br><br>  Behavioral data allows you to make a clear segmentation of users and run personalized campaigns with relevant content for each segment.  By combining all these tactics into a single strategy, marketers will be able to get the maximum audience involvement. <br><br>  Those marketers who develop a strategy based on user behavioral data will easily win the battle against competitors this year. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ # 6. Jodi Van Regin, Email Monday </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHaKAaz.jpg" alt="email monday"><br><br>  Email marketing is one of the best ways to build communication between a brand and a potential or existing customer; it is an evolutionary concept.  The following formula will help you look at email marketing in a new way: <i>Personality + Profile + Target = Productivity</i> . <br><br>  The value is not to collect as many addresses as possible, but to fill each subscriber profile as much as possible.  Previously, marketers collected information using a subscription form.  Then the pendulum swung in the other direction, and in the form of a subscription they left only an email address in order not to slow down the process of the subscription itself. <br><br>  Now subscribers have become more demanding of the mailings that they receive, they need relevant content.  That is why marketers will return to collecting information about their subscribers.  The more data a user profile will contain, the more thorough the segmentation will be, and the more relevant your email offer will become. <br><br>  I think that this trend comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_scoring">lead scoring</a> method in the B2B segment, when potential customers are segmented from the willingness to buy, to conclude a deal.  An integral criterion is such information: recorded visits to certain pages of the company's website, downloading presentations, opening and clicking on emails, interest in certain links, etc. <br><br>  This approach will become the basis in 2017 for email marketing - lead scoring and behavioral data collection. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ No. 7. Ros Hodgis, Campaign Monitor </h4><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MS9RAXD.jpg" alt="campaign monitor"><br><br>  10 years ago I made my personal breakthrough in email marketing.  It included the design, planning and launch of email campaigns for a large media network.  At that time, our team was drowning in tasks like placing and designing subscription forms, building email templates. <br><br>  Looking back, I will say that the success of the newsletter was an indicator of success for us.  And all because our hardworking and creative team lacked the technical means to manage the key performance indicators of email campaigns. <br><br>  Modern email services provide a whole range of tools for various tasks in email marketing.  Today, after sending the mailing, you can view a detailed statistical report: the number of open letters, clicks per letter, the rate of unsent letters (bounce rate), the location of the recipient.  But in addition to clicks, marketers became available distribution statistics in Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, thanks to which the transitions to the site and the financial results of each newsletter are tracked. <br><br>  As you can see, email integrates with other marketing and analytical platforms, so I predict that soon every marketer will be able to easily derive the ROI and track how mailings affect repeated purchases and the introduction of new functionality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319584/</a></p>
