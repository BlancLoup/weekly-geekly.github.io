  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home helpers: Clever & Clean 002 M-Series smart vacuum cleaner</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/">iCover</a> blog.  Could an ordinary user, some five or ten years ago, think that in 2016, almost everyone will have the opportunity to purchase their own, even a small robot?  And not just a robot to play around for a couple of hours and set aside on the shelf, but useful in everyday life ... Robotic cleaning of premises, like the systems of a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù, are no longer something supernatural in 21st century society.  However, most quality solutions still remain inaccessible to the mass market due to their cost.  Today we look at the product of a young company from Shenzhen - Clever &amp; Clean.  The company specializes in the production of robotic vacuum cleaners - today's model <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/clever_clean_m_series_002_robot_pylesos_blue/">M-Series 002</a> has a good chance to become an assistant, making a significant part of the routine of house cleaning without having hit the wallet a lot.  Doesn't every good householder dream of this! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4c/be5/fbe/a4cbe5fbefac46c9a7992dc699603ed9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's consider what, in theory, our home helper should be able to do so that the owner can, with a clear conscience, pass on such an exciting job as cleaning with a regular vacuum cleaner.  Ideally, we expect before the test that the robot must be well oriented in the allocated space, do not make much noise, collect 95% of the garbage itself and work as long as possible from a single charge.  Since our model is the simplest and is not equipped with such additions as a charging docking station with an automatic parking function in it, room inspection sensors and an additional console, for example.  It remains for us to consider the device only according to the criteria mentioned above.

    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Packaging</font> </h2><br><br>  Let's start traditionally with unpacking.  Robot vacuum cleaner comes in a large box of solid cardboard of good quality.  The main color of the package is white, there is also a large number of bright images and narrations about the company's product.  The classic approach of the marketing department to packaging "smart" home appliance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/21b/ac8/e9321bac867d4357a8c05339ff9df5d3.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the size of the box, a handle is provided in the upper part for more convenient transportation.  Inside, Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series is located directly in the foam protection, its accessories are in a small box.  Their list includes a fairly large-sized charger with a built-in meter cable, two compact corner brushes, a 800 mAh battery and, of course, did not forget about the accompanying documentation.  Because Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series supports wet cleaning - the manufacturer retrofitted the kit with a special thin cloth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/b94/e1e/b0db94e1e3f74095979c006f51b20155.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the manufacturer's approach to packaging makes a pleasant impression, the ‚Äúrobot‚Äù is packed securely, the box is neat, the color gamut is nice to the eye, and the kit contains everything you need to get started.  Let's look at the device itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d27/24f/4c5/d2724f4c56ec4ac28d8f492c3ff171b5.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Design and functionality</font> </h2><br><br>  In fact, it is always somewhat difficult to assess the external appearance of a device with a highly specialized focus.  After all, the market of robotic and autonomous household devices is young, and due to its specificity - each manufacturer is free to apply any design decisions when creating a product.  One can only note one main feature of automated portable vacuum cleaners - in the prevailing number - they are round (except for the most <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/irobot_braava_380t_b380t_robot_pylesos_black/">inexpensive model of the iRobot</a> , for example).  And still small - the author tells the captain the obvious.  Although one could argue in terms of size, the Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series is not a record holder for compactness, since 27.4 x 27.4 x 7.4 centimeters are still very noticeable on the floor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d5/fac/91a/2d5fac91a4c1429998cc44806798fe78.jpg"><br><br>  Increases the attractiveness and range of colors.  The vacuum cleaner exists in bright green and blue and more restrained <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/clever_clean_m_series_003_robot_pylesos_black/">black</a> .  In this case, only part of the body is painted on top, the other half remains silver.  The bottom, as usual, is made of rough black plastic.  There are no burrs or other defects on the plastic.  The vacuum cleaner is also assembled with high quality, which it has initially.  Of course, in some moments some simplicity is visible, for example, the mechanism - the lid of opening / closing the trash bin, is clearly not the most reliable one.  Yes, and the decision with the LEDs that glow when working, from my humble point of view, is controversial - it looks doubtful, rather like a Christmas tree. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/005/21d/c98/00521dc987e14900a4b72c94e7d43d9f.jpg"><br><br>  However, enough about the exterior ... In the end, we consider not a work of art, but a budget gadget for cleaning the house.  Let's get to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17c/197/bd3/17c197bd3ea74bccb54265a47afee7f8.jpg"><br><br>  We insert the battery into the gadget, install two side brushes for cleaning the corners, and in general, everything is ready - the device is ready to work, and the battery is fully charged for up to 40 minutes of continuous cleaning.  During my Clever &amp; Clean test, the 002 M-Series worked for about an hour from one battery.  The ‚Äúrobot‚Äù can move in a spiral, in zigzag mode and straight.  The gadget does not know how to identify the territory, and, consequently, it moves erratically, focusing on shocks on objects.  Fortunately, the manufacturer has stipulated that his ‚Äúchild‚Äù will not work in a concrete box, which means that it is necessary to preserve the interior and for this purpose equipped a plastic box with ribbed thick rubber band along the way. <br><br>  Well, now that should be fine, right?  The vacuum cleaner drives around the room, cleans up ... everything, as it should be.  Although we all, probably, since childhood remember how much the stationary vacuum cleaner is noisy, such as a victory, for example.  Modern counterparts have already become considerably quieter, but still a long job cuts off hearing.  The small ‚Äúrobot‚Äù was no exception, since it works quite noisy ... at least, it is difficult not to notice its presence.  The published noise level is approximately 60 dB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/b50/9b9/f08b509b9caf493cb91602eac78228f7.jpg"><br><br>  Suppose that the problem of noise is the ‚Äúscourge‚Äù of all dust-collecting devices, with which you are ready to accept for an hour.  Indeed, at this time you can do much more interesting and useful things - the main thing is how the device copes with its task.  To begin with, in contrast to the larger and more expensive fellow Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series, it is not able to collect a significant amount of garbage or some of its individual large parts.  This is due to a small suction hole, as well as a small volume of the container - only 150 ml.  Based on these data, we can conclude that the device is suitable rather to maintain the frequency in the apartment, and not the general cleaning.  But small debris - this is his element, the vacuum cleaner perfectly collects various crumbs, dust, fine sand, even the pet's hair was not an obstacle for him.  It is worth mentioning that the gadget is supplied with a fine filter. <br><br>  The disadvantage is that the gadget is not ‚Äúall-passable‚Äù.  If the joint between the tile and the parquet will not interfere with the device, then a thick wire or a small partition may well cause the vacuum cleaner to turn or stop.  Moreover, due to the simplicity automatically Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series will not turn off at the end of the cleaning.  There are several options, either you turn on and turn off the device yourself, or once you turn on the ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, it functions until the battery is discharged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9eb/016/6dd/9eb0166dd2c14e45a7d3c93b6f9e598b.jpg"><br><br>  In theory, Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series is suitable for cleaning carpets with a short nap, as well as wiping the surface - a complete cloth is provided for this.  In fact, the use of the device in the voiced modes, I would call into question.  Still, such things should be left more productive counterparts.  Especially, with regard to operation with a cloth, within literally a few minutes, it collects all the dirt on itself and, in fact, simply ‚Äúcrawls‚Äù it over the area being cleaned, which definitely will not bring success in cleaning. <br><br>  In conclusion, the orientation of the vacuum cleaner in space can be put at risk.  Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series is guided by a collision with an obstacle and it is on this point that it changes the trajectory of its movement.  It is possible that there is nothing terrible in this, however, the manufacturer laid the gadget too wide, and for this reason some places, especially hard-to-reach ones, may turn out to be unclean.  One can only hope that in the future such a feature will be taken into account that will serve as a pulse for its programmatic change. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Opinion is not an analyst</font> </h2><br><br>  New robotic technology has become a real trend today.  In just a few years, the market has been filled with various products, which are designed to ennoble a person‚Äôs life by taking over some of his work tasks for himself.  In pursuit of the buyer, both eminent electronics manufacturers and narrowly-shaped companies, or something completely unknown, were noticed from one well-known Chinese online trading platform with the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  Someone better fits the dream of a lazy person or just interested in the development of electronics, someone a little worse ... <br><br>  In any case, it is nice to see that there are simple budget options and sophisticated ‚Äútop‚Äù ones on the market.  What is called, for every taste, color and wallet.  It was my first acquaintance with a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù vacuum cleaner, which turned out to be not so clever as compared to <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/roboty_pylesosy/%3Fset_filter%3Dy%26arrFilter_3254_1042407081%3DY">expensive competitors</a> , but did not make it worse to perform the tasks assigned to it.  Yes, Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series does not have a charging docking station and cannot automatically move in and out of it for charging and cleaning, does not know how to determine the type of room and its area using sensors.  There are no different modes of cleaning in the direction of travel or time, and turning on the cleaning mode once - the gadget works until the charge is lost.  And the battery life is not amazing.  However, this robot involuntarily wants to be compared with some simple machine, which is not burdened with additional functionality, but it carries its owner to work or other business day after day. <br><br>  So, and <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/clever_clean_m_series_002_robot_pylesos_green/">Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series is</a> ready every day to remove some debris from the flat surfaces of your apartment in order to prevent the appearance of tangible foci of contamination and outright pieces of dust on the surface or its corners.  To perceive the gadget as a complete cleaning device, unfortunately, is definitely not worth it.  If they ask me, did I like the Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series?  I will answer that yes.  Of course, the price tag of 8 thousand is somewhat doubtful, but the pleasure of cleaning is guaranteed, especially if there is a desire to try to live with ‚Äúsuch‚Äù smart gadget - it's worth it.  In addition, it is a great gift.
