In this system, tens of thousands of trade operations are performed every second, and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hi/130113/">using the Disruptor pattern</a> , the average speed of a trade does not exceed 20.5 milliseconds.  The project involves the most complex integration with third parties - large banks, London Clearing House LCH and other corporations. <br><br>  The development of the project took about 3 years and a team of about 20 engineers.  There are no project managers, a coordinator, project plans, Gantt charts, architecture documents, requirements specifications, and testing plans. <br><br>  In addition to awards for outstanding technology, the company is recognized in the Agile community for a simple and effective development process.  About him I want to tell in this post.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h5>  About the process </h5><br>  The company uses its Agile development process.  The development of the system never stops, and new customer requirements are regularly met, with a new release cycle every 2 weeks. <br><br>  The developers of the company are divided into 3-4 groups, each of which is engaged in a certain direction.  In each group there are 5-6 programmers, a tester and an analyst. <br><br>  The work of all teams is divided into two-week iterations.  The iteration begins on Wednesday, and ends after 2 weeks on Tuesday.  The middle of the week is chosen so that it is not necessary to urgently finish the development on Friday, lingering at work. <br><br>  Requirements for the new version appear mainly from customers, the marketing department and the sales department.  All wishes are recorded on cardboard cards that are glued to the planning wall. <br><br>  The planning wall is divided vertically into teams, and horizontally into iterations.  The whole wall contains tasks for a quarter of a year, 6 iterations.  New cards are glued to the top, and backlog is at the bottom.  Between them - 6 iterations. <br><br>  Every Tuesday, all interested parties gather near the planning wall and re-glue the cards according to priorities, thus planning the next iterations.  Usually in the iteration of the team is 2-4 cards. <br><br>  The analyst collects detailed requirements for the cards of the next iteration.  Requirements are recorded in the Mingle system.  A regular card contains 5-10 acceptance criteria, in the form of sentences such as ‚ÄúIf the trader has set the size of the order, it should be kept until a subsequent change‚Äù <br><br><h5>  About work in iteration </h5><br>  Every second Wednesday at 10 am a retrospective and kick-of of the next iteration begins.  The teams scatter by rally-rooms or sofas (who didn‚Äôt have enough), and start meeting with eating the cake. <br><br>  In retrospect, the team discusses what was good, what was bad, what questions and ideas were.  To do this, the board is drawn in 4 segments, where the <s>assigned</s> volunteer records the reasoning of the team members.  The goal of this exercise is to come up with improvements for the next iteration. <br><br>  After the end of the retrospective, a rotation takes place, as a result of which each team loses one developer and acquires another. <br><br>  Then begins the analysis of new stories, where the analyst tells about the plan for the next iteration.  Developers ask questions clarifying requirements. <br><br>  Cards are moved from the planning wall to the kanban wall for this team.  The kanban wall is divided into tasks - horizontally, and status - vertically.  The first column contains all non-commented tasks.  The following columns occupy the started card, then ‚Äúin progress‚Äù and ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. <br><br>  The development of a story begins with breaking it down into subtasks.  The whole team gathers in the kitchen, and on the sticky sheets splits the card into subtasks.  Often at this stage a solution is designed - for this we use a white wall and multi-colored markers.  Adhesive sheets go to the kanban board in the ‚ÄúStarted‚Äù section.  The first and second tasks are selected, with a pair of engineers for each. <br><br>  Usually the first task is to write tests.  This involved a couple of programmer and tester, tester and analyst, or analyst and programmer.  Tests are written based on acceptance criteria. <br>  All tests are executable specifications.  Tests are a direct part of the system code, and participate in a continuous integration (CI) environment.  At the moment we have about 20,000 tests, and each commit is subject to automatic testing against these tests. <br><br>  Direct development always happens in pairs.  Most often, 2 programmers are involved in the development, although it is often a combination that includes a tester or analyst.  As a result of pair programming, the quality of the code is improved, the knowledge of the system is disseminated (excluding the need for documentation), and more correct decisions are made. <br><br>  In addition to ‚Äúmating‚Äù, we use ‚Äúswarming‚Äù - the development of one story in several pairs at the same time.  Some make the user interface, others meanwhile - the server side.  Since the breakdown into subtasks and design was done by the whole team, everyone knows what to do. <br><br>  A constant rotation also takes place in the development - the pairs converge and diverge, change tasks.  As a result, everyone knows everything, and the need for individual review of the code disappears.  In addition, confidence increases and relationships improve in a team, because it simply works as one organism. <br><br>  Changes are constantly being sent to SVN, where they are automatically tested. <br>  Theoretically, the system is ready to run at any time.  In the middle of the office there are monitors showing the status of testing, speed of execution, latency and other parameters. <br><br>  Such a development process, which is not typical for financial institutions, is used in the London Diversified Asset Exchange (LMAX).  All planning is exposed on a general review, each developer knows work of all system and practically each specific function.  As a result of ‚Äúpairing‚Äù and ‚Äúcrowded‚Äù specifications are not needed, there are no conflicts between different parts of the organization.  Everyone can always offer a new solution, having familiarized with the ‚Äúwall painting‚Äù of the neighboring team.  Documents are missing as a class, e-mail is almost never used.  There are no decision committees and boring meetings discussing plans ... <br><br>  By the way, we always need talented testers and Java programmers. <br><br>  PS work in London </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135183/</a></p>
