  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My 2 ¬¢ about telecoms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once again I discovered (at the most inconvenient moment) that my account at MTS was empty, although I was assured by polite employees about the ‚Äúfull unlimited‚Äù.  I fully agree with the numerous Habra posts that telecoms have become impudent.  And all the tops from the MTS and others in private conversations complained about how hard it is to do business in a barbaric country, and ARPA is so small. <br>  But pay attention to the financial <a href="http://www.company.mts.ru/ir/report/2009-11-13-1263247/">performance of MTS for the 3rd quarter</a> . <br>  OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) 50.7%.  More than 50 percent facking!  At the same time, it also increased by 11.4% compared with the previous quarter.  In dollars. <br>  Such a profitable business is quite comparable with the sale of drugs.  Compare say with <a href="http://s.tmocache.com/Cms/Files/Published/0000BDF20016F5DD010312E2BDE4AE9B/5657114502E70FF30124C645BC1131D6/file/TMUS%2520Q3%2520Press%2520Release%2520FINAL.pdf">T-Mobile report for the same period</a> . <br>  Some kind of miserable 33%.  Losers.  And in absolute terms, the difference is not so great, given the volume of T-Mobile business and the territory in which they operate. <br>  And this is despite the fact that we have far from the strongest economy in the world.  And this year was not the most successful.  And people like the salary did not seem to grow so much this year, but rather, quite the contrary, it was falling and these figures are also available to anyone interested.  And at clear boys from MTS business rushing as never before! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Against the background of all these figures, it is clear that there is a cartel agreement between the operators of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù, it is clear that the state regulators do not regulate anything. <br>  It is clear that there is little money for good lawyers, PR managers and other well-paid corporate dogs that will protect these business practices to the last. <br>  At the same time, when it comes to lies about the costs of expanding and developing a business, it has not deceived anyone for a long time, because these effective managers do not implement anything new, no new technologies, except for Jesuit billing and tariff policies. <br>  The way out, it seems to me, should be in the mass filing of complaints of subscribers both to state regulators and to the courts. <br>  In order for these complaints to be massive, you can probably create some sites where the application procedures were explained and maximally facilitated for ordinary people. <br>  This logic worked in the West when there was a struggle with the telecom monopolists there.  Most likely, it should work with us.  The logic is simple - to create conditions under which it is impossible to NOT notice the number of complaints. <br><br>  PS In contrast, I remember my life CDMA network subscribers in the States.  For 4 years of use 1. I never paid more than $ 35 a month, fixedly 2. I never even learned how many minutes or megabytes I spent there.  Both the ‚Äúintercity‚Äù and paid roaming there were canceled under the pressure of state regulators by the way.  And the EU is the same. <br>  But if you look at the history (AT &amp; T and others), you have achieved this by putting pressure on state control mechanisms.  There is no other way.  No conscience among people receiving OIBDA&gt; 50% can not be by definition. </div>
