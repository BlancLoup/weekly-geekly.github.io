  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nomobile.ru at CES 2010: Reflections on a Trend</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I returned from CES 2010 exhibition and already unsubscribed to the Itogi magazine and to the Nomobile.ru website ( <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/texts/60020.html">this is the article</a> ) <br><br>  After a bit more emotion.  At the exhibition, as I already wrote, there was no smell of the future, but there was a smell of conjuncture and the desire of companies to get into the trend of Apple and Google.  In this format - if these two companies come up with something - you have to break after them, and urgently.  And even such big brands as Microsoft - the performance of Steve Ballmer with the tablet, it is a lunge in its pure form in the direction of Apple, and also unprepared.  And I found few interesting and unique products, I really only enjoyed the Lenovo U1 transformer netbook, which combines a tablet and a netbook, two computers at once, and for less than a thousand dollars (here they already wrote about it). <br><br><img src="http://www.nomobile.ru/upload/images/60020/XXXXXX_XX_645.jpg" alt="image">

      The main focus of the exhibition was still not on Android, but on 3D-TV, and a large mass of visitors hung out in mini-cinemas, but I just had a good look at 3D at the September IFA, where this trend was marked to its fullest, and three-dimensional telegraphs bypassed by the side.  It turned out that the entire exhibition went around in two days.  Most of the topics from the exhibition here on the Habr√© have already been repeatedly raised (readers, android, etc.).  But I caught on with the ‚Äúsub-mirror‚Äù trend, which was in the shadow of all of the above. <br><br>  I was very interested in the entry of Samsung into a new mini-camera market, and I expect big changes this year. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, so far only two companies are promoting the class of ‚Äúexpensive leek‚Äù a la rangefinder - Panasonic and Olympus.  It is clear that this is not yet a SLR (there is no mirror system there), but already not a soap box, something in between.  4/3 matrix, interchangeable optics supported (including full-size lenses through an adapter), removed in RAW.  All the cameras in this class are very good, I would say excellent.  Handsome.  Ideally, the whole set of carcasses and several lenses should fit in a small handbag.  Positioning - they say, this is the second, a camping camera for a professional or the main one for a prosumer, an advanced amateur.  The main problem is the godless price, and I don‚Äôt really understand it, it‚Äôs still a marketing miscalculation or indeed, the technological process gives a great cost.  More inclined to the first version.  But as for the behavior of the Japanese in the market, I observe some stagnation: this market is not particularly expanding, the Japanese are too passive, and Samsung, which pulled out its answer, the NX10 camera, can shake this swamp.  And this is already interesting.  The main question is: do Koreans target the same audience, or did they just go from the other side? <br><br><img src="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9852/gf1pen.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is clear that the design and charisma of the Korean cannot even be compared with the Japanese: Japanese cameras look very vintage, they are thoroughbred, sort of small ‚Äúwatering cans,‚Äù and are not good for the mass market, but for those who are in the subject.  And the topic is not very large audience, well, actually, its price also narrows.  And, maybe, the Japanese do not reduce the price tag, because they understand that the audience will not increase much, the high price rebuilds just from the mass market.  (Of course, Panasonic also has a GH-1, more like a DSLR, but for me the personification of the Micro 4/3 format - these are the two things that are in the picture - the Olympus Pen and the Panasonic GF1.) <br><br>  Samsung has a different approach - it is convinced that the price will be very low (which one, the Koreans haven‚Äôt decided yet), and the design of the camera is a small mirror.  It really is small, a third less than the usual SLR, and this is a plus.  But it seems to me that the view can push the average person away: it‚Äôs too much like the big cameras used by understanding uncles ... Paradox: the Japanese offer a soap box format for those people who don‚Äôt use soap boxes, and the Koreans do not need a SLR format. are needed.  Well, it is hardly possible to imagine that a person will have the NX10 as a second device and a DSLR as the first, these are still two similar cameras.  Rather, the NX10 will be the main one, and the soap box will be in the appendage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1f/2d4/3d9/c1f2d43d97a1ae85122909322671fe9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, from the large NX10 DSLRs, only the matrix size is the APS-C 1.6 sensor, and the fastest autofocus in the class, as well as interchangeable optics (standard Pentax lenses are via an adapter, Koreans produce their own line of accessories under the camera).  14 megapixels and power-ups in the form of a great 3-inch swivel AMOLED display and HD video recording.  Although technologically this is a simpler solution than that of the Japanese, but such a photo should give a better picture - because of the size of the matrix.  And there will be much less noise than 4/3 mini-cameras (there is a problem there). <br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/3/3d/DC_SensorsSizes.png" alt="image"><br>  Just in case, the picture from Wikipedia is the matrix size 4/3 in the very center, and the light green around it is just the size of the matrix in the NX10. <br><br>  But the camera, though less DSLRs, is still big.  For comparison: the dimensions of the Panasonic GF1 are 119x71x36 mm and 285 g against 123x87x40 mm and 353 g for Samsung. <br><br>  I talked to the vice-president of Samsung, who was responsible for this very direction, and he told me that the audience of the NX10 are prosumers who are not ready to buy a DSLR, but who are not satisfied with the quality of the soap dishes.  And he said a strange thing for me - they say, mirrors are a trend, but not everyone is ready for them, and the presence of such a camera gives the amateur the feeling that he has a SLR ... so I don‚Äôt know how many people are willing to buy the device for the feeling that he looks like a DSLR?  Another Mr. Vice President said that replaceable optics can attract a buyer.  But again I doubt: is it correct to focus the question on interchangeable optics?  It is unlikely that this will drag an amateur into a niche, give him a compact size and a point-and-jester: he pointed it and took it off. <br><br>  In short, I'm a little confused, but one thing I know for sure - if Samsung has entered the market, it will be a carpet bombing - something is being driven into the minds of consumers, what will it be?  And everyone is waiting for progress from other brands: Sony (first of all), as well as Canon and Nikon. <br><br>  This class completely knocks the ground out from under the cameras, the latter will soon leave the mass market and occupy a niche, for example, a niche Youtube-cameras.  And there are plenty of questions on microphysics.  What is this market in Russia, is there a segmentation inside it, are the Japanese and the Koreans fighting for one audience or not?  What concept will win: ‚Äúshoved the DSLR into the soap box‚Äù (Panasonic and Olympus) or ‚Äúshoved the soap box into the SLR‚Äù (Samsung NX10)? <br><br>  Question to the habra people: what do you think about the fate of this class? <br><br>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/neturubar/CES2010">photo album from CES</a> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/neturubar/CES2010"><br></a>  opinion of the editor of Nomobile.ru Alexey Goncharov <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/word/60123.html">about the trend of tablets</a> presented at CES </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80784/</a></p>
