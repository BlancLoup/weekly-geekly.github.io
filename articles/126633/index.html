Skitch is an interesting Mac application that changes the way people receive, comment and share images.  The main developers of Skitch - Chris Pearson (Cris Pearson) and Keith Lang (Keith Lang) - will move from Australia and join Evernote, to lead the significantly increased Skitch team and implement plans for the project development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Evernote History </h3><br>  Evernote has come a long and interesting way.  In 2007, two teams came together to develop a new type of product - a service that would help the world remember everything.  In 2008, this vision was embodied in Evernote, which you know today.  Now these are 14 supported platforms and 12 million users, and we are taking the first steps at a new stage in the development of our company: <strong>new applications</strong> .

Over the years, one of the most pressing tasks for us remains the improvement of image processing and the ability to comment on them.  Our users have already uploaded millions of photos and screenshots to their accounts, but working with this content is not yet implemented as well as it could have been.  We argued that it would be better to add new functions to Evernote or develop a separate application for these tasks.  In the end, we decided to accept both options.  Thanks to Skitch, this can be done much faster and more correctly. <br><br><h3>  Skitch will make Evernote better (and vice versa) </h3><br>  Skitch users will confirm that this is one of the most innovative and yet easy to use Mac applications.  We want it to remain so.  Our task is not only to make Skitch for Mac an even more wonderful application, but also to bring Skitch to each of the existing computer and mobile platforms.  In addition, in the coming months you will see a closer integration between Evernote and Skitch, which will allow you to easily and conveniently draw, make handwritten notes, take screenshots, make comments and share your favorite notes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/895/b7a/eda/895b7aedabcce5f4a9c0b188c81b0da2.png"><br><br>  We get more than just an app;  you can't create one of the best Mac software if you don't have brilliant ideas, and therefore we look forward to Skitch team joining Evernote.  You can notice their influence on many aspects of our products. <br><br><h3>  What will change? </h3><br>  Everything that you like about Skitch today will remain unchanged, and we will focus on the rapid implementation of new features. <br><br>  The full version of Skitch, which used to cost $ 19.95 on the Mac App Store, is now available absolutely free.  Trial versions also disappear as unnecessary.  There will be no more advertising and restrictions. <br><br>  New users will be able to log in to Skitch with their Evernote account details.  Current Skitch users can continue to work through their <a href="http://skitch.com/">skitch.com accounts</a> . <br><br><h3>  Using Skitch with Evernote Today </h3><br>  You can use Evernote with Skitch today.  Drag and drop images from Evernote to Skitch for Mac, leave comments and edit them, and then use the ‚ÄúDrag Me‚Äù feature in Skitch to return them to Evernote.  Or just take screenshots in Skitch and drag them to Evernote.  We will try to make the interaction between applications even more convenient and transparent. <br><br><h3>  More new products in the future </h3><br>  Our goal is to make Skitch a self-evident tool for anyone who wants to draw, sketch, comment, paint, label or highlight something.  In general, for all.  Our developers are working on a close bunch of services.  We combine years of our experience with digital ink and handwriting recognition with fantastic Skitch capabilities. <br><br>  We want this amazing and elegant way to create screenshots, which we fell in love with many years ago, now to get the development resources it deserves. <br><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch/id425955336%3Fmt%3D12">Download Skitch ¬ª</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126633/</a></p>
