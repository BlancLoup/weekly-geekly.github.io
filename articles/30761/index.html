    <br><h3>  yaPhone </h3><br>  In the old iPhones, I was most infuriated by the fact that there was no search for contacts, that is, it was impossible to write ‚ÄúPu‚Äù anywhere and immediately see the phones of Putin and Pupkin, there is only a moronic script with the alphabet.  Russian letters in this alphabet does not appear even after the Russification of the phone itself.  I have four hundred contacts written in Russian, so I had to constantly and for a long time rub my finger on the screen from top to bottom.  Someday, after the third world war, people will thus make fire. <br><br><br><img src="http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2008/05/iBFG2.jpg"><br>  ¬© <a href="http://gizmodo.com/388554/100%25252B-iphone-2-designs-i-guarantee-steve-jobs-wont-unveil-anytime-soon"><i>The most idiotic iPhone concepts</i></a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>  30 '' movie screen </h3><br><br>  Everything in general is nothing, only the resolution is not enough, that is, the points are huge.  Well, what is 2560 √ó 1600 for a monitor the size of a football field? <br>  For comparison, on a seventeen-inch Dell working laptop, I have a resolution of 1920 √ó 1440.  In general, the laptop is a complete shit, but at half the size of the screen, the resolution differs only by a quarter, I tell you, this is an indicator of progress.  And yet, you will laugh, on huge spaces of 30 inches it is hard to find the mouse cursor.  If only it highlighted something, when after a break you begin to carry around the screen with a mouse. <br><br><img src="http://akomarov.ru/lj/2.jpg"><br>  <i>On a photo: workplace at my place.</i> <br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>  Mighty mouse </h3><br>  The device is a hellishly convenient ball for scrolling anything on the screen in any direction, stuck in a shiny piece of white plastic shit.  Besides the ball in the mouse, everything is different: <br>  hold is not convenient <br>  to press a button on weight is impossible (this pressing technique comes in handy somewhere at the fifteenth hour of sitting at the computer), the buttons on the sides are pressed by themselves without my participation (I had to turn them off). <br>  And the most important thing: you cannot press both buttons at the same time, and this means that you can‚Äôt jump, shoot and shoot - jump. <br><br><img src="http://akomarov.ru/lj/3.jpg"><br><br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>  MacBook Pro </h3><br>  Most of all I blew the brain apple on the lid.  The normal position of the apple is upside down.  At least once a day I take the laptop out of my bag, put it on the table in front of me so that the apple on the lid is <i>not</i> upside down.  (There is no other way to determine where in front of where the butt is, despite the ends.) I try to open the lid and it never works: the opening button is always on the other side. <br>  <b>Upd:</b> Yes, I know that the apple turns in a normal way when you open the lid, but I don‚Äôt care what logo the person sees passing by my laptop, inverted or normal. <br>  Here, Apple sacrificed some convenience and obviousness of use in favor of brand promotion.  From a business point of view, the decision is the right one, but from my point of view of the user, it is lousy. <br><br><img src="http://akomarov.ru/lj/4.jpg"><br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>  Ipod stirrer </h3><br><br>  The player itself is normal, but the headphones are just awful, they now began to make such a rubber rim so that they would not fall out of the ear.  After a couple of months, she begins to shred.  In the photo you can see the beginning of this process: <br><br><img src="http://akomarov.ru/lj/5.jpg"><br><br><br><br>  And finally <br><h3>  New iphone three ji </h3><br>  Firstly, the purchase process itself is terrible, the device needs to be written out in the store for a coupon, as in Soviet times, then wait a couple of weeks, and then again follow him to the store.  (I am silent, that in Russia it costs $ 1500 with the original price of 200 bucks, this is a topic for a separate study.) Secondly, in the welcome SMS from EHT it says "... It's all available online <b>on your PC</b> " - about poppies, not a word.  If I were Steve Jobs, I would be offended. <br><br><img src="http://akomarov.ru/lj/1.jpg"><br><br><br>  And also, the seller in the store told me that they are still forbidden to have iPhones - the demand for them is so great that everyone is not enough, and the priority is on the buyer's side.  Here is a corporate policy. </td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30761/</a></p>
