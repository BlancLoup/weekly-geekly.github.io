  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Under the RAO "dig": the investigation suggests the authors to write in writing to accuse the organization of causing material damage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Tuesday, December 1, Russian producers, members of the Authors Council of the Russian Authors' Society ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">RAO</a> ) and its managers discussed possible changes in the work of RAO.  It was a pre-planned meeting at which such topical issues were raised as the change of the organizational and legal form of society, the powers of the supervisory board and others. <br><br>  But participants of the discussion showed a special attitude to the issues of reforming the RAO.  Bearing in mind the ‚Äúdark‚Äù history associated with the withdrawal of the organization‚Äôs assets, the members of the RAO invited investigators to attend.  They investigate the details of the alleged theft of RAO assets.  Law enforcement officials argue that in order to speed up the investigation and possible initiation of a criminal case, the authors themselves must inform the law enforcement authorities that the activities of the RAO caused them material damage. <br><br>  So far, the authors have not taken a unanimous decision on filing complaints. <a name="habracut"></a>  However, members of the RAO Authors Council were offered to conduct an independent audit in the organization.  According to its results, it will be possible to make a final decision on whether to file an application with law enforcement agencies.

      True, not all members of the board of the authors' society were present at the meeting, and concrete decisions could not be made at this event, a source <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/02/619293-avtori">told</a> Vedomosti.  To this end, a meeting of the author's board of RAO, the main governing body of the organization, must be organized.  Such a meeting will take place sooner or later, he is sure.  The exact date is not yet known. <br><br>  In the summer of this year, the Main Department for Economic Security and Anti-Corruption of the Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted an audit of the activities of four subsidiaries of RAO - Service-Operation Company CJSC (SEC), Media-M Management Company CJSC, Media Management CJSC and Management Company CJSC "Musical Olympus".  According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 2012-2014, RAO transferred property in the amount of 557 million rubles to the balance of these companies, after which three of the four companies were liquidated. <br><br>  At the beginning of November, a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs informed Vedomosti that criminal cases were not initiated due to the circumstances of the withdrawal of assets by RAO subsidiaries. <br><br>  RAO confirms that it is being tested against individuals.  But so far the competent authorities have not established the fact of theft. <br><br>  On November 24, Megamozg <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22100/">wrote</a> that Igor Matvienko, a member of the author‚Äôs board of the Russian Authors' Society, at a meeting of the Council for Culture under the chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, said that RAO was not functioning and the organization‚Äôs accounts were blocked.  According to Matvienko, the size of the theft of his "hair stood on end" when he looked at the documents.  The composer said that members of the public testify that we are talking about a sum of about one billion rubles and the case is being prepared for transfer to the prosecutor's office. <br><br>  On the same day, RAO officially <a href="http://rao.ru/index.php/homepage/94-press-tsentr/novosti/2312-20151124-1">denied</a> this information.  The organization claims that as of November 24, 2015, it is operating normally, the author's fee is collected, distributed and paid without interruption, and the information on the ‚Äútransfer of cases to the prosecutor‚Äôs office‚Äù is fiction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296940/</a></p>
