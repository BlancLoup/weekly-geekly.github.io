The 3D card is equipped with two M.2 slots for SSD with PCIe 3.0 x4 interface.  Drives, according to the manufacturer, can be used to store data that is processed by the graphics adapter.  SSDs are connected to the PCIe bus using the PEX8747 bridge. <br><br>  At the presentation of the new graphics card, the Radeon Pro SSG (SSG - Solid State Graphics) was shown, with two Samsung 950 Pro drives of 512 GB each.  Both SSDs were combined into a RAID 0 array. According to the manufacturers, this was done to improve performance.  And it was worth it - when working with RAW video quality 8K, the data transfer rate was 4 GB / s. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you use a system SSD, then the average processing speed is equal to 900 MB / s.  The need to work the card with system memory instead of local causes a strong slowdown in adapter performance.

      The company has revealed not many details.  In addition to what has already been said, the adapter is based on the Polaris 10 chip, which is now used in the affordable RX 480 card. Map developers claim that SSG is ideal for graphic designers and developers, since the card can significantly increase the performance of high-load systems.  In addition to designers, the cards will be able to help physicians in areas where real-time rendering of images is required (for example, building 3D animation of a patient's heart), in the oil and gas industry, and other areas. <br><br>  The operation of the card with 8K video quality was shown with installed SSDs and without them.  When working with system memory, the frame rate during movie playback was 17 fps.  With installed drives, this figure rose to 30. AMD states that the frame rate can be raised to 90 frames per second. <br><br>  So far, the map development is in the proof of concept stage.  The prototype, which has demonstrated very high performance, suggests a possible approaching new era of working with graphics.  But this will happen only if cards of this type become more accessible.  Now, the developer‚Äôs proposed development cost is $ 9,999. Radeon Pro SSG cards will be available next year. <br><br>  In addition to the Radeon Pro SSG, the company introduced a new range of graphics cards for workstations based on the Polaris chip.  The series was named Radeon Pro WX.  The entire lineup, in fact, is the rebranding of the RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460, but with a number of options in driver support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe4/dc3/3a7/fe4dc33a7951dfa3c1cbb25b43d476ed.jpg" width="750">  &gt; <br><br>  The performance of the older model Radeon Pro WX7100 with 2048 stream processors - over 5 teraflops.  This card is equipped with an 8 GB GPU memory on a 256-bit bus.  The effective frequency is 7 GHz.  Its cost is ‚Äúless than $ 1000‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51c/eec/2c5/51ceec2c5a4774e23ac0327841d87428.jpg" width="750">  &gt; <br><br>  The Radeon Pro WX5100 with 1782 stream processors is a professional-grade energy efficient card.  Its power consumption is reduced to 75 W, so the card does not require an additional power connector.  The performance level of the card is slightly lower than the previous model - 4 TFlops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e73/858/0ba/e738580baefdc2f52ac9c48a05f8d0bd.jpg" width="750">  &gt; <br><br>  The Radeon Pro WX 4100 model with 1024 stream processors is based on the POlaris 11 graphics processor. It is equipped with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory.  Its performance is 2 TFlops. <br><br>  All presented cards can display an image simultaneously on four 5K displays.  On each model - four DisplayPort.  Adapters support hardware-based encoding and decoding of 4K video with HEVC2 and VP9 codecs.  These three models will be available in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Warranty period for cards is 10 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396305/</a></p>
