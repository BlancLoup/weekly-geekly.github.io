  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Atlassian Office in San Francisco</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month ago, I attended the <a href="http://summit.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Summit</a> in San Francisco ‚Äî an annual event for Atlassian customers and partners.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145607/">I already wrote the</a> report on the event, and promised to write a little about the Atlassian office, which everyone who <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145607/">had come to</a> see. <br><br>  An excursion to the office took place at the end of the last day, so there were not too many willing people (20 people).  But, it is worth noting that there were two ‚Äúcalls‚Äù to the office, in the afternoons and in the evening.  I chose the evening to not miss anything of interest at the Summit itself.  So during the day there could be more people willing. <br><br>  In total Atlassian has 3 offices - in Sydney, in San Francisco and Amsterdam.  In appearance, the building does not stand out in anything special and it is difficult to guess whose office is inside.  Even a billboard on the roof advertises a completely different company :)

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/520/f16/f80/520f16f8044102f720c0a59229177ef3.jpg"><br><br>  The office is located at the intersection of <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/e1Ow">Garrison Street and 7th Street</a> .  Previously, the office was located elsewhere, 1.5 kilometers to the south-west, but in April of this year Atlassian moved to a new and, of course, a steeper office.  Prior to this, the office has already undergone <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2008/05/san_francisco_n/">one move</a> in 2008. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a45/1ba/977/a451ba977f0636c4fae93ee24df2b303.jpg"><br><br>  Spiderman is not against IT <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e2/f0d/6cc/1e2f0d6ccd9625991e385dd1c6a66b5a.jpg"><br><br>  The entrance to the office is not equipped with light tunnels or transparent doors and looks rather modest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d8/80a/556/3d880a556ebe837931cfc0c94e539371.jpg"><br><br>  But the visitors who entered the office were delighted that today is Friday, which means that the famous ‚Äúbeer trolley‚Äù is driving around the office, which met us at the entrance.  "Beer trolley" transferred several reincarnations and in its current form is not just a cart, but a whole vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f69/5eb/c13/f695ebc137d9a9a19e2965fe877b8ac2.jpg"><br><br>  The Atlassian office is spacious and two-story.  People sit in OpenSpace, which, to be honest, is alarming.  But like the difficulty of working in OpenSpace like no one complained.  It was not possible to personally assess the noisiness of the office, since  there were few people in the evening, and those few teams that were present produced much less noise than visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1b/a9e/ae1/c1ba9eae107e77f76735a24a56abfe97.jpg"><br><br>  Workplaces are mainly located around the central almost empty zone.  In the central zone there are several cool armchairs, which were immediately occupied by visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e85/68f/4d9/e8568f4d9f9c4bd9acedb84fa267f5e0.jpg"><br><br>  An elegant staircase leads to the second floor, which is not only a staircase, but also an interesting place to rest and work.  Work and recreation places are equipped with pillows and sockets.  It is worth noting that this is not the only staircase to the second floor, but there are several more around the edges of the building, so the people sitting on the staircase should not be disturbed by the crowd. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40e/0c0/d0c/40e0c0d0cbe2612bd3ae96c74cca5be4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c5/719/3b5/5c57193b5ef35439c861395540752e70.jpg"><br><br>  Top view of the stairs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec2/e00/187/ec2e001872ca6a94d5fca037780c144e.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the room is made in a fashionable style ‚Äúlet's leave these pipes that were here before us,‚Äù but rather quickly stop paying attention to them.  People have enough personal space in the workplace, there are a lot of <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/work-chairs/aeron-chairs.html">Aerons</a> among the chairs, and a lot of Macs among computers.  On the walls hang large monitors with some kind of probably useful information, which I was ashamed to scrutinize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1f/4c9/484/c1f4c9484694fc251a02e425a5412219.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bf/354/b82/7bf354b8200658b0b6f46d9406ffcf53.jpg"><br><br>  Some, as you can see, did not get Aerons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c1/29b/9c2/5c129b9c26229e1cd512cc2ea12e36ba.jpg"><br><br>  The technical support team happily welcomes guests to the office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c9/612/5b7/6c96125b731a03af5e2dbf71300b6e37.jpg"><br><br>  The building has a lot of meeting rooms of various sizes.  And this, for sure, is one of the factors thanks to which people successfully work in OpenSpace - nobody will arrange rallies in your ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/769/e0f/744/769e0f744070a9df84a19ca58c29f7dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef2/37b/a4b/ef237ba4bf1a98b1d36de87efa0fcffc.jpg"><br><br>  There are such small negotiations for a couple of people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/450/764/0cc/4507640cc34856f1fcc47ce37ecb2038.jpg"><br><br>  I really liked the system of "booking" negotiation, assembled on the basis of iPad-s.  Shows the status of the negotiation, here it can be booked.  I did not ask, but I suspect that the statuses can be managed centrally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e05/257/a3c/e05257a3c58dc9d6d1baf2369fe2103a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/081/84b/a6a/08184ba6a6d30a67c1424fa821308b74.jpg"><br><br>  Regularly here and there small places for rest, food and quiet conversations, all made in different styles, come across. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fee/59e/93f/fee59e93fdc6ef414a906ed0c5872cdb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/731/a3b/020/731a3b020497ca99e9c5f6580fba55ae.jpg"><br><br>  There is an interesting (I noticed only one) hanging chair: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33b/b87/665/33bb87665111663f99d411362f9273eb.jpg"><br><br>  A modest door with a small inscription hides behind a small shower room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bb/89a/dbf/8bb89adbf28f3525514c91939b6070bf.jpg"><br><br>  Jobs employees make out who in that much: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e62/2ca/9a5/e622ca9a5895dd02564ff0e1fb0720b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09e/999/d20/09e999d20d5c994fa0e3d1c518a70580.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/036/2c2/f1d/0362c2f1ddc6a50854e34fafe417be9f.jpg"><br><br>  The office has several small kitchens where you can eat: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bf/581/d4a/0bf581d4ac7b5530ae3acd18a41b805b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab6/a1f/a72/ab6a1fa72eed585316c984b4862f7d4b.jpg"><br><br>  Having long puzzled over how the ‚Äúbeer trolley‚Äù climbs on the 2nd floor, I saw through the secret - there are 2 of them :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c67/291/42c/c6729142c217d1762e8691f4982aeeaa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1a/075/cbd/d1a075cbd3277e90292aa97d70589a9f.jpg"><br><br>  In one of the corners of the 2nd floor there was a ‚Äúgreen corner‚Äù with a hammock and a bookcase (not visible in the photo) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c60/a95/af1/c60a95af1f134a10eef8776c58844d23.jpg"><br><br>  But the support team has no time to rest, and the employees are in good physical condition right at the workplace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a70/0c1/12f/a700c112feca706d5772fbc25b806812.jpg"><br><br>  Side by side (with the same support) there are several places to work while standing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39c/3e6/24b/39c3e624b9d3fe665d23f60899c04afd.jpg"><br><br>  For one of the employees, who was jokingly dreaming about his small shop, good associates built (while he was away on a business trip) this very corner shop from materials left after the move.  Now he has a workplace there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b4/963/400/9b4963400d7252c11f666dc587228f4a.jpg"><br><br>  Sometimes you have to work in dangerous conditions.  For this, branded helmets are stocked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b56/001/4ba/b560014ba15360e99d2d4905b1f06f25.jpg"><br><br>  But some guys need more serious protection in the workplace: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52d/fbd/b0a/52dfbdb0a48ea82f667cc2433b4e43bd.jpg"><br><br>  The company strongly encourages the movement of employees on bicycles.  This year, Atlassian was among the companies most friendly to cyclists <a href="http://www.sfbike.org/main/san-francisco%25E2%2580%2599s-best-workplaces-for-people-who-bike/">in the opinion of the mayor</a> .  The building has a convenient bicycle parking area and several ‚Äúpublic‚Äù bicycles that can be taken by any employee of the company.  It is very convenient that the "public" bikes are with different frame sizes and you can choose the one that suits you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c16/6f2/940/c166f294041a960c6adb1b95e202fab6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac8/ad6/c3d/ac8ad6c3defc0814edd59485533ae732.jpg"><br><br>  Quite a large room reserved for a rest room.  There is a table tennis ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c3/c07/e21/1c3c07e212dadaf7e4887d584db42a56.jpg"><br><br>  ... another kitchen, where there is a bar with draft beer ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/07c/06d/785/07c06d7851b16abe2faee6ab1adc7c13.jpg"><br><br>  ... and a game console with all sorts of "bells and whistles" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf9/20f/0d6/cf920f0d6f49f591bfda5dad2389631f.jpg"><br><br>  Nearby there is a small hall for meetings and lectures, which so far is ‚Äúnot brought to mind‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c25/955/2aa/c259552aa8cc109e3e0285355ade5bc8.jpg"><br><br>  Having gone around the office a little more, I thanked the organizers for their hospitality and went to the Atlassian Experts party, where it was also interesting :) But I‚Äôm not going to write about it. <br><br>  To sum it up, there are no several cafeterias with different cuisines in this office, there are no massage therapists (although there is a massage chair) and instead of a discount for a car, they offer to ride a bicycle :) But it‚Äôs clear that the office was made not just for people, but with them, and people are now very comfortable in this office. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146593/</a></p>
