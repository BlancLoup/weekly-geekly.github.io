      So, for the continuation, please go to the full news. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, the first thing I want to thank all those who responded to the previous article and left their comments.  Thanks to you - many can read the sequel.  Well, now - in essence. <br><br>  <b>"Debriefing"</b> <br><br>  It will be tedious to disassemble all the comments that were written in the last part, but some should be stopped.  Immediately I want to apologize for those reflections that will be further and further in the text, but ... I want to put my thoughts a little on public display (discussion). <br><br>  So, the first comment that I would like to mention is the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15014/">comment of the</a> respected <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/denis_from_oks/" class="user_link">denis_from_oks</a> .  I had a clear feeling of something painfully familiar.  After some thought, I had to agree that this was the way ... of any ‚Äúself-taught freelancer‚Äù.  Of course, now many may begin to argue that ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù are not capable of working in a team, and in general they will not be able to work in institutions, as one of my colleagues said (because of this we constantly had disputes - who is better, he‚Äôs with tower ", or I am from secondary vocational school). <br><br>  I agree with you a little, out of respect, so to speak.  The thing is, in fact, I myself belong to such people.  It all started with a simple repair of computers to friends / acquaintances of friends, both hardware and software.  Further, when I had already picked up a bit of experience and dating, a little more serious work went - help build a network, set up an operating system for specific tasks, and so on.  When I realized that IT is the element in which I want to work, and I like it so much (and God bless him, that sometimes you come home so exhausted and dirty that you are ready to go to sleep right here on the mat ), then he began to prepare himself for more serious work - to read books on repair and adjustment, to look for programs, to train - well, at the same time to read articles and forums, including here.  Over time, I began to understand such things, when looking at which earlier I began to throw a nervous shiver. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bit of experience</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  As I remember, the first thing - which annoyed me very much - was the crimping of network cables.  Constantly confused, everything turned out wrong, nothing worked, spent hours on picking up a piece of iron, and then it turned out that he had mixed up the pair or did not fully compress the connector.  At one point, this situation is pretty tired.  For several days I tried to memorize color pairs ... It didn't work out.  Then he decided to combine business with pleasure - he compressed and looked at the examples, then he left a couple of samples for himself and dragged them along.  Over time, the habit of spying disappeared, and the skill remained, which is very pleasing.  Well, now you can easily do such work. <br></div></div><br>  Continuing the theme of "self-study" (and I will continue to reflect on it, perhaps in one of the following parts), it should be noted some cold attitude of the employer when applying for a job.  For example, in my case, I had to pretty much sweat over the fact that I could be noticed (see the first part in part) and, after the trial period (while I was the main administrator on vacation), I fully accepted the job.  It helped, as I now understand, that I had a desire to study, I was interested in how this or that mechanism / program works, and how the IT structure of the enterprise is built in general.  Also, their role was played by the fact that the administrator found a better job and was going to quit. <br><br>  Well, okay, I deviated a little from the course I asked at the very beginning.  Well, back to the comments. <br><br>  The next person you want to pay attention to was a user with the nickname <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/civil/" class="user_link">Civil</a> , who touched on the topic of company size.  Well, on this occasion, I would like to spend a little thought, as there were questions.  Specific example.  When I got a job, I was checked by a system administrator who worked at this enterprise and the head of the department.  The enterprise itself has a total of about 120 computers scattered throughout the area + about 50-55 computers in the city and + 20 computers in the building, where, in fact, I work.  In total, we have 190-195 computers, well, you can still throw 10 servers and 5 intermediate transfer stations from the zone nodes.  We have a medium-sized enterprise, but it is ... a branch.  And so in every district.  Why all this text?  The question is - what is the enterprise considered in this case, if it is a branch? <br><br>  Well, with the analysis of comments over.  Now we proceed to the rest. <br><br>  Entry into the WEB industry. <br><br>  I began to enter the world of the WEB industry and in particular development about six months ago.  Why only recently did I notice this?  Everything is very simple.  The first time after employment, I completely devoted myself to work.  Often I sat at night on remote access, testing this or that equipment and software.  And I liked it.  Tuning this or that software or hardware, you get an indescribable feeling of joy, and especially euphoria, when this software or equipment worked as it should.  Since the software is primarily for internal use, instructions for it are not found on the Internet.  I had to comprehend everything myself, ‚Äúwalking out‚Äù common mistakes and trying to speculate, link the test results and this mistake and find the ‚Äúroot of universal evil‚Äù.  But, believe me, after successfully launching all the software / hardware, and solving the tasks that I set for myself, I can calmly come to work and enjoy it, and then go home with peace of mind. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">From personal experience</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The most memorable was setting up the 1C database and transferring internal information between the databases, and the subsequent integration of data into a small console application that controlled the exchange operations.  Frankly, I do not remember a more stubborn and lengthy process of setting up and testing everything and everything connected with this very base ... <br></div></div><br><br>  But, again, I deviated from the topic, fast forward to the web industry.  After lengthy and painful actions with settings and adjustments, finally, all the tasks that I set for myself were solved, and I could go on vacation for 1.5 months.  Went to Italy, visited Karelia, St. Petersburg, admired swing bridges.  Vacation was a success! <br><br>  After arriving from such a trip ... it became boring !!!  There are still 2 weeks of free unoccupied time.  What would be useful to take?  That's right, to learn something new, so that the brain does not relax, but to work to its fullest. <br><br>  And this new for me was the world of web development.  You may have already noticed that I use the concepts of "web development" and "web industry."  I think that these concepts are a single whole, that is, the web industry develops thanks to web development, which brings more and more interesting things to the web world.  Here in the field of development I wanted to try myself. <br><br>  The first and most terrible mistake for me was the wrong way of learning.  For some reason, I wanted to configure servers for various operating systems, run various services, pick configs and so on and so forth.  Instead of real learning advanced technology. <br><br>  Soon, when the knowledge in the field of servers slightly increased, I began to look closely at the exchange of freelancers.  Alas, and oh, the road there for me was closed, because all the tasks were either too difficult, or there was too much chance of being "thrown" by another customer.  As a result, I stood at a crossroads - knowledge seems to be as it is, but I did not understand how and where to apply them.  It was decided to open his small project and pick it up little by little, day after day honing his skills and creating new configs for his collection. <br><br>  One day they called me ... and pulled me out, saying that tomorrow for work ... Ehh, 2 weeks flew by like an instant, and only an almost black tan gave me a vacationer. <br>  With the release to work, a small load appeared in the form of updates sent for a long time, heaps of erroneous data and a little out-of-mind technology ... <br><br>  A month passed ... Almost all problems were solved, only in the scheduler hung a couple of daily tasks that can be easily automated, but these are so subtle tasks that the slightest inaccuracy turned the whole database inside out.  Only reconcile line by line with the report.  It took about 1-2 hours a day. <br><br>  There is time, why not continue picking servers and comprehending new unknown programs and services?  Or is it better to read smart books on programming?  Or watch a video lesson?  As you can see, the weight options. <br><br>  Started with books.  PHP5 in the original, PHP through the eyes of a hacker and the rest ... It‚Äôs hard to understand what the author is writing - you have to google, and there are even more terms and concepts for google, so you can get lost.  I started watching lessons - but when, after 2-3 author's lessons, I literally lulled into a chair - I realized ... it's time to take up the practice! <br>  Worked according to the method - Purpose - Information - Implementation.  I quickly enough could penetrate into some elements, what I did not understand - I left it for dessert, sorting it out at the end of the week.  So I learn from time to time, not allowing the brain to fall asleep from idleness. <br><br>  We now turn to the <b>real state of affairs</b> .  Here I will be as brief as possible. <br><br>  What we have? <br>  - Favorite work, which is a pleasure to come. <br>  - Favorite team, which is very united, young, and well trained <br>  - Favorite hobby - developing and studying scripts for personal use <br><br>  What are my plans: <br>  - make your small cozy blog, where I will publish my articles. <br>  - put together a team of like-minded people who will help with programming the blogging system <br>  - continue the in-depth study of PHP and pay attention to the frameworks <br><br>  This is all for now for this part.  If you did not meet your expectations - please forgive me, and point out the flaws that are in the design.  For now, I‚Äôll think about the next article.  For the plans, I ask you not to execute much - if anyone is interested, then I will be able to describe in stages all the elements that I do.  For some, this will be an example of how to do it, and maybe not do it. <br><br>  To new meetings on open spaces of "Megamind".  And I do not say goodbye! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290406/</a></p>
