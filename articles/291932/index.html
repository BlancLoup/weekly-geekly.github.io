But how did oceanology connect you to programming and, in particular, to programming 1C?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Firstly, why did the Ural guy suddenly go to the ocean, right?</font>  <font color="#000">Perhaps this question has arisen?</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">And this, too, yes.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">In life, guided by several principles.</font>  <font color="#000">First, I liked math.</font>  <font color="#000">During the training I participated in olympiads.</font>  <font color="#000">Secondly, I liked chemistry, I also participated in olympiads.</font>  <font color="#000">Liked to explore.</font>  <font color="#000">In parallel with the trip, we had an optional course at school, like-minded group: we went on trips, but not just went on a hike, but did some research, participated in various conferences and seminars.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Then there was another passion for music: I liked to sing and play instruments.</font>  <font color="#000">Well, travel, I also called.</font>  <font color="#000">Here are 4 main whales.</font>  <font color="#000">To enter the Physics and Mathematics Department, then there is physics and mathematics ‚Äî something that I liked, but lacked that part related to travel.</font>  <font color="#000">If you go somewhere separately for travel, then accordingly ... Oceanology turned out to be such a science, where I could realize almost all my interests.</font>  <font color="#000">First, it is the mathematics that we were taught in the volume of the mathematical faculty at the university.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Seriously.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Secondly, chemistry in the volume of the chemical department: very deep, many, and very interesting.</font>  <font color="#000">And plus the research part of oceanology is extensive.</font>  <font color="#000">Probably, people now know less about the ocean than about near space.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, yes, he seems to be near, but in reality ...</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">... And in fact, no end of research.</font>  <font color="#000">Accordingly, the journey, and this, of course, the expedition, and the expedition is a small team of 120 people.</font>  <font color="#000">And these are opportunities for self-development - a certain mode, you can engage in sports, get together with like-minded people in the evenings, play in the ensemble, have parties and dance.</font>  <font color="#000">In fact, oceanology is a field of activity that has satisfied all my interests.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Okay, well ..</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">... how did you move on to programming?</font>  <font color="#000">(Laughs)</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Okay about programming ... Here you graduated.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">What was the cause of the first labor activity?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">You really began to travel as you wanted before entering or while studying at the institute?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I entered in the 84th year, and finished in the 91st.</font>  <font color="#000">For two years I had a break for service in the ranks of the armed forces.</font>  <font color="#000">The 91st year was characterized by the fact that a rather deep crisis had begun, the first, one might say, crisis, very powerful.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the first labor exploits</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Do you have a defense before the coup or after?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I graduated from the university, and the principle of distribution ceased to operate, that is, no one wanted to hire anyone, the need for specialists was over.</font>  <font color="#000">But, however, while I was still studying, we had a chance.</font>  <font color="#000">At one of the first manufacturing practices was a very good expedition leader, academician in the future.</font>  <font color="#000">After the expedition in which I worked, he met our rector, our head of department, and said: ‚ÄúThe student you had here was interesting.</font>  <font color="#000">In the morning I come to the laboratory, it works.</font>  <font color="#000">After a couple of hours I go out on deck to sunbathe, he sunbathes there, after some time I come in after lunch - he works.</font>  <font color="#000">At some point I go out on the sports deck before the afternoon snack - he is engaged in sports there ‚Äù...</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">That is all the time in front of his eyes ...</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">... ‚ÄùIn the evening I go to the mess room, and there he rehearses with the ensemble.</font>  <font color="#000">We went to Singapore, we go back from Singapore, we return to the home port, we work - they arrange a concert on the deck, everyone is having fun there.</font>  <font color="#000">I wish this student would be to me, ‚Äùhe said such a phrase,‚Äú after finishing work in the laboratory! ‚ÄùAnd the head of the department, when the 91st year happened, said:‚Äú There‚Äôs no distribution, but you can calmly come up and ... ‚Äù said, where this academician, Viktor Anatolyevich works, I still remember him - ‚Äúgo to him and say, remind him of this phrase‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">And I went to him and said, and he says: "Yes, of course, I remember that, and I will gladly take you to work."</font>  <font color="#000">And I began working at the Institute of Marine Technology Problems as an intern researcher.</font>  <font color="#000">It was the Far Eastern Branch of the Academy of Sciences.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">And what did you do there?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I was a research intern.</font>  <font color="#000">When I came to the laboratory, the academician told me: ‚ÄúWrite a program,‚Äù he needed a certain program, ‚Äúand learn English.‚Äù</font>  <font color="#000">Before me, he was able to prepare one student well, and he moved to work in Canada.</font>  <font color="#000">Regarding me, perhaps, there were such thoughts ... When I came to work, I did not know which side to approach the computer, because there were already PCs, and when I finished the university, we still had the EU.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">"I will change the one-room apartment in Moscow on a personal computer"</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, in the 91m already the 286th should have been.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Well, and there were even the 386th, and in the first expedition in 91 they even bought the 486th car, and in Singapore they gave it, I think, 5.5 thousand dollars.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">I still remember the announcements of the 90s ‚ÄúI‚Äôll change my personal computer to a one-room apartment in Moscow‚Äù.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, there was a time when personal computers were worth 40 thousand - this is a little later, and my salary was 240 rubles ...</font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">It turns out that you, as a research intern, began to write a program without knowing anything about it.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Can you say you started to explore a field like programming?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I was assigned the task in the following way: a program is needed that will store the data of those stations that we will process with the instrument: take the temperature, salinity, water density, and this data must be stored and then processed.</font>  <font color="#000">Accordingly, what to do?</font>  <font color="#000">Yes, you need to learn what a database is.</font>  <font color="#000">We take the book, we understand.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">At that time it was probably something like clippers.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I had only two weeks to write the program, thanks to my colleagues who suggested.</font>  <font color="#000">I say: ‚ÄúWhere does the computer turn on?</font>  <font color="#000">And what should I do? ‚ÄùThey say to me:‚Äú You know, there is such software product ‚ÄúClarion‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">This is a classic database, plus there is a certain template that some system things do there quickly, and you need to think only about logic, how to store data, how to connect them ... ‚ÄùThey gave direction and said how to develop.</font>  <font color="#000">And at that moment we are going on an expedition - I already need to pass this program on this expedition.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">That is already a finished product.</font></b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About inspiration</font> </h1><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, the finished product.</font>  <font color="#000">Before the start of the laying of these stations was about two weeks, and I came across a little book such a reprint used to be - Richard Bach ‚ÄúIllusions‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">The main idea: the master gives the student a book and says: ‚ÄúRead it not from beginning to end, but first you should have a question in your head, then you open this book, and there will be an answer‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">And I read a book in one breath - and I became winged ...</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">There was no documentation in Russian, and I was learning German at school and at the institute, here I studied English a little more, and documentation in English.</font>  <font color="#000">With the help of this constructor ‚ÄúClarion-designer‚Äù, I put this little book with the documentation on my knees, did some things and I had a question what this operator was doing.</font>  <font color="#000">I did not want to study the whole book, once I opened it on any page, I read a little, and - into battle ...</font> <font color="#000"><br></font> <br>  <b><font color="#000">Since the beginning of your work is understandable, and then what?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">I understand that you didn‚Äôt just take it and open that company, and now the group of companies you are leading now?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Probably, there were initial steps - on the one hand in the direction of IT, on the other - in the direction of business.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Well, of course.</font>  <font color="#000">First, the 91st and 92nd years - the aggravation of difficulties with the Academy of Sciences, the termination of funding of our institute.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">Post-crisis time: orders are over, funding is over, expeditions are over, wages are not growing, and prices are fast.</font>  <font color="#000">At about 91, there was already a leap 8 times.</font>  <font color="#000">It was necessary to somehow survive.</font>  <font color="#000">And I started to make money.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">In his native institute, where he worked, he went to the library, and all circulars write on pieces of paper.</font>  <font color="#000">I suggested that they write a program in order to drive the entire library fund into a computer.</font>  <font color="#000">In two weeks he wrote, set, taught to deposit funds.</font>  <font color="#000">And everyone began to use it!</font>  <font color="#000">That is - I took and inadvertently so automated the library.</font>  <font color="#000">And they even paid for my work, about one and a half thousand rubles!</font>  <font color="#000">I received essentially my half-yearly salary for this program.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000">The most interesting thing is that this program worked there until almost 2000.</font>  <font color="#000">So, I started to earn money, went into the trade, as many probably did.</font>  <font color="#000">But I didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbuy and sell‚Äù the trade, but I wrote a program for myself that allowed me to optimize my work as a sales manager, in particular, I wrote out document types in terms of 1C, fixed operations that I transferred to someone sales, processed the proceeds, attracted 2 more sales managers, began to endow them with work.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúI TAKEN AND UNFORTUNATELY SO AUTOMATED THE LIBRARY‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">In essence, the business operation recorded.</font></b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the return of millions</font> </h1><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, operuchet.</font>  <font color="#000">Thanks to the program, for myself and written, I successfully worked.</font>  <font color="#000">Millions hung back to the company.</font>  <font color="#000">Now it became clear who, how much should, for what.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">The speed of information processing and, most importantly, the perception of man, increased significantly ...</font></b> <br><br>  Yes, you are already going to the point, and you have a printout: ‚ÄúYou owe us so much.‚Äù  In the ‚Äúdashing 90s‚Äù, many worked shamelessly: they took the goods, sold them and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù that they owed money to someone.  In 1993, there was such a company, the owner and founder of which was also a little scientist, from another institute of the Far Eastern Academy of Sciences.  And he managed to rent a building from a housing trust, in fact, at the level of promises: ‚ÄúYes, I will write you a program, you will count now!‚Äù And pulled the team from the institute to write the program.  What is a program for housing and communal services?  One side is the charges, and the other is the receipt of the fact of payments. <br><br>  For a year or even one and a half, they wrote the part that handles the fact.  At the moment when the trust refused the services of the machine-counting station, a year and a half passed, they only processed payments.  As a result, accounting has collapsed in the trust for 1.5 years: the fact is, but they do not know who, as much as they should, there are no charges, because the services of the computer-counting station were refused.  And the head of the trust came to our head with a ‚Äúclub‚Äù - either to drive out, or to do.  And he said: ‚ÄúListen, you had friends somewhere in the academy, with whom you worked ...‚Äù And then many people fled to the port, where to program.  - "Talk to them, maybe they will write a program for ..." <br><br>  Then I have an idea: I am interested in this process, this automation, I tell the guys: ‚ÄúLet's write a program on the sly, he finances the development, we replace, etc.‚Äù They agreed.  I gathered a few like-minded people.  In the end, up to 17 I had a working day, at 18 I came to them, where they sat in the fishing port, developed the program, and we wrote somewhere until three or four in the morning ... <br><br>  <b>You could say it was a kind of subcontract.</b> <br><br>  We programmed the month by dividing the blocks among themselves.  In the end, we wrote the system in 4 months, were able to translate the trust both into fact and accrual.  And we make a decision that it was not interesting for this manager himself, who was engaged in trade, and he gives good - please work, develop.  And in the 93rd year we established a company, improved our software product and introduced it into 4 out of 5 large housing and maintenance trusts in Vladivostok. <br><br>  Because of this, many trusts became independent, that is, they themselves began to process payments and charges almost online.  Charging has passed - all the information is there.  It is always known who owes how much. <br><br>  In some trusts there was a phenomenal effect, because people forgot that they should.  Forget to pay and everything, get a receipt, and there is a huge amount.  Of course, they all rushed to pay, and housing trusts began to use it very well, became independent, got decent opportunities. <br><br>  In the year 96, in Vladivostok, the recess of the budget began again, various political trends, and from the Administration, from above, again began to impose other methods of calculation, and I realized that we, the company of 5 people, did not have to deal with these monsters, and began to look for to write such, program.  Has done some work  Portfolio diversification for a commercial organization, a trade organization, a wholesale and retail organization with branches, began to develop a system. <br><br>  <b>Did you take a row yourself?</b>  <b>Or is it a company?</b> <br><br>  By the company.  There was a company, but this was the moment when I left the company. <br><br>  <b>I have such a question: usually only established companies have a certain take-off period, a period when they took off, and then either they fall or they fly.</b>  <b>Based on your words, I understand that the company has existed for at least three years.</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Bugs when creating a business</font> </h1><br>  <b>And then what happened?</b> <br><br>  Firstly, it was created with all the mistakes that can be made while creating a business: when you, for example, create a company, and take all like-minded people as founders.  We were 5 founders.  Of these, I was the youngest.  Approximately 10 years behind the next two.  First, difficulties, ideas unite, everyone works on enthusiasm, inspiration, involvement, and then, when the product acquires certain features, work begins that requires commitment, that is, it is necessary to maintain it in working order, answer calls, go to customers. <br><br>  <b>That is, in the beginning there is a process of creativity, and then - monotony.</b> <br><br>  And then there are obligations.  They are already hoping for you, and you have to show aerobatics: answering the phone, and driving, and communicating firsthand - large programs, large trusts.  And in the company ... it turns out, some start to forget that finances will end if you are unhappy in the market.  I understood that. <br><br>  And out of 5 founders, 4 of us decided to ‚Äútake a rest‚Äù, one of them disappeared for 10 days, the phone didn‚Äôt even take the phone ... And then, in 96, I said: ‚ÄúYou know, guys, it‚Äôs clear that there is no inspiration ... but if you do not want to work, come on, take what you want from the company, how much you will carry in the money, go out of business.  We have such specificity that we either work, or ... We do not have such as abroad: put money, invested in something and then sit, and everything revolves itself ... " <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>"WE HAVE NO SUCH AS ABROAD: THE MONEY HAS PUT, INVESTED IN ANYTHING AND THEN YOU SIT, AND EVERYTHING IS STILLING"</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b>Yes, either you work and you support the cash flow, or you do not work, and it does not go.</b> <br><br>  The specificity is that we have created a product that is our breadwinner and needs to be worked on.  And in the current situation in the 96m I leave the company.  When I left, I took a couple of computers under my arm ... And from the 96th to the 2000th I had a period of searching.  97 year, in Vladivostok began to enter the Internet through a modem.  I worked as an administrator, even standing at the labor exchange.  And the invitation came ... <br><br>  <b>What year was it?</b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Coca-Cola left, plastic remained</font> </h1><br>  97 year more ... Commercial Director at the plant for the production of plastics. <br><br>  <b>Even so?</b> <br><br>  Even so (Laughs).  Situation: you come to the plant, and these are the ruins - Coca-Cola was leaving, pulled out all the pipes, almost the wallpaper there tore off, tore the windows ... <br><br>  <b>What could, then taken away, in fact.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  There was a former military-industrial complex, a leader in the manufacture of equipment for submarines.  The former canteen has turned into a smokehouse - smoke fish, and the workshop for the production of plastics has become a plant for the production of plastics.  But economic activity was carried out in such a way that by the time I arrived, there were long-term salary arrears, multi-million tax arrears, funds ... The products are good, but they cannot produce them, because money does not reach.  And I wondered if I could fix everything here.  And in the 97th I went to work as a commercial director for this half-factory ‚Äúcandlestick‚Äù, a dream ... (Laughs.) <br><br>  <b>Small, pocket ...</b> <br><br>  Pocket.  It turned out that the director who worked at this plant organized a serious scheme of theft, when KAMAZ trucks literally reached the hole in the fence at certain moments, loaded finished products there, which were packed in his garages or sent to Chita, for example, and money was lost somewhere along the way.  On him, of course, give rise to the case.  He managed the property, but after a month, after two, it was all hesitated. <br><br>  This is where I had to start.  And by the 98th year, first, again, it did not go without programming - that's when I tried 1C.  There was no team, I needed to create something quickly, for myself, to keep records.  I had to count the materials and salaries. <br><br>  <b>The 98th is already 7.5 or 7.7 even?</b>  <b>7.0 something for sure ...</b> <br><br>  7.0 was already accurate, but it was damp.  7.7 I have not even taken.  6-ka was in full swing.  I looked at the 6-ku and realized that I could with its help for myself, on my knees, satisfy the need for a plan to put the records.  I could not write a system without a command in a short time, but I could configure 6-ku for myself so that I could take it into account.  Secondly, I found friends who helped me organize a bank transfer, because this account is blocked ... <br><br>  <b>Do you mean a plant bill?</b> <br><br>  Yes, the account of the plant is blocked, and no operations were possible there. <br><br>  <b>Well, yes, if it's the CEO, then ...</b> <br><br>  And I need to pay for raw materials in Kazan, to pay people, and, for example, those who have taken the products from me, sent money to my account.  I was there commercial, and the general of the chief engineers was appointed.  I adjusted the accounting, cleared it up, and it was left except for the best buckets and the best coxae to start producing some better products that would give the plant an opportunity to shoot, at least make some money in a short period of time.  The market of Vladivostok is a port, a fish.  And products, so-called tare boxes - for fish. <br><br>  <b>That is, these plastic boxes that carry fish ...</b> <br><br>  In fact, the type of products was chosen, which should be released, but to do it in plastic, you need to make a mold.  We had the machines themselves.  The plant had 2 machines, which can produce these boxes by volume, but did not have its own mold, it was only in the drawings.  The mold is quite an expensive thing, it is metalworking.  In the workshop itself there is no ... <br><br>  <b>And the mold, most likely, not on one box?</b> <br><br>  No, the mold for one box, because the box is large enough, it is up to two kilograms ... <br><br>  <b>... plastic.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  1.76 we had.  The machine itself, we could make up to 2 kg of the product, the original raw materials in plastic.  For Vladivostok, it was a competitive advantage, because no one else had such machines in Vladivostok.  Accordingly, we rely on this box, but where to get the mold? <br><br>  Fortunately, in a nearby factory at one time, there was also such a fairly creative director, who managed with the Japanese in some way when this military-industrial complex collapsed to put a Japanese line, where you have electronic drawings at the entrance, on the other hand, a metal blank of 3 tons is put in weight, and goes along the metalworking conveyor, and at the exit you get this mold.  They say: "Well, let's save, save us."  The price is a lot.  It turned out that one mold requires about 10 thousand dollars to make it. <br><br>  <b>How much did you pay for these costs?</b> <br><br>  First of all, where did we get the money for it (laughs)? <br><br>  <b>This is the second question!</b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About a dollar loan at the end of 90x</font> </h1><br>  He is very closely associated with the first - through how much we paid for.  Here I am on a wave that everything turns out for us, that everything is developing, we are overcoming everything, I, by personal connections (this is the 98th year), turned to my friends and took a dollar loan ... <br><br>  <b>That is, it is several months before August ...</b> <br><br>  ... took a dollar loan at 2% per month. <br><br>  <b>24 per annum so.</b>  <b>Essential figure.</b> <br><br>  In a month we made - well, somewhere we stole a three-ton bar and agreed with the plant - in a month we made a mold, we spent part of the money on raw materials and in June we released the products. <br><br>  <b>Listen, this is a very short release period.</b> <br><br>  We have already released products, and I was ready to return the loan - I, it turned out, had two opportunities.  And in June I was ready to give a loan in full.  I prepared the sum, but the director fell ill at that moment, and I was at knives with the chief accountant.  There was a person who was not very qualified in terms of accounting, and she believed that her money was settling in my pockets.  She took this amount, which I prepared for the return of the loan, and I took it on my personal connections - she did not go anywhere at all.  But suddenly she grabs her and drags her into a pension fund, makes some sort of separative deal with them that they will put out some parts for some years ... In general, she took the amount.  The director left the hospital, I asked ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/591/54e/770/59154e770d6d4c08ac461e2e819d442c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>... what, how, where is the money?</b> <br><br>  Yes.  How am I now?  He says: "Well, come on, a month."  I say: "Well, all right, come on."  And I still negotiate and still extend for 1 month.  Before August.  July ends, I am again ready to give this amount, and we have a shortage of raw materials and the director, instead of sending people without any leave, takes, and lets go with the content and sowed this amount again.  She left again.  I already say to him that this is not possible, because the loan is expensive, and secondly, the currency loan, and thirdly, something is already restless on TV.  This is the beginning of August.  And when I come ... on the 18th we go to work.  We had a dollar 6, became ... <br><br>  <b>24</b> <br><br>  12 first.  The first day he was 12. 12 or 17 immediately, in my opinion.  I say to him: ‚ÄúWell, what now?  How many had the opportunity to return everything.  Imagine, you and products, and everything is there.  It all goes, it works. ‚Äù  And then I heard a phrase that had forever dampened my enthusiasm in taking loans for personal connections for public purposes that do not depend on you: ‚ÄúI brewed it myself, and dissolve it myself‚Äù. <br><br>  Well, I, naturally, went to my creditors to talk to me.  They say: "For us, this is also credit money, that is, we have resold you, let's somehow look for a way out of the situation."  I had a carte blanche, ‚ÄúI made it myself, and I cleared it myself,‚Äù and yes, I began to clear it up. <br><br>  Every day I collected some products there, traveled to all customers, collected cash, went the same day, bought dollars and extinguished some part, and so for several days in a row and in a row, every day I went for the rest August, by September, I repaid the entire loan amount.  I bought the last dollars at 24.5, in my opinion.  The next day, he made such a technical rollback to 13 rubles, although you can‚Äôt buy 13 rubles already, but she flashed there.  They called me Soros after that.  Type I rolled back.  But I saved the credit history.  Your credit history.  Because he gave in any case, did not disappoint.  There, at the factory, everything is fine.  With the loan paid.  Since then, in general, I remembered: not to take a loan under my responsibility for the needs of someone else. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúI was overlooked by Soros: I collapsed the currency back‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b>Well, yes, work is work, personal - personal.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  I was lucky that the friends to whom I turned were not gangsters, but people with whom you can negotiate and cooperate.  I worked there for them, I worked at the plant, and for them I serviced their computer equipment, automated them ... And in the 99th year they already ordered automation services from me.  They opened a fast food cafe, and I had already left the factory because I had fulfilled all my obligations there. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Automation of accounting as a vocation</font> </h1><br>  <b>Well, yes, after such a story, I think ....</b> <br><br>  ... went into automation.

There is a fine line here - either you are a writer, or you are a programmer who does not write anything at all, even the code does not document.  Two extremes.  Constructive written communication is a very delicate concept, and I work on it myself every day.  When I write and ask questions in writing, I also try to grind it. <br><br>  <b>Well, this time saving is obtained ...</b> <br><br>  This is a significant time saving, and this is the only point that allows you to save and achieve success in the main project activities. <br><br>  <b>That is, in fact, when we clean all this garbage from the text, from speech, it is much easier for us to give the same concepts the same concepts.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  Agree in three sentences.  Spend a minute on this and understand. <br><br>  <b>And not in three paragraphs.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  Or you scroll through five pages, and a bunch of details, and you will not understand the essence. <br><br>  <b>Well, well, what other principles besides this can you name?</b> <br><br>  Well, this is already manifested in the work.  If the skills of constructive written communication are, then the candidate reads the instruction.  If he reads the instruction, performs without questions, it is clear that constructive written communication, and as a programmer, it manifests itself in work. <br><br>  <b>Well, programming is easier here.</b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About nights "from Friday to Monday"</font> </h1><br>  First: you are either keeping or not keeping deadlines.  Mandatory or optional.  There are people who, yes, write well, write competently, but the man picked up and disappeared from Friday to Monday night. <br><br>  <b>How is this?</b>  <b>Do you have any tools specifically for remote developers, which allows you to regulate the timing, monitor the progress of the task?</b> <br><br>  This is an organizational method.  This is already within the framework of technology ... There is a process of requirements decomposition. <br><br>  <b>If I understand correctly, are we leaving the plane of philosophy to the plane of technology?</b> <br><br>  Yes.  The requirement itself is decomposed to such a level that one person can handle it within a reasonable time and for a reasonable fee.  That is, if he reports that the decision will be made in such a way, will hand it over tomorrow at 15 o'clock, wants to pay for 120 minutes - this is in principle an adequate decomposition and an adequate assessment of the task that is.  Accordingly, we do not have such an officer to say that he will pass the decision at the end of the week, he wants to pay for 10 minutes.  And why can't you do these 10 minutes right now or at least in the evening? <br><br>  Accordingly, the first task is the task of the manager to properly decompose so that the employee can allocate a continuous period of time, and secondly, it is the adequacy of the employees. <br><br>  <b>By the way, are the leaders physically in Moscow, in the office, or are they also remote?</b> <br><br>  Managers who are engaged in projects, namely production - this is a remote employee.  Who works where - both in Chelyabinsk, and in Ukraine ... <br><br>  <b>Good.</b>  <b>That is, it turns out that if we are talking about some kind of automation project for something, they don‚Äôt even go to the site?</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">TK or not TK</font> </h1><br>  <b>Then who should?</b>  <b>That is - where is the very border between programming for TK and programming for some real business model?</b>  <b>After all, often, to write a good literate TK, you need to cook in the business that you will automate.</b> <br><br>  The bottom line is that the first: 1C is a tool that allows you to create something ready for the description of the TK without a description of the TK.  That is, the term is comparable, immersion is comparable.  It turns out that our technology uses this moment as an advantage.  Someone will write TZ two months ... <br><br>  <b>... The result of TK analysis led to the conclusion that TK written over 8 months describes in detail every smallest detail of the business, but at the same time there is no longer a new model.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  Someone will write TK in two months, and we will start it in 2 months and in the third month we will fix it already ... <br><br>  <b>Good.</b>  <b>Alexey Lustin and I talked about the fact that they are launching the so-called ‚Äúcloud configurator‚Äù - that is, about their idea and trying to create some kind of collective development toolkit.</b>  <b>What tools do you use?</b>  <b>Tools or chips, or maybe some other variations?</b>  <b>After all, the standard mechanism 1C is not yet.</b> <br><br>  Well, there is storage, for example, configurations.  This is a step in team development. <br><br>  <b>Yes, but I mean that there is no final, full-scale implementation option yet.</b> <br><br>  We are also not aerobatics, but there are three main components: this is the version control system - we use CVS - this is the server part;  configurators - this is each developer;  requirements management system is a web interface.  The version control system and requirements management system are very closely related.  That is, to fix any configuration changes in the version control system, you need to get approval in the requirements management system. <br><br>  <b>So, the requirements management system has the highest priority?</b> <br><br>  No, they are connected.  If you commit changes, this is reflected in the requirements management system.  To fix this, you need to get the approval of the head to perform the task and to fix the changes. <br><br>  <b>A good idea.</b> <br><br>  As a result, all the moves are recorded.  This is one element, toolkit.  And in order to work with CVS for 1C, we wrote - I ordered - a commercial development, a parser that parses the configuration from me by text, forms, xml, mxl, and so on, that is, completely into a human-readable directory structure: the name of the document, the document such and such , the number of the form - these are the words without any difficulties.  And the disassembled configuration is stored in the version control system, and at any time you can get an up-to-date copy of the set of files and build from them using this parser ... <br><br>  <b>That is, in essence, a parser is a certain basis for, let's say, a constructor.</b> <br><br>  The parser is an intermediary between the version control system and the configurator. <br><br>  <b>Good.</b>  <b>But don't you find that this is very similar to flexible methodologies?</b>  <b>After all, the idea is the same ...</b> <br><br>  Our methodology is inherently flexible.  I believe that a flexible methodology is a methodology that allows you to work with the dynamic formation of requirements.  That is, I have no restrictions on how many requirements per unit of time to process, if we can do them in parallel ... <br><br>  Flexible formation, dynamic formation of project teams: I have a person who can work in this project and quietly leave it.  The system itself leaves knowledge, leaves results, and they can then be reused by any other employee.  This is a flexible methodology. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About ISO certification: 9001</font> </h1><br>  <b>As far as I know, you have recently been certified to ISO: 9001.</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>What difficulties have you encountered?</b>  <b>And most importantly, why?</b>  <b>After all, most companies, in principle, successfully exist in this market and operate without certification.</b>  <b>That is, whether it was a waste of time, resources and money.</b> <br><br>  The question is why?  For me, certification is a criterion of how I'm not retrograde in this sense, how truly I am not mistaken, and the system gives the same result, perhaps because I am there, right?  I wanted to make sure. <br><br>  A part of my system is a quality management system - as recognition by a third body, a certification authority, recognition that it really meets certain international standards, and, secondly, it meets the quality goals that existed in the company itself. <br><br>  The main difficulty was, probably, that while we were not puzzled by this question, the structure of the description of business processes, ideas, like what, where it works, this is practically my head and the heads of those employees who work in the organization.  We have a very small turnover, but in order to expand, I need a person who is up to speed to get into ideology more quickly. <br><br>  <b>That is, do you think that this is a kind of contribution, some kind of investment in the future development of the company?</b> <br><br>  Of course.  Yes, this is in the future, because I needed a description.  I understand how this works, but it's me. <br><br>  <b>That is, in fact, you tried to keep up with two rabbits at once: on the one hand, it seems, yes, we were certified, and on the other hand, in fact, we were building a methodology?</b> <br><br>  What is certification?  Certification is the pinnacle of a large process.  The first process is the development of a quality management system.  The second process is the description and implementation of the system, quality elements.  The third process is certification.  So, we have been developing, in fact, from 2005 to 2013. <br><br>  All that we have been doing since 2005 to 2013 is to improve the system so that it gives a qualitative result: the required functionality by the expected time for an acceptable fee.  The 13-14th years are a description of everything and introduction.  And the employees ... Their actions are already described, stored in the form of diagrams, and this, in fact, as a guide to action for the new employee. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About prospects and goals</font> </h1><br>  <b>And what are the next steps, goals, stages in the development of the company?</b> <br><br>  The certification stage lasted for several weeks while being checked for compliance.  And this is not the final part.  The next stage is the improvement of the system, because every year it is necessary to re-certify.  Secondly, during the implementation we found certain missing elements in our technology. <br><br>  That is, for example, I didn‚Äôt have numerical planning per se - I intuitively planned and intuitively checked some things.  When we began to introduce a quality management system, we just had to add some elements ... But the main difficulty is that there are no ready-made solutions for this.  That is, this was not mainly for objective reasons, because such specific software projects that this process is not so easy to invent.  For example, the evaluation criteria for the head.  How to evaluate the work of the head?  We had to figure out how to count this numerically. <br><br>  <b>Can you share some professional secrets that will help our students to significantly change either their scheme of work, or even their lives?</b> <br><br>  I can say one thing that there are no secrets.  All that you see under your feet is that you can draw your inspiration as an idea, and the only, perhaps, option is to see the idea, don‚Äôt think about its implementation, you must begin to implement it, analyze the results of your work and act, and I‚Äôve got technical details always ready to share.  But, perhaps, it will not be a wide audience, but a narrower audience, like the InfoStart conference, for example, on the sidelines, please ask specific technical questions, specific questions about secrets, and I will talk about my experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d6/b99/df6/2d6b99df658f4fee8b683d0778e30d92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <font color="#e9f3f7">______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</font> <font color="#e9f3f7"><br></font> <br>  <font color="#000">View and listen to us here:</font> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjuwXCXPZbTcQe4cLd_4CsA">youtube</a> <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/peredaca-gotovye-resenia/id961615837%3Fmt%3D2">itunes</a> <br>  <a href="http://gsoft.podfm.ru/ReadySolution/">podfm</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291932/</a></p>
