How satisfied are you with your daily life?  What is the reason? <br><br>  Most of us spend most of our time at work.  That is why, a feeling of satisfaction from work greatly affects the quality of our lives.  Not to mention the fact that your career success and daily performance depend on it.  Lucky if you get pleasure from work, and if not?  What to do in this case? <br><br>  <b>Who is guilty?</b>

      While your boss and employer take responsibility for providing you with a supportive work environment and the support you need, the level of job satisfaction that you feel ultimately depends on you.  So are you ready to take responsibility for what is happening? <br><br>  <b>Why do you do what you do?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Most employees are not only motivated by money.  To feel a personal contribution to a common cause (in the company's strategy, in the industry or in society) is very important for everyone. <br><br>  Perhaps an awareness of global goals is what you need.  Think about why you are important to business.  What could you bring in after joining the team?  Now think wider.  How much each day do you help approach your company's goals? <br><br>  You have a unique opportunity and reason to work.  Awareness of your contribution can make you more focused and connected with your work. <br><br>  <b>Remember your goals and objectives</b> <br><br>  Imagine how you can achieve your short-term and long-term career goals with your daily routine.  Think one step further: how this or that job can contribute to your future career.  For example, an unusual project with a complex client can be a powerful argument in a resume.  In addition, the connections that you acquire during work may be useful to you for further career building. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Learn something new</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Upskilling, or advanced training, is a sure way to get closer to your career goal and enjoy your work.  Ask yourself what is your favorite part of the job?  Is there any way to find out more about this? <br><br>  There are many ways to learn.  You can discuss with your supervisor the passage of certain courses or read their own books, articles or view free webinars.  Soon you will discover that your new knowledge of how a spark will kindle a fire of job satisfaction. <br><br>  <b>Set new tasks</b> <br><br>  If you are tired of the monotonous work, look for new opportunities.  Ask your manager to give you new tasks or projects that will push you out of your comfort zone. <br><br>  <b>Stay away from negative attitudes.</b> <br><br>  If there are negative or aggressively passive people in your environment, keep them at a distance so that they do not affect you.  It is difficult to do this when you work in open space and constantly intersect in work.  Remain professional, but do not let the negative in your direction and you will notice that you have an increased mood and you are satisfied with the work. <br><br>  <b>Rebuild your work-life balance</b> <br><br>  If you cannot remember when you left the office on time, or if you are worried about work in the evenings and on weekends, it is not surprising that you are not satisfied with the work.  Try to restore the balance between work and personal life. <br><br>  Analyze how effectively you use your time in the office?  If the load on you is too high and it can not be managed, it's time to talk to the boss.  Say that overwork leads to unproductive activity, and no one will benefit from it. <br><br>  In summing up, review your values ‚Äã‚Äãand work time, find the object of inspiration and do not be afraid to try something new. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336180/</a></p>
