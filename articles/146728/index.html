According to him, the focus of the new service is based on performance, scalability and cost.  He showed a genome computing application running on 600,000 nuclei. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/519/281/364/519281364ac26d0d947608237db26b24.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Another application used 10,000 virtual machines, but this is not the limit, Google will provide 50% more computing power than other companies. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Calculations - Run Linux virtual machines on demand.  1, 2, 4, and 8 virtual machines are available with 3.75GB of memory per virtual core. </li><li>  Storage - Store data on a local disk, on our new permanent block device, or on our online scalable <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage.html">Google Cloud Storage.</a> </li><li>  Network.

These partners offer services management services that allow you to easily transfer applications to the cloud, as well as between different cloud services. <br><br><h5>  Better late than never? </h5>

      When Urs Hall was asked if he thought that Google was a little late for <br>  he noted that in spite of the fact that in our time there are many <br>  players offering cloud infrastructure services, there are big <br>  prospects for Google as well, since the transition to the cloud is more <br>  cyclical and has a long-term perspective.  ‚ÄúThis is not about stealing <br>  other players' market share, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think it's even early, because the whole IT industry itself is in childhood,‚Äù <br>  he said.  "If you look at it, you will see that almost 99 percent <br>  companies are not in the cloud. ‚Äù  Hols said, however, that this is perfectly appropriate. <br>  time to enter google market.  "It is becoming more and more <br>  mobile and web applications, and data storage, as well as service provision <br>  moving into the cloud, ‚Äùhe said.  The advent of Chrome OS, Android and iPhone <br>  caused cloud clients to become ‚Äústateless.‚Äù <br><br>  "This is still a very young market, and frankly, in five years you will have <br>  a completely different look at the types of clouds and the services they provide. ‚Äù <br>  Hols was restrained in predicting the popularity of the Compute Engine, but <br>  feel free to point out that google works in business infrastructure in <br>  over the years, and this is one of the key benefits to <br>  the company.  ‚ÄúThe market will show,‚Äù he said and asked to ask the same question through <br>  two years. <br><br><h5>  Cloud games </h5><br><br>  Despite the dismissal of Google, it is impossible not to notice the looming shadow <br>  Amazon.  Amazon Web Services, thanks to its aggressive policies, and its <br>  faith in cloud technologies, has gained a good niche, with the result that it has more <br>  billion dollars in revenue.  But not only this income makes the IT industry <br>  jealous of the Amazon cloud business. <br><br>  The success of Amazon‚Äôs cloud services made it attractive for startups and <br>  independent application developers that cover the cloud stack <br>  Amazon services.  These coders are kings in the new cloudy world. <br><br>  Fighting for developers in the cloud and on mobile platforms is big <br>  21st century question worth trillions of dollars.  Microsoft Azure, iCloud from <br>  Apple, Amazon Web Services, and now the Google Compute Engine, all of them <br>  try to catch their cloud hooks developers.  And it is rather strange that <br>  Facebook is not trying to do the same. <br><br>  Now Amazon is king of the hill.  When I asked Amazon Werner's CTO <br>  Vogels about the next five years, he talked about a new layer of services, where Amazon <br>  will become a trendsetter.  This is a clear advantage to the Seattle company, <br>  which angered his partners.  He understands that this is a way to get money spent on IT dinosaurs like Hewlett-Packard. <br><br>  These giants of the past must wake up with a migraine, and the appearance of Google's Compute Engine will further complicate their lives. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Rates:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/compute-engine-pricing.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  <a href="http://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine.html">Official site</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/taking-on-amazon-google-launches-compute-on-demand-rival-to-ec2/">viva gigaom</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146728/</a></p>
