I can also recommend <b>LittleFox</b> , but to save space <b>Compact Classic</b> taxis, IMHO. <br><br>  They aren't looking for good from good, because from searching for a suitable topic I moved on to stuffing <b>Fx</b> extensions. <br><br>  Of course, I don‚Äôt plan to engage in web development on a netbook, because of course, I don‚Äôt want to install Web-developer or Firebug - it would be a very strong perversion, and no such task was set. <br><br>  Therefore, I put, for starters, <b>Fasterfox Lite</b> - the author states that it really allows you to increase the speed of Fx.  Apparently, here the placebo effect matters more, and British scientists have not yet proved the usefulness of this addon.  Nevertheless ... in the default settings the Extreme mode is set (hands would be torn off by an illiterate translator).  It is believed that with this option, Fx works as fast as possible, but this creates an additional load on the server, which may cause you to disconnect you from yourself.  It didn‚Äôt scare me, because I didn‚Äôt change anything here, but I removed the tick with Link prefetching - IMHO, could create unnecessary and unnecessary traffic. <br><br>  The second item was set by <b>Flashblock</b> - in order not to download Flash banners, if you need to watch a flash movie (for example, a video from Youtube) - just click on the button located on the same page as the flash movie. <br><br>  <b>ImgLikeOpera</b> - by default, images are not loaded (or loaded from the cache, if any), and the right mouse button allows you to load the required image, if necessary (why this function is not implemented in Fx (the ability to download the image not separately, but on the page itself) by default - I do not understand). <br><br>  Once the flash download was cut, the download and installation of <b>Adblock Plus</b> became logical - cut unnecessary ads. <br><br><img src="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/images/t/13530/1177025970" alt="image"><br><br>  For greater information, I set the <b>Extended statusbar</b> - shows the download speed, time, traffic.  It works incomprehensibly, with respect to speed, IMHO, it imposes (which is understandable), but it is sometimes useful, so let it be. <br><br><img src="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/images/t/25129/1221001150" alt="image"><br><br>  I also find the <b>Location Bar 2</b> extension useful - it allows you to turn parts of the URL in the address bar into links.  Sometimes it saves time and traffic on those sites where they forget to specify links in order to rise, say, one level higher in the site hierarchy. <br><br><img src="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/images/t/21090/1211739738" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to open new pages to the right of the already open one, I had to put the <b>Tab control</b> - when opening several tabs, they get out of the netbook‚Äôs small screen and not to ‚Äúrun around with the mouse‚Äù and not to look for them, this extension can be very useful. <br><br><img src="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/images/t/34518/1247627183" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>text / plain</b> extension is also useful - if a URL appears in the text of the page as plain text and not a link, it is enough to select this text, right-click and open it (URL) in a new tab. <br><br><img src="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/images/t/22480/1214352718" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, I installed the <b>Cache View</b> extension - it allows you to view pages, links, in the form in which they were cached by Google (also supported by the Web-archive and some other service, which I did not know about before the extension was installed).  It is also useful: instead of, cursing, knocking to the site that is currently unavailable, while spending time and traffic, it is quite enough, sometimes, just to see the cache of this page (site). <br><br>  In general, to my surprise, I had to install as many as 9 additional extensions, although this is probably not a lot, especially in light of the huge number of existing and available extensions. <br><br>  If there are comments, additions, recommendations (for example, more worthy alternatives to the extensions sounded here), I will listen with pleasure. <br><br>  To create a custom assembly, I used <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/firefox/64561/">Firefox Builder</a> .  The service is ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù, the catalog has the same extensions (with the same name and version number - which, to put it mildly, is surprising), but overall not bad. <br><br>  Download the assembly itself <a href="http://ffbuilder.ru/comments.html%3Fffid%3D933">here: NetBookFox</a> <br><br>  PS A couple of screenshots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fb/6d4/660/4fb6d4660c7fe5932410bbb5293641af.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/65e/e39/73d65ee39f0d7184e8661af6939c18c3.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66424/</a></p>
