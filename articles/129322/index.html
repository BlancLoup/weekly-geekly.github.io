If a person calls you - he just calls his last name and you immediately know which computer he is at. <br>  But if people change places?  Bring him his own computer?  Not the most convenient option.  Again, we don‚Äôt want to do extra work and constantly rename computers of laid-off \ new employees?  Many find a solution in complex indices. <br><br><h4>  11-WXP3-OFFICE-92SAL-25-NOTE </h4><br>  Naturally, it is more convenient than a surname, it carries a lot of information, but, alas, if you do not want to rename a computer every time it is transferred from accounting to the warehouse and back, it will not work for you.  I do not know about you, but I am still a bummer. <br>  By the way, the task for quick-wittedness:

      <i>How many minutes will Mariya Ivanovna from the logistics department read the computer name to you by phone and how many subordinates will she involve in this process?</i> <br><br>  The cleverest is the prize.  By the way, this is why the so-called naming of computers by existing companies in foreign companies disappears. <br><br><h4>  POWER, SQUIRREL, FLOWER, CVETOK, VODYANOI </h4><br>  Even in small companies it is very inconvenient.  In the case of English words, the problem is not knowing the language, and if you use the Russian language, we will encounter the wrong pronunciation and the eternal search for correct spelling. <br><br>  The option that I propose is practiced by many large and small companies around the world.  And so simple in its essence that it scares most <i>graphomaniac</i> system administration.  Numbers. <br><br><h4>  4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 </h4><br>  What are they good for: <br><br>  1) Easy to read even by people who cannot read <br>  2) On one label you can put a very large number, which is easy to see <br>  3) Do not end the <i><sup><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">source?</a></sup></i> <br>  4) Impersonal <br><br>  In addition, the use of numbers literally forces us to follow the road of Zen admin and keep our AD clean and tidy (it sounds somewhat vulgar and even strange). <br><br>  In the comments from more advanced guys, references to naming standards have surfaced.  Some of them are great for large companies, although it‚Äôs strange to keep the name of the city in the name, since it‚Äôs more logical for me to use subdomains. <br><br>  Also, you need to add one letter to the computer name in order to work out ping utilities normally.  I have already forgotten why all my computers have a letter in front of the name, I thought that I did it for some kind of identification when I was reminded - I remembered that the main problem was precisely the incorrect development of the network utilities, if you don‚Äôt add the prefix with the domain name. <br><br>  It is best to use letters like: <br>  W - Workstation <br>  N - Notebook <br><br><h4>  Do you remember? .. </h4><br>  Topics <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sysadm/129271/">ago</a> , I wrote about the need to scatter computers into folders - this is how to properly build the structure of computers in a domain, and for user names, departments, floors, software, and chest size, you need to use Description, groups, lists and folders. <br>  It's easier.  It seems complicated at first, but in reality is simple and convenient.  In the future, relying on such a structure, we will set up group policies and so on and so forth. <br>  By the way, since I remembered the previous topic, I can not help but note the ‚Äúwar of stickers‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Let's live together and be friends - families </h4><br>  In my practice, I use all available methods.  Of course, when I got a job at previous places of work, one of the requirements for HR (except for a separate office, sofa, plasma and two macbooks) was the ability of users to memorize a random set of letters and numbers.  But after HR and HR were not included in this definition, they had to reconsider their position. <br><br>  The most convenient way is to glue stickers on the system unit.  In the case of numbers - even one glance under the table will be enough.  But, until we go through the whole office with stickers, we need to use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897557">BgInfo</a> , a Microsoft software that displays the information we need on the desktop. <br><br>  It was ridiculously simple to use the program and I was surprised that almost no one remembered it. <br><br><h4>  Mini-man </h4><br>  Run the utility.  Customizable.  Save the settings.  We distribute through group policies. <br>  By the way, I personally refused to practice displaying all the information available to the user on the table.  It confuses and scares him. <br>  Print only the name of the computer, then it remains only to read the ‚Äúdigits in the upper right corner.‚Äù  This is naaaaamnogo easier.  Believe it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129322/</a></p>
