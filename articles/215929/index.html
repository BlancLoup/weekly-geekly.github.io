  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holland approved operator-independent SIM cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a7/a69/47c/7a7a6947c531116e4412ec6b246393bc.jpg"><br><h5>  A SIM card that can be programmed using the OTA method to register on the right network can revolutionize the world of Internet things.  In addition, it will allow manufacturers to become an operator to some extent.  Unfortunately, in most countries it is still outside the rules. </h5><br>  Last week, telecommunications regulators in the Netherlands opened up the possibility for any company, be it Apple, Audi or small local power grids, to release its own SIM cards that are not tied to any operator.  So far, only Amsterdam has taken this step, but if other countries dare to follow his example, this can fundamentally change not only the world of the Internet of things, but also affect the familiar principles of using mobile communications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few years ago, in his <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/11/20/how-to-bypass-carriers-apple-style/">article</a> , European economist and political analyst Rudolf Van Der Berg presented an option for how such a scheme can work for Apple if it wants to depend less on operators, providing a link directly to iPhone buyers.  Apple could offer customers its own SIM cards, and then remotely register them with various operators as subscribers use services.  The apple giant will be able to buy wholesale voice and internet traffic from hundreds of different operators around the world, so that at any moment it can choose the most suitable network for each of its clients, depending on their needs. <br><br>  For example, if the owner of the iPhone temporarily leaves his country to spend a vacation in France, he will not be ruined by cruel roaming rates.  Instead, Apple simply rewrites its customer's SIM card on one of France‚Äôs mobile networks.  And then, instead of getting into this network as a guest roamer, the client will be in his new home network.  And so it can be all over the world.  Whether Apple or Samsung will show any interest in becoming an operator for their customers, we still have to see - back in 2010, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/11/18/carrier-organization-changes-rules-to-allow-the-apple-sim/">gigaom.com reported</a> that Apple was developing its Soft SIM solution.  And, although from this, it seems nothing has come out yet, the result can be very useful in terms of building the interaction of M2M (machine-to-machine) systems around the world. <br><br>  Take another example: an automaker, such as GM, which embeds LTE devices in each of its cars.  In the US, GM is strictly tied to only one operator.  And it doesn't matter if you bought your smartphone from Verizon or T-Mobile;  if you want to connect your Chevrolet to LTE, you have only one option: AT &amp; T.  According to Van Der Berg, an operator-independent SIM card, a car manufacturer could connect it to any mobile operator with whom you already have a familiar relationship.  And also - to change it every time when you decide to change the serving network.  Or, for example, it would be possible to use several operators at once, switching you to the one that has the best coverage or data transfer speed in the right place for you.

      Of course, now the majority of traditional mobile service providers are opposed to such concepts.  However, in general, from such initiatives, the entire mobile industry would benefit.  In the world of Internet things, the client has to take care of connecting to the network, the balance and the tariff plan, or, if the manufacturer takes on these problems, he is tightly tied to one operator.  Reprogrammable SIM cards could be a good solution to reduce these negative aspects. <br><br>  Of course, now we are very far from the fact that such operator-independent services become a reality.  The Netherlands softened its rules, and the GSM association approved and supported this concept, however, reprogrammable SIMs are still outlawed in most countries around the world.  The USA and Germany are taking some steps in this direction, but they have yet to solve a lot of technical difficulties.  Let us hope that the success of the Netherlands will become an example to follow for other progressive countries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215929/</a></p>
