      It is difficult to say whether the owner is now threatened with a fortune of $ 400 + million in a small town.  But it is certain that he will not be able to lead his former life.  After all, even his family members did not know that it was he who created Bitcoin.  Nakamoto himself agreed to say a few words to the journalist, and in the presence of the police. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87c/4ff/494/87c4ff494885a3198d81794b91cbf4b3.jpg"><br>  <i>House Nakamoto</i> <br><br>  The Satoshi brothers describe him as an extremely intelligent, sullen and extremely secretive person who even sends email via an anonymizer.  For the past 40 years, he has not used the real name Satosi Nakamoto in everyday life.  At the age of 23, after graduating from the California Polytechnic University, he changed his name to Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, and since then he has been subscribing as Dorian S. Nakamoto. <br><br>  Nakamoto was born in July 1949 in the city of Beppu (Japan), a mother with three children emigrated to America in 1959.  The boy from an early age showed unusual abilities to mathematics and even signs of genius.  “He’s the only person I know,” says his younger brother, Arthur, “who could come in for an interview and tell the interviewer that he was an idiot.” <br><br>  After graduating from college, Satoshi worked for the military contractor Hughes Aircraft, then at Radio Corporation of America in New Jersey (now L-3 Communications) as a systems engineer.  This company also carried out orders for the army.  He then moved with his second wife back to California, where he worked in many companies. <br><br>  Daughter Satoshi describes the father as a workaholic who works from dawn until late at night.  At the same time, the office was locked and he punished the children if they touched his computer.  He collected computers with his own hands and was very proud of it. <br><br>  Since 2000, Nakamoto has worked at the Federal Aviation Administration of New Jersey on information security and telecommunications.  It is only known that he quit his job in 2001 and has not been working anywhere ever since. <br><br>  The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin alone is indicated by several factors, including the specific programming style using reverse Polish notation and the presence of errors.  Gavin Addressn and his colleagues had to rewrite about 70% of the code: “There were no good interfaces,” says Andresen, “the whole code was like one big ball of wool.  It was incredibly dense and well written at a low level, but when the functions were combined, sometimes it was rather untidy. ” <br><br>  The age of Satoshi is also indicated by linguistic expertise of the founding document, which he anonymously published in 2008, including the use of the old term “disk space”. <br><br>  Daughter Nakamoto recalls that his father constantly complained about the unfair exchange rates and high commissions that have to be paid for bank transfers to the UK, from where he constantly ordered models of steam trains.  By the way, thanks to this hobby, I managed to get in touch with Nakamoto. <br><br>  Satoshi has six children, including five from his second marriage.  While adhering to libertarian views, he even taught his daughter that he needed to be independent, start his own business and in no case allow the state to push his will.  “He was very worried about the intervention of the state as a whole,” said the daughter.  - When I was little, we often played the same game.  He said: “Imagine that special services are chasing you.”  And I was hiding in the closet. ” <br><br>  UPD 07.03.  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D7354326">New evidence has</a> emerged that Dorian is Satoshi.  At the same time, Nakamoto himself runs away from the crowds of journalists who rushed to Temple City, and with a smile said that he had nothing to do with Bitcoin ( <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/alleged-bitcoin-creator-dorian-prentice-satoshi-nakamoto-denies-bitcoin-involvement/">video</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214903/</a></p>
