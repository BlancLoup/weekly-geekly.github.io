Blogger thursday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/188668.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/188668.html</a> <br><h4>  from the creator of "Survey of blogs" and "World of blogs" </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you are reading this text, then today is Thursday.  Unless, of course, you are not the editor-in-chief of a single newspaper about computers "Computer News," which reads it on Tuesday.  And not a literary editor who reads it on Wednesday.  All other days of the week do not exist, and if your imagination says the opposite, then ‚ÄúKV‚Äù does not bear any responsibility for this.  Send all complaints somewhere. <br><br>  <b>Virtuality of the week</b> <br><br>  On January 17, <a href="http://keldron-rus.livejournal.com/8580.html">an entry appears</a> in one of the blogs in LiveJournal, which says that one of the Russian players in the online RPG Lineage II died after a four-day coma.  No, he did not die of starvation or nervous exhaustion.  He was beaten to death by another player in the same game.  And it happened at a general gathering in the presence of a sufficiently large number of people.  Another <a href="http://alxmcr.livejournal.com/1193130.html">comment</a> about what happened in another blog, from which I borrowed a quote: ‚Äú <em>After talking for a while, the hardboard hit Sasha and started beating him, Sasha‚Äôs arm was broken and he couldn‚Äôt defend himself for a long time, he slowly fell to the floor kicking ... he continued kicking him in the head! .. This lasted until the security intervened, the fiberboard did not get weak, but he was completely intact, which is a pity ...</em> "This news instantly became a hit on the Russian-language Internet.  In many blogs and forums began discussions of the incident.  Perhaps the most <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/2299">imputed article</a> about this murder and comments appeared on Habrahabr.  In general, from the outside, it all looks rather strange.  Surely there will be paranoids who will start screaming about the disastrous impact on the minds of computer games, in general, and online, in particular.  But both the murderer and the victim are already adults, they could hardly have come under such a strong influence from, albeit a good one, but games.  I, for that matter, always adhere to the opinion that the problem is low culture.  In a low culture of communication, low culture of consumption of alcoholic beverages, in a low culture of writing reviews blogs.  By the way, even the bourgeois <a href="http://www.l2guru.com/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D65479">are discussing</a> this sad event.  Yes, the boys used to gather in the courtyard and accidentally cut each other with knives, now the members of various clans from online games drunk kill each other with their feet.  Nothing changes.

      <b>Study week</b> <br><br>  sheldon_j in his blog conducted a wonderful <a href="http://sheldon-j.livejournal.com/20437.html">linguistic study</a> .  He checked well-known Russian-language blogging services (LiveJournal, li.ru and blogs.ru) by several parameters.  Namely - the concentration of network slang, ideology and politicity.  Thus, the general feeling left by the services (LiveJournal is a gathering of politically preoccupied intellectuals, Li.ru and blogs@mail.ru is Kisha Kuk reserve), fully confirmed by statistics and can be considered a medical fact.  Still, I recommend to go to the link and see the data.  Makes you think about the frailty of all things. <br><br>  The next guest on our statistical operating table will be the <a href="http://livestat.livejournal.com/">collective blog of the research department</a> of SUP, which promises interesting figures and facts about LJ and the blogosphere.  There are not many records in it yet, but all those that exist deserve close examination.  For example, about the joke countries, which indicate Russian-speaking users as a place of residence in their profile.  Approximately 15% of ZhZhistov, who write Cyrillic in their blog and at the same time indicate the country outside the former USSR as their place of residence, are in fact pinned on (and live, most likely, in Russia).  Otherwise, it is hard to believe that Albania is among the top ten foreign countries in terms of the number of Russian-speaking users, approximately at the same level with France and Australia. <br><br>  <b>Rules and facts of the week</b> <br><br>  How to raise children?  If you really need to know the answer to this question, ask Olshansky and he will answer you with <a href="http://olshansky.livejournal.com/1018649.html">five rules of education</a> .  It seems to me that these rules are rather controversial, but I am young and hot, so I can be wrong.  But if you believe these rules, I was brought up absolutely completely and irrevocably wrong.  A bit offensive. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/ice_dog_as/post29091174">All that you wanted to know about a dream, but did not know where to spy</a> .  Already 29 facts about this important process of our life.  By the way, I really like to sleep.  Here, for example, is one of the facts: ‚Äú <em>British Department of Defense researchers developed a way for soldiers to be awake for 36 hours. Tiny optical fibers inserted into special glasses projected a ring of bright white light (with a spectrum identical to the sunrise) around the edge of the retina of soldiers' eyes, misleading their brains</em> . " <br><br>  Interestingly, my girls column read?  Well, I know that the two just read (Olga and Larissa, taking this opportunity, give you my regards).  How many feminists are there?  And antifeminists?  By the way, readers of the all-galactic newspaper for gender equality or for total patriarchy / matriarchy?  Okay it does not matter.  It is only important <a href="http://syntinen.livejournal.com/554908.html">that feminism brought into our lives</a> .  " <em>If you are a woman and the trial of your rapist was not devoted to the analysis of your moral character and your past lovers, say thanks to the feminists</em> ."  Well, a few more thanks. <br><br>  Do you know all the posts of Nikita Mikhalkov?  <a href="http://navalny.livejournal.com/86792.html">Now you know</a> !  Mommies - 28 posts!  Apparently, a very busy man, and yet the movie has time to shoot.  What for? <br><br>  <b>And at this time ...</b> <br><br>  ... blogs help newspapers survive.  The appearance of the newspaper's own blogs seriously increases traffic to the site of the publication.  This is evidenced by a recent study by Nielsen // NetRatings.  According to the company, in the US, the audience of newspaper blogs is growing much faster than the audience of electronic versions of publications.  Attendance of the blogs of the ten largest American newspapers has tripled over the year, reaching 3.8 billion unique visitors.  The total number of readers of newspapers on the Internet grew by only nine percent, reaching 29.9 billion people, according to <a href="http://itua.info/news/internet/7450.html">itua.info</a> . <br><br>  ... British sociopsychologists conducted a large-scale study, during which they were able to establish that male attractiveness is based on the laws of the blogosphere.  The law of attractiveness is very simple: the more around a man smiling women, the more effective it looks in the eyes of a potential partner.  Here is the rule of the blogosphere, which says that the most commented posts are the most popular, it pleases us <a href="http://www.utro.ru/articles/2007/01/21/618756.shtml">utro.ru.</a> <br><br>  ... materialized from the Internet pop singer Lily Allen claims at once to three nominations Brit Music Awards.  Career Lily Allen - a miracle that characterizes the new state of the music industry.  Along with the Arctic Monkeys, the latest laureates of another important English music award, the Mercury Music Prize, Lily Allen became an example of a pop artist's powerful breakthrough from the blogosphere into the ‚Äúmaterial carriers‚Äù and ‚Äúbig media‚Äù.  Mrs. Allen at the dawn of a career fundamentally promoted her songs only through the MySpace service and others like him and did not enter into a major contract until the number of her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù became tens of thousands.  However, the actual musical material deserved no less enthusiasm than the commercial skill of the girl.  These are stinging couplets, put on completely original reggae and hip-hop themes, which Pink and Gwen Stefani would not have refused, sharing with us the secrets of popularity <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-y.html%3FdocId%3D734741%26issueId%3D36178">of the Kommersant website</a> . <br><br>  <b>Your favorite Alexei Khaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007040602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 4, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288558/</a></p>
