  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No one knows the boundaries of the Internet and there is always information that security services will never be able to reach.  However, with the advent of social networks, the Internet has become more systematic.  Most of the user data is now available on convenient web pages with a simple and intuitive interface.  And although many were horrified by the fact that people who listen to the same music, watch the same films and in principle think the same - not hundreds and thousands, but millions - this did not diminish the fact that social networks have greatly simplified the process of sharing information. <br>  But what is the future goal of Internet development, and what awaits us in the world of social networks in the future?  I propose to speculate a little on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Semantic links</b> <br>  When people visit any places they leave memories of them in the form of photographs and records, but at the moment these sources of information: the places visited, photo albums, notes are in no way connected.  It would be very interesting to see a list of photos from a single country or read the opinions of people about the newly opened club.  Another example of connections are family photo albums, now the only way to create them is a family private group, which is not always convenient. <br><br>  <b>Museum of Photography</b> <br>  The quality of amateur cameras is growing, and this leads to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a bank of digital photos within the social network.  Indeed, grouping user-accessible user albums into a single ordered catalog is not so difficult, but in the long run this could replace stock stores of amateur photos. <br><br>  <b>Extended user knowledge</b> <br>  Advertising networks should be more user oriented.  This requires accurate information about the buyer, you need to know what his interests.  An example of the wrong questions are: ‚Äúfavorite quotes,‚Äù ‚Äúfavorite movies,‚Äù because they say nothing about what a person needs now.  ‚ÄúFavorite car models‚Äù, ‚Äúfavorite clothes‚Äù, even ‚Äúinformation about allergens‚Äù - this is what the social network of the future should learn from its users.

      <b>Pets</b> <br>  Continuing the above, I want to add that the data on pets is more than important.  For example, if I sheltered a white Somali jerboa, then the advertising of canned food for jerboas will be very interesting to me.  An interface block dedicated to pets can include photos, videos, a biography, etc. <br><br>  <b>Personal diary</b> <br>  The concept of a diary is not limited to keeping notes on how I spent the day.  In general, this is a time-sorted tape of events recorded or captured in photos and videos, which may include your own thoughts, dreams, a list of desired and completed goals.  Here you can add home bookkeeping.  I would also include information about collections here.  We all collect something: stamps, coins, cards, it would be nice to have a user-friendly interface for this purpose. <br><br>  <b>Anonymous access</b> <br>  Here we smoothly turn to security issues.  Topics in which users would like to remain anonymous are not limited to personal health issues, it is also creativity, participation in discussions and much more.  Perhaps the only solution to this is the creation of anonymous social networks, although most likely in the future, existing networks will add the ability to privately enter their functionality. <br><br>  <b>Service Companies</b> <br>  This idea pursues the goal for everyone to do their work: a social network provides a convenient platform for users to work, service companies serve them.  Examples of frequently used services are: learning a foreign language, searching for employees and employers.  By entering into a partnership agreement, the service company will be able to reduce its own costs, because  in this case, the company does not need to spend money on the implementation of its own web application.  Instead, she will be able to add all the missing functionality to the owner of the social network, keeping the functions of advising users and controlling data. <br><br>  <b>What else</b> <br>  Online video conferencing, dating sites functionality, business analytics and, in principle, deeper integration with business processes of various companies.  Ideally, there should be one single public network where all users are connected to each other. <br><br>  PS It will be interesting to discuss the above ideas and listen to criticism addressed to them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143596/</a></p>
