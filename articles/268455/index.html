  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trends of the global e-commerce market in 2015-2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The e-commerce market both in the world and in Russian Internet is developing very actively, in spite of crises and other negative phenomena.  In the world per year, the average growth rate according to <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Global-B2C-Ecommerce-Sales-Hit-3615-Trillion-This-Year-Driven-by-Growth-Emerging-Markets/1010575">eMarketer</a> is about 18-20% per year, in Russia and Ukraine the growth rate reaches 17-18%.  This is about 3-4% of total retail in Russia (slightly less in Ukraine, the market is less developed and is now in deep crisis) and up to 10-12% in the United States and other developed countries.  The average level in the world is about 6%.  The only exception is that last year in Ukraine, due to a deep economic crisis, the market did not grow in dollar terms, but for local companies this is a chance to catch up on lost time.  The most interesting thing is that we are still at the stage of the birth of the market.  According to many forecasts, the share of e-commerce in total retail will reach 20% in the next few years.  For companies in this sector, ignoring this market today is tantamount to death tomorrow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3b/0ab/04f/e3b0ab04f649457da8a6ff76e6104b88.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting fact is that many of the largest e-commerce players in the United States have offline roots, and the United States is a kind of litmus test, a market catalyst, which shows us what will happen in our markets in the same segment in 3-5 years.  This is already confirmed: in Russia, a number of large online stores have long been owned by large offline networks and takeovers continue.  In Ukraine, this is more difficult, although this process is actively going on, so a few months ago, <a href="http://delo.ua/business/gruppa-kompanij-fokstrot-poluchila-polnyj-kontrol-nad-internet-295436/">Foxtrot bought 100% of the online store Sokol.ua</a>

      <b>Mobile commerce</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few years ago, a group of buyers appeared in the world who buy goods only from mobile devices.  Then it was an exception to the rule.  Now the share of buyers in this segment has become the rule rather than the exception.  Today, the share of mobile purchases reaches from 10% in developing countries, such as Russia and Ukraine, to 25% in developed countries, such as the United States and Canada.  Every year, this segment grows faster than anyone else, which means that if a store today is not optimized for mobile devices, it loses up to 25% of customers! <br><br>  In addition, several months ago, Google announced new rules in its algorithm, which provide for the reduction of sites that are not optimized for mobile devices.  It turns out that sites without optimization first receive less traffic, and then, those who still hit the site cannot make a purchase.  Double loss of customers. <br><br>  These trends have highlighted one of the strongest trends in e-commerce in 2015-2016 - Mobile commerce.  At a minimum, this is optimization for mobile devices; at the most, this is the use of mobile technologies at a deeper level, including geolocation and other interesting ideas. <br><br>  <b>Multichannel</b> <br><br>  Recently, this trend is gaining particular popularity in Ukraine and Russia, in developed countries it has long been normal.  Companies began to use all channels and do this systemically.  And both the traditional off-lain businesses, and he-lain.  Traditional off-lain businesses began to acquire large online stores, and he-lain businesses opened points of delivery of goods or even small shops in off-line. <br><br>  If you look at the largest players in the US e-commerce market, then we will see there many representatives of off-lain businesses, such as Walmart, and all of them have already very closely integrated retailers into off-lain.  If you look at the market of Russia and Ukraine, our company is usually represented, either in one segment or in another, although the trend of multi-channel is obvious. <br><br>  In the next few years, businesses will either go through a multi-channel, or will gradually die. <br><br>  <b>Big data</b> <br><br>  This concept has been actively discussed for several years in professional circles and in 2015 this is a global trend not only in e-commerce, but also in many other areas.  Today, almost all the largest stores collect and analyze a lot of different data about customers.  The trend is more likely not in the fact of using big data, but in strengthening the role of this data.  They are becoming more and more, and the connection between them is becoming more complicated.  This is the most valuable information for marketing and if you correctly collect and use this data, we can increase the conversion and the average check at times.  This product recommendations, and advertising, and universal personalization.  Everything is built on the basis of Big Data and each major project often has its own way, there is no single recipe for greatness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ec/676/487/9ec67648765c4bfcbcbc923da1deb4ad.jpg"><br><br>  Today we can collect information from various sources: computer, telephone, external sites, etc.  From each of the sources, we can collect very diverse data: visit history, behavior, average bill, frequency of purchases, preferences, and hundreds of other parameters.  Further, we can link all these parameters into a single system, think over the forecasting algorithms and provide the information to the user at the moment when he needs it.  This is a huge multi-faceted system that can be improved forever and every time it will bring more and more money.  If a little fantasy and look into the future, then soon the store will understand us better than the closest relative!  After all, data about us daily remain online and accumulate in different places.  A little math and psychology can do wonders with this data. <br><br>  This trend also allowed us to effectively work through the next one - personalization. <br><br>  <b>Personalization</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs such a personal merchandising tool and more.  Previously, it was quite difficult to personalize stores.  Usually, information directly provided by a person in a private office was used for these purposes: indicated the region ‚Äî the store changed the goods and prices for this region or similar simple mechanics.  Today, with the development of Big Data, any store can be very finely tuned for each consumer.  Technologies already know how to not only understand a person, but also to predict his behavior. <br><br>  For these purposes, there are special software and services in the world and runet that can be integrated with the website of the online store.  Large players usually develop their mechanisms, as this is a very unique and time-consuming process. <br><br>  In some stores, a significant part of sales is already taking place through personalization.  So, in Ozon.ru this figure <a href="http://www.searchengines.ru/articles/yac_m_2014_anal.html">has already exceeded 25% last year.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/767/b35/b9c767b353fe48a39691c24681838523.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Socialization of e-commerce</b> <br><br>  This is the growing trend of the last few years.  E-commerce becomes social when people influence other people to buy, consciously or unconsciously.  The trend can be traced from simple mechanics in the integration of social networks with websites of online stores (input through social networks, widgets, like and share) to socialization of the online stores themselves and the use of data obtained in social networks for personalization. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting that e-commerce has begun to develop within the framework of the classic social networks.  From sales directly on the pages of networks or application stores to the integration of entire market-place social networks. <br><br>  In the next few years, we will see the emergence of new types of projects that will be a mixture of online stores and social networks. <br><br>  <b>Globalization</b> <br><br>  This is a terrible dream of many regional online stores, including in Russian Internet.  Major global players penetrate many countries through the opening of representative offices or partnership agreements.  For example, just over a year ago, eBay entered into a partnership agreement with Wikimart to speed up delivery to the Russian market.  And the share of Chinese and American online stores in runet is close to 25-30% of the total market.  If you remember, about 5 years ago, few people bought in Chinese stores in RuNet, now this is the rule. <br><br>  For survival, local shops need to: reduce costs and prices, improve service, expand the range, improve logistics, work on the site, optimize marketing costs, provide favorable conditions for warranty and return. <br><br>  <b>Integration of third-party software and services</b> <br><br>  Another trend is the connection of third-party software and services to existing stores.  This was facilitated by the emergence of a variety of e-commerce software in recent years.  Today, small and medium-sized stores connect accounting programs, warehouse, logistics and similar.  Large ones often write their own solutions, which work as effectively as possible with their specific tasks. <br><br>  However, this trend also applies not only to e-commerce.  More and more packaged solutions are appearing on the market that make it easy for small businesses to work. <br><br>  <b>Logistics</b> <br><br>  Fast and free shipping is the norm in developed countries.  In Russia there are significant problems with this, the logistic structure is still poorly developed.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that I wrote about Russia from the whole Runet, since, for example, in Ukraine there is no such problem and goods can be delivered to any point of the country in 1-2 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87f/1d8/601/87f1d8601c7140188996496f5b2d2723.jpg"><br><br>  But the consumer is not interested in the problems, he is interested in the speed of delivery and price, so at this point, active development is already underway and many e-commerce projects are struggling with each other for "a place in the sun."  Now we can observe the active construction of issuing points throughout Russia, and I think that this problem can be effectively solved over the next 3-5 years. <br><br>  <b>Automation</b> <br><br>  With the development of technology and develops automation.  Many products today can be bought automatically, especially with regard to information products and services, in this area we have long been witnessing widespread automation.  With real goods more difficult, while only global giants like Amazon are introducing automated warehouses and robots. <br><br>  In the next 10 years, this trend will definitely develop.  First, global giants, and then runet companies, will switch to automatic or semi-automatic trading, including product selection, payment, and delivery. <br><br>  <b>Growth Trends by Region</b> <br><br>  Globally, developing countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Russia and others are growing the fastest.  In terms of market growth in percentage terms, the leadership of developing countries and we, the post-Soviet countries, belong to the latter group.  And this means that the markets of our countries scale the fastest, although we are not the richest. <br><br>  The main driver of market growth in the country for the last few years has been holding regions, about 70-80% of the total growth. <br><br>  <b>Growth Trends by Niches</b> <br><br>  The main share of the e-commerce market in the world is electronics (including computers), clothing and accessories.  The share of these goods runet reaches 50%.  In developed countries, slightly less, 40-45%.  Also actively buying books, household goods and office furniture, and a number of other categories. <br><br>  According to eMarketer, food products, beverages and auto parts can be considered as one of the fastest growing segments. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br>  Of course, there are still many trends that are standard for e-commerce, such as working on an assortment, service, connecting new methods of payment and delivery, and much more.  I did not single it out into trends, these are normal business processes in this segment, on which everyone works from year to year. <br><br>  The market is growing and developing very fast.  Developed countries show high technology, new approaches are being introduced, which then change the entire segment.  The markets of the countries of the former Soviet Union are still very underdeveloped, here you can still successfully start new projects, although the competition is already great. <br><br>  <b>PS I</b> invite you to our author courses in the business school "Digitov": <a href="http://digitov.com/course/marketing-e-commerce-courses">Marketing for the online store</a> and <a href="http://digitov.com/course/E-Commerce-courses">Everything about creating an online store</a> - I teach the course (the author of the article) and my colleagues, I promise a lot of interesting and practical information. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> To receive our new articles before others or simply not to miss new publications - subscribe to the SECL Group's fan pages: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SECLGROUP">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/seclgroup">VK</a> , and <a href="https://twitter.com/SECL">Twitter</a> . <br><br>  Original article: <a href="http://seclgroup.ru/article_trends_global_e-commerce_market_in_the_2015_2016.html">http://seclgroup.ru/article_trends_global_e-commerce_market_in_the_2015_2016.html</a> <br><br>  <b>Author:</b> <br>  Nikita Semenov <br>  The president <br>  <a href="http://seclgroup.ru/">SECL Group</a> Company </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268455/</a></p>
