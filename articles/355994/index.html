      <b>Updated:</b> <br>  On March 24, at the meeting of the Council of the Federation, the second reading was <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/work/id.nsf/(ID)/F97A94C8B50D6BF343257F80005A2DE9/%24File/INF03-24.rtf%3FOpenElement">postponed</a> to a later date, most likely, to <a href="http://pravo.ru/news/view/127229/">April 12</a> . <br><blockquote>  The Council postponed consideration at a meeting of the State Duma of draft federal law No. 113185-6 </blockquote><br><blockquote>  According to Pavel Krasheninnikov, the second reading will be held at the plenary meeting on April 12 or 13. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d45/63a/06b/d4563a06b90d417885e821c6addd5f28.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All that has been done is to move the law into force from January 2017 to spring 2016, and the definitions are slightly reformulated. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúNotes.  1. Under materials and objects <br>  with pornographic images of minors in this article and article 2422 of this Code are understood materials <br>  and items containing any image or description for sexual purposes: <br>  fully or partially nude genital organs of a minor; <br>  a minor who commits or imitates sexual intercourse or other acts of a sexual nature; <br>  sexual intercourse or other acts of a sexual nature committed in relation to or with the minor; <br>  an adult person depicting a minor who commits or imitates sexual intercourse or other acts of a sexual nature. <br></blockquote><br>  As we see, in comparison with the first reading, nothing has changed at all, but in her speech she will have the opportunity to say that "all the comments were taken into account." <br><br>  Legal Department demanded to remove the item about imitation, but his opinion was not taken into account. <br>  The responsible committee - the State Duma Committee on Civil, Criminal, Arbitration and Procedural Legislation - approved all the amendments by Mizulina and has already formed a text for the second reading, taking into account these amendments. <br>  If the responsible committee recommends adopting something, then this bill is adopted in its current form in almost all cases.  You can read in the transcripts of meetings or watch a <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/analytics/tv/">video</a> . <br><br>  I remind you that the main suppliers of convicts under 242 and under 242.1 articles are three things - <br>  1. Putting videos and pictures on social networks. <br>  2. Local file sharing networks, for example DC. <br>  3. Global file sharing networks - torrents, eDonkey, shareaza and so on. <br><br>  Comrades from the Interior Ministry love to write about those caught, I advise you to familiarize yourself with the practice on the basis of their triumphant reports: <br>  <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D242%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2Binurl%253Amvd.ru%26rlz%3D1C9BKJA_enRU645RU645%26oq%3D242%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2Binurl%253Amvd.ru">Regular porn</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D242.1%2Binurl%253Amvd.ru%26oq%3D242.1%2Binurl%253Amvd.ru">And "baby"</a> <br><br>  I also remind you that due to the efforts of the same Mizulina, the term for distributing ordinary pornography in 2009 was increased from 2 to 6 years, it became a grave crime. <br><br>  Now for hentai and school uniforms on actresses, the term will grow to another 10 years, plus pedophilia has been dragged along with the bonus. <br><br>  And <a href="https://antizapret.info/org.php%3Fid%3D1">here</a> you can get acquainted with the fact that it is our authorities who consider DP. <br>  In all the images there was due diligence and so on. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NAgXD2S34k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgJD7U2CDosayYJRJ_az8nSRDIG8g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Satire, we thought. <br>  Thicken paint, we thought. <br><br>  Lord, at least in one country of the world "imitation" with adults is equal to dp? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355994/</a></p>
