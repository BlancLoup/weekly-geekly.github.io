  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The amount of WebOS is over 20</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you still believe that Google is really developing WebOS, or a virtual operating system inside the browser, but you can‚Äôt wait for it, I can make you happy: there are already such solutions and more than 20 of them! <br><br>  Of course, some virtual operating systems look awful and are in beta testing, but there are some very decent designs in the review.  Actually, I offer myself a review :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.craythur.com/">Craythur</a> .  This WebOS is in beta testing and has an interface resembling Windows Aero.  At this dignity (and for someone, and no) Craythur ends.  But the flaws are just beginning - the applications themselves are not finalized, and in most cases their interface is in Spanish. </li><li>  <a href="http://desktoptwo.com/">Desktoptwo</a> .  This OS can be called high-quality and well-functioning.  So, after registering you get your mini-site, as well as an email box.  Of the more or less large applications, there is an HTML editor, OpenOffice, an RSS reader, an MP3 player and an instant messenger.  Although, unfortunately, this service has some problems in usability and interface. </li><li>  <a href="http://eyeos.org/">EyeOS</a> .  This WebOS differs from others in that it is basically not a hosting, but a platform.  EyeOS offers to upload your scripts to your own hosting and use it there.  Although EyeOS can allocate space on its server <a href="http://eyeos.info/">eyeos.info</a> , which lives by donations.  The functionality of this WebOS is not bad, but the speed is small. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.glidedigital.com/">Glide</a> .  It is worth starting with the fact that this OS is paid.  It also has its own interface (the GUI does not resemble either Windows or MacOS ...), but this can be attributed to minuses as a result, as there are obvious problems with usability.  As for the functionality, it offers 1GB of space, you can create documents, there is an RSS reader, a manager of bookmarks and meetings, chat, image viewer and calendar ... idle. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.goowy.com/">Goowy</a> .  This WebOS is favorably different from many others, since there are no problems with usability here.  From applications there is a file downloader, email client, RSS reader, messenger, manager of bookmarks and contacts, as well as a calendar.  Unfortunately, so far the service only works in IE. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.orcaa.com/">Orca</a> .  This OS has a player, Zoho Office office suite, RSS reader, calendar, notepad, several games and a file manager.  Also, the developers of this service is preparing LiveCD Orczilla, by booting from which you will get a familiar desktop. </li><li>  <a href="http://purefect.klorofil.org/demo/">Purefect</a> .  This WebOS is remarkable only in that it completely repeats the Windows interface, using even the same icons.  The functionality here is zero - a file manager and a calculator ... That's it!  :) </li><li>  <a href="http://giffard.dynalias.net/ssoe/">SSOE</a> .  Here, unfortunately, nothing worked.  The interface with these terrible huge icons also failed.  However, the system developer said that at the moment, only about 10% of the OS is written. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.xindesk.com/">XinDESK</a> .  This WebOS is still closed, so you only have to refer to entries in the developer blog.  It says that XinDESK allows you to open and save documents in standard office formats.  It also says that this OS will have an API, which makes it possible to write your own applications for this WebOS. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youos.com/">YouOS</a> .  This is quite a good WebOS, with a high-quality interface.  From the programs you can select a good messenger, RSS-reader, file manager and a couple more applications. </li><li>  <a href="https://desktopondemand.com/">DesktopOnDemand</a> .  In fact, this is not quite WebOS - this is the LiveCD Linux in your browser.  Yes, yes, this is a complete Linux environment with 1GB of available memory for your needs.  I think the functionality here can not talk now :) The only problem with DesktopOnDemand is login, as for this you need to download either a separate application or a Java applet. </li><li>  <a href="http://g.ho.st/">G.ho.st.</a>  This WebOS is different from others in that it has integration with Google docs and Flickr.  Otherwise, this is the usual WebOS with such standard things as an RSS reader, browser, notebook, clock, email client and instant messenger. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.odesktop.net/">ODesktop</a> .  This WebOS is written in PHP and Ajax and its distribution can be downloaded and put on your server.  OS code is well optimized and does not require large capacity.  Applications include a file manager, an audio player, a photo album, an instant messenger, an e-mail client, a set of games, an RSS reader and a browser. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ajaxwindows.com/">AjaxWindows</a> .  This WebOS task is to repeat the environment of your ‚Äúbig‚Äù desktop.  To do this, when you start the service, a setup wizard will appear, allowing you to synchronize your music, pictures, documents on your PC with AjaxWindows.  Unfortunately, there are some problems with usability. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mylgd.com/">MyLGD</a> .  So far, this development is in the alpha stage, however, applications in it are faster than in some other WebOS.  In general, we should expect polishing this service ... It would have turned out a good project. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.nivio.com/">Nivio</a>  This is also not quite WebOS using the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDesktopOnDemand, only instead of Linux there is Windows.  Nivio offers each user 5GB of free space for documents and applications space, and you can even put here Photoshop, even MS Office.  All this miracle works with the help of a Java applet ... It works terribly slowly.  By the way, how are things going with licensing?  Microsoft will not cover all this shop? </li><li>  <a href="http://www.schmedley.com/">Schmedley</a> .  This development by its appearance resembles Mac OS X Tiger, which naturally caresses the eye.  There are even a bunch of widgets.  As for applications, there is a notebook, a calendar, a reader of letters from Gmail, an RSS reader and a messenger.  Moreover, this WebOS works very quickly and without a single glitch.  Hooray! </li><li>  <a href="http://dekoh.com/">Dekoh</a> .  This WebOS has nothing to do with others: Dekoh allows you to organize media files, and then publish them to the public.  Desktop Portal, a place to manage applications, even more resembles a CMS, rather than an OS. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ironbox.com/">Ironbox</a> .  In general, Ironbox is a platform for developing web applications, but with its own graphical interface, it falls under the WebOS category.  However, for everyday tasks this ‚ÄúWebOS‚Äù is useless, because there are very few currently available applications.  It is hoped that developers will expand the number of applications, because it is easy, because the platform is very flexible. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.gcoex.com/">GCOE X.</a>  So far this is an early alpha version, but from the browser, audio player and chat present there everything works very quickly and without obvious errors.  Worth waiting for the next releases. </li></ol>  There are a few more WebOS not included in this review.  But to know about them is still worth it: <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.exoplatform.com/">Exo</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icube.at/oos.jsp">Oos</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.jooce.com/">Jooce</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://xcerion.com/">Xcerion</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://startforce.com/">Startforce</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.widgetop.com/">Widgetop</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.gopc.net/">Go.PC</a> </li></ul>  via <a href="http://franticindustries.com/blog/2006/12/21/big-webos-roundup-10-online-operating-systems-reviewed/">Frantic</a> <a href="http://franticindustries.com/blog/2007/06/16/another-10-web-operating-systems-reviewed/">Industries</a> . </div>
