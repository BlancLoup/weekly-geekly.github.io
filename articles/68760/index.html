Although in real <i>technical</i> life it is necessary to know (but well) only a few hours. <br><br>  Effective methods for me were: <br><ul><li>  learning conversational topics </li><li>  listening, dictation </li><li>  participation in olympiads </li></ul>  Also, a great advantage of learning was the fact that each lesson was essentially different from the previous one.  For example, on Monday they learned grammar, on Tuesday - colloquial, on Wednesday they wrote dictations, and on Thursday - they read and translated the texts of the classics (Shakespeare, Conan-Doyle, etc.).

    <h4>  Technical English at the university </h4><br>  The classical problem of universities is a different level of students, therefore the level of teaching is mostly low.  This led to the fact that for several years of study the level of English did not rise significantly. <br><br>  The only effective method that can be distinguished is the translation of a large number of technical articles (the more the better) for obtaining a base of technical terms. <br><br><h4>  Master's </h4><br>  Here the interesting begins.  If you want to study the language - choose the topic of the thesis, which is bad (better - no way) is described in runet.  Then you <i>will have to</i> look for (filter, translate) material on English-language resources, which will give a big increase in your knowledge of the language in a short (about a year) period. <br><br><h4>  English courses </h4><br>  In parallel with the English in the magistracy language courses were conducted at work.  The courses were conducted by highly qualified specialists for half a year, 2 times a week for 1.5 hours.  To be honest, I did not notice any tangible progress.  Just had a nice time :-) <br><br><h4>  Freelance </h4><br>  Again, in parallel with the master, I began to engage in freelancing.  I can not say that he brought me a lot of money, but now there is clearly more experience and knowledge. <br><br>  The hardest thing was to start, i.e.  find the first customer, and, therefore, write a few <s>dozen</s> letters.  I admit honestly - 30-45 minutes were spent for one standard letter of 2-3 paragraphs.  Books with collected standard phrases like "best regards", "hope to work with you soon", etc. came to help.  After a month of persistent effort, the letters became easier. <br><br>  Even more gave correspondence with customers in Skype, especially when they did not quite understand what they wanted.  In this case, it was necessary to attract all his ability to convince and convince in English. <br><br>  2-3 projects in this mode allowed to reduce the writing of letters to 10 minutes, and this undoubtedly was progress. <br><br><h4>  New job </h4><br>  After the transition to a new job, I was entrusted with a complex project with an English-speaking customer.  The project had to have technical documentation, the writing of which was also entrusted to me. <br><br>  At first it was <i>very</i> difficult, they worked in this way: I said that I needed to write, and a comrade who knew the language translated it into English and typed.  The reason for this work was in the absence of time to build up.  This went on for a week - then I typed up the documentation myself.  For 2-3 weeks, the progress was simply impressive. <br><br><h4>  Today </h4><br>  The best way at the moment is to read English-language news, as well as their translation and publication on your blog.  Other factors - letters, documentation, help not to relax and at least a few minutes a day to devote themselves to the English language. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  In my opinion, the most effective methods in the absence of real communication are: <br><ul><li>  dissertation topic poorly described in runet </li><li>  writing technical documentation in a short time </li><li>  small freelance projects </li><li>  reading and translating articles, news and publishing them on your blog </li></ul>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  <b>One more conclusion is noticed very nicely: if you try to jump higher than your head, it will be good, otherwise you will have a good time.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68760/</a></p>
