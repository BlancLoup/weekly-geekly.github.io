In the summer of 2008, calls from users suddenly began to arrive about the site being unavailable.  Hosting was paid less than a week ago, no disconnection notification was received.  The average site traffic then was 200-400 unique visitors per day.  When I called technical support, I was surprised to find out that they had introduced some new limits for disk operations, and the site was disabled for exceeding them ( <b>without warning! And without notifying about the introduction of limits!</b> ).  I instantly transferred the site to VPS, vengefully dragged from them a couple of my customers, whose hosting was running out, and forgot about this monstrous manifestation of Soviet reality, as if it were a bad dream.  Several customers remained in HC - for laziness and inertia.  As it turned out today, nothing ... <br><br><h5>  Actually the story </h5><br>  Now I received a letter from one of my customers who remained in HC - a small website-portfolio of an animal photographer on HostCMS, a lot of photos, but attendance is small.  On my VPS-ke 12 such sites are spinning at the same time, not counting the large visited main and projects in development.  The load on the processor on the VPS I never rose above 7%, and LA slightly exceeds the unit only at the moments of the backup - actually during the backup tar'om.  Therefore, <b>I know</b> that sites on this CMS with low attendance simply <b>cannot</b> create any exorbitant workloads, and even with a high one, the server is not particularly loaded.  In September, I mentioned one of these sites on Habr√© in the comments, and we <b>quietly</b> experienced a mini-effect - about 200 unique in 20 minutes. <br><br>  So, the letter from the customer turned out to be sent by the hosting center notification, I quote (the domain has been replaced by asterisks by me):

    <blockquote>  Good afternoon, you are concerned about the technical support of the Hosting Center. <br><br>  Our servers host your hosting, which includes the following sites: <br>  *********. ru <br><br>  Recently, your hosting has been overloading the server where it is located. <br>  This creates unacceptable interference to other users of this server. <br><br>  The reasons: <br>  Exceeded the limit on processor time in the last 7 days. <br>  Used 2459656098152450.00 of 500 minutes. <br><br>  Exceeded the limit on the number of I / O operations. <br>  Used 18446744073709551615 of 400000. <br><br>  (the maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãof the parameters are contained in Appendices 2 and 3) <br><br>  We remind you that in accordance with the Agreement (clause 2.2.2) our company is entitled <br>  block your hosting service as leading to a noticeable deterioration <br>  quality of service to other customers. <br><br>  (!) We strongly recommend optimizing the site scripts (by yourself or <br>  by referring to their developers). <br><br>  If this does not reduce the overall load, then you can: <br>  a) activate the Turbo service (see <a href="http://www.hc.ru/ru/news/index.php%3Fid35%3D1085">www.hc.ru/ru/news/index.php?id35=1085</a> <br>  and also the article in the help section - <a href="http://www.help.hc.ru/entry/1265/">www.help.hc.ru/entry/1265</a> ). <br>  For transition issues you can contact customer service. <br>  by phones (495) 544-55-66, (495) 666-27-40 <br>  b) go to a dedicated server <br>  (see <a href="http://hc.ru/ru/services/dedicated/">hc.ru/ru/services/dedicated</a> - server rental, <br>  <a href="http://hc.ru/ru/services/colocation/">hc.ru/ru/services/colocation</a> - hosting servers) <br>  For all matters of purchasing a dedicated server, you can contact <br>  with the department for work with corporate clients <br>  by phones (495) 961-32-35, (495) 961-32-39. <br><br>  (!!) The issue of reducing the load must be resolved as soon as possible. <br>  (!!) In the event that in the coming days the load will remain critical, <br>  Your hosting MAY BE BLOCKED without a second notice. <br><br>  The current value of the specified indicator you can see <br>  in the control panel of your service. <br><br>  Hope for your understanding. </blockquote><br><br>  I go to the site - I see as many as 15 visitors today!  I go to the statistics of the hot log - and see the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6f98c919/b6ef0208/606b5fcb/74a96fa4.png"><br><br>  Pay attention to tsiferki elevations in the letter!  These brazen scammers believe that a site with 20 visitors per day needs to purchase a VPS! <br><br>  No problem - I'll start transferring the Dashin website right now, this is not a problem at all - I will have another one on the VPS.  I would like to warn all habrazhiteli, so that no one attacked this rake called "Hosting Center".  Sooner or later, you may find yourself in the same situation - at Christmas, the fraudsters from HC run out of money for drinking, and you will be asked to transfer your saytik ‚Äúfor yourself‚Äù at least to Dedik ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111396/</a></p>
