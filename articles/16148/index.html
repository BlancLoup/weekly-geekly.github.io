      Victory over unnecessary occupations <br><br>  First, 2007 is rightfully considered the beginning of the end of the so-called search engine optimization industry.  All of us regularly learn from news reports about the capture of the next search engine optimizer.  Let me remind you that before the famous international ‚ÄúLaw on Countering Internet Crime‚Äù, among other things, determined by a criminal offense any actions related to raising the position of websites in search engines, search optimizers could act openly and legally.  It is now very few people dare to contact them, and in the times we described the demand for their services was quite high.  And it was precisely at that time that various clubs, associations, and other optimizer associations began to appear, which were later taken under control by the companies that owned search engines, which greatly helped further actions of a reasonable public against this evil. <br><br>  Speaking about the "dead" professions, it is impossible not to mention and rarely recalled now web designers.  But in 2007, most of the sites were individual in design!  Then the standards of design and site navigation have not yet been legally enforced.  There were no modern aggregators that allow you to read news of any subject from any source in any design and presentation style, nor the Unified Trading Platform.  In those days, companies tried to create a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù website, with a complete set of information ‚Äî a product catalog, and news, and even blogs.  Only a couple of years ago, the international classification of site types and color palettes (I recall their 87 and 23, respectively), which can be used on the Internet, was approved. <br><br>  Why are there design!  The person who created the site at that time should have known a bunch of unnecessary technologies.  It is difficult to imagine that then the sites were created by weeks (!), And not in 5 minutes.  It is now to create a site, you need to choose the design, type of site, emotional coloring of the generated content and fill out a couple of forms.  But then this operation required the ability to work with such things as FTP, HTML, PHP, DNS, etc., whose names now will not say anything to an ordinary web user. <br><br>  Victory over network scoundrels <br><br>  Although no, the DNS abbreviation is still widely known, after all, the attack of 2009 was not forgotten, when the al-Qaeda cyber division brought down the root Internet DNS server and paralyzed its work for a whole week.  We all remember the chaos and the huge financial losses to which the attack led.  And the ‚ÄúLaw on Countering Internet Crime‚Äù was adopted precisely after this event. <br><br>  By the way, it was this law that had a decisive influence on the vector of development of the Internet.  Now we are not surprised by the militarized security of the data centers and the Mandatory digital certificate.  And tell someone in that same 2007 that without a certificate confirming your identity, you will not be able to access the Internet even from an Internet cafe, you would have been instantly laughed at. <br><br>  Of course, there are still voices about the infringement of freedom, about the inconvenience of a written justification for the creation of a second site, the establishment of a second mailbox or a second account in the dating service.  But precisely because of this, the Internet has become much safer.  After all, now the hacker attacks have become very difficult to implement, anonymous slander on blogs is impossible, and the vile pedophile can no longer pretend to be a muscular young man, seducing a 15-year-old girl on Mamba. <br><br>  The heyday of this business <br><br>  But back in 2007.  This year a lot of important events happened.  For example, for the first time traditional conferences for web developers under the aegis of RIT were held.  They are now closed and strictly professional - I had to sweat a lot to get an invitation to the last of them - and then the organizers even had to advertise them.  In the same year, 1C finally turned its attention to the web, including the product ‚Äú1C: Site Management‚Äù in its product line (more precisely, this product was first called ‚ÄúBitrix: Site Management‚Äù, but as a result of a two-stage takeover, Bitrix acquired its current name ).  Finally, in 2007, Activist and Armada were formed, which supplemented the Big Three of the time (Yandex, Rambler and Mail.ru) to the Big Five. <br><br>  By the way, about the "five".  Yesterday, at the Rambler party, dedicated to its anniversary, tenth sale, we argued for 100 yuan with my colleague from Kommersant Online about who would still buy Yandex.  You all know that this unique company that barely survived the back has finally announced plans to sell.  I believe that Google, controlled by the US government, will win the dispute over its assets, and a colleague from Kommersant that Yandex will be bought by the Chinese, since  a deal with Google is likely to ban the antimonopoly committee.  For me, Yandex would have better bought our government, but Russian officials adhere to a different point of view, having invested 50 billion in the development of a public search engine last year.  Apparently, the experience of creating their own supercomputer and their own operating system did not teach them anything. <br><br>  Although it is possible, this decision is justified by the fact that Yandex was most affected in the ARRAY, the War of Advertising Income, when the Hosting Providers 'Association threatened the search engines to prohibit indexing of sites located on hosting providers' sites (and the Association includes, for a minute, 98 , 5% of all global hosting providers, including both Russian).  That war lasted about six months and ended with the defeat of search engines - the market finally came to its normal configuration, when hosting for sites is free, contextual advertising is required on them, and providers pay for it with search engines.  They say that the crisis was inspired by Google, which in general is not surprising, because in the end most of the search engines were closed, and Google after the next reporting period announced the tripling of revenue for advertising. <br><br>  Thank you party for this! <br><br>  Of course, the few companies that can afford to pay for ‚Äúad-free‚Äù hosting will not go anywhere, but there is a tendency towards the final normalization of this industry - after all, almost all government websites have also switched to advertising hosting.  Surely you remember the incident with the appearance on the presidential website of the foundation's advertising unit, Garry Kasparov, in which he announced the dissolution of the movement ‚ÄúAbsolutely Other Russia‚Äù and the creation of the movement ‚ÄúGenerally Other Russia‚Äù - for the elections of 2018, where the famous oppositionist in the West will again battle corrupt domineering nomenclature.  Then, in order to exclude such precedents, the Presidential Administration in a hurry decided to transfer the site to its own newly created hosting site, but, considering the money for an international hosting license, they left everything as is.  What can not be called a wise decision. <br><br>  In general, in recent years, the state has finally turned its close attention to the Internet.  As Internet Minister Igor Ashmanov put it recently, if the state used to have its back to the Internet, and the Internet used it, now the roles have changed. <br><br>  Of course, there were excesses in the relations of these two subjects of our life.  We all remember the first Internet elections to the Duma, when, due to an annoying error of programmers from the entire list of parties, it was possible to vote only for United Russia and the Alcohol Prohibition Party (well, at least they didn‚Äôt arrange re-voting).  What about the successful hacker attack on the server of the President‚Äôs online conference, as a result of which he was finally forced to voice his attitude towards Cthulhu? <br><br>  But all this is over.  And there are only bright prospects ahead.  And maybe, if I‚Äôm renewed the license of an online journalist, in ten years I will write a retrospective review about this year, 2017. <br><br>  <a href="http://webplanet.ru/column/life/dimatwork/2007/11/13/runet2017.html">Source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16148/</a></p>
