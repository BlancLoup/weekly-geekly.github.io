      There are many details that designers should consider when designing a so-called ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù.  One of such details is the speech of the robot. <br><br>  In the speech of the robot an important place is occupied by <i>verbal markers</i> [in Russian grammar - introductory constructions].  A few words will be devoted to them. <br><br>  Verbal markers are used to communicate in short form the various fragments of the utterance. <br>  Among the verbal markers are the following: <ul><li>  <i>Numeric</i> : first, second, third;  on the one hand ... but on the other ...;  first of all;  for starters, first of all;  In second place;  one two Three...;  a B C...;  next, then;  finally the last;  in custody, etc. </li><li>  <i>Supporting</i> : besides, besides, besides this, first of all, etc. </li><li>  <i>Equalizing</i> : equally, the same, in the same way, etc. </li><li>  <i>Translators</i> : by the way, by the way, now, etc. </li><li>  <i>Summarizing</i> : thus, in general, in conclusion, in general, to summarize, etc. </li><li>  <i>Attachments</i> : namely, in other words, for example, for example, that is, so to speak, etc. </li><li>  <i>Summarizing</i> : therefore, as a result, for these reasons, etc. </li><li>  <i>Derivatives</i> : other, otherwise, in other words, in this case, etc. </li><li>  <i>Reformulating</i> : better, rather, in other words, etc. </li><li>  <i>Substitutes</i> : on the other hand, rather, etc. </li><li>  <i>Contrasting</i> : instead, on the contrary, on the other hand, etc. </li><li>  <i>Conciliatory</i> : one way or another, in any case, it is still, however, nonetheless, in any case, etc. </li><li>  <i>Temporal</i> : meanwhile, then, at the same time, etc. </li><li>  <i>Estimated</i> : in fact, in fact, following the facts, strictly speaking, formally, officially, technically, theoretically, etc. </li></ul><br>  How can the use of verbal markers in the speech of robots help? <br>  First, the apparent redundancy of the markers serves for a meaningful connection between different fragments of the conversation.  ‚ÄúJuan is my son‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuan is probably my son‚Äù are two completely different sentences. <br>  Secondly, the verbal markers provide the system with an opportunity to confirm the presence of a <i>dialogue</i> between the robot and the human (and not just answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, ‚ÄúI did not understand you. Repeat‚Äù). <br><br>  Let's now turn to the use of specific verbal markers and see how they can diversify the speech of robots. <br><br>  <b>now / now / now</b> <br>  This marker in the design of voice prompts is used to indicate the connection of one level of dialogue with another. <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: Great.  You are logged in.  And now, since you are using the system for the first time, let me offer you help. <br><br>  <b>by the way</b> <br>  provides information in brackets <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: I dial the number.  By the way, when you finish a conversation, you can not hang up, but simply say: ‚ÄúGo back‚Äù to stay in the system. <br><br>  <b>oh / o</b> <br>  a marker of ‚Äúcognitive inconsistency‚Äù (what I know or think does not coincide with what you know or think) <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: Sport!  Of course, sports!  Oh ... Only this function I have not yet implemented. <br><br>  <b>actually / actually</b> <br>  as in the case of the previous marker shows that something does not correspond to reality or is not quite right <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: Actually, I can't go straight to this section.  To get there, say: "Back." <br><br>  <b>otherwise / or just say ... / or</b> <br>  perhaps one of the most common markers in the speech of robots <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: If you want to leave a message, say: "Yes."  Otherwise, say no. <br><br>  <b>OK</b> <br>  this marker confirms the user's choice and smoothly moves it to another level <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  SYSTEM: Do you want to change your personal settings? <br>  USER: None. <br>  SYSTEM: Good.  What's next? <br><br>  <b>sorry / sorry</b> <br>  this marker is not a sign of repentance of the system in the deed (the robot is not a human being), but is a signal of non-compliance of the request with the results <br><br>  <i>eg</i> <br>  USER: My PIN is three six, m ... no, it is ... two six four seven. <br>  SYSTEM: Excuse me.  I did not understand you. <br><br>  So, try not to use verbal markers in order to convince the user that it is not a robot that speaks to him, but a human being.  The markers ultimately serve to link the various parts of the dialogue together, which simplifies the assimilation of the meaning of the phrases. <br><br><h6>  Based on the book by Michael Cohen <a href="http://books.google.ru/books%3Fid%3DPI_n2EcJfT0C%26hl%3Den%26source%3Dgbs_navlinks_s">"Design of voice user interface"</a> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66639/</a></p>
