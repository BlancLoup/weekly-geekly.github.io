Many of your recommendations formed the basis for the continuation of this story. <br><br>  Although, for some inexplicable reason, and almost immediately after the publication, a strange voice appeared in my head, every now and then repeating - ‚ÄúOh, leave it ... drop it!  And do what you always do! ‚Äù  But the demon of doubt and laziness was still able to cope, having perceived, although not Kung Fu, then a couple of tricks for sure. <br><br>  The first thing that upset me as a beginner, no, even disappointed - this appearance of a practically similar project under the heading ‚Äúbeta‚Äù the very next day after the publication on Habr√©.

      In order not to fall into depression about this, I decided that this is still a pattern that does me the honor, for I am competing, I (I am a novice), apparently with professionals.  Well, with this thought, I proceeded to finalize the project. <br><br><h5>  Set goals </h5><br>  Already accustomed to the fact that everything in IT should be clearly planned out with a reasonable degree of uncertainty, I began with the same plan, which I talked about a lot in my first post.  And it was necessary: <br><ul><li>  Integrate registration and login with social networks; </li><li>  Something come up with a design; </li><li>  Run a full API; </li><li>  Somehow reduce the text content of the entire site; </li><li>  Something more convenient for users. </li></ul><br>  We will write down ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù and ‚Äúsomething‚Äù to the mentioned uncertainty. <br><br><h5>  Login through social networks </h5><br>  Perhaps this is the main wish expressed by the absolute majority of the citizens of Habrovsk.  At the initial stages, this opportunity seemed to me extremely difficult to implement, and the study of various techniques took almost a day, but the implementation itself took only 30 minutes. <br><br>  I used the Loginza service to achieve the goal.  And when everything was ready, I seriously thought about why, if everything is so simple even for a beginner, does the lion's part of the runet (forms, chat rooms, trackers, etc.) still require registration?  Laziness or some other considerations? <br><br>  In any case, the consequence of the introduction of registration through a social network was the rejection of the uniqueness of the user's login.  It is this requirement, and not the entry mechanism itself, that took a decent time to work out. <br><br><h5>  Design </h5><br>  Quite a lot of controversial (in my opinion) comments came to the design of the project.  Considering the fact that I myself sometimes cannot distinguish between shades, and there are no web designers in my environment, it was decided to look for someone from the outside. <br><br>  With a couple of people in the local (city) forum, I started a dialogue, but so, alas, it did not end with anything.  The reason for that was the use of ‚Äúflying‚Äù windows instead of, let's say, the standard approach to web-design.  And I like the idea with the windows, and I really do not want to abandon it. <br><br>  In general, it didn‚Äôt work out again for me to involve the contractor in the project, even to a single sector.  Maybe, of course, I did not offer much, and maybe I thought too much about myself - I don‚Äôt know, if I ask, I‚Äôll ask from failed partners. <br><br>  As a result, the work on the design was reduced to a thorough refinement of the existing ‚Äúengine‚Äù created on the basis of JQuery.  What came out of it is to judge you. <br><br><h5>  API </h5><br>  Despite the fact that the API was developed in parallel, I had to redo and modify a great deal, largely due to the fact that I myself experienced these mechanisms, for example, from the same Loginza or InfoBip.  The general conclusion is simple and obvious: the developer is the same user who needs to be comfortable, comfortable, warm and understandable. <br><br>  Perhaps it was the refinement and testing of the API that took most of the time since the first publication, not counting a couple of days for a detailed technical description of the functions. <br><br>  By the way, the description turned out to be 44 sheets (A4), which even seems to me too large.  But since I was doing this kind of work for the first time, I decided to make a start from the example at hand.  And, as it is not strange, the description of the bourgeois InfoBip service seemed to be the most adequate, where not less text volume is given to chewing a couple of functions.  But as a result, even a small naive hedgehog, like me, can figure it out. <br><br><h5>  Summarizing </h5><br>  For a little more than two weeks, as far as the availability of time free from the main work, it was possible: <br><ul><li>  Finalize the design on their own and correct the ‚Äúengine‚Äù itself; </li><li>  Run the API; </li><li>  Cut the site text by 25% - 35%; </li><li>  Add a bit of convenience to users; </li><li>  To fasten an entrance and registration through social networks; </li><li>  Refuse the uniqueness of the login; </li><li>  Find a lot of nasty little bugs and destroy them with persistence, having frightened you with red eyes. </li></ul><br>  I don‚Äôt regret so much that I bent on all this, making a conclusion for myself again and again - everything new is always interesting, and new knowledge is always only in favor.  And if this post is read by people who have an idea, but they think that they will not be able to realize it, you just start, and it will definitely grow with you. <br><br>  I will be infinitely grateful for suggestions and comments from respected habrovchan to the updated project, located all there, on <a href="http://lovepinger.com/">lovepinger.com</a> .  As before, he took valerian, breathing smoothly. <br><br><h5>  PS or Masha </h5><br>  A lot of comments or more questions have been received about Masha.  There were even a couple of letters in a personal.  I will not upload the photo of Masha, of course, despite the fact that it would have decorated the picture of the world, but I will confine myself only to the fact that I managed to drag Masha into the project.  And maybe not me.  After all, anyone could invite her. <br><br>  In any case, my sympathies were not mutual, but still - thank you Masha for the muse and invaluable experience in a new area for me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133946/</a></p>
