Many stores sell technologically advanced models that are very similar to people and even know how to communicate with their owners.  Some scientists believe that the time is not far distant when the robots will be ‚Äúprescribed‚Äù to patients who suffer from all sorts of sexual dysfunctions. <br><br>  This opportunity was discussed by members of the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/sex-robot-real-person-video">Mental Health Symposium</a> in early June.  The participants of the symposium studied the possible dangers of gradual popularization of sex robots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As mentioned above, the quality of robots is getting higher, in a few years (maybe a couple of decades) they will become completely indistinguishable from people.  And lovers of sexual pleasures will be able to embody <a href="https://futurism.com/sex-robots-health">any wildest fantasies with their</a> partner robots.  All this will help to get rid of psychological problems to people who are afraid to enter into contact with human partners.  It may well be that medical insurance will cover the purchase and maintenance of robots.

      But there are downsides to this.  So, psychologists believe that there is a non-zero probability of the formation of unjustified expectations from relationships with people from those who have already had experience of sexual pleasures with robots.  This problem is typical now, for example, for teenagers who watch pornography and then transfer their impressions and expectations to real life. <br><br>  Robots, like pornography now, will become a supernormal stimulus.  This is a term in psychology, which means SUPER-NORMAL INCENTIVE - a model of a key stimulus exaggerated by one or several parameters, causing any kind of specific reaction of the ‚Äúfixed action complex‚Äù type with a greater degree of expression than the original stimulus. <br><br>  It is important to note that supernormal stimuli can form illusory images and expectations.  In today's world of humans, supernatural stimuli are human-developed technological products that provide short-term emotional and / or physiological benefits.  But since these products are evolutionarily unnatural, they often do not lead to any long-term evolutionary benefits (such as strong ties with a partner and / or long-term reproductive benefits).  On the other hand, all this can be an independent way of the evolution of mankind, where technological factors are also interwoven into the process of evolution. <br><br>  In practice, this will be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/201906/sex-robots-and-the-end-civilization">reflected in an increase in the number of people without a couple</a> .  The fact is that since sex robots will be ideal partners for many, they can negatively influence people's relationships, making sex with people less attractive.  The quality of intimate life will fall, and the motivation for finding a partner in real life will begin to decline. <br><br>  The number of people who are unable or unwilling to start a relationship is constantly increasing (this is especially true for Japan).  After sex robots become familiar and common, the situation will worsen even more.  Relationships of couples, in terms of sex, will also deteriorate - of course, not always, but in a large number of cases. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dsexrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/g0/i7/qqg0i7eriq4febfjqqehire4fnw.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dsexrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/1y/yw/bv1yywjgl2_cbtzvvtk4rup2jz8.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456274/</a></p>
