Working on the material for <a href="http://ain.ua/">AIN.ua</a> , I chose the most interesting from the presentation on 192 slides, and I divided the result into two materials.  Today I publish the first one. <br>  <i>Attention!</i>  <i>Under the cut 8 slide images!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bed/298/fc5/bed298fc53d6429d9328fcc593132c5b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. General trends</b> <br>  According to a study by HAX, today companies in all industries are increasingly using Internet technologies in their products.  Examples include IP cameras with face recognition, iPhone controlled thermostats and cameras with onboard software.  Especially the company advises inventors to pay attention to the following areas: <br><br><ul><li>  Drones  Drones, photographers, pizza delivery couriers and so on.  Small aircraft have long ceased to be just entertainment, today they are already entering the business and the sector of paid services. </li><li>  3D printing.  In addition to metal, plastic and glass, today's three-dimensional printers are already beginning to "print" chocolate, and even human skin and bones. </li><li>  Smart and wearable gadgets. </li><li>  Interaction between devices.  M2M devices are actively entering our lives, the number of successful startups with additional gadgets to the iPhone only confirms this. </li><li>  Touch gadgets: not in the sense of touchscreen screens, but in terms of the availability of various sensors.  From fitness bracelets to assistive devices to a smart home. </li></ul><br>  According to the researchers, the era of the computerization of everything and everyone is almost over, and the next step should be the ubiquitous standardization, when the various ‚Äúsmart‚Äù subjects will begin to interact with each other.  This will be the era of "real magic"!

      <b>2. The issue of money</b> <br>  Public interest in hardware projects is supported by investor interest.  Many such startups have grown into large companies and went public - Oculus, Beats, GoPro.  Since Kickstarter was founded, more than $ 389 million have been invested in such projects through the crowdfunding platform. Recall only the recent success of the Pebble smart watches.  At the same time, the most successful investments were nevertheless attracted through venture funds, and not through crowdfunding: the mistake of many Kickstarter companies is that they live on just one project, and this is not often the case for large investors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/ea4/350/86dea43509af4afabc044681d5ad302b.jpg"><br><br>  To attract big players, you need to have a plan for at least a thematic product line.  Good preparation, presentation, contacts in the press significantly increase the chance for a successful crowdfunding campaign.  The popularity of social projects is also growing. <br><br>  <b>3. Growing Ecosystem</b> <br>  Around the world hackerspaces, coworking and all kinds of places for offline meetings are gaining immense popularity.  The number of meetings themselves is also growing rapidly: there are about 20 meetup groups in the world, which include about 1,000 people who meet regularly in person.  Centers of attraction: San Francisco, New York, London, Paris. <br>  At the end of 2014, there were more than 2,000 startup accelerators of various sizes and orientations worldwide.  However, most of them are software oriented, and hardware is often forgotten.  So for successful investment, hardware startups are advised to unite with colleagues from the programmer's camp, which will allow creating ready-made ecosystems with a unified interface and recognizable design. <br>  HAX identifies three types of startups depending on experience: <br><ul><li>  Beginners involved in the concept and prototypes. </li><li>  Experienced, whose task - to establish production and supply. </li><li>  Advanced.  They are engaged in logistics and cash flow. </li></ul><br>  The authors advise to take seriously the evolution of devices: in addition to combining with software companies, you should work towards compactness and optimizing the power supply of the device. <br><br>  <b>4. Lifestyle</b> <br>  "Smart iron" slowly fits into everyday life, and numerous smart watches (and indeed a whole class of wearable devices) confirm this.  Many people ignore the first generations of such devices, however, when the benefits become apparent, they become active users.  Wearable and smart gadgets spread to several areas in our life. <br><ul><li>  Companies tend to get away from the stereotype of ‚Äúdevices for geeks‚Äù - they create fashionable collections of watches, fitness bracelets and headphones.  Therefore, the gadget should look not only technologically, but also beautiful, confident in Xiaomi. </li><li>  In addition to fashion, manufacturers with might and main conquer the sports sector, not limited to the release of trackers and stopwatches (as it was a couple of years ago), but creating really comfortable gadgets for athletes. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c8/c59/13b/7c8c5913b8e8444fa2317f09038a78f6.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Do not bypass the side and your favorite pets: all kinds of activity monitors, feeders and devices for communicating with animals are becoming more and more popular. </li><li>  Non-cash payment technologies are evolving more and more rapidly: Apple is expanding its Apple Pay, additional devices are entering the market, allowing you to quickly use your credit card, various digital cardholders that simplify your life. </li><li>  Music is also popularized among engineers: for example, already today clever musical instruments, automatic tuners have been developed. </li></ul><br>  In general, trends show that smart devices, like in a science fiction film, are becoming stronger and stronger in our lives.  You just need not be afraid to experiment and offer the user to simplify any daily worries. <br><br>  <b>5. Health</b> <br>  Companies are increasingly uniting with scientific institutions and medical institutions to allow the user to monitor their own health and participate in the development of medicine.  Just look at the amount of investment on the slide below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/bfd/d04/05dbfdd04f7846af9ae7d609802c7226.jpg"><br><br>  <b>6. 3D printing</b> <br>  Modern 3D printers are divided into two types: <br><ul><li>  Using heat to heat plastic and give it the necessary shape. </li><li>  Stereolithographic, which using a laser beam cut out models from photoactive materials. </li></ul><br>  Today, the industry is developing faster than many others: printers are getting cheaper, they can print with a large number of materials, different colors, combinations of materials.  Gradually, 3D printers are really desktop.  Oh yeah, they are also used on the ISS. <br>  There are even new ‚Äúpens for printing‚Äù, whole desktops for sculptors, super-fast (10 times faster than normal models) combines.  The slide below shows only a part of the objects and industries for which you can print on a three-dimensional printer, but even this small part can surprise you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e2/7c8/113/7e27c8113d4c4d29a818f57f21b012b3.jpg"><br><br>  Today, a huge printer can print up to 10 simple (in terms of material and layout) homes per day.  Imagine what will be possible in two or three years?  Printing machine right in your home garage? <br><br>  <b>7. Smart home</b> <br>  Google has already taken the first steps in processing home data from various sensors, and is developing a system that can fully control your home by performing simple everyday tasks.  The world is waiting for a step from Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d4/949/e5f/5d4949e5f28c43a0a987334863ababfb.jpg"><br><br>  Today's smart homes themselves monitor the temperature, energy saving, fire safety, security in general.  Sensor kits allow users to control various systems using voice, from television to warming up the garage and car in the morning before going to work.  Lighting, climate control, cleaning - even a bed can be made for you today by robots. <br><br>  <i>The material was written by me for the project AIN.ua.</i>  <i>The original is <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/03/12/569355">here</a> .</i>  <i>The second part will be presented tomorrow.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377383/</a></p>
