Here is your iPad, here is your credit, get it - sign it, and stand in line for Success - the main value of modern Humanity!  If you get hungry on the way to Success, then have a snack with a Big Mac, drink Diet Coke and continue to work hard as next week your iPad will become irrelevant and you will probably need to purchase a new model.  Do not forget about your subscription to our fitness center, which will not allow you to fall apart halfway to Success.  Good luck! <br><br>  - This is how I would formulate a message that society brings to us every day.  We no longer need to think where we are going, the path is absolutely clear and illuminated with bright light bulbs - you need, by all means, to be Successful, and optionally the Best and Effective.  Now then, in the third millennium, it is not at all difficult, it is enough to set up a startup and not get up from the chair to become a rich movie character, with a mansion and a personal plane. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c94/7f2/7e0/c947f27e03ea812438bcd1a3859563d3.jpg">

      And if you distract from the world, drawn by public opinion and the media and look into the eyes of reality, we will see millions of people burning or already burned at work in a meaningless race for Success.  Competition, evolution?  Degradation!  Misinformation and delusion, sitting deep in their heads, fed by the monkey's desire to climb above all and envy.  A person in such a society is just a battery that cannot live for itself, fully convinced of the need to work effectively.  Moreover, the majority do not even have the opportunity to stop and think about everything - they are absorbed in work. <br><br>  We ourselves have instilled the fact that most of the life you need to work, that lack of time for your favorite activities is normal.  They instilled in that a lot of work is a blessing, and if in doubt, if you resist, then you need a MOTIVATION charge!  Moreover, people themselves are aware of the need to motivate themselves - ideal batteries.  Agree, it is rarely possible to sit with a clear conscience and relax, without the boring feeling ‚ÄúI have to do something!‚Äù.  The pursuit of success has become a new feature of the consumer society. <br><br>  Minimum communication with your loved ones is the key to success.  Our children and without us will be well brought up by a kindergarten and school! <br><br>  And for what is all this?  For the sake of a personal plane?  Golden Lamborgini?  New iPad?  Feelings of self-importance and superiority? <br><br>  I think these are not your values.  You may not go there. <br><br>  Why did it happen that we live for what we don‚Äôt need and deny ourselves our beloved - it happened so or this is a terrible conspiracy, I don‚Äôt know.  The only thing I know is that happiness from consumption is short-lived, and unhappiness, depression and fatigue are accompanied by a long majority of those who pursue success. <br><br>  We suffer from the fact that we can not afford any expensive thing.  We suffer from the fact that we are not as successful as we would like.  We work more for this and involve ourselves in the new suffering caused by the poor quality of such a busy life, lack of time for favorite activities and loved ones.  Life more and more resembles bigmak: bought, chewed and forgotten. <br><br>  And this has no end at any stage, no matter what you achieve and how you did not move forward - it will remain in your head and even when the desired Success comes to you, it will not be long, because the rules of this race do not provide for a finish and you will always want more.  Don't burn yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/336/3a8/46f/3363a846f3e32d28ebd6d0ddc3f48d23.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps you are going the wrong way, and a magical tomorrow, in which everything is good, will not come.  Perhaps this is not your way.  Someone else.  But not yours. <br><br>  Yours can be these six anti-GTD tips: <br><br>  1. There are many people around, but you should not look back at them, try to be like them.  Everyone passes his life path alone.  Follow it in such a way that happiness and peace will accompany you constantly. <br><br>  2. No need to live on hold.  It is infinite. <br><br>  3. Go on your way so that work strengthens your will and develops mastery, but is not the basis of your life. <br><br>  4. Make it clear for yourself that you truly love, and not something that you have been taught to love, and follow this. <br><br>  5. Improve, but do not try to be the best.  It does not need anyone. <br><br>  6. Be moderate in your desires.  Limit yourself within reasonable limits, fulfill your modest desires rather and be happy, and do not pursue more and more, because there is no end to it and next week the new iPad will definitely come out :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151280/</a></p>
