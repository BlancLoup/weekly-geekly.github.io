  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The domain zone .com is 30 years old</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The era of domains began back in 1985.  The first registered domain became symbolics.com, the record for which was created on March 15, 1985 and has not been deleted since.  It is this date that is considered the birthday of the .com domain.  To commemorate this event, we offer you a light Friday post about various interesting and strange things associated with domain names. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/044/c4a/137/044c4a137c3b493a9daaf583ea50a102.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first domain zones were .com, .net, .org, .edu, .mil, .gov, delegated as early as January 1, 1985, and in the same 1985, in February, the first geographical domain zones began to appear.  Domain registrations in those times were rare.  In 1985, only 6 .com, 1 .net and 1 .org domains were registered.  And the leader in registration has become .edu, in which over the year already 20 domains have been registered.  At the moment, these numbers seem ridiculous, now there are more domains registered in a minute than in the whole of 1985.  At the moment, it is estimated that there are about 285 million domains, of which 112 million (about 39%) are in .com.  And this is despite the fact that the number of domain zones managed to increase to 800, and this growth continues. <br><br>  Over the past 30 years, people have managed to do a lot of interesting, and sometimes just funny.  For example, many sources claim that all domains of the form aaa [..] aa.com are occupied for any allowable number of letters ‚Äúa‚Äù.  This information is persistently reprinted from one article about domain oddities to another, but I decided to check it myself.  And I have good news: you have the opportunity to join the a-community right now.  Domains with 28, 29, 31, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 47, <s>50</s> (could not resist), 51, 53, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61 are available for registration with the letters "a" in the zone .com , and in the .net zone - even more, almost everything, starting with 11 letters.  If you took any of these domains, post in the comments, brag.  On other domain facts, which you lacked in life, further in the text.

    <h4>  Useless statistics </h4><br>  The average length of the domain (the same useful indicator as the average temperature in the hospital) is 11 characters.  The most common first letter of the domains is s.  Perhaps because more words begin with this letter in English than with others.  The cheapest top-level domain is .tk, which you can register for free, the most expensive is the Nigeria domain .ng, for which you have to pay $ 40,000 per year. <br><br><h4>  New domain zones </h4><br>  Some consider them as one big oddity, others as compensation for the over-employment of the .com zone.  However, the fact remains.  If you run your eyes through the new zones, you can collect interesting statistics about those who support them, their goals, values, etc. <br><br><h5>  Zones for adults </h5><br>  One of the popular values, as always, remains the industry for adults, for which there are already at least 4 separate domains (.adult, .porn, .sexy, .xxx), and also sometimes the Sint Maarten geodomain .sx adapts.  According to one focused study, about 4% of the one million most popular sites belong to the adult industry, and about 13% among search queries.  In 2011, 2.5% of <b>all</b> Internet users visited one webcam resource at least once a month. <br><br><h5>  .sucks </h5><br>  Perhaps the most controversial domain zone, which has chosen a very interesting monetization policy.  Do you own a trademark and do not want at one point to see the domain of yourcompany.sucks on the Internet?  Pay $ 2499 during the sunrise period.  And then you can even create a website on it with a single phrase: ‚ÄúNo, it is not‚Äù.  However, the registry policy on trademarks is quite strict and will not save you from registering with yourcompanyreally.sucks or yourcompanytotally.sucks.  In the future, registration / renewal will cost $ 249.  But there will also be two special types of registration.  One will allow you to simply block the possibility of registering any domain for $ 199, the other - solely direct the domain to the appropriate forum thread on everything.sucks (only $ 9.95 per year).  The name of the site itself is curious.  One gets the impression that the ideological inspirers of the zone set themselves the goal of gathering under their wing all the terrible Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9e/1ef/de8/f9e1efde8e584d1bb196001cca242f9b.png"><br><br><h5>  New geographical areas </h5><br>  Los Angeles became the first city that found itself steep enough for its own domain zone.  At that time, new suffixes were not so widely practiced, but the initiative group of businessmen found a way out and took Lao‚Äôs geo domain, .la, which was actively positioned as the domain of the city.  But with the active introduction of additional suffixes, some cities and regions have decided that they are already large enough and adults for their own domain zones.  Among them: London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, New York, Sydney, Zurich, Moscow, Quebec and others. <br><br><h5>  Big and proud companies </h5><br>  Some companies have decided that they are also quite large and proud for their domain zones and are willing to pay $ 25,000 a year (about as much as maintaining their own suffix) for demonstrating their coolness.  And if I understand Google, Youtube or Yandex in this regard, then why is my domain name, for example, a Japanese company with the name Otsuka Pharmaceutical somewhat incongruous for a Russian ear, more difficult to understand.  But if they open a public registration, for sure the .otsuka domain will be able to become a competitor in the spaces of Runet .sucks. <br><br><h4>  Domain of a non-existent country </h4><br>  Of course, we all know him.  We are talking about the domain .su, which was delegated to the Soviet Union on 9/19/1990, and soon after that the union itself collapsed.  In most cases, in such situations, the domain will be separated over time (for example, this was the case with Yugoslavia and its .yu domain, which was blocked in 2008 and removed from the delegation in 2010).  But the domain .su for not very understandable reasons, fell in love with users.  At the moment there are more than 100 thousand domains.  The zone showed a steady growth until January 2014, and now it is approximately on the ‚Äúshelf‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/854/0e5/bde8540e59fc4796909e52e3a63ad139.png"><br><br><h4>  Measure length </h4><br>  Despite the love of the Germans and the Dutch to speak the whole sentence in one word, the village Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch in Wales has become the champion in the length of a one-word domain.  For those who have so many letters in their eyes from a number of letters, I will simplify the task: Llanvayrpullgvingilgogerykhverndrobullllantisilliyogogogogy.  From the Welsh, this big and beautiful word is translated as "St. Mary's Church in the hollow of white hazel near the turbulent maelstrom and the Church of St. Tisilio near the red cave."  The site itself can hardly be called very informative, but they are clearly proud of the length of the name: <a href="http://llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch.com/">llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch.com</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0d/444/9f6/c0d4449f614943ff997388d880e9d190.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Ahh effect </h4><br>  For its Ahh Effect campaign, Coca-Cola has acquired not only the ahh.com domain, but all other options with the number of letters ‚Äúh‚Äù up to 62 (the maximum length of the domain name).  Unlike aaaaa, on each of the domains there is a real separate site, all sites are different and are actively supported.  On some, it is possible to stick on for a while. <br><br><h4>  The most expensive domains </h4><br>  Many have heard of the sale of the domain sex.com for $ 13 million.  But this is by no means the most expensive domain in history.  In 2007, VacationRentals.com went under the hammer for 35 million evergreen presidents.  Other major purchases include fund.com for 15 million and insure.com for 14 million and others.  A total of 20 of the most expensive domain sales are pulling at $ 150 million. <br><br><h4>  The most voluminous registration </h4><br>  In April 2012, a single person registered 14,962 domains in a single day.  "Cybersquatter" - you shout and run after the pitchfork.  Yes, that is right.  And very greedy, as he himself admits.  However, this allows him to earn about 400 thousand dollars a month on domain sales, registering about 300 new domains per day.  Forks with a pitchfork, but domainering is a very difficult business, and the man clearly succeeded in it. <br><br><h4>  Domain Hacks </h4><br>  So called domains, which together with the suffix form a single word.  The first domain hacks were inter.net (11.23.1992) and pla.net (11.11.1997).  Since then, it has become a common practice, and some domain hacks have even been sold for good money.  Below are some examples. <br><ul><li>  youtu.be was purchased by our beloved YouTube </li><li>  goo.gl is used by Google to abbreviate addresses.  They own g.co </li><li>  In the domain zone .co, several domain hacks and downers are located at once: in addition to the mentioned g.co, e.co, a.co (Amazon), t.co (Twitter) are also used. </li><li>  Instagram previously used the domain instagr.am, but later went over to instagram.com </li><li>  whi.ch went to Which.co.uk for $ 21,840, answe.rs was sold to Answers.com for $ 20,000.  local.ly became the most expensive domain hack and was sold for $ 100,000 </li><li>  other lesser-known on our open spaces are khaki: bi.ng, pep.si, ti.me, blo.gs, po.st </li></ul><br><h4>  Just a bad choice. </h4><br>  There are a lot of articles on the Internet about how not to choose domains, with good examples.  Let these examples be an edification to all who plan to purchase a domain in the near future.  Often, the merging of words in a domain leads to a double meaning.  It can also lead to a completely different meaning of certain sound combinations in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(I already mentioned one of the examples above). <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.blackhatebook.com/">www.blackhatebook.com</a> - Black Hat eBook search engine book turns into racist Black Hate Book (black hatred book) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.apetit.com/">www.apetit.com</a> - the Finnish recipe site for English-speaking users will look like Ape Tit, which in a very literary translation would mean ‚Äúchest of higher primate‚Äù </li><li>  <a href="http://www.hollandshitfestival.nl/">www.hollandshitfestival.nl</a> is quite a <a href="http://www.hollandshitfestival.nl/">massive</a> Holland's Hit Festival event, but it can raise the question of what kind of Holland Shit Festival is, and what are they doing there in their Holland? </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mp3shits.com/">www.mp3shits.com</a> - could become a haven for true fans of lossless formats </li><li>  <a href="http://www.whorepresents.com/">www.whorepresents.com</a> - whoRepresents? com directory.  But if, again, to break in a different way, you get a great name for an adult site. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.therapistfinder.com/">www.therapistfinder.com</a> - an even more noble site to search for therapists with a certain alignment of spaces will turn into a search for rapists.  Has it become too boring and calm at night in your area?  Visit TheRapistFinder.com. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/852/345/b01/852345b01f94446d84672a27917d5c0b.jpg"><br><br>  All with a holiday, with Friday, and thank you domains for the fact that they are. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253501/</a></p>
