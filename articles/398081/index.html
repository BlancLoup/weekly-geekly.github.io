WHO calls stress a health epidemic.  Constantly experiencing stress, a person becomes susceptible to cardiovascular diseases, obesity, various types of diabetes, and cancer.  In the United States alone, about 120,000 people of working age die every year due to stress. <br><br>  The problem is most likely how we work.  Now that Internet technology has become available worldwide, we are all the time online.  Smartphones make us available to colleagues, friends and acquaintances 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Day and night we are online, on weekends and during work hours.  Technologies make our life more convenient, but at the same time, the same technologies have complicated everything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The need to be constantly in touch begins to cause any person.  Office workers, Internet investors, financiers - many people need to be online day and night.  And this affects the quality of life, reduces the amount of time that can be spent on communication with family and friends.  Psychologists, and just with the Internet geeks with experience recommend sometimes completely disconnect from the network.  Telephone, Internet - all this should be periodically disconnected for a while.

      Roy Hessel decided to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/every-week-i-unplug-from-technology-for-24-hours-and-im-convinced-it-makes-me-better-at-my-job-2016-9%3FIR%3DT">try</a> this solution on himself.  Once a week, he made it a rule to disconnect from online life, completely switching to offline.  Time spent offline, Roy began to call the "blackout."  Why all this?  To fully relax.  Communication with the outside world on vacation is wrong.  Someone will write, call, ask for something urgent to do.  And normal rest does not work. <br><br>  When Hessel comes home, or the weekend comes, he tries to plunge into family life as much as possible.  Once a week it is disconnected from the entire outside world completely.  But even on ordinary days, when he and his family return home, Roy tries not to work and not to touch on work issues.  In this case, only the situation of ‚Äúlife and death‚Äù can return it to work, when something happens so important that it is impossible to ignore this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.  Yes, at first it is difficult, but gradually a person gets used to rest, and not to work in his free time. <br><br>  Roy Hessel is not the only one who decided to go offline sometimes.  Many representatives of the IT sector are regularly disconnected in order to take a break from eternal commotion to be able to relax.  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Richard Branson, and their colleagues all go offline. <br><br>  As already mentioned, you need to disconnect not only the Internet, but also the telephone.  The more devices near you, the more you have to be distracted.  What about the stock price?  Did the boss send a new task or comment to the work already done?  And what will the weather be like tomorrow, during an important outdoor meeting?  These and other questions will distract from the rest, because to get an answer to any of them you need internet and a telephone. <br><br>  By the way, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581">stress</a> is not a nervous tension or emotional excitement.  This is, in fact, a universal physiological response to strong effects.  And she has certain symptoms and phases.  The same psychological stress is stress due to social factors.  Probably, among them are social factors related to virtual reality. <br><br>  The average person spends about 11 hours a day at the computer, using also a tablet or smartphone.  In many cases, all of this electronics just eat up the time.  A person gets used to distractions, it becomes more difficult for him to concentrate on the main tasks.  The effectiveness of the work done falls, permanent fatigue, irritation and dissatisfaction with oneself (work, others, etc.) appear.  The more devices you can turn off, the better.  Computers, laptop, TV, tablet, portable gadgets of another kind - all this should be turned off. <br><br>  The lack of connected gadgets allows you to read a book, talk with friends or simply reflect. <br><br>  Some people are so hard to divide work and rest, that they are forced to present their "I" as two separate people.  So does, for example, David Brooks, a New York Times journalist and author of <a href="http://theroadtocharacter.com/">The Road to Character</a> .  He has to be "Adam 1" at work and "Adam 2" on vacation and with his family.  This already seems a bit like a split personality, although a completely healthy person works with such a scheme.  So it is easier for him to concentrate on work and fully relax.  What Adam 1 does does not concern Adam 2 at all, and vice versa. <br><br>  In general, there are several rules of effective rest, which should be followed.  Here they are: <br><br>  <strong>For a good rest you need to change the type of activity.</strong>  Such advice can be called scathing.  His lead very often.  But this is because it is really effective.  If your job is to use a PC and a phone, you need to do something else to relax.  Routine needs to be diluted, otherwise the hours and days will fly past, without bringing pleasure and joy.  A change of activity can be anything from sports to archeology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f1/2dc/9e7/6f12dc9e762a15be66607e4d52635986.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  <strong>You can not ignore the rest.</strong>  No matter how energetic a person you are, you need to work in such a way that it will not be painfully painful later.  Sometimes it‚Äôs worthwhile to get away from an important project to give a break to the brain.  Workaholysis is good only up to a certain measure.  If you overdo it, then work efficiency will only fall. <br><br>  <strong>Once a week - we rest from everything.</strong>  Roy gave the right advice, which coincides with the recommendations of experts.  Once a week, you should rest for a whole day, turning off all your gadgets. <br><br>  <strong>We share personal life and work.</strong>  Well, everything is also simple here - it‚Äôs not worth living 24 hours a day.  Initially, it may be interesting, but then, when you become a habit, you just forget how to relax.  Business - time, fun - an hour.  That's right. <br><br>  Without a doubt, each person has his own rules regarding rest.  Perhaps you can share this information with readers in the comments?  Here every advice will be helpful.  Swarming, for example, shutting down for 24 hours a week from the Network and communications helps to be happier.  What helps you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398081/</a></p>
