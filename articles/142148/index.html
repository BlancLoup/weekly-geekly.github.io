      <a href="http://www.digium.com/en/training/certifications/">dCAA</a> (Digium Certified Asterisk Administrator) - this exam can be passed to anyone who has read <a href="http://www.asteriskdocs.org/">Asterisk: The Definitive Guide</a> , passed Asterisk Essentials or Asterisk Fast Start.  The exam can be taken online after registration.  I advise you to enter all registration data correctly, because  After passing the exam, you will receive a certificate in PDF. <br>  <a href="http://www.digium.com/en/training/certifications/">dCAP</a> (Digium-Certified Asterisk Professional) - recommended to take after Asterisk Advanced.  This certificate has a unique number and will come to you by mail directly from DIGIUM. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My turn has come.  With the very first group that took the courses, I went to take dCAP.  I was not on the courses, I decided to immediately take the exam, the benefit is not all of the students passed dCAP, and there were a couple of empty seats.  Alexander (the teacher) first told us about the rules for passing exams and gave us practical tasks.  We have included workstations.  And from 14:30 to 16:00, everyone stuck into the monitors; in the classroom, you could only hear a knock on the keyboard and occasionally calls on IP phones.  The task was simple in essence: set up a couple of SIP accounts, a simple IVR, a queue, SIP and DAHDI trunks and voice mail.  But none of us expected that an hour and a half would be so little for this, and as a result, when Alexander announced that 45 minutes were left, everyone gasped.  There was a feeling that it was not 45 minutes but 10. They were still more focused and started frantically checking and testing their settings, everyone called softphones and IP phones ... At 16:00, everything calmed down and we went for a smoke break where, of course, we discussed what did what he did and what did not. <br><br>  The time has come to pass the theory ... Alexander distributed to all the new batch of questions and spoke about the rules for conducting the theoretical part of the exam.  At 16:15 the start was given.  In front of us we had 115 questions printed out on A4 sheets, a pen and nothing more.  No internet, no notebooks, nothing!  It took me about 30 minutes.  to answer all the questions, but in order not to embarrass the others (I didn‚Äôt go through Asterisk Advanced), I waited another 15 minutes before returning my work.  But here I was wrong.  I was too hasty and too self-confident :) as a result, I passed the theory only by 74%, and in order to pass, you need to score at least 75%! <br><br>  To not give up! <br><br>  I do not like to give up and in a month I was preparing to hand over dCAP again, this time I had to pass only theory.  DIGIUM has a rule: if you pass one of the two exams, then during the year you can pass only the one that failed.  With a half of the new group on the Asterisk Advanced course, I was already (virtually) familiar, and within a week I went to them after the courses to talk about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/122858/">Switchvox from DIGIUM</a> and about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139250/">KIRK</a> systems.  On Friday, I came back to take dCAP again, and it turned out that I was the only one who ever rents him out of this group.  This time I didn‚Äôt hurry, I even re-read <a href="http://www.asteriskdocs.org/">Asterisk: The Definitive Guide</a> before the exam.  As a result, scored 83% and received a well-deserved and long-awaited dCAP! <br><br>  Citizens Asteriskers with dCAP certificate, I would like to meet you all personally.  Call out please! <br><br>  Citizens Asterists without a dCAP certificate, you already know where and how this can be done!  Wish you luck!!! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142148/</a></p>
