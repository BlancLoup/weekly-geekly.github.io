      - User experience. <br><br>  - <strong>Aesthetic and usability of the</strong> device. <br><br>  - <strong>Possible</strong> (technologically) product <strong>release date</strong> . <br><br></blockquote><br>  This year, participants are designing devices that respond to one simple idea: designing devices that "help people do what they are passionate about."  This means that most devices are designed for: artists, designers, architects, programmers, and "just" developers. <br><br>  An open vote has already been completed, and the results must be announced within this month.  And even if we, the Internet users, do not have the opportunity to participate in the voting - most of the devices undoubtedly deserve thousands of curious views.  And right now you have the opportunity to gaze at some of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152097.jpg" width="450" height="298" title="palette" alt="palette"><br><br>  This device, with the speaking name <strong>Palette</strong> (Palette) is intended primarily for digital artists, designers (in the original, this vital title sounds like: ‚Äúdesign visualizer‚Äù, which literally can be translated as ‚Äúa specialist in design visualization‚Äù), and simply artistic geeks.  The device was designed on the basis of palettes that were used by masters several centuries before us.  In addition, a similar implementation of the palette carries a positive psychological charge - it is not at all the same with the selection of colors in Photoshop or the design in Fireworks. <br><br>  The palette, according to the creators, should be connected to a computer, monitor or other peripheral devices.  This connection is, of course, wireless, and the surface of the Palette uses a photo-optical visualization sensor with color recognition. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152202.jpg" width="450" height="337" title="personal computer" alt="personal computer"><br><br>  But this invention cannot be called a ‚Äúdevice‚Äù for one simple reason - it is a harmonious combination of high-tech devices. <br><br>  The biometric fingerprint scanner recognizes an authorized user and provides him with a workspace, with all saved files and settings, which, however, is not surprising.  But as an additional option it is possible to include a voice recognition program, with a huge library of saved commands.  After access has been received, laser technology using thin (in fractions of a millimeter) rays will display a two- and three-dimensional image of the highest resolution and color quality on two displays.  An excellent solution for designers of any profile. <br><br>  The high-power music system built into the ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù will add a sense of realism when working with any type of file.  Since the image itself is not limited to the display frames, because it simply does not exist, the diagonal can be varied from 15 to 24 inches, and the maximum viewing angle is up to 80 degrees.  All this is done by adjusting the rotation and power of the very columns between which the image appears. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152264.jpg" width="450" height="332" title="trvl" alt="trvl"><br><br>  This device, called <strong>TRVL</strong> (from travel - travel) - the concept of a personal computer for travelers, which will help to strengthen and easily capture any of your impressions.  This computer has everything that can be useful to almost anyone on the road, the main functions are: <br><br>  1. <strong>Maps</strong> with GPS navigation. <br>  2. A <strong>tourist guide</strong> is an opportunity that any tourist will appreciate. <br>  3. <strong><strong>Keeping</strong></strong> notes and schedules. <br>  4. <strong>Videophone</strong> . <br>  5. Built-in <strong>photo / video camera</strong> . <br><br>  Indeed, innovation of all this can perhaps be called an electronic guide-navigator.  The very same novelty lies in the fact that the computer shows information about the surrounding area on a transparent display, which means that the user will receive information looking through it at any object in view.  This method is much faster and more efficient than using a standard, paper, map or navigation system, for example, a smartphone. <br><br>  With <strong>TRVL,</strong> people will travel easily, efficiently and as interestingly as possible. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152366.jpg" width="450" height="335" title="dna computer" alt="dna computer"><br><br>  The purpose of this device, called <strong>DNA</strong> , according to the creators, is to provide the user with a fully configurable and customizable personal computer, giving freedom of form, style and mobility. <br><br>  One of the modules is the core of the system, which has outputs from all planes, allowing the user to connect devices at his will from any position.  In addition to the main module, there are three more: the projector, keyboard and power supply. <br><br>  Other modules, which, apparently, will be a great many, will be available additionally for a separate amount and in accordance with the requests. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152448.jpg" width="450" height="335" title="flux" alt="flux"><br><br>  This ‚Äúcreation‚Äù is without a doubt a practical breakthrough at the presentation level of a mobile personal computer.  The device is called <strong>Flux</strong> . <br><br>  The innovative form and design, the method of entering and storing information make this device really compact, adaptive and fashionable.  The entire system is based on a dressing bracelet that communicates wirelessly with a portable display.  The bracelet stores information, while the display provides a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãviewing files (yes, anything), and connecting multimedia devices.  The monitor is needed when you need to view an enlarged image or access the control interface. <br><br>  The entire system can be connected to other computers via wireless communication, although which protocol will be preferred is a big question. <br><br>  Among other things - the display is very economical in energy consumption, made on the basis of touchscreen technology from nature-friendly materials.  The bracelet itself is individually customizable, and can be made from any material to your choice.  Here, the calculation is, of course, not only for the average user, but also fans of boasts. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152582.jpg" width="450" height="336" title="momenta" alt="momenta"><br><br>  Momenta (Momenta) - this is a personal computer, worn in the form of a bracelet around the neck, will also help to capture the brightest moments of life.  While everyone around is laughing to tears from a successful joke, someone says, ‚ÄúIt was necessary to record‚Äù - the previous 5 minutes of video and audio recording are already in the buffer of the Moment and it continues recording until the user will say stop recording. <br><br>  Turns on the recording mode is also an interesting way - the computer determines the frequency of the heartbeat of its owner and is included in the moments of enhanced experiences, which could sink into oblivion, leaving no traces.  Whether it is an interesting sporting event, a scene from life, some kind of incident - it does not matter, a moment will help you save and share it. <br><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1210152630.jpg" width="450" height="336" title="ZENPC" alt="ZENPC"><br><br>  Another interesting development, called <strong>ZEN</strong> is designed to help, first of all, people with impaired visual capabilities. <br><br>  By itself, it is a mixture of software and the latest technology, called <strong>Sandbox PC</strong> , which can be translated as ‚Äúcomputer-box with sand‚Äù.  The analogy with the box is poorly visible, but the ‚Äúsand‚Äù component is indeed present.  Together with a specially developed software, this system allows you to use the computer environment with closed eyes. <br><br>  Innovation ZEN is enclosed in its very name, which stands for " <strong>Z-axis Enabled</strong> " and this is a truly interactive three-dimensional software environment.  This is not just a dirty finger on your monitor;  ZEN uses Active Surface technology (active surface) - an electronic surface that can take different forms and be controlled by the user.  It is possible to read Braille texts (perforated surface for the blind), to build working windows, icons and various textures.  It can be pressed or scratched.  All interaction between the user and the computer is made precisely through tactile control. <br><br>  People with limited visual abilities are currently almost completely unable to use a personal computer, and ZEN gives them that opportunity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24951/</a></p>
