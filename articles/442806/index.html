And in what tasks of analyzing interrelations between variables cannot be avoided? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/ey/jc/tfeyjcugrbuwlkgbw4qcyftmhgm.jpeg" width="110" height="110" align="left">  <b>Igor Mamai (Contour)</b> will tell the necessary minimum for understanding quantum algorithms, consider the physical principles that make quantum computing possible, introduce the mathematical model, explain what a qubit is and what operations it is possible to perform on it.  And Igor will analyze a simple algorithm that demonstrates the advantage of quantum computing over classical ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/f-/j_/7bf-j_nn34zjjaraa9qonsfz0ic.jpeg" width="110" height="110" align="left">  <b>Nikolai Kuklin (Ceramic 3D)</b> will share his image smoothing algorithm and how to implement it on the GPU.  This is a real working implementation in a commercial program, which allowed rendering a high-quality image into a virtual reality helmet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z9/ic/wu/z9icwuzklhrg9y3ceh_lqbx66ra.jpeg" width="110" height="110" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/lx/wy/kulxwydivkvnomwq3gywvqqzsqu.jpeg" width="110" height="110" align="left">  The developers at <b>Tinkoff.ru, Vladislav Blinov</b> and <b>Valeriy Baranov</b> , will understand the chatbot as an example, when you need to implement a state-of-the-art scientific article, in which cases you can do with logistic regression, and when it is better to recall the good old prefix tree. <br><br>  This is not all.
