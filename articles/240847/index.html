For example, this question: <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff9/a3d/724/ff9a3d724a5a6564a18a876c70e8a08a.png"><br>  Which of these animals to choose as a greeting card?  Or, to give solidity: Which of these two logos will bring the success of a transnational corporation with a turnover of 3 billion euros? <br><br></blockquote><br>  The question itself is not complicated, sometimes even obvious.  But it is necessary to formulate the right answer when the board of directors or own doubts demand it.  There may be difficulties in trying to prove your intuitive solution.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Prove that you were wrong </h2>  This is a simple and effective way to prove why the obvious (for you) answer will be the right decision (for all). <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/8db/d9a/b658dbd9a0eab21932f6ba48a641e972.png"><br>  The year of the sheep is approaching and on the greeting card the sheep will be gorgeous!  It is logical!  (or not) </blockquote><br>  In business disputes, I myself and my opponents more often instinctively prove their case, than they accept the arguments of the interlocutor.  Therefore, logical arguments do not always help to make a decision.  And even more, in 99% of cases, all those who argue are right.  You can get fan from the negotiation process, but personally I feel sorry for wasting too much time. <br><br>  To reduce the time - it is possible with the same perseverance and zeal to prove that I was wrong.  The bonus is that finding an error is much easier than proving its absence. <br><br><h2>  The simplest test for finding errors </h2><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/bbf/6a8/2b4bbf6a8bb157eae640ebe78fe79617.png"><br>  Key test questions: Why am I wrong?  What now?  And an effective panda coming method (actually PANDAN, but panda is funnier). </blockquote><br><h3>  Why am I wrong? </h3>  I love this question very much!  It turns into a beautiful puzzle from the series ‚ÄúUnder what conditions, the obvious X is not true.‚Äù  In the case of the beasts, it can be assumed that the recipients of the cards will think that they were called sheep and offended (I saw it with my own eyes a couple of times).  But this is not my problem. <br><br>  Giving the puzzle at least five minutes of time, you can laugh a little and stretch your brains.  And as a maximum - to find a huge omission in their calculations and in time to correct the error. <br><br>  When you don‚Äôt want to answer the question with logic, you can pass an emotional test.  Grasp your head and ask yourself as sincerely as possible: ‚ÄúWell, why ?!  Why am I so mistaken with this sheep ?! ‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  What now? </h3>  Put yourself in a situation: you thought of everything and did it right, but you still made a mistake.  The reason is not important.  It is important that you do right now in this situation? <br><br>  The answer is also not important. <br><br><h3>  Coming panda </h3>  When all the key questions have been considered and the initial decision has not found any criticism, then you can safely return to work.  The test for the absence of errors passed. <br><br>  But if, despite all the efforts, doubts remained (with you or with the board of directors), congratulations, a panda came to you. <br><br>  She is all so inadequate and tells you inadequate things.  Perhaps contrary to the very logic of the project and the business as a whole.  Perhaps related to your personal complexes and preferences.  Perhaps the panda is just dancing. <br><br>  If in doubt, dance with the panda and do as she says.  And then there will be no doubt, it is logical! <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2>  It is said more than enough.  Finding mistakes is easier than proving their lack.  Using this axiom, you can increase the effectiveness of planning.  Above was a little blablabla, funny pictures and enticing title.  Good luck with the solutions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240847/</a></p>
