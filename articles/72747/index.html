I was not sure that it was a presentation from Nokia, Symbian, Maemo or anything else.  This is a kind of clipart, taken as a template. <br><br>  Honestly, I could not decide which interface to use for this phone.  So, using the search engine, I found photos of the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.  This is a fairly modern phone, although it works on an outdated Maemo 4. A welcome phone, but with an outdated user interface !?  I didn't care ... some of you noticed a trick here. <br><br><h5>  Start </h5><br>  The story began with a simple message on my twitter in early September. <br>  A simple message: "Nokia is similar to the IPhone, [Link to image]."  (9th of September) <br>  That's all!

      For several weeks, the message remained unread, and I thought that nothing would change.  But I was wrong ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  39 days later </h5><br>  On October 15, the mysterious phone caused quite a stir when a Chinese website put the title ‚ÄúDetails about the Nokia N920‚Äù.  They proved their theory using my photos and adding their specifications, hehe. <br>  For a short period, the news spread all over the world.  Many editors added new incorrect information. <br><br>  I have never published the characteristics of a fictional phone.  In addition, I have never claimed that this is the Nokia 920. It was just a picture on Twitter that began to show off in the headlines around the world. <br><br>  Did I want to play a trick on you? <br>  Of course not!  If I wanted to do this, I would have posted the picture myself on various Internet resources and contributed to the spread of this news.  But I did not do this. <br>  I try to keep the notion of NokiaPort.de as a serious and reliable source as possible.  That's why I decided to shed some light on this issue. <br><h4>  I just posted a picture, you did the rest! </h4><br><h5>  Thank </h5><br>  All those who found a catch in my picture: this is a screenshot of the old interface.  Your doubts are justified.  Unfortunately, you have not convinced others in a series of discussions. <br><br><h5>  Thank you very much </h5><br>  the guy who posted photos of the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.  Also, thank you very much for the comments that were present in different discussions: <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe photo looks pretty realistic.‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚Äúpretty big device‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ "... it looks too good to be untrue." <br>  For me, this means that I work very well in Photoshop. <br><br><h5>  I'm sorry </h5><br>  all editors who participated and spent their time writing articles, the press service of Nokia probably received several calls on this issue and all enthusiasts who are probably very disappointed now. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I liked everything :-) <br><br>  Sincerely, [ExiTuS], NokiaPort.de <br><br>  PS Have you seen the Nokia N920 image search results on Google?  What have you done?  :-) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26b/a48/ded/26ba48ded04db149f18798f147b2e29a.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72747/</a></p>
