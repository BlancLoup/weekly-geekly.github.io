These differences also fall on the software tools for working with EGAIS, which we encountered when integrating our <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">software for TSD</a> into industry commodity accounting systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x5/zf/zw/x5zfzwxnkftyqpydcp-zqpkoxis.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Operations, accounting processes and documents in the wholesale and retail have differences. </h2><br>  For a start, I want to sprinkle ashes on my head, and admit that we underestimated this problem.  Our focus on the integration of the <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-skanport/DataMobile-EGAIS/">DataMobile EGAIS software</a> into various commodity counts fell on the retail processes of the alcohol metering meter.  We did these integrations quickly and were ready for the demand of our alcohol drinkers for a mobile automated solution ahead of time.  Our software is positioned as a ready-made solution for USAIS, which was hoped by one of our customers - an alcoholic wholesaler.  To be fair, it‚Äôs worth noting that our wholesaler didn‚Äôt pay attention to the differences between retail business processes and wholesale ones, bought data collection terminals and installed our licenses, installed, connected and only then realized that the wholesale functionality when exchanging mobile software data with accounting is clearly not enough.

      Now we are working on updating DataMobile  for the wholesale segment of the alcohol market, and we will definitely write about what we have implemented as a result.  We do this in cooperation with three alcohol manufacturers, who kindly advise us, so that our product takes into account all the "life" situations that are present in the wholesaler's everyday life in connection with EGAIS 3.0. <br><br>  Why are we writing this article now?  When we faced the problem of our wholesalers, we were together with them to monitor the market of mobile (and not only) software solutions and realized that such an ‚Äúambush‚Äù can be expected by many alcoholics if they do not take into account the nuances that distinguish their activities from retail processes.  Therefore, choosing an automated solution for accounting for  3.0, they should know about these nuances now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dv/63/fr/dv63fra663kp3qejnfgaft_uqlu.png"><br><br><h2>  Brief background of the introduction of the Unified State Automated Information System 3.0. </h2><br>  On 30.06.2017, on <a href="http://www.fsrar.ru/">the FSRAR website, it was</a> announced that electronic diagrams of version 3 documents became available in the personal account of the egais.ru portal, in the ‚Äútest transport module‚Äù section. Published diagrams and descriptions can be used to adapt their accounting systems to use the new format. <br><br>  Initially, the introduction of EGAIS for the accounting of alcoholic products began with the control of the wholesale level (manufacturers and importers), because the main goal was to track the turnover of large quantities of alcohol.  Wholesalers received excise stamps for a lot at once in series or code ranges.  It is under this account of such ranges of excise stamps that the data structure of the USIS system has been adapted.  It was important for the state to understand that the plant produced a certain number of bottles, excise stamps were pasted on them with numbers in the range equal to the number of units issued. <br><br>  Further, the retail link had to be connected to the already operating wholesale USIS. <br>  To make a single, and at the same time convenient, system for wholesale and retail, somehow did not happen.  Retail, by virtue of its specificity, cannot work with code ranges, and wholesalers cannot afford to mark the metering of each bottle when shipping products by wagons. <br><br>  Creating two independent alcohol accounting systems for wholesalers and for retailers that require data synchronization between these systems is not a lordly business.  Therefore, the treatment of this proctological disease is proposed to engage the entrepreneurs themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ay/tp/x-/aytpx-lbit_v5evdj3vxji3v58m.png"><br><br>  In the format of the EGAIS version 3 documents, there is a requirement that each receipt document contains a complete list of specific excise stamps that move from the wholesaler to retail.  Those.   ceases to operate with ranges of excise stamps and will start working with each specific stamp.  And if for retail this innovation practically doesn‚Äôt threaten anything, it has dealt with scanning and taking into account each bottle before (even on the contrary, with EGAIS 3.0, SLRs and other misunderstandings should stop), then for wholesalers the new version requires preparation and re-automation of most accounting processes. <br><br><h2>  Differences  3.0 in wholesale and retail. </h2><br>  So, let's consider what threatens the new order of work for those and other business representatives.  To do this, let's see which business processes associated with the mark accounting are assumed in the retail store, and which ones are the wholesale distributor of alcoholic beverages. <br><br><h3>  <u>Business processes of alcohol retail:</u> </h3><br><ul><li>  small periodic alcohol intakes that can be checked by the bottle </li><li>  processes of inventory and stamping on the 3rd register of accounting of the Unified State Automated Information System </li><li>  retail sales (but cash register software and <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/skanery-dlya-egais/">barcode scanner are</a> already included) </li></ul><br><h3>  <u>Business processes of the alcohol wholesale organization:</u> </h3><br><ul><li>  large acceptance of alcohol (pallets, waggons, etc.) which verification is almost impossible to perform </li><li>  processes of inventory and stamping on the 3rd register of accounting Unified State Automated Information System </li><li>  product withdrawal, relocation and return of products </li><li>  aggregation of stamps during repacking, with printing of labels of new group packages </li><li>  large shipments of alcohol, using group packaging, as well as testing batches of products </li></ul><br>  Naturally, all the processes of movement of alcohol products are reflected in specialized documents in 1C in both cases, but, due to the specificity, the configurations of 1C themselves differ for different business processes.  For example, retail configurations such as, Dalion PRO / UNO, Tavern Head Office / Management, TREND, Shtrikh-M: Trading enterprise, 1: Retail, have EGAIS documents that allow you to execute retail business processes.  It does not provide for accounting, for example, group packaging and repackaging processes.  In some of them it is possible to keep records of shipments and returns of alcohol positions, but this will also be in the minimum version, with a blot work and without partion. <br><blockquote>  And here it is important!  Choosing mobile software for TSD and work with , which is supposed to be integrated into the product accounting system, the wholesaler should find out from the developer with which documents his mobile EGAIS program works by default.  In the case of our wholesale client, who was satisfied only with the description of the functions of our mobile client and, with the purchase, did not take into account the differences between the retail and wholesale processes - this is where we stumbled. </blockquote>  As for the wholesale configurations of 1C, such as for example specialized configurations from the company KT Alcohol (KT 2000): Distillery and winery (Distillery), Management of trade in alcoholic products (UTAP 10 and 11), Integrated automation of trade in alcoholic products (CATAP 1 and 2) then they have everything necessary for the work of wholesale organizations.  In addition to all sorts of reports and declarations, they are necessary for work, they also have mechanisms for accounting for group packages, maintaining accounting registers for them, with the possibility of repacking products, checking acceptance and fixing shipments also by group packaging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/lg/jn/ttlgjnadtg4urteajs5tzuasdgw.png"><br><br>  If a wholesaler has one of these industry-specific systems, or some other (self-rewritten and adapted configuration), and even if he sees one of these inventory records in the list of mobile client compatibility in the list, it‚Äôs still worth getting detailed advice from the developer on all data exchange circuits required for wholesale operations with alcohol, taking into account the batch work. <br><br>  Separately, it should be noted that, until recently, there was no certainty on the very principles of labeling group packages, but recently various options were proposed and a <a href="http://egais.ru/news/view%3Fid%3D1541">vote was launched</a> by the PAP <a href="http://egais.ru/news/view%3Fid%3D1541">.</a> <br>  It is noteworthy that EGAIS 3.0 started on March 15, 2018, and the proposal to vote was received on March 30, 2018.  At the moment, the <a href="http://egais.ru/files/format_tara2.pdf">next option</a> is leading, which apparently will be taken as a basis. <br><br><h2>  In custody </h2><br>  We urge the wholesalers of the alcohol market to carefully and carefully approach the choice of software for data collection terminals.  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">Our DataMobile software</a> has open exchange formats and can be used in any business process of an organization, including when working with non-1C systems, as well as using its own work algorithms, thanks to parametric tuning.  However, we are in the process of developing a version for blot accounting in the wholesale trade of alcohol, so that our customers do not need to ‚Äúcut‚Äù standard wholesale processes on their own.  We already have a wholesale focus group that advises us, but we will welcome all the recommendations from the representatives of this segment.  One head is good, and ten is even better - and our mission is to help businesses solve their problems with the most simple and convenient automation tools.  If you have something to say on this topic, please write to us in the comments or on e-mail (507@Scanport.ru), we will be grateful for your ideas and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354016/</a></p>
