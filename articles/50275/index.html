      In the course of the project, the I-2 group of the specialization <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/about.html">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù</a> under the supervision of experts and practitioners in the field of Internet marketing will conduct several advertising campaigns to promote the site.  The competition moment of the competition is that to solve the problem the group will be divided into several teams, each of which will conduct its own campaign independently.  After the project is completed, the effectiveness of each campaign will be evaluated. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the beginning of the meeting, the head of the specialization briefly told about the conditions of the competition, the timing of the completion of its main stages and presented the meeting participants.  Intrigued by the audience, however, she did not go into details, leaving the description of the details of the project to representatives of KupiVIP.ru. <br><br>  KupiVIP Shopping Club was represented by its General Director Oscar Hartmann and PR Director Julian Kaspranova.  In addition, David Warrowyer, head of the investment fund Mangrove Capital Partners (one of the main investors of the shopping club), was also present at the meeting. <br><br>  Juliana Kaspranova told about the features of the project KupiVIP.ru, which will be promoted by the audience. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe‚Äú shopping club ‚Äùmodel is new for Russia, so I would like to achieve a clear understanding of the concept.  KupiVIP is not a standard online store, it is a club that is received by the invitation of an already registered member or by a special secret code that allows you to access the shopping club.  Of course, there is an opportunity to ‚Äúcast a bait‚Äù by yourself - write about your desire to become a member of the club directly on the site KupiVIP.ru.  But in this case, those who are already members of the club have the opportunity to block your candidacy for any reason.  It is important to understand that within our shopping club we are trying to create not only a place for shopping, but also a whole information space for people who follow style and fashion. ‚Äù <br><br>  Oscar Hartmann, speaking after Juliana, briefly focused on the history of such projects, the prospects for their development and a description of the project to promote. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe first such project appeared in France.  Now he is considered one of the most successful Internet projects.  In general, in Europe and America, such communities are very common and popular.  Therefore, we clearly represent the goal to which we aspire.  And I am sure that after some time, such shopping clubs will become a real social phenomenon in Russia, which has a huge potential for the development of the luxury market - Russians are one of the biggest connoisseurs of brands in the world. <br><br>  Why is the model of shopping clubs is attractive?  I would say with our slogan: ‚Äúexclusive brands at club prices‚Äù.  Collections of famous world brands in KupiVIP.ru can be purchased with significant discounts, while the whole product is genuine, as the shoppers of the shopping club work directly with major brand suppliers.  At this stage of development of the KupiVIP.ru shopping club, it is important for us to attract as many new members as possible, and we are waiting for creative ideas from you to attract customers to the site. <br><br>  To do this, the group will be divided into several project teams, each of which will be allocated a budget of <b>200 thousand rubles</b> for an advertising campaign.  The winner will be the team that in two months will attract the largest number of registrations.  All members of this team will receive an iPhone, and the campaign they have started will be continued with a large investment.  We will pay attention to the successful ideas of other teams, which will also be awarded. " <br><br>  After many clarifying questions to the organizers, the group split into six project teams.  Internet marketing professionals, such as Vitaly Bykov (creative director of <a href="http://redkeds.ru/">Red Keds Creative Agency</a> ), Vasily Lebedev (head of the interactive department of Red Keds Creative Agency), Nikolai Mityushin (director of investment venture fund <a href="http://abrtfund.com/rus/">ABRT</a> ), Sonia Sokolova (portal CEO <a href="http://soundkey.ru/">Soundkey.ru</a> , chief editor <a href="http://www.zvuki.ru/">Zvuki.ru</a> ) Ekaterina Tikhonova (head WOM advertising agency), Tatiana Tsvetkova (Director of marketing and PR company <a href="http://www.softkey.ru/">Softkey</a> ), Dmitry Stepan  in (project executive director of the <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">"Bill the Digital¬ª</a> ).  The meeting ended with a discussion within each team of a campaign promotion strategy and a subsequent series of clarifying questions from a representative of KupiVIP.ru. <br><br>  The project is running.  We will follow it and wait for the results! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50275/</a></p>
