Search / analysis / comparison / selection of programs </h3><br>  After making a decision, you must determine who you want to do.  In the states, future undergraduates are free to choose a specialty, <u>regardless of the bachelor's degree</u> .  However, do not be in a hurry to rejoice: in this case it is almost impossible to obtain financing.  You can save only experience in the related field.

      So, who should the 4th year student of the VTIPO specialty do for two years of working as a programmer?  Of course continue your favorite business in the field of computer science! <br><br>  Despite the fact that the United States is the epicenter of the IT world, there are many other countries where computer and engineering sciences are taught at a level no worse than Ivy League universities, and maybe even better.  I also considered Germany, namely DAAD, however I did not have time for the deadlines (if memory does not refuse, the deadline for submission of documents is November 5).  This is probably for the best. <br><br>  Today, the Internet provides all the knowledge of humanity, the main thing is to be able to focus on the subject of the search and sort unnecessary / incorrect information. <br><br>  "Top USA Classes Computer Science" - my first search query in Google, which immediately put me on the <a href="http://www.greatvaluecolleges.net/affordable/computer-science-engineering/">link</a> .  Using this link, I looked at all 50 university sites, and found only a few educational institutions that provide Full Tuition Scholarship by MS in Computer Science (MIT, Cornell, Duke, etc).  As it turned out the deadline at their December 15, and I did not have time.  Here I also found for myself such concepts as Master of <u>Engineering</u> and Master of <u>Science</u> (MEng &amp; MS). <br><br>  In short, these two concepts are different in that <b>MEng will not be able to receive a PhD in the future</b> , and he does not need to defend Thesis Project (diploma).  In principle, MS will not be able to get a PhD either, if instead of Thesis Project it chooses regular subjects in the last semester.  As you probably understood by the name, MS begins its training on becoming a scientist (but this does not mean that you will be obliged to enter the PhD).  That is why financial support is provided mainly by MS, while MEng may not even count on a ‚Äúgrant‚Äù.  Why do you ask this?  Why should the university sponsor you at all if there is no contribution to the development of the name of the university?  After all, sponsoring students, the university hopes that he will write good publications, and maybe he will contribute to a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience.  And this will undoubtedly increase the university's rating, which entails more willing to enroll, which means more profit.  Generally, universities in the states are workers' factories.  The better the product, the greater the demand for the product. <br><br>  We decided that we need to look for Master of Science programs.  I continued my search by returning to Google with the query "ms in computer science full tuition scholarship".  From the first three search pages, I found 2 possible programs.  However, the deadline for one was January 15, and I, in principle, did not have time for it either, but at the second university the deadline for participation in the scholarship competition was February 15.  And this university is called Baylor.  I have not heard of this university before, but the name was familiar.  The national university ranking according to USNews at that time is 70, which is not bad in principle.  The truth is better to watch the ratings of a particular school, and the rating of the School of Engineering and Computer Science of the Baylor University was not available on this site = (But then I still remembered what kind of university: all participants of ACM ICPC (the largest international programming competition among students) at The email comes with a thank-you note for participation from @ baylor.edu. Then wikipedia told me that the head office of ACM ICPC is at the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Baylor University. This was the main argument for this university. After reading about admission requirements , P  edostavlyaemyh opportunities and learning conditions, I firmly decided that I would try to do it in this university, although in all Internet resources are advised to apply for the most appropriate <b>five programs.</b> Oh, I would at this single catch. And in general, it seems that during the the process of preparing documents and passing tests, all the cards are laid down so that I enroll in this university - I will tell the details later. <br><br>  So, now, using the example of the aforementioned program, I will show you how to study information on university websites: <br><br>  1. Go to the university site and immediately go to the "Graduate School Admission" (typical of most sites): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e9/0cf/6df/8e90cf6df7ae061da71533910481cdcb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2. We are looking for the program we need in the list and go over it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/0a5/fb1/0e90a5fb18869f3c2f5de39bb43874a1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/498/4a9/92d4984a95aa00f5a5bd02d3edc7012c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Choose Master of Science (in all universities MS goes for a couple with PhD, they are painfully connected) and we can read a little about the program.  Since our priority is free education, and not the program itself, we will immediately move to the Financial Aid section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/947/f8d/a41/947f8da415995ec5244d43c3223e5dd4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4. Here we are immediately told that full funding is provided + scholarship in the form of a salary for the work as an assistant.  At other universities there were mainly lists of possible scholarships, both internal and external.  Do not be lazy and explore all possible types of funding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/537/6c9/885/5376c9885f69cf8ec120e9af6fb4b8f7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The outline of this mini-tutorial is suitable for many universities and outside the USA.  The main thing is not to be lazy, click and read, click and read =) Not one capillary will burst in the eyeball during this process, and that is why I said that the decision to enter does mean a lot.  You should clearly focus on your goal, because finding programs is quite a tedious thing, and after analyzing more than a couple of dozen programs, you will start to get confused and doubt that you can finally find that program.  Therefore, get the Excel file where you will fix the studied programs and mark with a check mark or a cross.  Unfortunately, I did not backup the same file, and I did not save it in the cloud.  Lost the file, and so would show. <br><br>  At this point, the first stage (in my humble opinion, the most important) comes to an end.  The remaining parts will write later. <br><br>  <i>To be continued...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304170/</a></p>
