Initially, an optional upgrade <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265456/">pissed off as a recommended</a> update, and later began <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273004/">heavy artillery around virus tricks</a> .  In early January, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/01/15/windows-10-embracing-silicon-innovation/">announced</a> that the new Intel Kaby Lake, Qualcomm 8996 and AMD Bristol Ridge processors will be supported only by the Windows 10 operating system. Now the processor manufacturers have confirmed this information. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter the release of the new generation of chips, they will work only in the environment of the latest Windows platform,‚Äù said a spokesman for Microsoft.  ‚ÄúThis allows us to focus on the deep integration of Windows and new chips, ensuring maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of processors.‚Äù  So those users who hoped to build a powerful machine based on new processors and work with the usual OS will most likely not be able to do this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Microsoft policy assumes that the latest generation of processors should support only one Windows - ‚Äúten‚Äù.  As for AMD and Intel, these companies do not have much choice.  They can either work with Microsoft on its terms, or refuse to cooperate.  Microsoft partners chose the first option.  These companies <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3112663/software/microsoft-made-em-do-it-the-latest-kaby-lake-zen-chips-will-support-only-windows-10.html">responded</a> to the request from Pcworld, confirming their intention to submit to the will of the corporation.

      "We confirm our intention to work with Microsoft and our partners in order to comply with changes in Microsoft policy," said an Intel spokesman.  He also said that the company will not release the 7th generation Intel Core processor drivers for Windows 7/8. <br><br>  AMD representatives reported roughly the same thing: "The AMD processors development roadmap complies with the Microsoft software strategy."  In June, the company released the Bristol Ridge chip, it is also the seventh generation processor.  And the first member of the Zen microprocessor family will appear in powerful desktops early next year.  This processor is called Summit Ridge.  Support for Windows 7/8 for these processors from AMD does not appear. <br><br>  It is unclear what will happen if you try to run older versions of Windows on a PC or laptop with the latest processor.  As experts say, previous versions of Windows OS will work without an official driver, but the work will be unstable - glitches and malfunctions are possible.  Some of the specific functions supported by new generation processors will not work at all.  In this connection, the OS may freeze, unauthorized reboot and ‚Äúcrash‚Äù of the operating system at the most unexpected moments. <br><br>  A number of experts do not agree with this statement.  For example, Dean Mac Carron from Mercury Research believes there will be no problems with the new processors.  "Most likely, third-party companies will release their drivers, which will allow you to work without any problems, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3112663/software/microsoft-made-em-do-it-the-latest-kaby-lake-zen-chips-will-support-only-windows-10.html">"</a> he <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3112663/software/microsoft-made-em-do-it-the-latest-kaby-lake-zen-chips-will-support-only-windows-10.html">says</a> .  Mac Carron says that for the average user, minor problems may not be noticeable.  There was a crash, and all right. <br><br>  It is quite another thing - corporate users.  Drivers for third-party chipsets do not guarantee reliable operation of a computer system.  Here the slightest failure can result in millions in losses.  Therefore, such users may have to either risk money and the stability of their services, or agree to the terms of Microsoft and update the OS.  And this, in turn, creates additional problems for companies whose software platforms can be ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for older versions of Windows.  The transition to Windows 10 for such companies is also associated with time and financial costs. <br><br>  True, corporate users with computer systems on the sixth generation Skylake platform <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/269436/">will be provided with</a> updates to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.  The term of support is limited to 18 months.  The systems for which updates will be provided include Dell Latitude 12, Latitude 13 7000 Ultrabook and XPS 13, HP EliteBook Folio, EliteBook 1040 G3, as well as Lenovo ThinkPad T460s, X1 Carbon and P70. <br><br>  As you can see, Microsoft is making very significant efforts to convince users of its software platform to upgrade to a new version of the OS.  And the fact that the company was able to negotiate with manufacturers of processors on cooperation, says a lot.  Probably in the near future, Microsoft will still be able to persuade users (both corporate and ordinary) to update their operating system. <br><br>  Dynamics of growth in the market share of Windows 10 and other versions of Windows over the past three months: <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="113" align="left"></td><td colspan="4" width="453" align="center">  Netmarketshare </td><td colspan="4" width="453" align="center">  StatCounter </td></tr><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">  Windows 7 </td><td align="left">  Windows 10 </td><td align="left">  Windows xp </td><td align="left">  Windows 8.1 </td><td align="left">  Windows 7 </td><td align="left">  Windows 10 </td><td align="left">  Windows xp </td><td align="left">  Windows 8.1 </td></tr><tr><td align="left">  June </td><td align="right">  49.05 </td><td align="right">  19.14 </td><td align="right">  9.78 </td><td align="right">  8.01 </td><td align="right">  42 </td><td align="right">  21.9 </td><td align="right">  6.5 </td><td align="right">  8.67 </td></tr><tr><td align="left">  July </td><td align="right">  47.01 </td><td align="right">  21.13 </td><td align="right">  10.34 </td><td align="right">  7.8 </td><td align="right">  40.67 </td><td align="right">  23.53 </td><td align="right">  6.36 </td><td align="right">  8.4 </td></tr><tr><td align="left">  August </td><td align="right">  47.25 </td><td align="right">  22.99 </td><td align="right">  9.36 </td><td align="right">  7.92 </td><td align="right">  39.88 </td><td align="right">  24.43 </td><td align="right">  5.83 </td><td align="right">  8.38 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Windows 10, perhaps, will be provided according to the ‚ÄúOperational service as a service‚Äù model.  Now, according to employees of the corporation, the development of new versions of the Windows operating system is not conducted.  Previously, it was almost always the case.  For example, while developing Windows 8, work was also being done on Windows 10 at the same time. Now, the Microsoft divisions are only working to improve Windows 10, releasing regular improvements and updates.  Large volumes of new features are added in the form of major updates.  For example, a significant update of Windows 10 - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306964/">Anniversary Update</a> .  Most likely, this principle of operation will continue to be maintained, with the addition of new modules to the already existing OS.  If this is true, it becomes clear why Microsoft is so concerned that users switch to Windows 10. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397135/</a></p>
