  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Morgellon 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Quite a strange name for a note, is not it? <br>  What are the morgellons you can read here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellon">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellon</a> and further links.  If you spend some time and get acquainted with publications and discussions on this topic, trying to find out if there is any such thing at all and what‚Äôs what, then my further reflections will probably become clearer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, it seems to be an existing disease that causes strange lesions of the skin in the form of ulcers with cellulose fibers emerging from them, as well as damage to the nervous system and a number of other organic disorders.  In Russian there were only a couple of publications on this topic on medical and news sites.  Well, for example, here <a href="http://www.newsru.com/world/29may2006/desease.html">www.newsru.com/world/29may2006/desease.html</a> <br>  Such a strange thing, mentioned not in the yellow press, intrigued me.  On the one hand, I decided to choose it as the main subject of our article, but its object will not be infectious diseases at all. <br>  Now attention, the question is: do you think this disease exists? <br>  I killed about 24 hours of my time to conduct an impromptu investigation.  And I do not know what to answer him.  At the same time, the point is not that there is not enough information - there is a huge amount of it, all this time I have been engaged not so much in its search, as in reading, viewing pictures, and so on. <br>  There is a fund for the study of this disease, many publications have been published under its auspices, faqs have been compiled, and a lot of assumptions and advice have been put forward on this subject.  It seems like they have registered over 4000 diseases in different parts of the world, concentrating around various foci.  On the Internet, heaps of images, interviews with the diseased, videotaping and photographing skin lesions up to a thousandfold increase are posted.  However, in our case it is important, not a single case of illness has been recorded in Russia, so without making long trips, it is impossible to see anything connected with this subject with our own eyes. <br>  Let's continue, there are a lot of pro et contra publications, blogs of the diseased, Internet clubs of anonymous morgelists, Internet forums on this topic, videos on youtube, photos on flickr and other media material.  There are detailed analytical articles by independent experts who ordered cellulosic fibers for what seems to be an independent examination, with photos, comments, but the samples seem to be different, they turn out to be just hair or thread, then, on the contrary, they have no analogues.  The photographs of the samples themselves, under magnification, live their intricate life, to the extent that someone photographs a thread from the sofa in macro photography, just to create a duck and lets it, it is discovered by experts with degrees and with two classes of education and again they begin to compete discuss what it is and again do not come to the same conclusions.  But in fact, for each of the countless photos and videos you can find relevant discussions, opinions, expert opinions (diplomas of which I also cannot see without going on a long journey).  Fixed a lot of cases where mentally unbalanced people, having fallen under the influence of these publications, themselves begin to consider themselves to be sick with this disease.  Or maybe they are really sick, since it manifests itself supposedly intermittently and the symptoms of the disease affect the nervous system until the appearance of hallucinations.  But according to the logic of things, the ‚Äútrain‚Äù of mentally unbalanced people is the most real manifestation of this phenomenon. <br>  Have I asked myself such questions?  No, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in America also puzzled by this.  And it seems like they formed a commission to sort out the question at least about the existence of a forever.  However, apparently, like me, it did not work out - I could not find official papers on the activities of this commission.  The commission said neither ‚Äúyes‚Äù nor ‚Äúno‚Äù, although it seems like it has been working for the past year (well, or all this time is in the process of being formed).  I am afraid of this commission, if they work ‚Äúaccording to the present‚Äù they will have to deal with the same materials as me.  Plus they have the opportunity to meet with the sick, which I do not have.  Was it difficult to do this in a year, do you think?  Does this commission exist at all? <br>  In order to describe all the hypotheses sounded and structured to give links on the subject I would have to spend another day, however, if it suddenly seems interesting, try it yourself. <br>  However, let us return to the second word (number) in the title of the essay. <br>  We all witnessed the victorious march of media viruses on the Internet. <br>  A person can feel something and watch something, and from this the brain creates a model of the environment, a huge database of the history of the interaction of an individual with it.  There is a culture - all the same, the phenomena of the environment are reflected in words, works, scientific hypotheses and so on.  But another layer appeared.  Online communities, like cortical columns in our brain, process information, as they digest it in their own way, discussions on a separate issue of skeptics and believers, Gnostics and agnostics, engineers and poets, supporters of various political camps proceed in accordance with the laws of some kind of social and communicative mechanics.  The cortical column in our brain (this is such a closely related group of about a hundred neurons) receives a signal from another column or neuron leading to a photosensitive cell, it passes it through itself and somehow reacts or does not react at all, but notice its activity. It is not aimed at finding some kind of truth about the nature of the signal - the neuron, in fact, is a live animal that tries to organize interactions with the environment so that they have a favorable effect on the balance of substances inside it.  Similarly, in his judgments about the false and the true, the beautiful and the ugly, in disputes about this one can imagine the same neuron that tries to create social psychologism comfortable for itself with social interactions - to get approval, point to karma, fame, defaced opponent etc. <br>  Of course, among the communities there is a specialization - well, not interesting, for example, auto.ru users of the actual modernism in modern art - they are talking about machines, but business news will interest them - they need to make money for machines - connections from various fields The real world are reflected in virtual communities.  The connection between the nerve cells in the visual cortex also topologically to a certain extent reflects the location of the photosensitive cells on the retina.  And the word ‚Äúleg‚Äù and the word ‚Äútable‚Äù also, in our understanding, have an interrelation between them that comes from the real world.  Changes in stock value reflect the success of a particular company.  Let's return to the brain - that neuron, to which only the first of a huge number of neurons has got a signal, which, in one way or another, will react to this event, the distant echo may come back to the auditory cortex and where it‚Äôs not, well, or not huge - it is quite possible the signal will be suppressed at this initial stage, but it is useless to look for true or false in this process.  The mechanism that is outside these categories ‚Äî in this case, neurophysiological, in the case of morgellons ‚Äî is social.  For some reason, people began to send each other pictures of ‚Äúmedvedist‚Äù and ‚Äúchumazik‚Äù, for some reason the killing of one person causes a loud resonance, and the other - zero.  You should not blame everything on the secret machinations of the government and corporations with our consciousness - they would be happy, perhaps, but only some attempts of manipulations for some reason are extinguished at the entrance, while others receive a resonance beyond all expectations and can predict all this only in certain, very narrow , limits.  We poke the electrode somewhere locally in the brain and how it reacts there, sometimes according to the predicted, and sometimes not. <br>  I don‚Äôt know how to correctly draw an essay to the end, I may have to limit myself to lyrics. <br>  If you draw a parallel of the online, and just a human, social community with the brain, then perhaps the disease is a morgellon, a picture with a medical assistant - this is just his thought, a kind of elusive system-wide process that you can‚Äôt just poke a finger at and say "that's it!" .  And this is not a unique property of the Internet.  Take the same fashion: this summer, all wear trousers in the style of flared, and the next summer, the popularity of torn jeans.  And not necessarily at the entrance of this should be some kind of event in an explicit form - for example, a popular actor in torn jeans in a freshly erected film (a new technology, a political event, and so on).  Why this particular stimulus among all will cause a resonance to be understood and predicted now is almost impossible.  But I see the merit of the Internet in understanding this issue only in the fact that it makes these ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù arising in the intricacies of social interactions visible to our eyes, but they do not exist for a specific person to understand a specific issue, they exist on a different level by themselves.  And I, making actions to search for information, as well as scribbling and publishing this note, I feel like a regular nerve cell in the process. <br>  Therefore, to the question about the existence of this disease, I admit the answer, which consists in the fact that this is another spontaneous social-information process out of many. </div>
