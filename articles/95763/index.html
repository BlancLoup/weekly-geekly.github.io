Here I will digress and tell a small prehistory: the fact is that my HTC P3400 has served for 2 years and began to throw out the tricks with a hang, sensor, call taking.  It became necessary to buy a new communicator.  Since the budget was very, very limited, we had to choose not from a large number of devices.  The requirements were not so complicated: a communicator, Wi-Fi, touchscreen, 3G, more than 64 MB of RAM, a screen of more than 240 * 320, and either OS or WM or Android (I don‚Äôt like Symbian chronically).  Among the current set of communicators of all sorts, two candidates were selected: RoverPC Pro G7 (9980r Messenger) and thanks to the advice of Olyapka LG GT540 (8990 Euroset).  In general, having felt both devices from different directions, and I looked at them very long and tediously, the greetings from Euroset were a big hello for patience, I decided on LG.  So let's start ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Repeating all the characteristics makes no sense, and so they are fully online.  The only thing I will note is the processor and ram, since I did not find one or the other on the network until I put the benchmarks in the already purchased device.  Processor 600Mhz, ram 159 Mb.  The strange thing is that the manufacturer tried to hide these facts.  In appearance, the device was much nicer in life than in the photo.  I remember my first reaction after seeing the official pictures: well, a freak !!!  But in fact, the LG GT540 communicator turned out to be a very pleasant looking and tactile device.  Of course, there is not enough soft plastic, it is only on the side panels, but this is not critical.  The assembly is of high quality, dense, no squeaks, no turning.  The cover fits snugly to the rest of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/716/df2/474/716df24744495e51401cf10dc1af7e26.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The screen after my HTC just pleases my eyes.  Juicyly (photya in pics I could not convey this) is bright, but of course it fades in the sun and you need to set the brightness to maximum.

      The Android 1.6 platform, manufacturers have already hinted about the short release of the upgrade to 2.1.  About the OS to tell nothing, it has already been written so much.  I can subjectively say that nothing slowed down on this hardware, thanks to the DivX hardware support, it played the video perfectly.  The programs were instructed on the first day of use, until they all started.  It‚Äôs good that there are a lot of free apps in the Market.  The only program that started only once is the LJ client - LJBeetle.  Incredibly pleased with the full tie-in to Google services as I use them very actively, almost everyone))). <br><br>  It‚Äôs too early to judge the battery.  I note that the battery is a new generation, lithium-polymer, not lithium-ion.  At the moment, after 9 o'clock the most active use of Wi-Fi, GPS and many programs (you know, fresh purchase) charge at the level of 30%.  Later add impressions about the battery. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings: in my opinion a frail nest for a microSD card, although if it is not often removed or inserted, it is of course normal;  speaker at maximum volume wheezing, it is impossible to say that much, but still audible;  inconvenient circular switch layout on the keyboard. <br><br>  Very pleased with the purchase, for such money LG GT540 is a good device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86f/188/637/86f188637b87a3a2264666641f046493.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f5/5b0/a68/3f55b0a68beb164ccec4ae5ad23244ae.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95763/</a></p>
