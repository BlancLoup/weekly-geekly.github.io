In the article, Mike McGuire reflects on how to use personal data to create personalized offers and not to lose consumer confidence.  Is it possible?  The author is sure that he knows the answer to this question. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Mike mcguire</b> <br>  __________ <br><br>  Marketers should move in the direction of providing relevant mobile offers, while not losing customer confidence.  Your customer has recently purchased homeware.  By tracking its behavior, you provide targeted advertisements for door handles and pendant lights.  In this case, the main goal will be to collect enough information to provide advertising on topics of interest to it, without going beyond what is permitted. <br><br>  For modern marketers, creating effective offers and messages in real time requires detailed and constantly updated information not only about the location, but also about such things as shopping history and family composition. <br><br>  Buyers are accustomed to expect the unity of prices and goods on various information channels, but still fear to share information.  Marketers are faced with ever-changing ideas about what is permissible when using personal information. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúExecutives, it is very important to gain consumer confidence.</i>  <i>When carefully taking into account the impressions and opinions of customers, marketers have the opportunity to establish close contact with consumers and combine offers inside the store with mobile and online data. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Buyers want both mobile offers and personal data integrity</b> <br><br>  The Gartner study, conducted earlier this year, showed a great desire to receive information on prices for various products, as well as to purchase these same products at various retail sites.  For example, in a survey conducted in February 2015, <i><b>52% of consumers claim that they received personal offers from stores</b></i> in the last 6 months.  And among these potential buyers, 43% fully agree that the relevant offer will affect their buying decision. <br><br>  The analysis showed that <i><b>21% of consumers are already sharing their location data</b></i> with stores from a mobile device, and another 27% say they would like to take this opportunity.  But nevertheless, they are concerned about the safety of their personal data: <i><b>52% of consumers claim that they never shared location data</b></i> or did not use this function in store applications ‚Äî and <i>will not be</i> thereafter. <br><br>  The study also showed that it is important for customers what kind of personal information - the very information necessary for composing effective mobile applications - they are ready to share.  For example, <i><b>users are more likely to write their age and gender, but they are unlikely to give family marketers data on family income or provide a mobile phone number.</b></i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Deserve trust and listen</b> <br><br>  Marketers working with mobile platforms should be honest with customers about what kind of information they collect and how they are going to use it.  The benefit for successfully practicing these organizations will be substantial: By 2018, those who have invested in all types of personalization will <b>overtake in sales of</b> those companies that have not done so <b>by 20%</b> . <br><br>  - Continually check and update your <b>privacy policy</b> .  Formalize and document your privacy policy.  Avoid complicated legal terms and write in plain language so that buyers can easily understand how their data will be used and how well they are protected. <br><br>  - Use only quality information.  Test customer data and information from third-party sources for accuracy and ensure that they are timely and widely available.  <b>Avoid the use of confidential information</b> . <br><br>  - Take the initiative in obtaining customer feedback.  Check personal offers on a small sample and constantly monitor the results with surveys and <b>monitoring of social media channels</b> . <br><br>  <i>Listen and interact with users.</i> <br><br>  Mobile offers will become more popular when users ‚Äôconcerns about the security of their personal data subside and when they become accustomed to using personal information in exchange for more personalized promotional offers.  However, marketers should use personal data sparingly so as not to lose user confidence. <br><br>  __________ <br><br>  <b>Stay with us - we are already preparing new interesting publications for you.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294752/</a></p>
