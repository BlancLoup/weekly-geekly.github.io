My potential energy as a client of this company has increased. <br><br>  After a short time it took to buy a tablet for the company.  Sheet Yandex.Market, I saw a company whose booklet sated me with loyalty.  Oh, the price is only slightly higher than that of unknown companies, clack!  Tablet in the basket.  We make out.

      So, where can I show my legal entity?  Not to see.  Somewhere in the basement there was a link "Corporate sales" - useful enough.  Okay, we'll figure it out on the road.  Go. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  We pull! </h4><br>  Before you are allowed to click the "Buy" button, the phone is being requested from you.  In exchange for the phone will present an account in the store.  I indicated a personal phone number, and an order for the company.  Bad luck, but I hope that later I can fix it - if suddenly we become a regular customer. <br><br>  Offer shipping options.  By default, the option "take it myself."  Yes, I love to pick myself.  Yes, precisely because I feel sorry for 300-500 rubles.  But then for the opportunity to save I was asked ... 50 rubles.  There is no free pickup option.  There is a more expensive pickup, and no free.  The store tried to sweeten this pill with the icon ‚Äúgreat!‚Äù And tekstiku ‚Äúwithout prepayment‚Äù.  Well, thanks for that - they did not demand an advance payment for the right to come to your warehouse. <br><br>  Ok, let's get the delivery.  I wonder how much it costs, if the largest part of self-pickup options is 128 rubles?  Klats!  390 rubles inside the Moscow Ring Road. <br><br><h4>  Let's pull! </h4><br>  To pay.  In, finally, I can indicate that the person at the menu is legal.  Nal, non-cash - all the same, + 4% to the price.  Mmm, on Yandex.Market, a purchase with such a price would crawl to a page I would never have reached.  Around this place I quit the order and went to the competitors.  But my phone number was already in the hands of the company.  First, the manager called, completely free.  Given the following, it is quite a pleasant surprise (meaning free of charge).  A masterpiece supplement to the order, which I noticed just now: <br><br>  Choose how well to serve you: <br><br><ul><li>  Human service (49 rubles. For SMS notifications on the status of the order + 49 rubles per call one hour before delivery). </li><li>  I do not want to pay for comfort - I am ready for tough service in Russian </li></ul><br>  Honesty is the best policy.  But politeness and goodwill - not the worst. <br><br><h4>  We can not pull out ... </h4><br>  I informed the manager that the order was no longer relevant.  An SMS message of the following content followed: ‚ÄúYou canceled the order.  You are waiting for a discount of 500 rubles, if you place an order within an hour!  Every minute the discount is reduced by 10 rubles! ‚Äù.  I deleted this message faster than my discount has decreased. <br><br><h4>  If I did not swear, but worked </h4><br>  If this were a report on usability auditing, the following problems would be included in the top problems (here they are not prepared for steps, given in ‚Äúbundles‚Äù).  Solutions can be borrowed from many competitors, nothing profound is required here. <br><br><ul><li>  Requiring a phone for the right to click the Buy button, without giving anything in return, to create a barrier for the buyer and, in general, rudeness.  Moreover, claiming that notifications will be sent to him, but not informing him that this is a paid service. <br><br>  <b>Better</b> : do not create an additional barrier at the time of making the purchase decision, especially in the form of a tough condition ‚Äúgive the phone - turn on the button‚Äù.  It is better to draw several fields of the order form at once - the user feels free and understands that he is already placing an order, and does not follow the store in an incomprehensible direction.  Moreover, it is a good reason to think about the simplicity and brevity of form. <br><br>  Some stores ask the phone only when making delivery, some - after choosing a payment method.  In other words, then, when it is already just a pity to roll back or when the buyer has naturally matured a question like ‚ÄúHow do I know about the status of the order?‚Äù.  And do not give false hope for free notifications. If the store does not have a mobile version, it is better to ask for an e-mail, because the path from the phone to the site will be too long. </li><li>  Actual fraud with the price - if there is no free pickup, it is impossible to get the goods at the price indicated in the price (the price is indicated without pickup and delivery).  Pickup for money is absurd, the buyer seems to be paying for the fact that he goes somewhere. <br><br>  <b>Better</b> : in the case of the cost of self-collection of 50 rubles, it is quite possible to add this amount to the price of all goods, and not to demand money from the buyer for self-service.  For goods priced at 5-10 thousand rubles, this rise in price is unlikely to be critical when choosing a store.  But then the former cheapest pickup will be free. <br><br>  Or do not call "this" self-delivery.  More cunning stores use names like ‚Äúdelivery to the point of issue‚Äù - here it is easier for the recipient to convince himself that he received the delivery service, although the financial flows are exactly the same.  In this case, the saying ‚ÄúThough you call a pot, just don't put it in the oven‚Äù does not work.  Plant in the oven, but with a kind word, which is also nice for a cat. </li><li>  Blackmail with a discount and a time counter at the end is unlikely to cause anything but annoyance.  Forcing a person to change their just made decision is a thankless job.  And at the same time, putting tough conditions at that is doubly ungrateful. <br><br>  <b>Better</b> : regret the cancellation of the order.  Discount give less, but more long-term.  Remind her of the case or before the expiration of her term. </li></ul><br>  <b>General recommendation:</b> put emoticons!  Then the whole frenzy about "serve me in a tough form" will be perceived with humor, at least by some buyers. <br><br>  What is significant, all the problems mentioned relate not so much to the interface, but to service design.  The interface honestly and even, in general, quality worked out the service in the form in which the supplier designed it.  But he designed it, in our opinion, rather unfortunate. <br><br>  <i>UIDG Analytics Department</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185668/</a></p>
