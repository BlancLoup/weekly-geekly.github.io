I call this period the stage of emotional extinction, which is expressed by increasing indifference to the release of technical innovations, a negative attitude towards computer technology in general, and dissatisfaction with the existing technical characteristics of devices.  Soon, smartphones will become more productive than netbooks, but the fashion for mobile devices with touch screens, like the dubstep passion, will not affect the adherents of a rational approach to life.  Objectively, there is nothing to replace the hardware keyboard (but <a href="http://hard.compulenta.ru/669201/">development is underway</a> ).  Add to this a relatively low price for devices of this class. <br><br>  The netbook is still a good alternative to tablets.  You may not agree with this statement, but using the example of ASUS 1025CE I will try to convince you of this.  In the ASUS netbook product line, 10-inch models remain the most popular devices.  This form factor allows you to maintain a balance between the size and duration of battery life. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

The video card, let's say, is present - Intel GMA3150. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d7/819/eec/9d7819eeca2b570d93f35afeeed48232.png" alt="image"><br><br>  320 GB hard drive.  Read / write performance: 70.12 MB / s, 74.29 MB / s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60f/43f/3a3/60f43f3a34048d51a25da6f568a7c36e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUS Eee PC 1025CE is based on a fresh, energy-efficient Intel Cedar Trail platform, built on a 32-nanometer process.  TDP - 6.5 watts.  The Intel Atom N2800 processor (1.86 GHz) is installed, but in some models the Intel Atom N2600 (1.6 GHz / 3.5 W TDP) is found.  The difference in performance between processors can be noted only in synthetic tests. <br><br>  The communication capabilities provide a 10/100 Mbps network card, a WiFi controller with support for the 802.11n standard, and a Bluetooth adapter version 3.0. <br><br>  Weight - from 1.1 kg (with a 3-cell battery) to 1.25 kg (with a 6-cell battery). <br><br>  <b>Interfaces</b> <br><br><img src="http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5804/41206083.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left side are the VGA, USB port, charger jack, HDMI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/875/96e/1b4/87596e1b45de82795c36551f87b82242.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right - two USB ports (one of them is USB 3.0), a network RJ45 card reader and an audio jack. <br>  For a 10-inch netbook live communications suite.  In general, for the first time I am satisfied with this arrangement: the mouse is not confused with HDMI, the headphone output is optimally placed, the power connector is placed on the rarely used side (of course, if you're not left-handed). <br><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d35/3bf/0cd/d353bf0cdf3f6f3ddc655c17f4787736.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The resolution of a 10.1-inch display is 1024x600 pixels.  The screen is matte.  Image quality is slightly above average for its class, but the viewing angles are small.  The matrix has acceptable (by the standards of netbooks) brightness indicators. <br><br>  The ASUS Eee PC 1025CE is optimal for working with text display, not straining the eyes.  I would not recommend using a netbook for working with images (if you suddenly have a desire to drive photoshop on it), but for text and web browsing is a good choice. <br><br>  <b>Work panel</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36d/a39/7c3/36da397c34fb34b71ccabc4bbaa1a566.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Four standard indicators.  In the upper right corner - the power button with blue backlight.  Space under the keyboard a bit, but enough for a comfortable positioning hands when working. <br>  The island keyboard with keys from opaque plastic.  There is still no Russian layout on this engineering sample, but the color of the Latin alphabet could be brighter.  The keyboard block does not play, but the keys do not have enough softness.  There are no complaints about the layout.  Keep in mind that keyboard evaluation is a weak point in any review: for my full testing, in my opinion, you need at least a month to work on a device. <br><br>  The large touchpad has the same surface as the working panel.  The mirror rocker is more beautiful than comfortable.  However, it will surely satisfy ordinary users. <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5c/80b/62c/e5c80b62c4e587c48af8c69b099d807b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Maximum opening angle of the screen.</i> <br><br>  With the design all is well.  The possible colors of the case of the Eee PC 1025CE are pink, blue or purple.  For our review, we chose pink (not only harsh geeks should be happy).  If you are shocked by this color, then think about a girlfriend / wife / mother - they can be to their taste. <br><br>  The Eee PC 1025C model will please with additional color options: white, black, gray, pink, brown, red and blue.  Soon, ASUS will finish experimenting with all the existing colors and will start producing netbooks of nonexistent colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f0/737/43e/0f073743e18a2dc287b70a2ebee6cb4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The frame around the screen has a plastic black rough coating.  Netbook cover is made of soft-touch matte plastic.  The bottom panel is made of exactly the same material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c2/81f/a4a/3c281fa4a3272c0394128073d5e639fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is no quick access to the replacement of components (although there is nothing special to replace).  It was not immediately possible to find the only screw on the panel - it was hidden behind a pink plastic cap, almost not standing out on the body.  On the bottom there are a lot of ventilation grilles (blowing small, there's nothing to warm inside). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c92/4f1/ece/c924f1ecead0972e387deac67bcb6919.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The thickness of the case varies from 2.07 cm in the front to 3.44 cm in the back.  On the sides are glossy silver inserts.  The battery is also silver.  It is not entirely clear what caused this approach to color design. <br><br>  The rest of the netbook is decorated harmoniously.  The material of the working panel does not differ from the cover, completely repeating the color and texture.  There are no complaints about the design of the netbook.  With one exception: a convex battery does not look very aesthetic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb8/ad6/a41/cb8ad6a4106653daf514f0f0903ba557.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a built-in webcam with its own feature - the camera lens is covered with a special curtain.  It is also equipped with a 4x digital zoom.  Standard webcam - 0.3 MP.  Few?  The ASUS ZENBOOKTM UX31E ultrabook (which is 4 times more expensive than our netbook) has a 0.3 megapixel camera installed - there are enough features for video conferencing. <br><br>  <b>Running time, heat generation and noise</b> <br><br>  During normal operation, the netbook does not make noise or heat up.  You can warm it up with tests, but even in this case the noise will be insignificant.  As mentioned above, available with a lightweight 2600 mAh battery and 5200 mAh enhanced battery.  When using a more capacious battery, the battery life (WiFi, reading) will be about 7 hours.  Only in the mode of reading the text with dimmed display - more than 10 hours. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Cute, colorful, compact, relatively inexpensive netbook with drawbacks inherent in all netbooks.  The device is intended for surfing, communication, work with documents.  Good choice for travel.  Small body and weight, increased battery life. <br><br>  Having read rave reviews, we choose fashionable equipment with metastasis of time bombs inside.  And now the ultra-thin case crumbles from impact, the battery loses its charge, the case decays, the paint is wiped, the monitor dims. <br><br>  Sometimes you need a device that is simple and effective, like an ax, or like a kitchen knife for a woman who might like a pink netbook.  In order to work the allotted time, I looked decently and reliably fulfilled my mission - in this case, I recommend that you take a closer look at netbooks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146123/</a></p>
