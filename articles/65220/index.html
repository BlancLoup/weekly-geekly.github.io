  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Industrial espionage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It took somehow one company to steal the drawings of the parts that competitors turned out on their CNC machines.  And not just drawings, but CNC programs for which all this is processed.  But it was not easy to do this - the drawings in the form of files went to the machines through the local network directly from the company's office.  In the machine itself, they settled in the sharpened folders from which the operators had already taken them into the processing prog.  By the way, Win2000 was installed on all machines, generally modern machines on systems other than Windows or DOS, I have never seen before. <br>  The only one with whom we managed to agree on the theft of the cutting plans was the machine operator, but here's the zapadlo - the stands of the machines are tightly closed and sealed.  Outward sticks out only the monitor, mouse and keyboard.  Well, the muzzle PLC, but with her nothing really have fun.  Before computers to put there a floppy or flash drive can not get.  How to be? <br><br>  The solution turned out to be very simple - it turned out that the mouse there is a USB flash drive.  Therefore, a similar mouse was quickly found and prepared.  In the belly of the mouse stuck USB hub trim in which stuck the flash drive and, in fact, the mouse.  A mouse cord shoved at the entrance to the hub.  After that, the mouse was kicked around the shop to give it factory stiffness and foulness.  Further, the combination was a protoy - a bribed operator pulled his mouse through a hole in the rack and went to complain to the local IT shnik about the fact that he accidentally pulled the mouse and it fell out.  The unsuspecting admin, in combination with a security man, opened the rack with his own key, stuck a mouse in there, closed it and went about his business.  Further it is trivial - a flash drive appeared in the system EXTREMELY where all files were merged within a month.  After the mouse understood, and the flash drive went to competitors. <br>  Then there was a lot of screaming, fights and searches extreme.  The leak was never found, But a charged mouse still stands there ... <br>  ***** <br>  published with the kind permission of the author - DI HALT (dihalt.ru) </div>
