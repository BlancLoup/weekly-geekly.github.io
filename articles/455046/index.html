This is the next traditional list of books that have proven useful for the year.  Especially subjective, of course.  But I seriously expect that you will tell more cool things to read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/zc/pw/p0zcpwwd-teb_w1wladhfsauwiu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Think slowly, decide quickly - Daniel Kahneman</b> <br>  This is the most magical thing that has happened in recent years in terms of geek literature.  This thing consistently opens cognitive distortions and teaches how to customize thinking.  It is fascinating.  In general, the approach to the fact that thinking is a set of techniques that can be trained and honed, it is probably more correct than the approach "this is shamanism."  Kaneman, unlike the next book in the list, which shows the features of reverse thinking, does not give new techniques - but it shows where we make and what mistakes we make in ordinary processes.  Such a serious brain debag. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Game Theory - Avinash Dixit and Barry Nailbaff</b> <br>  MYTH suddenly released a very good book on game theory.  What is very important, is its application rather close to reality.  Because the second author is Barry Nay ... Nalebuff.  In general, when you watch his course on Curser about negotiations and mathematics (which I highly recommend to do), you will understand why there are typos in my last name.  He says and does logical things, but every time he has such a face that he categorically does not want to believe.  And returning to the book - it gives a very good link to how laws are formed, why not the most beautiful lady wins at beauty contests, and so on.  But I‚Äôm not sure that this book alone is enough, because you still need to know the mathematical apparatus and a lot of applications - I‚Äôve come into the theory of games from biology and urbanism at one time, and I was very happy with this book.

      <b>Ray Dalio - Principles</b> <br>  Actually, I almost abandoned this book, because it did not fit into the bag.  But there was an autograph of this unknown dude to me, and decided that I should respect him.  Because I remember how painfully difficult it is to sign books.  Then I found out that he brought a stripper to the congress of agrarians.  And I thought that the man knows a lot about thinking outside the box.  As it turned out, the hypothesis was true, it is a damn useful book.  But only if you are the leader of a large team.  From there, I caught up with everything else for about half a year, because it‚Äôs interesting not only what he wrote, but also why it works that way for him, and how other parts of the company deal with it.  Then this book was given to me a couple more times, the last time - TM after speaking at a seminar about Habr) <br><br>  <b>Makarenko - My education system.</b>  <b>Pedagogical poem.</b> <br>  For a long time I did not understand what the joke was Makarenko, because there was another no less epic colony of homeless children of the same period, which is even better - the name of Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky.  So, it turned out that this is what happened from the students of Makarenko and a lot of funding.  And he created everything from scratch, even worse than from scratch - the first homeless children almost beat him there, and he almost started shooting at them in the first chapter.  The muzhik in fact discovered the system of Soviet education and showed how to socialize the group dynamics.  And all this is read as Rimworld in half with a thriller, because there in each chapter there are either epic gunfights, or massive injury, or the theatrical squad feels the love of the villagers.  It is worth reading at least for the sake of the beginning of the chapter about the theater squad, if everything else is alien to you. <br><br>  <b>45 tattoos sold - Batyrev</b> <br>  I don't like the way the book is written.  I do not like the oozing out of it in half with fat.  But there are really useful practices there, and they are not found anywhere else in Russian.  Therefore it is necessary to endure and read.  Well, it is read at times easier than textbooks. <br><br>  <b>Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive, Others Die - Dan Heath</b> <br>  Textbook on social engineering in the text.  I add it to the beautiful collection from ‚ÄúThe Art of Speech at the Court‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Second Most Ancient‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfessions Obsessed with Efficiency‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbout Children, the Sun, Summer and Newspaper‚Äù.  By the way, the last thing from this list can be found only in paper.  As for Heath, this is almost a tutorial on how to work with product launches. <br><br>  <b>Magical cleaning - Marie Kondo</b> <br>  Konmari is a very fashionable Japanese woman from America who was burned by colleagues when we changed lists of favorite books on the road (this is one of the traditions of travel).  I would never have imagined that I could read a book about cleaning.  Like the fact that someone wrote it, and it is not GOST for cleaning various strategic facilities.  In general, you first read it, and then throw out the fucking half-apartment.  And you can no longer look at anything around calmly.  Because it teaches that everything around from objects should bring joy.  Take each in hand and ask yourself if you would like to see it again.  If you doubt even half a second - throw it away.  As a result, 2-3 items remain in the apartment, where there was a whole room or a whole closet.  And the side effect is that after 20-30 pilgrimages to the trash bin the skill is fixed, and you also begin to relate to goals in life and thoughts.  I advise. <br><br>  <b>Predictable Irrationality - Dan Ariely</b> <br>  It is almost like Kahneman above, only calling from the other side.  Presupposition and influence on the context of decision making, a lot of hacks rights.  It is like a book about military propaganda, written in peacetime and for conventionally peaceful purposes.  Well, or so I took it. <br><br>  <b>Involve and Conquer - Kevin Verbach, Dan Hunter</b> <br>  Verbakh is also a familiar face with Cursors, an old troll and a gamification specialist.  The book teaches what and how in this story - from educational program to normal techniques.  Want to quickly understand the issue - read here.  I suspect that roughly these mechanics are the future of education. <br><br>  <b>Language Design - Alexander Piperski</b> <br>  In general, this is the most useless book in the world, which at the same time can teach a lot.  It is about artificially created languages ‚Äã‚Äã(and now I‚Äôm not talking about C ++, but about colloquially Esperanto).  Different approaches to how to express thoughts.  Different frameworks.  Different tasks of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthemselves.  The farther into the forest, the more interesting.  Here is one example: Tokipona.  A language designed to express only good thoughts.  Architecturally, this is an assembler of 120 word operators, each of which is neutral or positive in meaning, and very ‚Äúnice‚Äù in pronunciation.  The phrase ‚ÄúHave they poured ponies‚Äù - a macro ‚Äúsmall animal-separator-kind‚Äù - if you add ‚Äúdog‚Äù to the macro, there will be a ‚Äúcute puppy‚Äù.  If you add "fox", then there will be "this little fox friendly" - it all depends on the context.  Of course, the macro "dog" or "fox" is also collected from these operators.  The result is either a completely wildly indefinite language consisting only of pointers to the context in the heads of the interlocutors (the analog is Russian without ordinary speech), or a macro assembler.  Attempts to speak these languages ‚Äã‚Äãwildly change thinking.  Well, or at least enough to understand how they are arranged. <br><br>  <b>The science of the brain and the myth of my self.</b>  <b>Ego tunnel</b>  <b>- Thomas Metzinger.</b> <br>  About cognitive distortions, psychos and self-perception.  After reading, there remains the feeling that the person is a release that may fall from a couple of changes in the configuration file.  Or just like that.  There is more reverse engineering man than something practically applicable, but, damn it, how our vetver is buried! <br><br>  But past selections: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/110797/">first</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">second</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/178557/">third</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/254309/">fourth</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/307724/">fifth</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mosigra/blog/353010/">sixth</a> .
