      So, with what can you compare computer games?  Long thinking about this question, I came to the conclusion that <br><br>  <b>computer games should be treated the same as alcohol.</b> <br><br>  I decided so, because computer toys and alcohol have a huge amount of common properties.  Let's list them: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><u>Property 1. The</u> Ministry of Health of Russia warns: excessive sitting at computer games is harmful to your mental health.</b> <br><br>  I remember myself as a schoolboy and sometimes I get scared when I realize how many people have misled their lives by not being able to recover from gambling addiction.  It seems that Peter Petrov was a talented mathematician and won in competitions, he could have entered SPBU, but now he is studying at the Nth <s>vocational school</s> .  And Mashka Mashkova went to art school, brilliantly painted, but then more and more often she launched SIMS on her computer ... <br><br>  Gambling is a real disease, like alcoholism.  But if our children drink beer on the stairs, we grab hold of their hair and shout: ‚ÄúWhat a Fright !!‚Äù.  But at the same time, we are absolutely not interested in how long our children play, and we don‚Äôt take it by the hair. <br><br>  <b><u>Property 2.</u> Persons under 12 years old selling a game console is prosecuted.</b> <br><br>  By law, you should not sell alcohol if you are under the age of 18.  But why is there no such law about computer games?  In modern child psychology, there is a hypothesis that a child under 1.5 years old does not understand that video on TV is just pictures.  Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for children to watch TV at least until they have reached 2-3 years old.  Our body goes down if it consumes alcohol at a young age.  Our mind may not be fully established for computer games. <br><br>  Perhaps the age of 12 years is a bit far-fetched by me - it is worth finding out to psychologists.  But this age must be set!  It is impossible for the fragile consciousness to give free rein to decide which computer games to play! <br><br>  Although of course, there are exceptions.  By analogy with alcohol: children drink kefir and kvass, although they contain some alcohol.  It is even good for health.  But you won't give your five-year-old son brandy or even a beer?  In the same way, there are wonderful and developing children's games (for example, I had Living Books for learning English) that can <b>and should be</b> given to children! <br><br>  When we order drinks, we ask if they can be their children, so why aren't we also interested in computer games? <br><br>  <b><u>Property 3.</u> Play every day the right path to gambling.</b> <br><br>  Anyone who drinks a glass of beer every day becomes an alcoholic without being noticed.  The same is true for computer games.  Why is it necessary every day, coming from work, school, university to relax with the help of computer toys?  Read Eugene Onegin, download a masterpiece Soviet film (of which there are VERY many) and look with your wife, go to Skype and talk to a friend you haven't seen for a thousand days. <br><br>  Playing every day, like drinking every day, is a very destructive habit.  As they say, "Sow a habit, reap ..." <br><br>  <b><u>Property 4.</u> <s>Do not drink with alcoholics.</s></b>  <b>Do not play with "very addicted gamers"</b> <br><br>  Would you drink with a person if you knew in advance that he was an alcoholic?  I would not - firstly: take a sin on the soul.  Secondly: you can get drunk yourself, like a pig.  That's the same with games, do not play with <s>zadrota</s> "very addicted gamers."  The reasons are the same two as with alcohol. <br><br>  And from this it follows that you should not play "online" games, because there are so many gamers there. <br><br>  Sorry for such a sharp thesis, dear habratovarischi, but it's true! <br><br>  <b><u>Property 5.</u> There are fake games.</b>  <b>Even in small doses, their consumption is fatal.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Will you drink ethyl alcohol?  Or "fake" vodka?  So, there is also a "fake" game.  We must learn to distinguish them.  Unfortunately, lately, "fake" toys are becoming more and more.  I myself like some shooters (for example, classic Doom 2), but how can you play a shooter where the body scatters into guts and brain, and some worms get out of the liver ??  How can you even look at it? .. <br><br>  <b><u>Property 6.</u> If you play, you will not work</b> <br><br>  Try on Monday morning to drink three glasses of brandy.  I think work on Monday will not go very well ... The same applies to games.  No "I'll play an hour and then do my homework!"  After ‚Äúplay‚Äù the head is relaxed and thinks about the process of the game (especially for children) for a long time.  If you play, you won't be able to work all day!  It is necessary to play with friends, during some fun, and again in moderation. <br><br>  <b><u>Property 7.</u> The only way to stop being a gamer is to never play.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  If a person is an alcoholic and realizes his misfortune, he has only one way out: do not drink.  Never drink.  Not at the birthday of the mother-in-law, not at Easter, not at the ninth of May, not even at the wedding of her own son.  Do you remember the story of the hockey player from the first series ‚ÄúMoscow Does Not Believe in Tears‚Äù?  Exactly!  Remember her more often!  Same with computer games.  The only solution gamers - do not play.  Never play. <br><br>  Alcoholics do not even smell alcohol, so as not to be tempted.  But unlike alcoholism, in gambling "not sniffing" is replaced by "do not watch how others play;  Do not watch the game trailers, so that it will not be seduced either. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  There are many alcoholics in the world, many people have broken their lives because of alcohol.  But alcohol is also a culture.  Orthodox Christians generally take communion with alcohol.  The same is true for computer toys: do not treat computer games as well as pornography. <br>  Computer toys are a culture.  Unfortunately, a very degraded culture in the last decade. <br><br>  Do not treat computer games badly because of the presence of gamers, "fake" toys and careless parents.  If you are an absolute sober, this is commendable and I respect you very much.  But you will not begin to condemn those who are not absolute sobriety?  If so, do not judge computer games. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154307/</a></p>
