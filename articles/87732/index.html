For developers, this implies the need to follow Microsoft's technical and content guidelines in order to get to the Marketplace.  Accordingly, it is possible refusal to accept the program.  Sounds familiar?  Todd told us that Microsoft plans to avoid the Apple Store headache by making the process transparent and predictable, with regular meetings of Microsoft managers to review individual cases and update guidelines as needed, but a couple of unusual programs (sexy apps) can break even the best plans.  We have details on how the Marketplace will work, come back after the break. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Update: Microsoft wants us to clarify the presence of the possibility of installing programs for employees in enterprises without the use of a targeted Marketplace - details will be announced some time later. <br><ul><li>  It seems that the Marketplace will incorporate better the features of the App Store and the Android Market, mixing them, but there are still ambiguities with the trial system - in the Marketplace the <b>limitations of the trial version are determined by the developer</b> .  In fact, there are some APIs that allow the developer to control how the trial works, for example (quoting Biggs), the game may end after killing 50 trolls.  After the end of the trial period, you do not need to download anything, after the purchase the full version of the game is unlocked. </li><li>  For developers, using the Marketplace is still worth $ 99 a year, although Biggs indicated a <b>possible change in the limit of 5 applications that is</b> present in the Marketplace for Windows Mobile 6.5.  We do not know whether this means a complete absence of restrictions on the number of applications. </li><li>  <b>Application updates by developers, as well as downloads for users are free.</b> </li><li>  You <b>can</b> also <b>uninstall programs and re-download them at another time</b> - purchases are tied to your Live account, and not to the phone, so that the phones themselves can be changed.  Developers will not be able to circumvent this rule of Microsoft. </li><li>  If the application is free and with advertising banners, then the developer has only two obstacles: payment of $ 99 and approval by Microsoft.  Especially for advertisements, instead of buying applications, Microsoft will make special gaylans about relevant advertising. </li><li>  Microsoft <b>uses only real money</b> , no points (although the possibility of payment through a service provider (mobile operator) is still present). </li><li>  Although there is some connection with the development for Zune and WP7S (especially with XNA), it‚Äôs precisely in the development that connection ends - the Marketplace will be different for them. </li><li>  You can <b>watch and purchase applications and games through the Zune desktop client.</b> </li><li>  Although there is no way for end users to acquire and install applications through the Marketplace, Microsoft is working on a way to test applications on a limited number of devices, we can assume that the method will be similar to installing a la Apple ad hoc.  However, Charlie Kindel stated that the method would not be available in the first release of the platform.  So far, the only way is to unlock devices one by one through the portal for developers, and Microsoft does not say how many devices you can unlock through one account. </li></ul>  Biggs stressed several times that the company will publish comprehensive rules and guidelines in May, and they will contain answers to all remaining questions. </div>
