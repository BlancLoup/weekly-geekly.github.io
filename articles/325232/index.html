I will try to say simply about the complex, and describe the indescribable.  This is a theory, a model, an assumption, I reason theoretically.  However, this theory can be easily accepted by billions of people, because it does not contradict the traditional worldviews of Mongolia, China, India, Iran, Jews, Muslims, and so on. <br><br>  Here is a small fragment of the universe to defragment your attention: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51c/9fa/9d5/51c9fa9d5f124779abd0793071c0eae2.jpg" alt="image">

      The estimated size of the universe does not fit in my head.  The human mind is not designed for such complexity.  Imagine that the size of the operative memory of your mind has become more than billions of billions of times and has become able to mentally embrace this whole economy, and think about where all this is and when?  In Zen terminology, this question is Koan.  Koans are a means of achieving enlightenment, theoretically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76a/3fa/751/76a3fa75184d45819e0a65ed1c51c9b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B7%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD">Zen</a> - this is the Japanese version of the Chinese <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">Chan</a> - this is essentially the Chinese version of the Indian term <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%2585%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Dhyana</a> - this is the penultimate stage of the ancient Vedic-yogic psychotechnology described, for example, in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2599%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</a> .  Her initial goal is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F">Prajna</a> , translated from Sanskrit: comprehension-knowledge-schema-project-intent-design, that is, an understanding of the structure of the world and the most efficient work of the human mind, and even the achievement of supernormal abilities, theoretically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b7/95a/ddd/0b795addd1e440e68fafcc4526afc1ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, Buddhism is not a religion, it is a state of mind, a level of human consciousness. <br><br>  Theoretically, Jesus reached the maximum level of human enlightenment and had direct access to the API of this ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù, and could do incredible frills with space-time.  Moreover, theoretically, he said that in the future, instead of him and thanks to him, there would be a whole army of people like him, and they would do even more miracles.  Since then, two thousand light years have passed, but nothing like that, unfortunately, mankind has not observed. <br><br>  For example, Jesus could change the physical properties of his body by becoming luminous.  Previous prophets, such as Moses, reached a similar state.  And there is a version that in such a state it is possible to overcome time and space, and communicate with another person who is in the same state.  This Jesus specifically demonstrated to his disciples by transfiguration, and two other luminous comrades from another time appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c2/ca7/2f8/3c2ca72f83964ca0a2acabe569f8df85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, Jesus demonstrated the accelerated drying of a tree when the tree dried out unusually quickly, in seconds, as if the video was fast rewinding.  The disciples asked him: ‚Äúhow is it possible !?‚Äù, Jesus answered something like this: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think how it is done‚Äù, that is, just give a command to the system and everything will be executed. <br><br>  Even for example, Jesus demonstrated a copy-paste (or 3D printing, or cloning) of food, when thousands of people went to the field to take food, then Jesus took several fish and loaves of bread and propagated them.  Moreover, in the desert, people even from the sky scattered the perfect food (manna) on an industrial scale, and clothes and things did not grow old, but this is not enough for people!  Not enough to be! <br><br>  The most interesting thing in the legends about Jesus is the theoretical possibility of reviving dead people.  Now on this planet there is nothing more interesting than this. <br><br>  Suppose that the biblical legends describe the real facts and knowledge given to humanity from the outside.  Let's try to reconstruct the model.  How is it possible to manipulate matter as Jesus did?  He spoke of the Force that is inside of him and which he could share with others.  Most likely it is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Dark Energy</a> , or in Chinese - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8">Qi</a> , or in Indian - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Prana</a> , or in Hebrew Wind, or in Russian Spirit.  Accordingly, the Soul is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Dark Matter</a> , an invisible body.  Such is the simple scientific explanation of the invisible world.  The invisible world and its matter and energy are figuratively speaking Sky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67a/ae8/47a/67aae847a7e64f289b6faa0b8d595d34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, recently, humanity has learned that the body of an animal, such as a human, is a community of 37 trillion microorganisms-actors, each of which contains the same software code, for example, 1.5 gigabytes in size.  Before that, people naively assumed that life originated from nothing, and it seemed to them that such a theory is smarter than the theory of consciously constructing organisms by certain higher intelligent beings from other worlds.  I think such a delusion is possible only in the absence of telescopes, microscopes and the science of programming.  The harm from this delusion is huge - people believe that everything in life is created and improved by itself, for example, they believe in the invisible hand of the market.  From this passivity, lack of independence and the inability to distinguish reality from fantasy. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="http://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2016/04/12/10/1460483626183575560.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div></div></div><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="http://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2016/04/12/11/146048412711807770.webm" type="video/webm"></video></div></div></div><br><br>  Any real adequate programmer knows that the code itself is not written, and the programs themselves do not improve, and the programming language itself does not arise.  Therefore, there are obviously some Engineers who have created terrestrial bioprograms and biomechanisms.  You can call them gods or higher intelligence.  No matter how you call them, it is important to understand the Model, to realize the Reality.  Among these gods may well be the Supreme God (in Hebrew: Elohim and Yahweh, in Arabic: Allah, in Indian: Ishwara, in Mongolian: Tengri). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/284/bd9/00b284bd9dc14cadb302e38a5b643bed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ancient technology of enlightenment described in the Yoga Sutras is a program-sequence of actions.  Sutra means a thread, a thread associated with a set of tags with commands.  The word Yoga is translated from Sanskrit: yoke-load-equipment and also: method-method-means.  Understanding comes after doing the seven parts of Yoga.  The first two parts - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0)">Yama</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">Niyama</a> , are the eternal universal law of the hostel and the rules of conduct.  That is, it is impossible to achieve real miracles without meeting the standard.  You can develop science, do reverse-engineering of biomechanisms and try to hack the system in the collider, or it is possible to get perfection for nothing, theoretically. <br><br>  Trusting ancient legends and sacred texts does not mean believing in any modern religious organization.  I am not at all interested in any religious organizations, because there is nothing interesting in them, but it is very interesting for me to read ancient texts in the original language.  If you want to explore, for example, the Gospel or the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, read only the original, without traditional religious interpretations. <br><br>  <a href="https://music.yandex.ru/album/10071/track/31549746%3Ffrom%3Dserp">In life, there are only two ways</a> - legal and illegal, that is, righteous and vice versa.  Theoretically, a highly developed human civilization has already been on our planet, which has sunk into an unsuitable state and has been completely destroyed by the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF">World Flood</a> .  This event means that for the sake of salvation-survival-development of mankind, it is permissible to destroy almost all of humanity.  A non-working system must be restarted.  Billions of living people are of no value if the result required by the Developer is not achieved. <br><br>  Theoretically, <a href="https://www.bibleonline.ru/bible/rus/01/01/">according to the Bible</a> , in the antediluvian times over the planet's atmosphere was an ocean of water, which probably protected the biosphere from cosmic radiation, and the force of attraction was less, so there could be gigantic organisms and the duration of human life was up to a thousand years.  Theoretically, Dark Matter kept the ocean in limbo.  Perhaps Dark Matter is a necessary condition for the long life of biological mechanisms.  During the flood, all the water fell to the ground and washed away everything that was on it, and now the water is under the surface of the earth, and its volume is several times larger than the volume of the world‚Äôs ocean.  It is interesting that in the predicted next after our world there will be no seas, oceans and mountains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/2c2/be1/f162c2be14d74b4d8daf722854023529.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here, for example, the remnants of former luxury: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c7/325/e62/6c7325e6255c44c3a99ff2713d1acdf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today it is quite possible to reproduce such forms by ultrasonic or water-jet processing of a stone on a CNC machine.  First, 3D scans are made of all mined stones, then the 3D editor calculates the masonry so that it is earthquake-resistant and with minimal processing costs, and the stones are sent for processing, and the cranes are stacked, and as a result there are no gaps between the stones.  But as long as there are no such machines, it is very expensive and nobody needs it, because there is concrete.  In the first human world there was a different lifestyle and a different level of technology - they were built not for centuries, but for thousands of years. <br><br>  Jesus predicted that there would be a similar repeated clearing of the planet from unnecessary people: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man: for as in the days before the flood they ate, drank, married and got married before the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not think until the flood came and destroyed all - so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man</i> </blockquote><br>  - such is the plan, such is the program of actions of the Master of this planet.  All people and civilizations that do not meet the standard will be burned as unnecessary garbage.  Such is the harsh reality.  Similarly, in normal society, criminals and traitors are ruthlessly destroyed.  For example, under <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">Genghis Khan</a> for adultery, they were killed on the spot, as well as in Judaism or Islam - this is unacceptable grievous harm to society, this is a betrayal of his family and his people.  The law of the hostel and the system of education should be so effective that people do not want to destroy their families and betray their homeland, to make treachery as minimal as possible.  And if, on the contrary, most marriages break up and almost all citizens betray and destroy their state, then there is no point in executing a good, harsh law, because all the people must be destroyed.  This principle was demonstrated by Jesus when a hostess was brought to him by a crowd of fellow citizens.  Then the enemies blamed Jesus for abolishing the Law of God.  For the first time, Jesus came to the ‚Äúlost sheep of the house of Israel‚Äù not to judge and punish, but for his death, Israel was destroyed by the hands of the Romans, and this was predicted by Jesus in the parable of the vineyard. <br><br>  Jesus formulated the essence of the perfect law of the hostel - love comrades as yourself, and deal with your neighbors as you want them to do with you.  But at the same time he did not abolish all the former stern law of the Abrahamic religion.  Every normal and healthy person wants pest criminals-traitors to be justly punished and isolated, and abnormal and unhealthy people are taught to love them as their close brothers, and they preach impunity and irresponsibility.  This is the reason for the tolerance-liberalism-humanism of Western European Christian culture, in which LGBT human rights are the highest value.  Jesus in the parable described the world as a field, and the owner of the field and his pest enemy, and this enemy will never become a friend.  European Christians misunderstand the principle of "love your enemy" - this principle is contrary to God's law and was intended in the first century only for special-elected disciples of Jesus, who had to trust their enemies-traitors, as Jesus did, that is, voluntarily follow Jesus on penalty - for an ordinary earthly person, this is an abnormal and insane behavior.  Not all people are chosen, but only those whom Jesus chose in the first century.  It is impossible to be elected at will.  Failure to understand the gospel leads to disastrous consequences. <br><br>  The yoke of Jesus is in Indian Yoga of Jesus.  Yoke is slavery, law-abiding, righteousness and work for the Master in His field. <br><br>  In short - theoretically there is a <b>program of behavior</b> given to people from the outside.  Ideally, each cell of a public multi-billion organism should contain this program in its pure form.  Only then the whole human body will be healthy and happy, and there will be no cancer of the egoists.  This is the simple essence of the original Abrahamic religion.  The owner of all this zoo needs order and harmony, and rationality of mankind.  People differ from animals in that they do not have a built-in perfect program of behavior, without learning they are not viable and worse than animals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d0/951/935/4d0951935b1246df9fffa80fae6c2c30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to single out the core (hardcore) of social programming.  It is impossible to simply establish religious laws - after all, over the centuries, any religion has completely lost confidence.  Very often, religious organizations disgrace the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfaith in the Supreme God and his law program, therefore the scientific faith appeared Atheism as a reaction.  Religion, faith, mysticism, esoteric, shamanism - this is a personal intimate affair of citizens, within the law, it is not a state affair.  The business of the state is not to contradict the eternal fundamental system of moral coordinates.  Jesus said that no one should see you pray, and your appearance and behavior should not be religious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/548/997/d9a/548997d9a13d47d59c13a376b72e238f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At forty, I certainly like the Confucian Cult of the Family - Family is the highest value.  The state is a big family, the family is a small state.  Everything that destroys a family should be minimized, and vice versa, what develops and strengthens should be stimulated to the maximum.  This is a very simple reasonable principle.  This is a serious question for the survival of humanity. <br><br>  Suppose that all biblical predictions since <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2595%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0">Enoch</a> are accurate, then the main thing that people should think about is how to survive inside the mountains in the face of constant earthquakes and burning of the planet's surface.  Technically, this is possible, for example, in the United States built an underground city in Mount Cheyenne in case of nuclear war.  But besides technology, it is necessary to have high-quality social programming so that the legislative / judicial / executive program does not contain errors, and that the controlling artificial intelligence does not make mistakes.  A real strong AI begins with what Confucius theoretically said - with the definition of term concepts.  If people do not understand the meaning of words and use meaningless, incomprehensible words, if the language is polluted, then the information exchange in the public organism will be disturbed and development is impossible.  In the natural human language it is necessary to distinguish the core (hardcore) of the language, a mixture of Prolog and Loglan. <br><br>  Such terraforming is a theoretically inevitable stage in the history of people - this is a test of a person, a test of his viability.  Similarly, the Russian people were tested in the Second World War, and they proved to be friendly enough to survive and defeat the western European enemy. <br><br>  By the way, it seems that my Soviet Motherland has broken up and died.  In fact, there remained a huge reserve of simple, gentle, viable people - dear outer Mongolia. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>And in the days of those kings, God will raise up the kingdom of heaven for ever, which will not be destroyed forever, and the kingdom will not be given to His other people, will destroy and destroy all the kingdoms, and will stand for ever</i> </blockquote><blockquote>  <i>The righteous will inherit the planet and will live on it forever</i> </blockquote><br>  The name Mongolia means: the eternal state.  In the pre-Soviet period, for some time Great Mongolia owned Russia.  In fact, Russia is part of Mongolia.  China thinks Mongolia is part of it, in fact the opposite.  On the flag of China, a fragment of the symbol of the future global Mongolia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/641/dfb/8d3/641dfb8d3a274494890826dcf302a036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The oldest social program</b> , that is, the TAO-method-rule-law-custom-morality consists of ten elements: <br><br><ol><li>  Wife - humanity, compassion, caring for people </li><li>  And - duty, justice, legality, decency, responsibility </li><li>  LI - ritual, decency, tact, etiquette, politeness (we are polite people) </li><li>  JI - wisdom, science, knowledge, the desire to learn </li><li>  Tsay - abilities, stimulation of talents </li><li>  BLUE - honesty, loyalty, trust, reliability </li><li>  Yun - courage, courage, courage </li><li>  LIAN - disinterestedness, non-greediness </li><li>  SHUN and TI - obedience, meekness of Jesus, humility (in Arabic: Islam) and respectful attitude of elders </li><li>  ZHENMIN - name correction, realism, call a spade a spade </li></ol><br><br>  And accordingly, the worst devilish qualities that should not be in a healthy social organism: <br><br><ol><li>  Terrorism, enslavement, sadism, trolling, mockery, rudeness </li><li>  Irresponsibility, impunity, indifference, lawlessness, laziness </li><li>  Depravity, disgrace, vulgarity, jokes below the belt </li><li>  Ignorance, stupidity, idiocy of the people </li><li>  The suppression of talent, the destruction of heretics and prophets </li><li>  Deception, infidelity, treason </li><li>  Cowardice, betrayal </li><li>  Greed, selfishness, excess, lust, money sack, robbery </li><li>  Arrogance, pride, feminism, fascism, nazism, estate society </li><li>  Idolatry, dogmatism, fanaticism, delirium - one must live in the real world, and not in an imaginary virtual </li></ol><br><br>  Simple hierarchy: <br><br><ul><li>  citizen honors the sovereign </li><li>  soldier honors general </li><li>  student honors teacher </li><li>  wife honors husband </li><li>  son honors father </li><li>  the younger brother honors the elder </li></ul><br>  The one who is lower in the family hierarchy cannot be equal or superior, otherwise it is arrogance.  In spite of the hierarchy, the mutual respect of the senior and junior comrades is obligatory, for example, in the army the officer is obliged to respect the private.  If parents harm their children - it is not parents, but pests.  Jesus said that the potentially worst enemies of a person are his household, that is, the greatest harm to a person can be done in a family if it is bad. <br><br>  Comrade, Friend, Brother, One Belief, Mother is synonymous, the opposite: Enemy, Traitor, Pest, Criminal and so on.  The brother does not harm Brother: does not mock, does not humiliate, does not offend, does not betray, does not deceive, and so on.  At the same time, harming and benefiting is dementia or schizophrenia; sick and insane people must be isolated from healthy people. <br><br>  An adult should not be like a child, be underdeveloped, infantile.  You can not mix the adult and children's worlds.  Until adulthood (15 years old) a child is taught by adults, after adulthood it is useless to re-educate a person.  Underdeveloped people are unable to create a full-fledged family. <br><br>  Male and female worlds can not be mixed - boys are taught by courageous men, girls are taught by feminine women.  Women can not manage men. <br><br>  Value and purpose is not the number of people, but their quality.  In a good family there are seldom bad people, in a bad family there are seldom good ones.  People should be valuable like gold.  Straw-husk will be burned with unquenchable fire, theoretically. <br><br><h3>  Seven major roles in the Family: </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Engineer</b> - scientist, developer, researcher, designer, architect, designer </li><li>  <b>Judge</b> - critic, appraiser, controller, investigator, analyst </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Commander</b> - General, Director, Head, Manager, Lord (Lord, Lord) </li><li>  <b>Trainer</b> - educator, psychotherapist, teacher, trainer </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Performer</b> - soldier, subordinate, official, servant (servant, slave) </li><li>  <b>A mercenary</b> is a free artisan, a laborer concluding an agreement temporarily becomes a Contractor, for example, a peasant can sell his products to the state.  All the rest except Guests are the Performers of the State Program. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>A guest</b> is an ordinary person by default, not participating in a government mechanism, such as a minor child or a pensioner, or, for example, a nomad, or for example, someone can practice ten years of Chan Buddhism and sit in a cave like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">Damo</a> .  Not all people want to live in cities. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bd/43c/586/2bd43c5862764beaa95763b7f87c551b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In any society there are talents, the ability to develop and stimulate. <br><br>  At the head of society are Engineers and Judges, not politicians or accountants. <br><br>  Engineers invent new things, look ahead for thousands of years, develop strategies and tactics.  It is necessary to constantly develop and improve the body's program so that there are no diseases, cancer (sects), disintegration and death, so that the society continuously develops for thousands of years to withstand a direct nuclear strike and terraformation. <br><br>  Judges know the principles that Engineers embody, able to evaluate the work of a professional master, they understand the technology.  They know various legislative systems, from fair to deceitful, insane and criminal.  Understand the difference between useful and harmful, between health and illness, between talent and mediocrity, and so on.  They know the history of mankind, all the dark ages of ignorance, are able to reconstruct events.  They know the psychology of the criminal, they know psychiatry, they distinguish madness, they are able to make a diagnosis. <br><br>  Only real Judges have the right to judge, evaluate and punish; Jesus recommends to all the rest: ‚Äúdo not judge and you will not be judged‚Äù - mob rule and slander is a serious crime. <br><br>  The commanders organize the execution of the finished Program, understand the technology, ensure the stable operation of the system.  They know the Law and are able to evaluate and judge in case of emergency, they can be shot on the spot or fired.  Military security forces provide order. <br><br>  Trainers are able to educate and develop children and adults, talented psychologists, psychotherapists, use a training program developed by engineers, understand the technology, know the law. <br><br>  Performers are all those who wish to participate in the social mechanism.  The social structure must be attractive to a free citizen, for this, strict and strict order and rationality are needed in everything, without tolerance for madness and traitors. <br><br>  A mercenary can temporarily or permanently work in a public body, work in production, provide services, and sell products.  A mercenary can stop working and become a free guest and a nomad. <br><br>  We are all guests on this planet.  Hospitality is the foundation of a good life.  The state should be so developed and strong to ensure the reception of each Guest, for example, to provide everyone who arrives with a simple modular smart housing and communication, education and medicine, and food.  The guest is obliged to comply with the law, otherwise he becomes a violator or even an enemy.  Such a law-abiding citizen is in fact the Servant of Heaven and the Slave of God. <br><br>  Each participant must soberly and honestly assess their abilities, talents, knowledge, experience, and not go into those areas in which he can not be useful to the family, and vice versa can be harmful.  Everyone should do their work, and not pull the blanket over himself.  Ears can not perform the function of the eye.  Arrogance, stupidity and incompetence are deadly dangerous for the public organism - an empire or union may collapse, and as a result - mountains of corpses and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtears. <br><br>  The best and Great is, by definition, Jesus, the Artist who brought the most benefits to the Family. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Civil servants are the Army of Performers, with rigid discipline - figuratively speaking, Wolves, in the good sense of the word. They live mainly in cities, for example, a city of scientists or a production city. Their work is the development of science and technology, construction and production, the protection and survival of the people, the maintenance of order and justice, the provision of all citizens with a living wage - free medicine and education. Guests and Mercenaries are free people living closer to nature, in a different rhythm - figuratively speaking, Sheep, in the good sense of the word. Thus, "The Wolf and the Lamb will live together."</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/2ab/d70/f612abd70041479398e6b43e15bf7e5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the simplest and most effective program for building a strong collective mind and a sustainable social organism, theoretically. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can use this Model for organizing your family, village, state, and for the whole huge family of sensible peoples of the planet.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca5/78e/163/ca578e1632fc4ec2947032283a66c7fc.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325232/</a></p>
