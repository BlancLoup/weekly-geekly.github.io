It was an official (with the permission of the authors) non-commercial project. <br><br>  In short, the series is an image of the hero's computer screen, and only in a small corner is a live video in which we see him, and in which some real events sometimes occur.  The main action takes place in the virtual world.

      During the translation, and even after, many had the idea that it would be nice to make such a series, only about us, with our features.  After some time, an idea for such a series. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It will be like a ‚Äúscene‚Äù, in the sense that about IT people, about the Internet, file sharing and pirates, in about the same format.  This is how the original series looked like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6de/d51/b0c/6ded51b0c83c2d37cd3366877f84ec41.png"><br><br>  There will be about the same picture, but in our series there is a completely original story, which, as it seems to us, will be very interesting.  The plot is not related to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184910/">story</a> , which I now publish on Habr√©, it is a completely different story.  The plot itself should be a surprise for the audience, so for obvious reasons, I do not publish its description. <br><br><h4>  What do we have </h4><br>  There is a plot basis and a partly elaborated script.  The material is designed for 8-10 short web episodes with a length of 10-15 minutes.  There are a number of musical tracks for the background, selected from open libraries, as well as written by our friends and acquaintances.  There is a dedicated non-stop server for chat, ftp, etc. <br><br><h4>  What do we need </h4><br>  First of all, I want to say that this will also be a non-commercial project, that is, it may be possible to donate in some form, but this is not our goal, and we do not count on any financial benefits.  Therefore, we appeal specifically to those who like the idea: if you want to participate, offer your help or advice, we will be glad to all offers. <br><br>  1. You need a screenwriter to work out all the details of the plot.  I came up with a story, but I do not have enough experience to reveal it in detail, to create realistic portraits of characters, additional storylines, especially considering the unusual artistic form of the film. <br><br>  2. Looking for actors.  How many characters there are, as yet unknown, will depend on what the screenwriter thinks up.  At least there will be two main characters, both IT specialists, one older, 35-40 years old, the other younger, 25 years old. <br><br>  3. Specialist on working with video to make a screensaver, and possibly some special effects. <br><br>  Communication methods: in a personal, <a href="">mail</a> <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> thanks to everyone who responded, I will definitely answer everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187070/</a></p>
