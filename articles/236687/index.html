It looks like this (yes, yes, this ice bowl did not pass us either): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dlB_5dOc0k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  How did these videos become a viral summer event?  Why were the videos able to do in a month what was not possible before even articles in the media - to collect almost one hundred million dollars for a completely unprofitable business?  Business owners and marketers have something to think about in this story.  In the meantime, you decide whether to include in your budgets the costs of competent video marketing or not, we suggest you read the translation of the article by Emily Alford, made by hardened douche translators from <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dice_bucket">Alconost</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Ice Bucket Challenge campaign was launched in Boston in honor of 29-year-old Pete Fratis (Pete Frates) - former captain of the baseball team at Boston College, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease) two years ago.  The rules are simple: if the challenge is given, the participants have a choice: either pour cold water from a bucket or donate $ 100 to the foundation's charity work against the ALS.

      President Obama chose the latter: however, most of the participants do both.  And the results of this popular viral campaign are astounding.  According to the ALS Association, the Ice Bucket Challenge participants and those who simply enjoyed watching the video received $ 94.3 million donations between July 29 and August 27, which is significantly more than the $ 2.7 million donated to the fund over the same period. last year. <br><br>  Although the Ice Bucket Challenge was definitely beneficial for the ALS Association, the campaign was not launched by the fund: the campaign was conducted by the participants themselves.  However, social media market participants and those who are interested in fundraising from the hottest campaign of this summer can learn a valuable lesson from ‚Äúnational marketing‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/456/7f8/6e5/4567f86e535f40708137a13a3fb04f96.jpg"><br><br>  According to Gene Lewis, partner and creative director of Digital Pulp, the secret to the success of the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign is that it‚Äôs almost impossible to ignore such a challenge. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúLike many other things - simple, interesting and successful, the Ice Bucket Challenge is now taken for granted.</i>  <i>Why haven't we thought of this before? ‚ÄùHe</i> says.  <i>‚ÄúThis campaign has everything to be viral: it is funny and funny, personal and with wide coverage.</i>  <i>It is for both children and adults;</i>  <i>it is extremely intensively shared on social networks, but the main thing is that it is overwhelming, and not only in words.</i>  <i>You are challenged in front of the whole world!</i>  <i>This is not just a status update, which will not be remembered soon: it is a personal challenge that cannot be ignored. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Bob Cargill, director of social media at Overdrive Interactive, believes that another important reason for the success of a campaign is its social nature.  <i>‚ÄúIn the era of <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2340773/10-types-of-visuals-to-boost-your-social-media-engagement">selfies,</a> more people than ever are happy to demonstrate their support for a common cause or brand commitment, especially if they gain something in the process.</i>  <i>This is what the success of this campaign can teach social media market participants and those interested in raising funds</i> , ‚Äùhe says.  In this case, the participants acquire what they themselves become part of the event, namely, <i>‚Äúthe personal satisfaction that any philanthropic act brings, and the public approval received from friends</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And finally, the key aspect of the campaign‚Äôs popularity is its brevity, explains Rob Moritz (Rob Moritz), the editor-in-chief of the social media department at Innocean USA: <i>‚ÄúFrom a social media management (SMM) perspective, the main thing here is that on the action itself, and on viewing takes a matter of seconds.</i>  <i>This short entertaining content is as easy to replicate as it is to share</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Of course, the viral success of the Ice Bucket Challenge was completely unexpected.  Specialists in SMM should definitely mention the psychology of this success, but the creation of content for viral purposes should still be treated with great caution.  After all, expectations often turn out to be a <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2307136/i-want-our-brand-content-to-go-viral-thats-a-thing-right">negative reaction from the audience</a> .  A more reliable solution is to focus on the consistent production of quality content related to the brand.  <i>And in this we at <a href="https://alconost.com/services/video-production%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dice_bucket">Alconost</a> are ready to help you!</i> <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dice_bucket">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
