Perhaps you already know about the features of <a href="https://www.dash.org/ru/">Dash</a> cryptocurrency?  In my previously published materials, I wrote in particular about one of the key advantages of Dash, <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24552/">the decentralized management and financing system</a> built into the protocol.  The bottom line is that this System distributes 10% of the reward for new blocks (as opposed to Bitcoin, where all 100% go only to miners) - projects aimed at developing the Dash ecosystem.  Details about this can be found <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262310/">here</a> and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/17260/">here</a> . <br><br>  Until now, this was purely theoretical for me, but recently I personally personally posted a budget proposal on the Dash network, and as a result of the vote I received funding in the amount of 250 DASH (at current exchange rate it is about 120 thousand rubles). In this article I want tell about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So ... Usually the opportunity to participate in the rapid development of the cryptocurrency sector implies the need to make some kind of ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù (for which most people don‚Äôt have money).  My experience tells about the alternative side - about the opportunity, without investing anything, to receive a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), such as Dash.  Dash not only has a Distributed Management System, but (most importantly) an Integrated Autonomous and Decentralized Finance System.  Are you interested in the opportunity to become a ‚Äúmercenary blockchain‚Äù (total payments in this System exceed 7,400 DASH (at the current rate it is&gt; 50.000 USD) per month)?  Then let's go! <br><br>  So, every month the masternode operators (each of which has one vote) conduct a vote embedded in the protocol of the decentralized network.  They can vote as ‚ÄúFor‚Äù individual projects, and ‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù them.  When launching this system in 2015, there was some lack of good offers, but at the moment we are seeing quite intense competition for a limited development budget.  For example, some of those proposals that even scored the required minimum of votes did not receive money, as they were supplanted by other, more popular, alternative budget proposals. <br><br>  The status of the April vote can be viewed in this table: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d71/25c/7ce/d7125c7ced9c47edba39de13b087713d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The status of current offers for May is conveniently tracked here: <a href="http://dashvotetracker.com/">http://dashvotetracker.com</a> <br><br>  I have been involved in the active life of the Dash cryptocurrency community since 2014, and during that time I managed to earn a certain positive reputation (I created a number of promotional materials, wrote articles, and so on), which helped me gain the necessary support for the network when voting.  I conducted my activity on volunteer principles, but in some cases inevitably have to spend money on the purchase of ‚Äúsemi-finished products‚Äù, hiring freelancers, etc. <br><br>  People who have been monitoring the results of my work for a long time, wanted to support my initiative, which I <a href="https://dashtalk.org/threads/pre-proposal-discussion-alex-ru-promotional-initiatives.8434/">submitted for discussion on the Dash forum</a> . <br><br>  In addition to my proposal, a number of other interesting projects were supported that could benefit the Dash project.  Among them are such as: <br><ul><li>  Encouraging members of the core development team; </li><li>  Works on Dash Integration into Lamassu Bitcomat; </li><li>  Cost recovery for the creation of the Dash'n'Drink Apparatus for the Bitcoin Conference in Miami; </li><li>  Budget for marketing and promotion; </li><li>  Adding Dash to ROKOS products based on Raspberry Pi; </li><li>  Creating a plug-in for receiving DASH payment in online stores working on WordPress WooCommerce; </li><li>  Development of the next generation specification of the Dash Evolution system; </li><li>  Compensation for maintaining the Dash Electrum servers necessary for the operation of ‚Äúlight wallets‚Äù; </li><li>  Compensation for the purchase of the domain dash.org; </li><li>  ‚Ä¶ other. </li></ul><br><br>  Within this system, Payments can be either one-time or monthly, recurring ... Now there is a revision of the Dash Budgeting System, which will support work with irrevocable contracts and a number of other tools. <br><br>  Anyone can post their proposal from the network, but not all offers will receive funding.  Of course, few people will support the advance payment to the newcomer, for whom there is nothing worth but promises like ‚Äúgive me money, and everything will be cool‚Äù.  Attempts of this kind have already been made by incomprehensible people without any reputation and have been successfully ‚Äúmined‚Äù.  At the same time, many ‚Äúthird-party companies and professionals‚Äù were financed, who had nothing to do with the Dash project before, but were able to earn a positive reputation in other areas, from programming to journalism ... <br><br>  If you have something to offer to the Dash project, and you are ready to provide competitive prices and a clear rationale - getting money directly from the Dash blockchain was not a big deal for you.  You can place your offer not only through the Dash wallet terminal, but also through adapted convenient web interfaces - I can recommend this website to use, through which I published my offer: <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/budget">www.dashwhale.org/budget</a> <br><br>  But before spending the 5 DASH sentences required for posting (paid posting is protection against spam attacks), it is strongly recommended to create a topic with a preliminary discussion on the forum dashtalk.org, get opinions and recommendations of the community regarding your proposal.  (to discuss and lobby your proposal, it is advisable to speak English, since the main part of the community does not speak Russian) <br><br>  If you need any help on the procedure - you can always clarify everything on the forum (there is also a Russian-language section) - or write to me in a personal - I will help as much as I can! <br><br>  Details on the theoretical part of the System of Decentralized Management and Budgeting of the Dash network can be viewed, for example, in this video (turn on Russian subtitles): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYo8dRnO00g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  General information on Dash: <a href="https://www.dash.org/ru/%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0-dash/">www.dash.org/ru/prefimu-dash</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300000/</a></p>
