    <blockquote>  Thus, we are sure that Ross 128 b is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B">rocky planet</a> - he says.  ‚ÄúUnlike Proxima Centauri, the Ross 128 is considered‚Äú quiet ‚Äù, so it emits significantly less radiation, which can harm the life we ‚Äã‚Äãknow. </blockquote><br>  If this news is not interesting enough, it also has another side related to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI">SETI project</a> aimed at finding extraterrestrial civilizations.  Earlier this year, Ross 128 of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">Planetary Community</a> (the author of the original publication - approx. Lane) already made an announcement about this star, from which it seemed to be a semi-repetitive signal.  The signal was later explained by noises from a geostationary satellite, but this announcement again returned to the game Ross 128 as a potentially habitable star system.  This discovery will soon make this system a target for many observations, including the SETI radio telescopes. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the light of the new discovery, we are considering additional observations in the radio and optical range,‚Äù says <abbr title="Andrew siemion">Andrew Simion, director of the SETI research center at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">the University of California at Berkeley</a></abbr> .  ‚ÄúThe nearest exoplanets are especially interesting from the point of view of SETI, since they allow us to search for and potentially detect much weaker signals than from more distant sources. </blockquote><br><h4>  Habitability </h4><br>  <i>The most important question: Is planet Ross 128 b habitable?</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">The</a> star's <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">habitability zone</a> is the region of the distance to the star, in which liquid may exist on the surface of the planet.  Depending on the temperature of the star, this region varies.  In our solar system, this range is roughly between the orbits of Venus and Mars.  But for colder stars, even planets closer to this region may contain liquid water. <br><br>  Ross 128 b falls under this scenario.  The parent star is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">red dwarf</a> , which means the smaller mass of the star and the temperature on its surface is almost two times lower than that of the Sun.  Ross 128 b is 20 times closer to a star than Earth and it takes about 9.9 days to complete a full circle around its star.  However, due to the lower temperature of the star, this should give the planet a temperature between -60 and 20 ¬∞ C.  It is highly likely to place it in the habitable zone, but scientists cannot yet state this with certainty. <br><br>  Just being in a habitable zone does not guarantee the Ross 128 b that it is actually habitable.  Many planets in red dwarfs are in a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">tidal capture</a> , which means that all such planets are always turned by one side to their star, which makes one side of the planet much hotter and the other cooler.  And both of these states are not conducive to sustaining life. <br><br>  In addition, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">solar flares</a> from red dwarfs like Ross 128 and Proxima Centauri are a source of ultraviolet and x-ray radiation, which is detrimental to earthly life forms.  However, since Ross 128 is a less active star than Proxima Centauri, it is now ‚Äúthe closest place for a comfortable stay of life,‚Äù <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1736/%3Flang">according</a> to data from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258E%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">European Southern Observatory</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4CnneMrcmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Opening </h4><br>  European scientists have found the Ross 128 b using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Accuracy_Radial_velocity_Planet_Searcher">HARPS</a> - a 3.6-meter telescope at the Chilean <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F">observatory of La Silla</a> , working on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">separation of starlight</a> into its frequency components.  Exoplanets also attract their stars and cause them to oscillate slightly.  This leads to small fluctuations in the stellar spectrum, and following these shifts, HARPS can detect the presence of planets orbiting this star.  In this case, HARPS took data collection for about a decade to eventually discover Ross 128 b. <br><br>  Being just 11 over.  years, Ross 128 b is already our star neighbor, but it‚Äôs also interesting that this planet is going to visit us: the star is moving in our direction and will overtake Proxima Centauri in the rank of the nearest star after 79 thousand years. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ut/vm/hg/utvmhgbrgothspgxpb8cphjfiyi.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>The star Ross 128 is located near the Virgo constellation in the center right and highlighted in red</i> <br><br><h4>  Red dwarfs and SETI </h4><br>  Cold and light red dwarfs are the most common type of stars - at least in sunny environments.  In fact, it is easier to detect exoplanets near red dwarfs for the reason that they are dimmer (not one of them is visible from the earth with the naked eye), thereby not illuminating their surroundings with them.  In addition to this, planets close to their star like the Ross 128 b are more visible, which makes them easier to search with tools like HARPS. <br><br>  Red dwarfs are also a frequent target for a SETI project search, mostly because of their prevalence.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Listen">Breakthrough Listen</a> Yuri Milner along with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2582_SETI">institute SETI</a> listen to the radio <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2017/20171025-seti-anybody-out-there.html">on the subject of signals</a> from stars from our nearby environment. <br><br>  When Mendes‚Äôs team was looking at these results, they found something unusual: some strange, semi-repetitive signals from Ross 128. The signal had a frequency of about 5 <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2586_(%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">GHz</a> (currently widely <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">used</a> in WiFi networks - approx. Lane) right in the middle of a typical SETI search range in 1-15 GHz.  The signal did not look local, since <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE_(%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">the Aresibo telescope did</a> not detect such signals.

His team plans to continue observing this system. <br><br>  So Ross 128 b is potentially inhabited by the world, however, no signs of the existence of aliens have yet to find this moment.
