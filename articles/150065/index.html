  <section class="page js-page"><h1>23 reasons not to believe in bullshit about working in large companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I very often come across a repost of an article about how bad people work in big companies.  It is necessary for someone to post this nonsense, as a crowd of disgruntled hamsters immediately rushes in and begins to cry out that all this is true and big companies rob them of their best years of life, without giving anything in return.  Whenever I see it, one thought arises in my head as a sneaker: ‚ÄúFind another job, work you through a yoke!‚Äù If I have the imprudence to voice this thought, I usually object that all companies are the same, everything is bad, and in general, on May 4, 1925, the Earth will fly on the celestial axis. <br>  Well, let me give you a slightly different view of things.  I am 25 years old, and I work as an ordinary software engineer in a large company whose name is not disclosed in the interests of the investigation.  In this small article I will go through a hot iron of satire on each of the points of the original article, and explain why this is a complete bullshit.  Most of the examples will be a description of the real situation in our company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br><h6>  1. ‚ÄúYou will never get a career growth that satisfies you‚Äù </h6><br>  In our company, most of the chiefs went through a full career from an ordinary developer.  Yes, our CEOs come outside, but show me people who can really pull out the work in this position.  For some reason, most representatives of the office plankton believe that the general director is doing what lies in the hammock, sipping cocktails in the company of fluffy blonde blondes.  Few people think that his duties include, for example, negotiations with large customers and selling them the final product on favorable terms for the company. <br><br><h6>  2. ‚ÄúInitiative is punishable‚Äù </h6><br>  If you work in a public institution, then maybe it is.  If the company aims to make a profit, it cannot afford to be rigid and inert.  Our initiative is strongly encouraged: there are special projects like the ‚Äúfactory of ideas‚Äù and R &amp; D laboratories that consider projects to improve the production process and the final product.

      <br>
    <h6>  3. "You will not be able to express your opinion in public" </h6><br>  Another problem of a weak amoeba, for which office plankton blames the company.  If someone suddenly wrote a govnocode or came up with a crooked architectural solution, they will immediately inform about it.  Grow eggs - be a man, bleat!  :) <br><br><h6>  4. ‚ÄúTeam!  Team!  Team! ‚Äù </h6><br>  It already depends on the team itself.  Again, if the team has a weak amoeba, they will allow the self-sucking manager to carry out any experiments on themselves.  We were lucky with this: a great team was selected in the department, and we were not afraid to go for a beer or go roller skating.  Just because the cool guys gathered around. <br><br><h6>  5. "You will lose emotions" </h6><br>  And again, the personal problem.  If you are so shy that you don‚Äôt want to show emotions anywhere other than your favorite online game, then these are cockroaches in your head, and not the destructive influence of the company. <br><br><h6>  6. "You will forget how to be daring and get used to the working pace adopted by the company" </h6><br>  If the author considers the ability to dare as an undoubtedly positive skill, I am truly sorry for him. <br><br><h6>  7. ‚ÄúYou will be taught what ZHPP is (ass-cover letters)‚Äù </h6><br>  It sometimes happens, I will not argue.  Although, people who really have something to do, rarely participate in this. <br><br><h6>  8. ‚ÄúYou will learn not to listen to people who talk to you.‚Äù </h6><br>  I do not know where the author found this "majority."  Naughty from the heart. <br><br><h6>  9. "You will learn to spend most of your time in useless negotiations" </h6><br>  If you develop a great product, then you will not do without meetings.  Just because there are too many people involved in the process, each of whom has his own vision of the problem.  Yes, sometimes negotiations come to a standstill and the councilors start walking in a circle.  In such cases, we take a timeout, think about their behavior, and meet again.  A healthy discussion process is good.  Without this, the output will be a monster of Frankenstein. <br><br><h6>  10. "You will not have problems with late" </h6><br>  If a person is broken, the company is not to blame.  Personal discipline is the business of each individual, and for that she is personal.  If a person is late everywhere, then, most likely, he does it outside the office. <br><br><h6>  11. "You will become caffeine addicted and love toilets." </h6><br>  Here I can only say about myself.  I never tolerated coffee and two years of work did not completely change the situation.  It is enough to go to bed before midnight and there is no need for doping.  And drinking tea with colleagues in the morning is always a pleasure :) <br><br><h6>  12. "You will spend 12-14 hours at work" </h6><br>  With this, we are also lucky and the attitude towards the employee in this regard is very loyal.  I can leave work at 5:00 pm, and then spend half the night at home on an interesting task, because a brilliant idea came :) This, of course, is a cliche, but Confucius was right when he said: ‚ÄúFind yourself an activity like you, and you don‚Äôt I have to work a day in my life. ‚Äù <br><br><h6>  13-14, 19. "You will start to think that you are undernourmed all the time" </h6><br>  Bayan, of course, but this is also a problem of a person, not a company.  The secret is one of the manifestations of the inferiority complex. <br><br><h6>  15-16.  "You will have excess weight and an ugly body" </h6><br>  I lift 130 kg in dead weight with my own weight of 75 kg.  Of course, among professional powerlifters, this is a very small weight, but it would be very interesting for me to look at the person who tells me in my face that I have an ugly body :) <br><br><h6>  17. "You will idolize Friday" </h6><br>  And what?  Friday is a great day, there are two days off in front of you, which you can spend riding on a board, climbing at a climbing gym or watching a TV series with cookies.  If someone systematically thumps on Fridays, then it is alcoholism, and not the fault of a large company. <br><br><h6>  18. "You will learn to sincerely rejoice at victories to which you have nothing to do with" </h6><br>  This is completely incomprehensible to me.  If the guys did an excellent job and achieved outstanding results, then why not be happy for them?  oo Again smacks of inferiority complex. <br><br><h6>  20. ‚ÄúYou will also love corporate parties‚Äù </h6><br>  Here I have a twofold attitude.  On the one hand, I see nothing wrong with eating at the expense of the company to which you spend so much time.  On the other hand, at such events there is often a certain share of corporate bullshit coming from the top leadership.  You can go to the bar where you can not hear the speaker, and eat cookies :) <br><br><h6>  21. "You will lose the startup spirit" </h6><br>  The so-called startup spirit is a separate topic.  In short, how many ‚Äústartups‚Äù do you know who receive real money from their project?  Not an investment from rich uncles, but a real loot brought by the project itself?  How many?  Here I am not one.  I can write a lot on this topic, so we roll up :) <br><br><h6>  22. "You will gain credits" </h6><br>  I do not have a single loan.  Yes, I take the subway.  However, my salary allows me to rent an apartment in Moscow, buy iPads and ride abroad.  What am I doing wrong? <br><br><h6>  23. Lolshto? </h6><br>  And even here the author deceived us, for there are only 22 points. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  There are several conclusions, and they are very simple. <br><ol><li>  A good half of the problems described in the article are the person‚Äôs personal problems resulting from an inferiority complex and other cockroaches in the head.  Of course, it is easier to put the blame on a big evil company than to pull yourself together and change something. </li><li>  There are companies in which the degree of cretinism really goes off scale and there are some problems described in the original article.  But there are also normal companies in which management is focused on productive work, and not on stroking its own ego. </li><li>  Therefore, the generalization that working in <i>any</i> large company is bad is wrong.  If you are a good specialist who wants to change something in your life, you will easily find a job that suits you.  If you are a typical weak-willed representative of office plankton, who only knows how to go through papers, then you have no one to complain about. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150065/</a></p>
