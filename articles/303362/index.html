  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do those who work a little have higher productivity?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The flexible schedule and distribution of mobile devices blur the boundary between work day and family dinner.  36% of employees regularly <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/07/why-checking-email-after-work-is-bad-for-your-career-and-health-2/">check mail</a> and other work communications during off-hours. <br><br>  Perhaps some managers are pleased with the availability of an employee at any time of the day or night, but as a rule, not for long.  Studies <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/working-hours">show</a> that exceeding 40 working hours per week leads to a collapse in productivity ‚Äî as the working day lengthens, the number of mistakes made grows exponentially.  And vice versa - several ways to properly spend your free time can increase productivity and inspire unusual solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/8e8/3a9/e9c8e83a9f58459998f1d87e50cec58f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Free time value</b> <br>  The endless to-do sheets and the desire for maximum productivity create for the employees (and their managers) the illusion that they do something, but it is not necessarily something necessary.  Bridget Schulte in the book ‚ÄúI have no time!  In search of free time in an era of universal time pressure, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/blog/kak-najti-balans-mezhdu-rabotoj-otdyhom-intervyu-s-avtorom-knigi-mne-nekogda-bridzhid-shulte/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dfree_time">recommends</a> moving from‚Äú confetti of time ‚Äùto‚Äú transparency of time ‚Äù- a state where you feel that you have time for everything you need and most strongly want to do.  For this, she recommends getting rid of all the lists and writing down all fragmentary thoughts that come to mind.  Then choose one single important task and do it right in the morning so that you feel great the rest of the day. <br><br>  Instead of filling the day with the maximum number of cases, it is more productive to perform two or three most important tasks, leaving yourself enough free time.  It is the time when our brain is not busy with purposeful activity that allows us to reboot, fill with energy and find unexpected solutions to old problems.  Switching to the free mode also helps better achieve the state of flow, which has become so fashionable to talk about lately. <br><br>  <b>In the beginning was the game</b> <br>  The game as a special human practice has long been interested in both cultural studies and economists.  Its main difference from any other activity is that the meaning of the game and the pleasure from it lies in itself, and not in the subsequent result.  Game elements in work and study (socialist competition was invented not out of the blue) significantly increase their effectiveness.  And the Dutch culture researcher Johan Huizinga, in his book ‚ÄúThe Man of the Game‚Äù, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ludens">asserts</a> that the basis of human society and all culture is precisely game, not work. <br><br>  The alternation of games and work significantly improves mood and well-being.  Allow yourself and your subordinates a half-hour break in the middle of the working day for football, kicker or ping-pong, and you will find a surge of strength and excitement after returning. <br><br>  <b>Focus on nothing</b> <br>  Meditation is a simple and effective way to achieve relaxation and get rid of extraneous thoughts.  In a paradoxical way, meditation saves time - it improves sleep and <a href="http://alifeofproductivity.com/what-you-can-learn-about-productivity-from-a-meditation-retreat/">concentration</a> , so returning to daily business will help the brain to cope with them much better. <br><br>  It is not necessary to start with a long practice - even a five-minute meditation in the morning or in the middle of the working day will have a significant effect.  To do this, you can use one of the applications to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/zenso-meditation-timer/id590280866%3Fmt%3D8">detect the time of meditation</a> and get back to business in time.  Although the best time for meditation is the period before bedtime. <br><br>  The old English proverb ‚ÄúAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy‚Äù is still relevant.  It is impossible to indefinitely demand high results from the brain, leaving no space for rest and play.  In the words of the American psychologist Eric Ericson: "The one who achieves an internal balance between three components: work, love and play, has the most complete life." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303362/</a></p>
