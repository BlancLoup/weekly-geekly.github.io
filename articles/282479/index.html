  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CRM: April theses from Ruli24</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Russian CRM market is going crazy.  And for good reason.  Users are constantly confronted with the term "CRM-system" and, sooner or later, they begin to search for their solutions, obeying partly the advice of colleagues, partly urgent need, partly fashion.  But at the same time, clients still do not fully understand what they want from the system and why it is for them at all.  Vendors only add fuel to the fire - in particular, the fact that the CRM system calls the corporate software of completely heterogeneous configurations: from simple contact managers (notebooks) to programs that closely approach ERP (now they are defined as <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iladaruli24/blog/274933/">xRM</a> ).  Using our system as an example, we will try to figure out what CRM systems are good for, who needs them and how justified it is to automate transactions, sales and, most importantly, customer relations. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/696/5f3/d0c/6965f3d0c3354b358dbb7d4e668a9a0d.png" width="700"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#127a00">Do you need it?</font> </h2><br>  The prerequisites for the implementation of a CRM system (hereinafter - CRM) are highly dependent on the structure of the company and the type of activity.  The systems themselves have long since moved away from the meaning of the program for customer accounting, transactions and sales automation.  Today, the leading CRM (in any case, those that are found in the reviews on Habr√©) offer users a wide functionality that can be implemented in three main ways. <br><br><ol><li>  <i>Functional CRM as a separate product</i> - developed, which includes the entire tool that has been accumulated by the vendor over the years of development.  Such solutions are powerful, optimized and, as a rule, meet the needs of several customer segments.  But this is their misfortune - as a rule, the functional and price differentiation is manifested rather weakly and the client who wants to get a program for sales with a call, overpays for the entire set. <br><br></li><li>  <i>CRM with widgets, plug-ins and connectors.</i>  The logic is as follows: the most basic functionality + for an additional fee (or in the finalization) the necessary features: mail, dashboards, telephony, instant messenger, site integration, etc.  This approach is good for those who prefer to choose their own functionality, but ultimately carries two risks: an increase in price due to add-ons and a loss of control over third-party applications that can fail at the wrong time.

    </li><li>  <i>CRM as a module of a larger system</i> , when it is part of a comprehensive automation of the entire enterprise.  That is, in fact, CRM, as in the first case, may be associated with other automation tools, but through seamless integration (since all modules belong to the same vendor).  At the same time, additional modules can be connected and disconnected as the company grows (we recently wrote about the laws of such growth).  The benefit is in saving on unnecessary functionality.  By the way, this is how the <b><a href="http://ruli24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">solution was</a></b> built. <b><a href="http://ruli24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">Ruli24</a></b> : CRM is a module of a powerful corporate information system (we also increasingly call it xRM).  At the same time, <a href="http://ruli24.ru/crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">CRM Rule24</a> and the organizer can be purchased separately using the SaaS model - an additional benefit from savings in IT infrastructure (everything is located in our cloud. By the way, we do not use third-party data centers, therefore we are responsible for the system's accessibility level). </li></ol><br><h2>  <font color="#127a00">What does CRM as part of xRM to all divisions within the company?</font> </h2><br>  <b>For the organization as a whole.</b>  First of all, this is the creation of a single information space due to the accumulation of all information related to the company's commercial activities.  It is the organization and control of business processes, when all steps are interconnected, regulated and strictly consistent.  CRM-system as a rearguard for the automation of a commercial service allows you to obtain data for managing pricing, assortment, competition policy, personnel and marketing. <br><br>  <b>For the sales department.</b>  CRM in this case is alpha and omega, it is working on organizing communication with customers and counterparties, accumulating information for effective segmentation and future additional sales, the work of sales managers is transparent and controlled.  At the same time, the presence of CRM protects the company from the loss of its client base - it is possible to fight against this vice of managers for the flexible distribution of access rights to the system.  With the help of a CRM system, managers collect, structure and interpret information about customer relationships. <br><br>  CRM is a handy tool for gathering information that managers and managers need.  Each manager in the course of working with clients records detailed information about each impact and parameters of the client, ranging from the details and ending with telephone conversations, which take place, including using CRM tools.  This forms the most valuable block of information - the customer base. <br><br>  And finally, <b>for the marketing department</b> .  In the conditions of developed online communications, the company wins, ready to make the most personalized offer for both the B2B sphere and B2C.  Marketing impacts (mailings, promotions, individual offers) should be based on information: customer segments, consumption profiles, SWOT analysis, ABC analysis.  Some CRMs (for example, our <a href="http://ruli24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">Rule24</a> ) also allow you to collect and process incoming leads. <br><br>  Once, in one of the telecom operators, an interview was held for the position of a marketer.  As is often the case in federal companies, the conversation was long, until the applicant was asked the question: ‚ÄúWhat is marketing in one word?‚Äù The answer was correct: ‚ÄúInformation‚Äù.  Indeed, any marketing decision should be based on information: analysis of the product range, customer profiles, sales, sales stages, external factors.  Only in the case of a comprehensive assessment of the data obtained and their detailed analysis can we get weighted marketing decisions that will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù.  All the rest is guesswork, no more. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#127a00">What is the essence of CRM?</font> </h2><br>  The essence of CRM is simple both from the point of view of the engineer, and from the user's point of view.  The client-server system architecture involves creating records in a database that is stored on a central server (in the case of <a href="http://ruli24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">Ruli24,</a> this is its own data center, and in a number of other cloud systems it has leased data center capacities).  All records are created by users using a graphical interface (card fields, table fields, etc.).  Then, as necessary, the following operations are performed with the data: editing, modifying, deleting, grouping, etc.  But this is how most applications work.  CRM is distinguished by close connectivity of the most heterogeneous data. <br><br>  <i>Let's look at the brick sales chain.</i>  <i>A client is drawn to the construction company.</i>  <i>The manager makes his details, contacts, gets a legal / physical person.</i>  <i>The client is interested in price.</i>  <i>The manager sends the price, sets himself a reminder for a clarifying call after three days.</i>  <i>Three days later, the manager calls and clarifies the need of the client, who answers that he is ready to buy three silicate brick trolley cars, but after 2 weeks.</i>  <i>The manager enters the event and reserves three trolleys in the warehouse.</i>  <i>The storekeeper sees the order and understands that there are only two trolleys.</i>  <i>He forms an application to the supplier.</i>  <i>Then the client redeems the brick.</i>  <i>The manager creates a package of closing and shipping documents.</i>  <i>A transaction is taking place.</i>  <i>The storekeeper writes off the goods.</i>  <i>The manager might not know that the trolley was purchased, the storekeeper might not know where the client came from and what channel he came from.</i>  <i>However, in a complex, analysts and executives receive a pool of related information.</i>  <i>It forms the basis of analytics and sales development strategies.</i> <br><br>  Inside the complex system Ruli24 CRM is implemented as a module that includes directories, reports, contacts, companies, leads (the company or person is already known, but not yet a client), transactions, calendar, and so on.  In the system Rule24 Processes to Customer Relationship Management include 6 tasks: Administrator CRM, CRM, CRM B2B, CRM B2C.  Technical support, Personal account Ruli24 (in demo mode, the functionality is still limited). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd8/871/f51/dd8871f514104ce8ba3de15379135f7e.png"><br><br>  Work with a client begins with a lead - object, information about which already exists, but the status of the client has not yet been assigned.  Leads are not taken into account in all modern CRM-systems, and in vain - competent management of relations with frets ensures their conversion into customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8a/ea2/c6f/d8aea2c6f4754e578056d83e9d74d759.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Lead segmentation by traffic source</font></i> <br><br>  Lida can be grouped by traffic source, by individual advertising campaigns.  All data can be viewed in tabular and graphical views. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/622/d30/74d/622d3074dc274aa7847894562b456364.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Lead segmentation by advertising campaigns</font></i> <br><br>  In Ruli24, you can analyze leads by product with indication of IP addresses, cities, traffic sources and advertising companies.  This allows you to prepare a suitable offer for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/200/79f/b7020079f0c546b99959b5edf44a980e.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Tabular view of lead data</font></i> <br><br>  For each Lida, you can add a note, a file with information, see the transition to the transaction, work with the contact, call statistics with the ability to listen to the recording, click statistics on the links in the e-mail list, subscribe to the list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/1d3/ff1/c581d3ff1c524a8cb8b6fd4a9366152e.png"><br><br>  CRM's lead management approach helps to convert them into clients on the basis of analytics, not randomness. <br><br>  Ruli24 differs from other CRM systems by customer segmentation.  For medium and large businesses, whose number of customers is large enough, you can keep records of market segments, grouping customers into different groups, such as status or industry.  For example, a company supplies workwear.  Then, for the purposes of sales and optimal marketing policy, customers should be divided into groups.  Further analytical work, reports, mailings will be conducted on the basis of such groups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e6/c12/cd7/8e6c12cd704e4a2581bac1ee09c2d639.png"><br><br>  In <a href="http://ruli24.ru/crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">CRM Ruli24</a> there is a set of ready-made reports in which you can get a set of aggregated data on various parameters.  All these reports together provide much broader information than the standard sales funnel. <br><br>  Reports are built using built-in operations: filter, grouping, analytics.  For all data, you can generate reports in the form of several types of graphs and reports in the form of "chess".  The reports use the so-called Dril method - clarification. <br><br>  First of all, reports are necessary for managers to assess business indicators, operational planning and monitoring, and develop new strategies.  Using the above simple tools, any user can build reports in several sections, analyze for any data and data elements.  Below are examples of reports on transactions that can be built in CRM Ruli24. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/060/a61/bb3/060a61bb3b31409985fcc6df489d8549.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Opportunity analysis of transactions as</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a90/a83/d45/a90a83d459ff4acd837e737836cd9316.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Opportunity to analyze transactions by stages and amounts</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a67/5e4/b3b/a675e4b3bd284fde853745ad045ae9b4.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Options for analyzing transactions by stages and number</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/167/882/3c8/1678823c862341a2b4f5cad8ca64f51e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4de/d2e/c49/4ded2ec49b234ad89bc0a91a7c3ce150.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Possibilities of analyzing transactions by source of interest</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4af/9da/55a/4af9da55a9b44e8bb6ae10cdb458d03a.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Opportunities to analyze transactions by state, performers and quantity in the ‚Äúchess‚Äù mode</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/ac3/f89/384ac3f89a1d47ad9ac3f33330f012ad.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Possibilities of analyzing transactions by status, performers, number and amount in the ‚Äúchess‚Äù mode</font></i> <br><br>  The approach to filling the card in CRM Ruli24 is different from other large CRM and is aimed at optimizing the speed of the manager - at the first stage, not all information is entered into the company's card, but only the most basic data.  At the same time, when creating a company, an entry is created in the contact table.  In the future, information on deals, orders and other blocks will be tied to a contact, company or group of companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b73/e7e/1e1/b73e7e1e150e43b3ab0196ce383517e0.png"><br><br>  Also in <a href="http://ruli24.ru/crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">CRM Rule24</a> managers and managers can create tasks in the calendar, drag them across the field, set reminders.  Thus, by opening the calendar, the employee sees all his tasks, crossing them in time.  By the way, it is CRM that helps to manage the schedule of meetings and transactions, set tasks aimed at constant contact with customers - after all, as is well known, one should not forget about those who bought, nor about those who became interested, but refused services.  At any time there may be a profitable offer that stimulates the sale.  All affairs in one list with affixed statuses manager can see in the tab "My affairs". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/123/57b/4cb12357b3fa4730bd32a5ca00618499.png"><br><br>  But on these basic things the <a href="http://ruli24.ru/crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">CRM Ruli24</a> functionality <a href="http://ruli24.ru/crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">does</a> not end.  This is not a complete list of what can be done in the system. <br><br><ul><li>  You can get customers as users with limited rights and create a personal account for each of them.  In this case, customers can use the CRM-system as a way to get technical support, see the status of their account, contract, bills, acts, payments, history of changes in tariff plans.  They can receive an invoice and pay it both through a p / account and through cards and electronic wallets such as Yandex, Money, Webmoney, etc. <br><br></li><li>  You can wind up and group leads to transfer them to client status or delete them. <br><br></li><li>  You can create your reports in any data section.  In terms of speed of building reports and the ability to upload data of any structure and any level of complexity, CRM Ruli24 can compete with renowned competitors.  Such capabilities are implemented through the use of a powerful Oracle database.  By the way, our clients do not pay for acquiring DBMS, since it is deployed on our side, and the client receives CRM as a service from the cloud (SaaS).  For small and medium businesses, this is a weighty argument.  In addition, Oracle is not very easy to maintain and administer - and these concerns are taken over by the Rule24 team. <br><br></li><li>  CRM gives the head of the department and the company a reliable control tool - the administrator can create and view current work plans for each of the managers, monitor and analyze all the work performed by those responsible with groups of assigned customers.  You can not listen to promises, but simply monitor the progress of the plan and make adjustments within the reporting period, while you can still fix something. <br><br></li><li>  As for primary and other documentation, this is often a problem point in foreign CRMs (they are sharpened by other principles, for example, invoicing, and need to be improved) and in Russian systems (only part of the forms are present, outdated templates).  In <a href="http://ruli24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3DCRM%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">Ruli24</a> there is the possibility of processing any documents necessary for the work.  This could be an invoice, a quotation, a contract, an act, an invoice, or any other document you need. <br><br></li><li>  CRM provides many tools for sales statistics, analysis and graphical presentation of data, telephony and much more. <br><br></li><li>  You can create download widgets for each manager and get a transparent picture of the sales department, redistribute tasks, adjust further actions. </li></ul><br>  The whole set of actions listed is possible precisely because of the well-thought-out system architecture, data connectivity.  In many ways, this is why the rest of the modules can be integrated with CRM without the slightest compatibility problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#127a00">Who needs CRM?</font> </h2><br>  From year to year, vendors talk about certain areas that, well, without CRM, well, just nowhere.  I think, as of 2016, the answer to the question of the subtitle is simple: "CRM is necessary for everyone who has customers."  The problem is what it should be and what tasks it should solve.  However, it is worth highlighting the groups that should definitely pay attention to this type of corporate software. <br><br><ul><li>  Institutions with a large flow of clients - individuals: medical centers, banks, sports clubs, cosmetics stores, service providers and exclusive products (optics, orthopedics, event).  For such companies, CRM, in the first place, is a tool to ensure the loyalty program: binding savings and bonus programs, discount cards, purchase history.  Companies of this kind are required to have a flexible assortment, identify and withdraw unclaimed positions in time.  Without CRM this is problematic.  Yes, and calling customers and making mailings from CRM is not an example easier than from an Excel file or a logbook. <br><br></li><li>  Institutions with a large flow of clients - legal entities.  If you work in the field of B2B, you must share the values ‚Äã‚Äãof time and commitment.  Accordingly, the software helps to keep time and keep a history of relationships. <br><br></li><li>  Companies whose sales have a long cycle - building long-term relationships, it‚Äôs most convenient to lead a client in CRM: you will not forget anything and get excellent analytics on the sales funnel, you will be able to identify at what stage of the cycle the most failures occur. <br><br></li><li>  Companies with complex organization of business processes.  In them, CRM should be integrated with other automation elements in order to turn routine processes into a real pipeline. <br><br></li><li>  Retail and retail stores that need an expanded inventory management and in the creation of loyalty programs. </li></ul><br>  Among vendors from time immemorial, there is a saying "If you put CRM in a company where there is a mess, you will get an automated mess."  Absolutely correct judgment.  However, if you have decided to change the situation in your business and restore order in affairs, then CRM can be an assistant from day one - this is almost the same as starting life from scratch. <br><br>  Thus, the CRM-system is able to solve important tasks within the company, aimed at optimizing the activities of employees. <br><br><ul><li>  An integrated approach to company management, accounting and information gathering due to the connectivity of system modules. <br><br></li><li>  Aggregation and interpretation of information for making management and marketing decisions, as well as for customer relationship management. <br><br></li><li>  Operational work of managers with calls and e-mail, processing customer requests due to the capabilities of telephony and service management. <br><br></li><li>  Preservation of data - to corrupt data in CRM is much more difficult than in Excel tables.  This is due to the use of a single database, the availability of a backup system for the database and the distribution of access rights to the system. <br><br></li><li>  Operative exchange of information between employees and departments: rotation of clients, delegation of tasks, coordination of orders and contracts. <br><br></li><li>  Client personification - addressing the client based on the card parameters and interaction profile. </li></ul><br>  As experience shows, companies come to the introduction of systems at a different stage of their existence.  I can not say that it is late - it is difficult.  And practically in the overwhelming majority of cases (if implementation problems were overcome), the result of using CRM turns out to be positive and affects the growth of the company's profitability.  So it's better late than never. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282479/</a></p>
