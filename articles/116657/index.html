  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startups: that Russian is good, then German is death?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On March 14, <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/">we</a> held a public lecture with the participation of German Mark Samver, co-founder of the European Founders Foundation.  To listen to the person who created German eBay, who invested in Facebook and LinkedIn, and now managing Groupon, people traveled not only from different parts of Moscow.  There were those who got to the meeting from the Voronezh and Volgograd regions, Karelia. <br><br>  Mark in Russia for the first time and honestly admits that he is not familiar enough with the general situation, with the opportunities and conditions for entrepreneurs and investors, the start-up market and other things.  Therefore, he even refused to communicate to the press - in any case, journalists would hardly have missed the opportunity to ask a question on any of these topics.  But the topics are painful - disputes about investors or whether it is worth going straight to western markets, periodically flare up at events, online and in the media.  To his fellow entrepreneurs, who came to the meeting in DigitalOctober, Samver could not answer: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>We can not find money in Russia!</b> <br>  ‚ÄúWhen starting something, do not think about millions.  50 thousand dollars is enough to start.  It is possible to find them, although it is very difficult.  You need to learn to sell.  I heard that in Russia there are still few investors.  But, probably, every project is appealing in 20. In the same States, business angels and venture funds are an order of magnitude more, but thousands of startups stand in line with them. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>I am building a global project - why should I spend money on the Russian market?</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI know that many of you aspire to start straight from‚Äú conquering the West. ‚Äù  Do not go to the global market too soon!  For a good start, it is important to gain a foothold "at home".  Do not lose concentration.  This is vital for your startup. ‚Äù

      <b>In the Russian market, for example, Yandex is quite popular, despite the fact that there is Google.</b>  <b>Groupon ready for competition from the "local"?</b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe take local managers to local branches.  They come up with action, understandable to the audience.  In Russia, they will probably sell discounts on vodka and a bath (laughs).  And Google has common standards, unchanged from country to country.  Perhaps that‚Äôs why now Groupon‚Äôs profits are higher than Google‚Äôs over the same period of existence. ‚Äù <br><br>  Not that Mark "broke the veil": it was often about basic things.  On which many, for some reason, still prefer not to concentrate.  Another thing is that the emphasis on them was made by a person with an interesting, large and quite successful experience.  So you should listen.  We hope, those who were, liked. <br><br>  And for all those who were not with us, a <b><a href="http://narod.ru/disk/8986086001/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%2520%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2520%25C2%25AB%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%2520%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%2520%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%2520Google%25C2%25BB_%25D0%2592%25D0%2595%25D0%25A1%25D0%25AC.mp4.html">video of the lecture</a></b> : we publish in our Habrablog a direct link to the full version of the material, which will not appear either in <a href="http://www.aif.ru/money/article/42007%3F1301480332">AiF</a> or on Theories &amp; Practices. <br><br>  Fully <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/news/7052/">question and answer section</a> with Russian entrepreneurs published here.
