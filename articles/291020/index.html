  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sign in to IT: Junior 2 Senior</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hey.  My name is Ivan Kryuchkov.  In brief, I‚Äôll tell you how I got into DataArt and how it all worked out. <br><br>  I interviewed the third time.  The first did not work because of bad English, I went to English courses on the same day, six months later I tried the second time, only the iOS-iOS vacancy was available, it was an exceptional voluntarism, because I knew nothing about iOS at all and had never seen , not that the code wrote.  Accordingly, did not pass a technical interview. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The third time decided to try another six months.  I prepared thoroughly, read Jeffrey Richter for the third time, tried to write a web application using the latest front-end technologies (then it was backbone.js).  I also didn‚Äôt really want the English to be checked by phone, because the pronunciation leaves much to be desired, and there are also problems with the quality of our cellular communication. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that during the interview they did not ask me anything about .NET, although they asked about everything: about the layout, about SQL, they talked for JS ...

      So finally I became a trainee. <br><br>  <b>Practice</b> <br><br>  I must immediately say that at this moment I had two years of development experience, an irrelevant position in DataArt, but still - experience.  Therefore, from the very beginning, I realized that no one would mess with me, no one would tell me how to do anything, they simply would not immediately give me complex tasks and would not ask for them to the fullest extent.  The practice was in line with expectations and I really liked it. <br><br>  In fact, it was a very interesting time of internship projects, since you almost belong to yourself, you do not have restrictions that impose paid projects (deadlines, technologies, other developers and their opinions).  Although I was very lucky with a mentor who did not tyrannize me.  Thank him so much for that. <br><br>  I can‚Äôt say anything terrible about a review once a month, I wasn‚Äôt tortured on them very much, and there was always something to tell.  It never looked like an exam, rather, a report on the work done. <br><br>  Three months later, at the end of the practice, I became a junior and got into the first paid project. <br><br>  <b>First project</b> <br><br>  With the first project, I think I was very lucky.  We had a very friendly team (out of work - joint trips to the river, etc.), the project started from scratch, there was a lot of work, technologies were new, a good development process.  In the beginning it was difficult, but interesting, because all the time I had to solve problems that I had not previously encountered.  The pace of professional growth was mad, I have never absorbed so much knowledge in such a short time and did not acquire so many skills.  It was the best period in DataArt, probably, I have never been so pleased with the work.  After six months on this project, I became a middle. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  I worked in DataArt for two years.  During this time - I figured - worked in seven projects.  Probably, I decided that it was time to become a signor, after half a year working in one helmet on a project, doing the whole range of tasks (I didn‚Äôt get the bugs myself), I worked almost directly with the customer (I didn‚Äôt invoice only).  In this situation, all the Fails are yours, because you are responsible for everything.  Therefore, responsibility and self-discipline are growing very well.  And these are more important qualities of a developer than knowledge of technology or patterns. <br><br>  DataArt is the best company in which I had to work and talk.  At the interview you are treated immediately as a specialist, although you know nothing.  Then - an excellent trainee program, introducing into the working rhythm and processes of an unprepared person.  Always a good attitude towards colleagues, which is also very important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291020/</a></p>
