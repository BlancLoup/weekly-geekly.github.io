  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Integrated security systems at large sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Integrated security systems </h4><br>  Good day dear reader.  I will tell about the device of networks and in general about the concept of work of complex security systems.  Speaking of "integrated security systems" (hereinafter - KSB), I mean a set of equipment, software and engineering structures.  What are they needed for?  KSBs are created to protect against terrorist threats, from unauthorized entry, to control the entire territory, buildings, and the perimeter of the object of protection, and of course from the ‚Äúfool‚Äù.  Currently, these systems are mainly equipped with energy facilities, large plants and other "critical" elements. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/e9c/4c9/9dae9c4c931c4f769133cdcb77293f2b.jpg" alt="image1"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1. Perimeter in one fence without any additional means of detection.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f96/7b7/8dc/f967b78dcfeb450092bb622afb526eb9.jpg" alt="image2"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2. Perimeter in one fence with a spiral barbed barrier and (possibly) triboelectric sensitive element at the bottom of the fence from the locker.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Is not it better to let the dogs with the protection?  It is difficult to answer this question unequivocally, especially since there is a government decree on the mandatory equipment of certain categories of objects.  The decree is a document of special use, so the article will not talk about it, nor will it talk about the nuances of this decree.  In order not to break anything and not to offend anyone, we restrict ourselves to the basic principles of protecting objects and describe some examples of the functioning of such systems. <br><br>  In order to determine whether it is interesting to you or not, I will describe a picture of what is happening: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      The intruder, making his way through the mesh fence with barbed wire, will climb over it or have a snack (perepilit) in any case.  At this moment, a vibration detection tool (or its type) will work, capable of perceiving different frequency ranges.  The cameras will turn to the place of penetration and this section will be displayed on the security console in close-up.  Behind the fence is a security zone (without mines), but with radio-beam sensors installed on it.  Once in the field of radio-beam sensors, the intruder will increase the alarm mode, the illumination intensity of this area will increase, an additional notification will appear with the number of the penetration area on the plan and with video information.  By this time, the rapid response team is already approaching, which is enough for the first warning and video recording from the camera.  Further, the intruder will approach the second, inner boundary of the fence, and from the inside and outside, armed guards will wait for him. <br><br><h4>  Technical part.  General information </h4><br>  To put it simply, the system has a single data center, usually one 19 "server rack and a couple of servers in it are enough. Naturally, by" data center "I mean a small hardware room, equipped with everything for normal equipment operation. Server receives from peripheral switches that collect information directly from sensors, it processes, analyzes, archives and responds. Any temperature-resistant, moisture-proof industrial switches can act as switches.  switches usually have ports for SFP and several Ethernet ports.The data to the switch comes from video cameras (usually powered by POE) and from security equipment units that have ethernet ports or are connected through a port converter. <br><br>  Information comes to the blocks of security equipment (there are already many options): <br>  - dry contact; <br>  - industrial RS485 interface; <br>  - the same ethernet. <br><br>  But more often than not, these are analog non-address sensors. <br><br><h4>  Technical part.  Perimeter </h4><br>  Now about the principle of operation more.  The conditional object has a perimeter.  Let our object be a huge factory or power plant, the perimeter length of which is just over 3 kilometers, and maybe five.  Usually, for ease of perception, the perimeter is divided into sections from 100 to 250 meters.  Speaking of simplicity of perception, I was a little cunning, in addition to the simplicity of perception, detection sensors - no matter what - tribroelectric, radioluch, accelerometers or others - usually work up to 200 meters (however, they also exist on the basis of an optical cable, they are much more long-range).  The gate is usually considered a separate section, a separate stationary camera is installed on the gate to help a heap of perimeter turning points.  We look at our perimeter in the section and see, here's what: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d1/109/203/3d1109203909438493ec5a1ad13ad073.JPG"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3. The perimeter with the existing external concrete fence, equipped with a visor.</i> <br><br>  The fence on the perimeter is double and each with barbed wire, in addition, the external is equipped with triboelectric sensors.  This means that if we shake it, shake it, or try to climb, it will work.  There are supports between the fences and illuminate the entire obstacle course so that the cameras can see everything perfectly.  Also in the obstacle course, we see small columns ‚Äî these are radio-frequency sensors; they work when an object hits their magnetic field and changes resistance in the field.  Following the electromagnetic field of the sensors, the final frontier is the inner fence, all passages through which are also equipped with magnetic sensors. <br><br>  Thus, all perimeter security systems work together and are based on different physical principles.  In this case, there are still a lot of nuances - such as the antidoped grating, also equipped with vibration sensors and so on. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is a lot of information and each part is considered in detail - it‚Äôs very volumetric.  However, you can grab certain layers and describe them in technical details.  I would like to find out what aspects, it would be interesting to write a less ‚Äúcommon‚Äù article on a specific topic. <br><br>  A. What I would like to continue in the following article: <br>  Technical part.  Types of sensors. <br>  In case of successful joining the community, I undertake to tell about the types of sensors used (in most cases), they are all from different manufacturers and are based on different principles of exposure and information. <br><br>  B. Technical part.  Transfer of information. <br>  Most and many more know about information transfer here, there have also been a number of fairly detailed articles on the use of optics, but I can approach this problem from other sides and describe other aspects of problems and solutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363383/</a></p>
