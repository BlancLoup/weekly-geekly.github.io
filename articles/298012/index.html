  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GitHub silence: community members cannot force platform management to correct platform errors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Developers and hosters of some large open source projects complained about the poor performance of the <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> platform.  They sent a letter to the management.  Many community members are upset because the glaring flaws in the platform are still not fixed. <br><br>  There is no implied management response to the proposed solutions: it either does not respond, or responds extremely formally, without undertaking anything. <br><br>  The community has a few key suggestions for improving the GitHub platform. <a name="habracut"></a>

      First, developers are asked to add a system of feedback templates for users of software products.  Now users describe the errors found and requests for product improvement are not complete.  In addition, they do not have the ability to track the process of developing new features and "correctional work", which were initiated by users. <br><br>  Templates would save time and developers, and users would make the interaction between them more productive. <br><br>  Secondly, the developers are asked to implement the opportunity to vote for the project without commenting on it.  For example, add a button "+1" or a set of reactions Emodzhi. <br><br>  Thirdly, community members are asked to consider the possibility of displaying the contents of the CONTRIBUTING.md file in a visible place.  It contains all the information about how to join the project, how the user leaves a request for revision and "kick" developers when such requests are ignored. <br><br>  Earlier, in the <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/commit/fc94eba9277a97dfaeb4f83a8dff355afb1a0eb2">previous</a> version of the letter, these proposals were much more.  Now their number has decreased to three.  And even the management has not yet adequately responded to these three simple sentences. <br><br>  On GitHub, in terms of open source software development, the whole process should be as transparent as possible.  Therefore, the abundance of narrow and "dark" places in this sense seems at least strange. <br><br>  The answer from GitHub comes down to the fact that they take the letter very seriously and even work on several sentences.  They are looking for ways to better implement all this. <br><br>  When the story of the rejected complaints from the developers was just beginning, the GitHub guide would easily let it go.  But now she was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D10904671">made public</a> in the media.  Community members were supported by more than one and a half thousand developers, comrades in misfortune, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/01/19/frustrated-developers-from-the-webs-biggest-projects-say-github-isnt-listening/">reports</a> The Next Web.  Therefore, there is hope for the best. <br><br>  GitHub is the largest web service for hosting IT-projects and their joint development.  Based on the Git version control system and developed on Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub Inc.  The service is absolutely free for open source projects and provides them with all the features. <br><br>  Such large projects as Node.js, jQuery, Ember.js, Bootstrap, Grunt, Meteor, and hundreds of others are developed on GitHub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298012/</a></p>
