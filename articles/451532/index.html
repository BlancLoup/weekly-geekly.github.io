It helps both government and private organizations to effectively manage their values ‚Äã‚Äãand digital archives.  Not long ago, Museos Abiertos <a href="https://twitter.com/MuseosAbiertos/status/1123366005768687616%3Fs%3D19">published a</a> map of the <a href="https://www.museosabiertos.org/blog/mapa-de-museos-de-la-ciudad-de-buenos-aires">museums of</a> Buenos Aires (Argentina). </li><li>  Jasebi <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/3767">made a request</a> to display on the main OSM (Catro-CSS) filesystem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge">ridges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar%25C3%25AAte">peaks</a> .  Nothing has yet been decided, but discussion and ideas may be useful to anyone interested in mountains and countryside. </li><li>  The Association of Rail Operators of Great Britain ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rail">National Rail</a> ) has developed a <a href="http://accessmap.nationalrail.co.uk/">map of</a> rail station accessibility for people with disabilities.  OSM is used as a substrate. </li><li>  In Belgium, four public transport operators jointly developed the Smart Mobility Planner (Smart Mobility Planner), which takes into account the information transmitted in real time by each of the operators when building the route.  Routes are built on a map that is based on OSM. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Mapping </h2><br><ul><li> Started voting for the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/camp_site_pitch"><code>camp_site=camp_pitch</code></a> , which was <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-May/044990.html">proposed</a> by n76 exactly four years ago.  This tag is proposed to mark places for tents and caravans on the territory of campgrounds. </li><li>  The user amilopowers <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-May/045023.html">suggests</a> using tags <code>surface=whispering_asphalt</code> or <code>surface=silent_asphalt</code> mark a special type of asphalt (‚Äúwhispering‚Äù), which would allow to estimate the level of noise pollution on the roads.  However, most commentators on the Tagging mailing list find it better to use other tags for this, for example, <code>asphalt:type=*</code> , <code>asphalt=whisper</code> or <code>noise_reducing_surface=yes</code> . </li><li>  In iD, <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/commit/cdd624b41bd206638cd823a8df94eca3d3596d55">a</a> tag <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/commit/cdd624b41bd206638cd823a8df94eca3d3596d55">appeared</a> for what is forbidden in most countries: <code>shop=cannabis</code> . </li><li>  <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/changing_table">Changing tables for changing tables</a> ( <code>changing_table=*</code> ), developed by Velor Naram, received an ambiguous assessment after it was voted on. </li></ul><br><h2>  Software </h2><br><ul><li>  Bryan Housel <a href="https://twitter.com/bhousel/status/1124869535440494592">announces</a> that in the next version of iD, users will not be able to delete items with the wikidata tag.  This is explained by the fact that inexperienced users often delete the necessary data without realizing it.

They managed to find and digitize not only old maps of many cities, but also such "diamonds" as the Mumoldus Mercator's " <a href="https://www.oldmapsonline.org/map/cuni/1039192">Orbis terrae compendiosa descriptio</a> " (1587). </li><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/guyshrubsole">Guy Shrubshol</a> from Friends of the Earth (UK) wrote a <a href="https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008321697/who-owns-england-how-we-lost-our-green-and-pleasant-land-and-how-to-take-it-back/">book</a> on land ownership in England - <em>‚ÄúWho owns England‚Äù</em> ( <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/28/who-owns-england-guy-shrubsole-review-land-ownership">review</a> ).  For several years, he was in his blog talking about the details of the study, which in the end is easily the basis of this book.  For example, <a href="https://whoownsengland.org/2019/01/11/the-holes-in-the-map-englands-unregistered-land/">not so long ago,</a> he drew attention to the fact that almost 17% of the country's territory is not registered in the Land Registry (cadastral authority in the UK). </li><li>  May 2 marked the 500th anniversary of the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> .  He drew maps and plans of cities, as if he saw them from the air, for example, in 1502 he performed <a href="">the Imola plan</a> in this style.  In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2gEwEcYnewE%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dyoutu.be">small film</a> from VOX, it tells in detail how he did it. </li></ul><br><h2>  Community </h2><br><ul><li>  The founder of the <a href="https://osmghana.org/">OSM</a> office <a href="https://osmghana.org/">in Ghana</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Enock4seth">Enok set Nyamador</a> enrolled in the master's course in GIS technology in Munich.  Unfortunately, he failed to get a scholarship to the Erasmus Mundi program, and now he is trying to raise funds for his education through the crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/studying-msc-cartography">Go Fund Me</a> . </li><li>  <em>UNAM</em> Mexican TV channel <a href="https://twitter.com/openstreetmap/status/1124461905106604039">interviewed</a> OSM-Mexico community representatives Miriam Gonzale and Celine Zhakin. </li><li>  Valery Trubin began a series of interviews ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447850/">1</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449074/">2</a> ) with Russian mappers.  He is interested in how they came to OSM, how they see his future and that they want to change in this project. </li><li>  At the end of April in Russia there was a cartographic action <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D66032">"Spring entrances"</a> .  For one week, its participants noted the entrances to residential apartment buildings, as well as their rooms and apartment numbers in them.  As a <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D747797">result</a> , almost 1.5 thousand entrances were added to OSM. </li><li>  A researcher from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, Matthew Das, at the ACM CHI 2019 conference held <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">by the Computing Technology Association</a> , spoke about his <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm%3Fid%3D3300793">work</a> on gender analysis of the contribution of OSM participants in the United States.  They analyzed the edits of the 2 thousand most active users who marked or edited the POI.  Depending on the specifics of the POI, the information entered was related (in the author's terminology) to either ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù or ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù.  Previously, where it was possible, the gender of the participant was determined.  As in other papers, it was concluded that 95% of OSM users are male, but it cannot be said that the information entered is determined by the influence of gender. </li><li>  At the end of April, <a href="http://blog.kathmandulivinglabs.org/the-map-book-pokhara-metropolitan-city-in-maps-launched/">a</a> paper atlas of the city of Pokhara (Nepal) was <a href="http://blog.kathmandulivinglabs.org/the-map-book-pokhara-metropolitan-city-in-maps-launched/">released</a> , which was prepared using data from OpenStreetMap, as well as the Geonode web portal (project Secondary Cities - 2C).  With the support of the 2C Pokhara project, Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) collected data on the ground.  KLL also interacted directly with the local administration, which made it possible to add quite a lot of POIs related to health care, water supply, education and business. </li></ul><br><h2>  Imports </h2><br><ul><li>  Robert Bell ( <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/itsamap!">Itsamap</a> member <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/itsamap!">!</a> In OSM and bjjptq in Reddit) gives a <a href="https://amp.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/bjjptq/what_i_have_learned_after_being_involved_with">very detailed</a> description of how they accessed local data and then imported it into OpenStreetMap.

Therefore, licensing changes do not affect JOSM and the developers recommend continuing to use the current version Java, apply any updates and wait for the publication of OpenJDK, published by the community, which will be available on each platform. </li></ul></div>
