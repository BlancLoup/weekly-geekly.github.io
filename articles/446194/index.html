In the end-end - the paper can endure everything.  Need a cyborg girl?  No problems!  What we have now at the peak of popularity?  Sexual appearance?  Easy!  Incomparable to human physical strength?  Easily!  Oh yes!  Another pair of lotions in the form of a super-powerful laser built into the eyeballs (for some reason!) And X-ray vision.  Well, it started ...

      We went the other way.  And they tried on the pages of the novel to collect android, which does not give a damn about the laws of physics, and using the technologies of today or tomorrow.  The purpose of the article is to get your opinion, to listen to reasoned criticism and, possibly, to involve you in the process of further refinement of the android, whose birth will take place as early as 2023 in Dubna, in one of the laboratories of the powerful CYBRG corporation.  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/nika-veresk/era-vodoleya-nezrimye-uzy/">The first part of the story can be viewed here</a> .  Honestly, we have set ourselves a difficult task - to make the novel ‚ÄúThe Age of Aquarius‚Äù a kind of ‚Äúfusion of lyricism and physics‚Äù, and for this fusion to be strong enough, we just need your help!  All who are interested in this entry, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that the pseudo-science fiction, which now shelves bookstores and cinema screens in abundance, could never be compared in our understanding with the works, for example, of Stephen Hokking, who on the one hand largely remain fantastic hypotheses, and on the other , have a well-reasoned scientific rationale. <br><br>  It is such works that really catch on to the imagination and give food for the mind, direct it to the frontiers of the unknown, and not to the banal happy ending, where that same sexy cyborg girl who has burned all enemies to the last page finds happiness in the arms of an infinitely in love with her from flesh and blood.  By the way, if someone liked the picture below, it is taken <a href="http://www.fonstola.ru/268682-devushka-polet-oruzhie-fantastika-krylya-art-blondinka-kostyum.html">here</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/t3/p0/dst3p0lo3fet9ffyolipljiajzy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Science fiction, in our opinion, is not just a fairy tale for adults.  This is a vector that determines the direction of technical progress.  And this article is a brief overview of the existing attempts to create humanoid robots and an attempt to understand whether everything is ready for the appearance of the android described in the <a href="https://www.litres.ru/nika-veresk/era-vodoleya-nezrimye-uzy/">novel ‚ÄúERA of Aquarius‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  For those who are in business - welcome to Moscow in 2023, where people chipping is no longer a topic for discussion, but a social norm;  where a global corporation controls everything from your finances to the electronic lock on the door of your apartment;  where artificial intelligence takes on a human form, and the coming struggle for power threatens to turn the closest friends into sworn enemies.  With the lyrics for now, we return to reflections in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence. <br><br>  And now the floor is given to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/walker2000/">Walker2000</a> , who made an invaluable contribution to the writing of the novel, providing numerous technical advice. <br><br>  Hello! <br><br>  How is it possible to create an android, indistinguishable from a person, in the near future?  Suppose the task is to design this device.  And let there be an unlimited amount of resources and access to the most modern technologies.  We formulate a minimum list of systems that need to be developed: <br><br>  1. The musculoskeletal system (artificial bones, joints, ligaments and muscles, sensors controlling the position of body parts in space). <br>  2. Realistic artificial leather with built-in pressure and temperature sensors. <br>  3. Power supply (principle of operation, power output will have to be calculated). <br>  4. Sensors for obtaining information about the world (organs of sight, hearing, touch, smell). <br>  5. The communication system, namely, the device for articulate speech.  Here we also add a 5G transceiver and something like WiFi and a Bluethooth LE interface (hehe, a cyborg can have something like a built-in smartphone, which will be very useful for the cyborg host). <br>  6. Nervous system (apparently, these are wires for transmitting energy to artificial muscles, transmitting signals from sensors). <br>  7. The brain is composed of several subsystems. <br><br>  The brain is the most muddy organ in this whole story.  No one yet knows how it works, but it seems like they <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439410/">promise to tell you soon</a> .  But the artificial brain is likely to be represented by several subsystems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5n/yu/vj/5nyuvjdqessymmybr1ti4eu_u4a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first is a strongly truncated limbic system (control of movements, balance, orientation in space, control of the power supply system, thermoregulation). <br><br>  The second is receiving and processing information about the world around us (most of them will most likely have to be sent to the visual analyzer).  Also in this part there should be a sound analyzer, a gas analyzer for some reasonably limited set of chemical compounds.  Well, the analysis subsystem tactile and temperature sensors. <br><br>  The third - the most mysterious part that determines the identity of the cyborg.  It is a memory and experience of learning, judgment, desire, self-preservation instinct, feelings, analysis of one‚Äôs own emotions and social interaction.  In our novel, we came up with an organic cultivated substrate, which is absent in reality, with a huge number of neurons.  Well, here we have these neurons somehow agreed among themselves and suddenly began to form an individual) <br><br>  The fourth is a built-in smartphone with a straight several gigahertz bus connected to a part of the third brain.  For it is difficult at present to imagine an individual existing separately from a smartphone.  So why not to give our artificial individual a built-in smartphone with a direct bus to his big hemispheres?  ) <br><br>  Well, that's all.  If something is forgotten - feel free to write in the comments. <br><br>  Creating the most realistic android is quite a time consuming task.  Suppose that each of the above systems employs several dozen highly qualified specialists in the relevant field.  Plus, we need subcontractors for the manufacture of composite bones, for example, polymers for artificial leather, etc.‚Ä¶ Apparently, the cost of such a project will be commensurate with the creation of a new automotive platform and will cost several billion dollars. <br><br>  We are not aware of the fact that someone in the real (not fantastic) world swings at the solution of a similar task.  But if we are mistaken, and there are similar projects, we will be very grateful for the comments. <br><br>  At the same time, there are now quite significant successes in creating robots with one or several of the listed systems.  I believe that everyone already knows the robot Sofia from Hanson Robotics.  Developers are trying to endow it with outstanding (in the world of robots) communication skills.  By the way, last year <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/416993/">on Habr√© came wonderful material</a> with a lot of photo content on this topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/kx/vp/jtkxvpzqcjyfu_ze4dnygcy1tvk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLikxFZZO2sk">Boston Dinamics robots</a> are also widely known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLikxFZZO2sk">for</a> their advanced musculoskeletal system, and their developers are quite ethically controversial in their relationship with their robots) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/pg/tf/nepgtffcl9hsgetqdf-uwfz66qm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is an interesting example of a robot actor.  It is copied from the German playwright Thomas Melle and lectures on the book written by Thomas Melle himself.  A couple of years ago, he suffered from bipolar disorder and shed all his feelings on paper, writing a bestseller.  But here the main goal is not to replace a person, but rather to emphasize the difference between a natural and artificial person.  To do this, from the head of the "writer" pointedly stick wires.  In the video, which is shown in the <a href="https://www.bfm.ru/news/410180">announcement</a> , you can see the manufacturing process of such a robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/mf/0p/xkmf0p1ns1ooyk0o0rioghjcgs8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently on the Internet flashed the <a href="https://hightech.fm/2019/03/01/xr-1">news about the robot</a> , which has a very impressive fine motor skills.  He even knows how to thread a needle (honestly, a needle for this demonstration with a rather large eye).  On the video there are brief TTX devices.  Somewhat hooked is that the maximum load that can be lifted by a robot hand does not exceed 1.5 kg.  That is, if you assemble a realistic android-girl on a similar platform, it will not take anything harder than a clutch) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/7o/wo/sv7owou4ulwkluqbdklcjlwsz9q.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The successes in certain areas of Android are impressive.  But you can‚Äôt expect that in the next five years you will meet an android on the street, which will be very much like a person, it‚Äôs not necessary.  But in a science fiction novel - why not?  ) <br><br>  If the audience has an interest in the issue of android engineering, and the audience casts us links with more advanced examples of technologies or specific implementations of androids, we will continue this topic with pleasure. <br><br>  That's all for now.  Thank you very much for your attention and have a nice day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446194/</a></p>
