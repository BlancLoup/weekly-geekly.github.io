The client never knows the cost of the work.</strong> <br><br>  It is very rare to meet a client who understands how much what is really worth doing is done ‚Äî most of the clients have a certain budget and wishes for what needs to be done in the end.  Usually, neither about the technical specifications, nor about the ratings (assessment of the hour of work in monetary terms) - they did not hear or hear, but did not come across.

      <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  1) to ask to show the technical task and on it (and only on it!) To call the cost of work, always being ready to explain what this price is formed from (rate, time estimate, assessment of complexity, etc.). <br>  2) not to work with clients who do not know how much this or that work may cost at least approximately.  Very often it is necessary to be confronted with the fact that the client wants to create a CMS for $ 100. <br>  3) split the task into several ‚Äúsubtasks‚Äù, evaluating in turn which - in sum, you can add up the approximate price of the project. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 7. Literacy.</strong> <br><br>  Personally, I am not very pleased to communicate and cooperate with a customer who cannot competently write a few words. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><br><blockquote>  1) Overpower yourself and ignore literacy. <br>  2) Do not work with such a customer. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 8. The client always wants more than described in the TOR.</strong> <br><br>  While working on the project - most customers make many adjustments to what needs to be done.  Sometimes substantial, sometimes not very.  In my practice, there was a case when having made the second release of the system out of 3 six months after starting work on the project - the client sent a lot of clarifications and additions such that they hooked most of the kernel - as a result, the system had to be redone almost from scratch.  The client is good and old - so everything was decided simply by increasing the time frame and additional injections into the project budget. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><br><blockquote>  1) For everything that does not comply with the TK - initially stipulated before the start of work - take a surcharge.  But this is a more radical method and it is unlikely that the client will linger on you after this project. <br>  2) If the changes or minor additions - make them for free - the client will only be happy with this approach to business - and will return to you again and again if you successfully complete the project. <br>  3) If the edits are large and substantial, issue as additional costs in the course of the project and bill the client.  And most importantly - do not forget these moments initially to discuss before the start of development. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 9. The client is poorly oriented in technical aspects.</strong> <br><br>  First of all, the client is concerned with the successful completion of the project and the receipt of what he ordered.  However, the customer and the contractor understand slightly different things by many concepts.  In my practice, there was a situation when the customer thought that ordering a design - as a result, he would receive an imposing design in html format.  Although this is no longer a design - but a layout (or HTML coding).  As a result, I completed the layout for the client for free - but for myself I concluded that it is better to discuss all the details in advance. <br><br>  And such moments happen quite often.  Therefore, now every time when they order a design, I explain to the client what ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is and what the client will receive as a result.  This is much better than doing the work and finding out that the customer wanted to get something else. <br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><br><blockquote>  1) Be a little meticulous - find out all the details about the work and explain what the client will receive as a result of your work. </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Problem 10. The client believes that he is a pro in this area.</strong> <br><br>  This is probably the most difficult type of clients - very often, in fact, this is not a pro, but the usual ‚Äúzaznayka‚Äù, which the candidate for the master of sports chooses with closed eyes, the horse will stop at a gallop and does not have enough theoretical and practical knowledge to do . <br><br>  A true professional will never say that he is a pro.  He will prove it with his deeds, not with words. <br><br>  <em>Solution methods:</em> <br><br><blockquote>  1) Skip past conversations about how ‚Äúcool‚Äù the client is. <br>  2) Do not work with this type of clients. </blockquote><br><br>  The original is <a href="http://malkin.com.ua/2007/09/08/freelance-10-problem-pri-rabote-s-zakazchikami-chast-2/">here.</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14997/</a></p>
