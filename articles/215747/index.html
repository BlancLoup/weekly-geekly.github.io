  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Building a business with Acronis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, Habr!  My name is Rustam Mizov, I am the Acronis Product Director, and I want to tell you about our new product.  Today, more and more Russian companies face the challenges of protecting their fast-growing data / systems.  In an environment where they lack the resources to protect important information, other companies come to the rescue as service providers.  In general, of course, service providers can help in almost any area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour professional activity, but in this case we are talking about backing up and restoring information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/dc5/9a5/bc6dc59a5f453f48089a80a46fcd722e.jpg" alt="Rdq6ytJA3.jpg"><br><br>  With the current level of development of small and medium-sized businesses in the Russian Federation in the field of reliable backup, there has been a large bias towards demand: the market is large, and there is practically no one to provide their services.  Judge for yourself, direct backup software sales to companies that do not have IT expertise (as an example, a small accounting office may be appropriate) do not work or work poorly.  They will not have enough time or qualification of the available personnel to set up and maintain the backup competently, and to hire a specialist for regular work ... in general, either the efficiency of the solution or the cost of ownership.  Following such reflections, sooner or later, anyone will hit himself on the forehead with his hand and say that instead of the Decision one should buy the Service.  And this is where the fun begins. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is Acronis? </h4><br>  Acronis currently has a streamlined and polished backup and recovery technology in a variety of environments: personal computers, servers, virtual and physical machines, supported by both Windows and Linux, and you shouldn‚Äôt forget <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/acronis/blog/215007/">about strong data storage</a> too. <br><br>  The solutions for these environments, of course, differ, but all of them are closely integrated into a common ecosystem, have been fine-tuned and improved over the years.  More than fifty patents have been obtained for certain technologies in the USA and other countries of the world.  <sup>1</sup> And, most likely, we are the only company that offers a ready-made cloud solution that combines both disk and file backup.

      Of course, direct sales of such a service are profitable and interesting, but, first of all, our business is to write software and ensure that backup and recovery work like a clock, and secondly, those who it really does well, has a customer base, or simply wants to expand its business.  In general, to each his own: to us - a large and familiar B2B segment, you - the opportunity to earn on our products. <br><br><h4>  Acronis Backup as a Service - for all </h4><br>  Regardless of whether you are a large company or a small one, whether you are providing IT outsourcing and outstaffing, or are a major regional service provider, or even a telecommunications giant with your data centers and data centers, you can always expand your service portfolio. <br>  Acronis BaaS can be resold under its own brand, using Acronis reliable and secure infrastructure, or deployed on its own facilities. <br><br><h4>  What does BaaS consist of and how does it work? </h4><br>  Acronis Backup as a Service consists of three major components, some of which are more or less familiar to everyone: <br><ul><li>  <b>Acronis Backup Advanced</b> is an application installed directly on the client‚Äôs computer that backs up and restores data.  Acronis Backup Advanced contains agents for backing up disks and files, and agents for backing up virtual machines stored on virtualization servers; <br></li><li>  <b>Cloud Management Server</b> is a scalable and fault-tolerant component that allows you to centrally manage multiple client machines that have Acronis Backup Advanced client application installed via an ergonomic web interface, also compatible with mobile devices; <br></li><li>  <b>Acronis Storage is a</b> software solution that allows you to quickly deploy a highly reliable and easily expandable storage system for storing cloud backups.  Cloud storage, for storing backup copies of our customers, has already expanded to several petabytes in three data centers in the United States and Europe. <br></li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/431/efa/33a431efaf44d43f264fef9fcef2006a.png"><br><br><h4>  FAQ </h4><br>  Of course, right now you probably have questions.  Some of the answers can be found just below, and the rest can always be set in the comments. <br><br>  <b>I am not a major hosting provider, where do I get such power to start the service?</b> <br><ul><li>  As an option, Acronis offers its capabilities to provide this service. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>How much can you trust Acronis cloud storage?</b> <br><ul><li>  You can sleep peacefully, our data centers are located in Europe and the USA, and are built on the basis of its own scalable Acronis Storage software ;. <br></li><li>  To access the data center requires a biometric scan of the staff's palm and a special access key.  Data is encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm and transmitted over a secure SSL connection; <br></li><li>  In addition to multi-level protection, the storage technology itself preserves: even if it is assumed that someone will get access to hardware, it will be very difficult to find something integral and specific, the data is encrypted, broken into blocks and stored on different servers with error correction through Reed codes - Solomon.  Getting data directly from hardware is about as real as getting at least some useful information from an SSD disk with a dead memory controller and an encrypted file system. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>How advanced is the backup engine?</b> <br><ul><li>  Backup-as-a-Service uses the most advanced Acronis engine - Acronis Backup Advanced, designed for backing up workstations, physical and virtual servers and applications.  Acronis Backup Advanced is already used by more than 300,000 business clients, and, of course, it is used within our company. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>How much $ will it take to start working with you?</b> <br><ul><li>  Our offer does not require initial investment: costs grow only with income, i.e.  license agreement does not provide for any financial obligations or minimum terms of use <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>How to render those.</b>  <b>support?</b> <br><ul><li>  Do you need technical support?  You will get it!  Moreover, it will work 24/7, experts will immediately understand all major issues, know the product and have access to the most popular issues and their solutions. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>I do not know how to start the service, how to enter into contracts with customers and at what price?</b> <br><ul><li>  If necessary, Acronis will provide you with marketing support in launching the service. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>How does all this work?</b> <br><ul><li>  Everything is very simple.  For starters, you leave a partnership application with Acronis.  You can do this, for example.  a letter to <a href=""><u>SP@acronis.com</u></a> ; <br></li><li>  Our representative contacts you and tells in detail about the decision, the cost and also answers all your questions; <br></li><li>  If everything suits you, you get access to our cloud service (or deploy a backup on your own capacities); <br></li><li>  Optionally: Service branding is done.  Want to sell our backup under your name?  No problem.  All that is needed is already included in the package of services; <br></li><li>  A backup application is installed on client machines, which, by the way, can be installed fully automatically and does not require any interaction with the end user.  Just send the link to the right people, and the rest will be done by software.  All connected computers automatically connect to the cloud service, receive a backup plan. <br></li><li>  Through the service control panel, you can remotely assign backups, create and edit associated plans and schedules, get real-time data about backup results; <br></li><li>  At the end of each billing period (once a month), you will receive a bill for payment, based on the amount of data that has been saved.  For example, $ 0.30 for 1 GB of data.  Obviously, the final cost of the service for your client should be higher. <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>What about discounts?</b> <br><ul><li>  We have a progressive scale of discounts.  The more your customers back up, the more discount you will get for services. <br></li></ul><br><br>  And finally - watch the video, in it everything is short and the case is told.  :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h24JWPstDXo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1PfYMaEOgYWU3UN0JUuqyr6oOLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  1 - For patent law in the field of software, there will soon be a large publication.
