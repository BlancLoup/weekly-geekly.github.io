  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the level of service and increase the profits of companies using communication solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is common between a credit and financial organization issuing micro-loans and an online food delivery service?  These are service businesses for which high level of customer service is critical.  Consider two cases of mobile solutions from Infobip, which allowed to reduce the number of complaints from customers, reduce costs and as a result, increase profits. <br><br><h2>  <b>Case 1. Chocofood - mobile number authentication for timely delivery of notifications.</b> </h2><br><h3>  <b>Tasks</b> </h3><br>  The goal of Chocofood was to connect restaurants and customers through its platform.  The process of ordering food was arranged simply: the client leaves a request on the website or via a mobile application, and then the courier brings the order.  No additional communication with the customer between the order and delivery is not planned.  But it quickly became clear that by filling out an application and receiving a standard ‚Äúthanks for the order‚Äù, the client begins to worry about whether the order was accepted, when it was delivered, and so on.  As a result, the flow of calls to the Chocofood call center increased.  As an alternative solution, the idea arose to launch a real-time notification system at each stage of order processing, as well as to set up a mobile number verification service so that notifications reach the customer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <b>Decision</b> </h3><br>  Faced with customer questions, the company began to adapt its system to deliver urgent messages to users.

      Chobofood chose Infobip as the global SMS provider. <br><br>  The first part of the solution, <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma/rassylki/dvukhfaktornaya-autentifikaciya">2FA (Two-factor Authentication),</a> allows you to make sure that the client who registered on the platform has left a valid phone number available for calls and SMS.  To do this, during the registration process, the system sends the user a one-time PIN code, which he enters in his personal account.  After verification of the number and successful registration on the platform, you can send notifications. <br><br>  The second part of the solution - the <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma/rassylki/sms">SMS notification itself</a> - showed effectiveness immediately after launch.  The number of calls to the call center has decreased, and customers now receive information automatically.  In turn, Chocofood management acquired a reliable SMS partner with international coverage, able to support the company's ambitious plans related to entering other markets. <br><br><h3>  <b>results</b> </h3><br>  1. Chocofood customers received convenient service and unobtrusive information. <br>  2. Chocofood reduced operating costs. <br>  3. The load on the customer service department, contact center personnel, etc. has decreased. <br>  4. Infobip 24/7 technical support has strengthened the reputation of one of the best services in the industry by assisting Chocofood staff at every stage of their work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/im/ta/lsimta7voycmjqtvmbauvzyyd0y.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <b>Case 2. Credit24.</b>  <b>Infobip SMS Solutions</b> </h2><br><h3>  <b>Tasks</b> </h3><br>  During the initial launch and SMS Credit24 settings, we encountered some technical problems: we could not manage the volume of mailings, ensure the reliability of the service and use the statistics, which was necessary for the steady growth of microcredits.  Also, Credit24 did not have a short number, which they could use both for sending and receiving SMS messages.  Among other technical problems were: delays or inability to deliver messages, restrictions on the number of simultaneously sent messages ‚Äî up to 50 SMS, as well as incomplete statistics on delivery status and time.  This affected both the work processes themselves and the business results, since in the busiest months the company provided 10,000‚Äì12,000 microcredit. <br><br><h3>  <b>Decision</b> </h3><br>  Credit24 first began working with Infobip as part of work on delivery processes, then it expanded to the scale of a full-fledged service, including an interactive solution - Number for SMS Receipt, which allowed using other communication services to support processes and achieve business goals. <br>  After deploying the SMS solution from Infobip, the speed of message delivery doubled.  Improved delivery had a direct impact on strengthening ties with potential customers, which made it possible to get additional profits.  It also served to increase customer satisfaction.  Before integration with Infobip, the call center Kredit24 received about 50-70 complaints weekly, today an average of 1-3 complaints a week, and most often problems are solved on the side of a mobile operator. <br><br>  Having set a goal to make your message channel more dynamic and improve communication with customers, Kredit24 proceeded to the implementation of the Number to Receive SMS service.  This allowed customers to initiate communication and engage in dialogue in the format of unobtrusive messages, which is preferable for a young audience.  Existing customers were given the opportunity to request a loan and check the status of the application by sending SMS to Credit24.  The application procedure for a loan has become simpler: customers send a message to the specified short number, get approval for a loan, after which cash is transferred to their bank account.  With the service Number for SMS reception, the company Credit24 also received the opportunity to conduct surveys on products and on the quality of service. <br><br><h3>  <b>results</b> </h3><br><ol><li>  Kredit24 doubled the speed of SMS delivery. </li><li>  The share of customer complaints decreased by 98%. </li><li>  Detailed statistics and in-depth analytics provided through your Infobip account allow you to see the full picture of the work at any time.  Knowing the exact number of SMS messages sent and delivered to customers allows you to more correctly calculate ROI. </li><li>  Service Number for Receiving SMS directly affects the new streams of profits, since 25% of requests for loans come from existing customers via SMS-channel. </li><li>  Through the <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma">platform</a> Infobip Credit24 gained access to 800 mobile operators worldwide, as well as the ability to manage professional and large-scale <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma/rassylki">SMS communications</a> . </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/04/ly/5t/04ly5tg-dj5pz7ugumhcm8dbhle.jpeg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342088/</a></p>
