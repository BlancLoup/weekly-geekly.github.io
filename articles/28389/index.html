However, the violation of certain rules when placing links may have a negative impact on the position of the site in the search results.  In order for the links to bring tangible and extremely positive results, it is necessary to take into account the basic rules of their formation and placement. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Reference factors </h2><br><h4>  Link text </h4>  The content of the link is of great importance, and the first thing you should pay attention to is the thematic matching of the link and the resource being promoted. <br>  For example, when promoting a site dedicated to construction, it is most reasonable to use links with appropriate text.  If the link concerns other topics, for example, cars, then on thematic queries in search engines there will be no positive result.

      <br>
      No less affected is the length of the link.  In an effort to place as many requests in a link as possible, you decrease its effectiveness.  In addition, a large link text is usually impossible without punctuation marks, which are automatically determined by a number of search engines as a passage boundary. <br><br>  It is also necessary to take into account that any search engine can use special word bases when indexing a link.  So, placing in the link words that are obscene, you can get a negative result - the dictionary of censorship artificially lowers the coefficient of the resource with such content.  And vice versa, if the link contains the indication of authorship (for example, the original source, the author, here, the news), the link will look more natural and its effectiveness will be higher than the calculated one. <br><br><h4>  Text around the link </h4>  It is definitely not to say that the inconsistency between the subject of the text surrounding the link and the subject of the link itself will reduce its effectiveness.  Nevertheless, such a factor exists, although it only has an indirect effect. <br><br><h4>  Link period </h4>  It is highly likely to assume that the duration of use of a link has a certain effect on its effectiveness.  The ‚Äúolder‚Äù the link, the more attractive it is for search engines. <br><br><h4>  Type of link by type of information </h4>  The most effective have links containing textual information.  The mechanism of the search engines minimizes the impact that links containing images can have.  Such links are sometimes posted, as graphic information is often more attractive to network users. <br><br><h4>  Position of the link inside the page </h4>  The higher the link on the page, at the very top, or in the body of the text, the more effective they are.  Those links that are located below are easily blocked by search engines. <br><br><h4>  "Reciprocity" links </h4>  The main task of search engines is to provide natural selection and to form a rating of sites according to key characteristics.  Fighting link exchange systems is one of the most effective methods for minimizing the effect of artificially crafting search results.  In practice, a link that is delivered from one web resource to another is more effective if there is no reciprocal link.  If there are a lot of reciprocal links on your site, then the position of your site in the search results will be artificially lowered, and the decrease can continue until the complete removal of your site from the search results <br><br><h4>  Target link </h4>  The link target is the page of the web resource to which it translates.  If the goal is an internal, not the initial page, then the effectiveness of the link is usually higher. <br><br><h4>  Placement in the source code of the page </h4>  Site page can have a significant weight, reaching several MB.  In such cases, search engines process only part of the page - from 512 kb for MSN to a few MB for Yandex.  However, some search engines index the page in stages.  If the link is located in the source code of the page is too low, the search engine will either not see it at all, which means its effectiveness will be zero, or the link will be processed only after some time. <br><br><h4>  Number of external links </h4>  Placing several external links on one page - more than ten - can lead to the fact that page indexing will drop sharply, and in some cases a filter may be imposed on such page.  In this case, links on the page will be completely ineffective. <br><br><h4>  Number of internal links </h4>  The number of internal links is also significant.  For example, the Google search engine can process only 100 links from a page.  For the Yandex search engine, the limit number of links is somewhat higher ‚Äî about 150 for each page. <br><br><h4>  The nature of the adjacent links </h4>  The content of adjacent links may have an indirect effect on the effectiveness of each.  So, if there are links to doubtful resources on one page, or inefficient links, other links, even to quite high-quality sites, will also be less effective. <br><br><h4>  Link location order </h4>  It can be assumed that the effectiveness of the link is influenced by its order in the reference block.  The earlier it is located, the more effective.  In this case, the effectiveness of the links will be influenced by the other factors described above, taking into account the number of links on the page. <br><br><h4>  Number of links on the subject site </h4>  Donor sites - sites that host links to various web resources - often place too many external links.  This leads to the fact that search engines impose a filter on the donor site and its effectiveness is significantly reduced.  This can be avoided by not placing links to all websites in a row, but by sending links to sites of similar subjects. <br><br><h4>  The number and quality of links to the web resource </h4>  The number of links to various external resources is of indirect importance when the search engines evaluate each individual link to the site.  The number of references often serves as a criterion for assessing the credibility of a resource, and too many of them may entail the imposition of a filter.  It is necessary to take into account the quality of each link.  Mass deviations of the semantic content of links from the subject of the site, or placing links to your site on doubtful web resources will lead to a decrease in search engines of their effectiveness. <br><br><h2>  Page factors </h2><br><h4>  Authority of the page by the number of internal and external links </h4>  When placing links on the page of an external resource, it should be borne in mind that the more links from other sites to this page, the more effective the link will work.  At the same time, the more links to a page from other pages of a web resource, the higher its ranking in search engines and the more effective your link. <br><br><h4>  Number of external links </h4>  This is written above <br><br><h4>  Number of internal links </h4>  This is written above <br><br><h4>  The nature of the adjacent links </h4>  This is written above <br><br><h4>  Page age </h4>  The longer the page is involved in the search, the higher its appeal to search engines.  This indirectly affects the effectiveness of external links from the page. <br><br><h4>  The relevance of the text on the page </h4>  If the text of the page is close in subject to the content of the link, then its effectiveness will be higher. <br><br><h4>  The percentage of the volume of content to the volume of links on the page </h4>  If the page consists entirely of links, such as the site map page, then such links will be less effective, and in some cases search engines simply will not process them. <br><br><h4>  Page URL </h4>  This factor can be considered secondary, but in some cases it can be manifested quite strongly.  For example, your auto mazda, and the link we place from the donor, the url of whose page is http://www.donor.ru/mazda/.  In this case, the link efficiency will be quite high. <br><br><h4>  PR page authority </h4>  The Page Rank indicator of a page makes it possible to indirectly assess how a page meets the requirements of a search engine. <br><br><h4>  Last page refresh date </h4>  The more often the page is updated, the more often it is re-indexed by search engines, which means that your link to such a page will be processed by a search engine in the near future.  In addition, it can be assumed that the updated pages have an advantage when indexing. <br><br><h4>  Page format </h4>  Different search engines prefer pages written in different formats.  Today, the most commonly used formats are html, doc, pdf. <br><br><h4>  The uniqueness of the content on the page </h4>  Placing unique content is an important requirement both for a single page and for all pages of a web resource.  Duplication of content leads to penalties, and ultimately the page on which non-author content is posted can be completely excluded from the search.  The uniqueness of the content increases the credibility of the resource, and therefore increases the effectiveness of links. <br><br><h4>  Subject page </h4>  Subject resource affects one of the main indicators - the citation index (TCI).  Similarly, matching the link text with the page text increases the search engine‚Äôs link rank.  Due to this, the rating of links placed in the body of the text is higher located separately. <br><br><h4>  Link location </h4>  Links, one after another, in the so-called link block, reduce the search engine's confidence to this page.  Thus, a filter can be superimposed on the page or the entire resource. <br><br><h2>  Domain Factors </h2><br><h4>  Authority of the domain </h4>  This factor is determined by the popularity of external links to the domain. <br><br><h4>  Domain age </h4>  An important factor, since the longer the domain functions, the higher the credibility of the pages on it by the search engines. <br><br><h4>  Authority by relevance </h4>  The higher the compliance of thematic sites of the domain to key queries, the more effective is the placement of links on such sites. <br><br><h4>  Authority domain attendance </h4>  The more visited pages with a given domain name relative to other sites, the more popular such sites from the point of view of search engines. <br><br><h4>  Authority domain PR, TCI, Alexa Ranking, TR resource itself </h4> Indicators such as CY and PR to a certain extent indicate the level of trust in a resource on the part of search engines.  TR (trust rank) can be influenced by originality of content.  If a unique text is placed on the resource and its volume is higher than the duplicated one, then the TR index rises. <br><br><h4>  Domain Relevance </h4>  The more accurately the thematic site corresponds to its subject matter within the domain, the higher the trust of search engines to such a resource and the more effective is the placement of links on it. <br><br><h4>  Domain Extension </h4>  It can be assumed that the extension of the domain (info, com, ru, com.ua) may affect the attractiveness of links for search engines.  We conducted a study of the Yandex search engine, which revealed the general specifics of the attitude of the search engine to domains of different types.  It was revealed about 35 thousand domains that the search engine processed, and about 6.5 thousand domains that were excluded from the search.  In percentage terms, the results of the study can be represented as follows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ of the total number of domains tested, about 18.87% do not participate in the search; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúRU‚Äù domains - 16.49% do not participate in the search; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúUA‚Äù domains - 14.18% do not participate in the search; <br>  ‚Ä¢ domains ‚ÄúCOM‚Äù - 16.05% do not participate in the search; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNET‚Äù domains - 14.68% do not participate in the search; <br>  ‚Ä¢ INFO domains - 35.9% do not participate in the search. <br><br>  The apparent rejection of the INFO domain search system is caused by the low cost of the domains, as a result of which the domain is used to host weak sites with content duplicated from other sources. <br><br><h4>  Domain Level </h4>  The domain level has an indirect impact on the popularity of a web resource.  This is due to the fact that the more remote level domain - the second, third, or even fourth level - the less informative resources are placed on it.  If a site on a domain of any level contains author's content, is highly informative and popular, then links from such a resource will work no worse than from a site from a second-level domain. <br><br><h4>  Strict compliance with topics </h4>  Compliance with a single theme is a significant plus when indexing pages by search engines, and therefore links from such a resource will work more efficiently. <br><br><h4>  The number of incoming and outgoing links to the resource </h4>  When placing on the site a large number of external links and the lack of links to the resource itself, search engines determine a lower site rating.  This is due to the mechanism for determining the information content of the resource - the more sites refer to this resource, the more popular it is.  So, and links from it are more effective. <br><br><h2>  Factors in which the effect of reference is zero </h2><br><h4>  Page closed on robots.txt from being indexed </h4>  In this case, the search engine will not see and will not index the links. <br><br><h4>  Link to the penalty page </h4>  Links from pages on which filters are imposed or which do not participate in indexation for other reasons will not work. <br><br><h4>  Javascript link, redirect link </h4>  Links in this format do not affect the results of the promotion. <br><br><h4>  Link in the block "for publicity", paid links, etc. </h4>  It can be assumed that such reference blocks are easily recognized by search engines and the links located in them are not taken into account when processing pages. <br><br><h4>  Page in noindex </h4>  Links from such pages are ineffective. <br><br><h4>  Noindex for the section of the page where the link is located </h4>  Links located in such parts of the page are ineffective. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Link promotion is one of the favorite ways of SEO-site promotion.  With the advent of convenient systems for the automatic sale of links, when it is enough to indicate certain parameters of the donor site in order for the system to select and place your links, you should not forget about manual checking of the placed links.  Because  careful work with links will allow you to get the desired result on the site positions in the shortest possible time, as well as significantly reduce the money spent on the posted links. <br><br><h2>  Copyright and stuff </h2><br>  The original topic was drowned in the blog of the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/cims/" class="user_link">cims</a> cims, but it was never restored.
