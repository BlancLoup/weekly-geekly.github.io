  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Excellent article on the assembly of industrial products</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The kindest. <br><br>  In October, another software development conference was held in Moscow.  I could not go (and I found out too late), but to read the topics and theses of reports, to listen to the reviews, there was such an opportunity.  Though I live in a den on the seashore, we also have Internet connections, yes. <br><br>  I decided to find out what they are saying today about SCM in the circles of developers - this is my professional hobby.  It turned out that almost nothing.  However, there was one report on this celebration of life, which still justifies the existence of the conference :) Moreover, it strongly echoes one of my old notes.

The speakers are descendants of the harsh Vikings, Lar Bendix (associate professor at Lund University) and Andreas Goranson (Sony-Ericsson employee). <br><br>  What is so pleased? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Translation of a short review from the authors: <br><br> <code>     ,   ,    ,  - .  , -,        ,  -,      .    ,        ,    .  ,             ‚Äì    - ,           .  ,            ,              .    ,      ,      .         ,    (rule base)          ,     . <br></code> <br><br>  There were also abstracts, and in fact a <a href="http://www.cs.lth.se/home/Lars_Bendix/Publications/BGSG10b/Moscow-camera-ready.pdf">full-fledged article</a> - there are a lot of simple English. <br><br>  In one old post I mentioned <a href="http://scm-notes.blogspot.com/2009/09/software-configuration-management_06.html">components, their versions and product lines</a> .  As I wrote the material based on the experience of working as an integrator in Motorola, the problematic was taken from there - from the engineering of industrial-level products. <br><br>  And the speakers relied on the rich work of another telecom giant, Sony-Ericsson and other similar companies.  For cell phone manufacturers it is very important to be able to combine various features of their products depending on the operator, price segment, form factor, country of sale and many other things.  Hence, the long-standing problem is how to ensure, with the lowest possible cost, the best opportunity to adapt products to these conditions. <br><br>  The code of all complex systems is somehow divided into modules, i.e.  <b>the components</b> .  So, at the product level it is more logical to operate with components and their variations - <b>versions</b> and <b>branches</b> .  In this direction, work and led - have developed a model that takes into account the components and the <b>rules</b> by which the components are assembled.  The concept of a <b>base of components</b> is introduced, from which with the help of a configurator a whole variety of products necessary for the end user is obtained.  They describe the developed model.  And the work goes on the junction of SCM, design and project management. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is not indicated at what stage of readiness and practical application this model is located.  Knowing that she is engaged in a man from a commercial company, we can assume that the work is being done in a practical way. <br><br>  Excellent article, read with pleasure. <br><br>  If you have something to add - well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108059/</a></p>
