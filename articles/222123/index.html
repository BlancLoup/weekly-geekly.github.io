The question is: what to wear?  Yes, so that it is convenient and safe for electronics?  Today I will talk about a <a href="http://www.thule.com/ru-ru/ru/products/luggage-and-bags/daypacks-and-messengers/thule-crossover-backpacks/thule-crossover-32l-_-tl_85854221924">fit</a> 32-liter geek backpack <a href="http://www.thule.com/ru-ru/ru/products/luggage-and-bags/daypacks-and-messengers/thule-crossover-backpacks/thule-crossover-32l-_-tl_85854221924">.</a> Well, and of course, I invite everyone to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/222123/">EDC thread</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5b/c7e/40d/a5bc7e40dc968b2f6c05b8817e3e36c7.jpg"><br>  <i>Caution: a lot of pictures!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> About the manufacturer </h4>  The Swedish company Thule is known as a manufacturer of various accessories for conveniently transporting things, be it bike mounts or a backpack, the experience of which I will share today.  The Swedes made a good Russian-language official website with a detailed description of all products, their own video reviews and even the FAQ for certain products, so I advise you to <a href="http://www.thule.com/ru-ru/ru">read</a> . <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Appearance and wearing comfort </h4>  Thule TCBP217 is the largest backpack in the company's portfolio, its volume is 32 liters, and 17-inch models fit perfectly in the laptop compartment.

The length and position of the fastener can be adjusted.  I, in turn, took it off altogether, because I don‚Äôt need it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/431/066/1144310660dcb9777fdef7b6e5178951.jpg"><br><br>  The clips on the straps are made of metal, and the backpack itself is made of nylon, which guarantees the safety of your gadgets when it is exposed to rain.  True, there is a small snag here, all except for one lightning, lacking any kind of moisture protection, so that with a long stay in the rain some amount of moisture can still leak out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/7b3/c31/6137b3c317ba39a04e29694e91b97fea.jpg"><br>  The highlight of the backpack is a shock-resistant polyurethane compartment for storing glasses or other valuable things.  By the way, this is the department whose lightning has moisture protection, so that even in the pouring rain the contents will not get wet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/022/853/217/0228532171a9b35ecc98972e00d8db29.jpg"><br>  To protect your gadgets from intruders on the dog has an additional hook that clings to the gum at the end of the zipper. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/dab/5b2/383dab5b20dac90113e69319a93be6af.jpg"><br>  The front pocket is quite roomy and is designed for essentials.  I, as a student engineer, wear a large number of various offices there. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/47a/4d9/d0c47a4d9bf6dfe9942304ca5649e094.jpg"><br>  Another waterproof pocket.  :) Suitable for documents or other valuable things. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2b/5cc/6bb/e2b5cc6bbb925fe3c27c7dbc7cc437c2.jpg"><br>  Side pockets are equipped with elastic bands, which prevents the loss of things.  A thermos lodged in one of its pockets, and the other plays the role of a backup. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd4/823/281/dd4823281ff936341c4b06d1909c3b90.jpg"><br>  There is another funny department called by the company as ‚ÄúShove-it Pocket‚Äù.  The manufacturer suggests wearing a jacket, a change of shoes, or, if the backpack is heavily packed, a newspaper or magazine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dc/cb6/d03/9dccb6d030a35324dae0ca323d909090.jpg"><br>  The carrying handle, unfortunately, was not made in the best way.  In a backpack of this size, it should at least be thicker and longer, and be attached not only in the middle of the upper face, but also to move to the side.  Thus, the mass of the backpack is distributed and it is easier to hold it in your hands (useful in public transport). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ab/272/f61/0ab272f6194d718b6582bb1c76e29c5c.jpg"><br>  On the bottom of the backpack is another pocket, for example, for the charger.  But for me it is empty, as it is often necessary to leave a backpack on the floor / ground. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f5/91a/271/4f591a27179169c1818d70a2430aa2e0.jpg"><br>  The department closest to the back is given more gadgets.  As stated by the manufacturer, models with a display diagonal of up to 17 inches will fit into the compartment under the laptop, and my 13-inch macbook looks like a drowned person in this department. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37c/d82/04c/37cd8204cb561148f6cddb0b85826d2e.jpg"><br>  Here are additional pockets for Powerbank, flash drives, hard drives.  I almost forgot: another soft pocket for the tablet was sewn to the laptop compartment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/577/5ab/9615775ab12c04585ea04dc1071cff55.jpg"><br>  And finally - the vast main department.  Literally everything that a modern urbanist might need. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78d/cec/c17/78dcecc178029492a130cded8fa700a8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Results </h4>  Good city backpack and the best of those that I had.  The main criteria for selection were sufficient size, more pockets for various equipment, a protected section for a laptop and, most importantly, a compartment for glasses.  Not without drawbacks in the face of the lack of moisture protection on lightning and not the most convenient handle for carrying.  The back, by the way, is not ventilated, but personally I have not yet met a backpack when I wore a back that did not sweat. <br><br>  On the territory of the Russian Federation a backpack can be purchased, for example, from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ryukzak-thule-crossover-tcbp-217-32-litra/">Madrobots</a> for 7,990 rubles.  The price is not small, but the backpack is worth it.  In addition, as usual, the day habrovchan discount - with the code <b>THULE</b> backpack is almost a quarter cheaper - 6 500 rubles c delivery June 17. <br><br>  The same code will work for all other backpacks of the same company, the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ryukzak-thule-crossover-tcbp-117-25-litrov/">TCBP-117</a> with it will cost 4,800, the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ryukzak-na-odnoy-lyamke-thule-crossover-sling/">TCSP-213</a> will cost <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ryukzak-na-odnoy-lyamke-thule-crossover-sling/">4,250</a> , and the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/thule-gauntlet-13-dlya-macbook-pro/">TAS-113</a> will cost 1,600 rubles. <br><br>  And now let's start <abbr title="EDC (Every Day Carry) - things that are carried every day with you.">EDC-</abbr> ed. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> EDC thread <a name="edc"></a></h4>  The other day, the idea came up to us with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/" class="user_link">vvzvlad</a> to look with what people of Habra move every day, what gadgets they use, in general what they are made up for every day.  To begin with, we made a newsletter to friends with a request to share our EDC, well, and then we hope for your comments on the topic. <br><br>  <i>A few days before that I found the site <a href="http://www.thinglink.com/">thinglink.com</a> .</i>  <i>The service allows you to hang tags with comments on pictures that would ideally fit our post, but the code embedded in the post did not work.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, just in case I will hang a link to the picture, perhaps this service will seem to someone more convenient than just a textual description of what is in the photo.</i> <br><br>  As the creator of the thread, I'll start with myself.  At the moment I am studying in the first year of the Faculty of Radio Engineering at the Kiev Polytechnic University, respectively, the main activity is studying.  The office is dominant in the backpack, but all kinds of gadgets also do not lose ground. <br> <a href="http://www.thinglink.com/scene/522123896116215810"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf2/3d5/0ca/cf23d50ca4a2d2608286eda087edc04a.jpg"></a> <br>  Of the interesting things I would like to mention the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/189512/">Powerball</a> , which I wrote about last summer - I use it myself and meet everyone I sit down.  Even in the photo did not get "smart" flashlight <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/213485/">Nitecore SENS AA</a> , and the rest can be found by clicking on the picture. <br><a name="vvzvlad"></a><br>  The second will be <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/" class="user_link">vvzvlad</a> as a hand to the idea.

But the fact that I have in my backpack and pockets every day: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kwuNKZMUwR/">Dictaphone</a> (while walking from the metro you can dictate a couple of thoughts for the article), a very <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kaRDdFMU0Y/">cool pen</a> , a lot of wiring (including <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/aksessuary_dlya_ios_i_android/culcharge-lightning-brelok-kabel-dlya-zaryadki-iphone-5-5s-5c/">CulCharge</a> ), <a href="http://instagram.com/p/mBd9D6sUwr/">Motorola MotoACTV</a> , keys, a wet napkin, guarana concentrate (if you don‚Äôt have to sleep at night), a pile of checks (almost all - shopping for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/221697/">store</a> ), reserve 200 rubles in the back pocket, ANC9 headphones with active noise cancellation, 10 screeds, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/lnQs4mMUwc/">leatherman squirt es4</a> , passport, card on the subway, office pass, discount cards to the most popular stores, payoneer card, debit and credit card from alpha bank, xperia Z, iphone 5 (use it as a body  the hold can not, there are even sim card is not necessary, but there is a classy player, good camera down and have instagramm), pebble, macbook pro. </div></div><br>  Everyone knows <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> : <br>  As an everyday backpack I use Manfrotto Stile Unica Red - a red and white shoulder photo bag, designed for those who want to carry a laptop and a camera at the same time.  Quite a handy thing, but the white fabric on it is very marking, so it is better to take the brown or black version. <br> <a href="http://www.thinglink.com/scene/524679376818667520"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23a/7b0/8ea/23a7b08ea23c52956ee0aa3d5f47d1ee.jpg"></a> <br>  In the main sections of the bag you can sneak in two ways: by unfastening the top ‚Äúcovering‚Äù part (it is fastened with a padlock and velcro), or by unzipping it.  There are two separate compartments: one for a laptop and the other for photo personal belongings. <br>  Under the photo prichindal three sections, and the partitions between them can be moved (they sticky).  It easily fits the carcass of the camera, two lenses to it and all the junk. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/d55/554/203d555541ce4a749f6506b7a3e5993f.jpg"><br>  Another zippered compartment is at the bottom - it is usually empty.  I fill it only when I want to pofot something purposefully: a Velbon Ultra Maxi mini tripod, a battery charger for a camera and a laptop, a set for cleaning optics and a belt for a camera are placed there.  In short, a small handbag, and allows you to carry everything you need. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The rest of the set is as follows:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Macbook Pro 13 Laptop and iPad mini Tablet </li><li>  A Canon 6D mirror with a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù 24-105 + sometimes SIGMA 50mm 1.4 for photographing children </li><li>  Two SanDisk memory cards of 64Gb - one always in the camera, the second - just in case </li><li>  Card reader for SD and microSD-cards - for discarding photos from the camera and recordings from the DVR </li><li>  DVI-Thunderbolt adapter - so that you can always connect to the projector (in case of a seminar, for example) </li><li>  Sony External Battery CP-F5B for 5000 mAh - accidentally bought it when the phone in the store sat down, since then we have not been parted </li><li>  USB Lightening Cord + USB-microUSB cord with microUSB-Lightening adapter </li><li>  AC adapter with USB connector for charging your smartphone </li><li>  Microfiber for wiping the camera and other devices </li><li>  Nutrition and Nutrition: Nuts or Snickers </li><li>  Samsonite Purse / Document Holder </li><li>  House / garage car keys </li></ul></div></div><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> : <br>  I have <a href="">such a</a> bag.  It has 4 compartments, two pockets in the front and one suede pocket for the cell in the middle, plus a bunch of business card holders and pens.

Prototyping cards from the set also serve well instead of a small notebook.  The paper in the middle is the wish list, which was recorded a year ago.  He should be carried with him until everything is done.  Even in the bag is usually a comb and a camera - but the camera is in the hands, and the comb in another bag after the road. </div></div><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/papabubadiop/" class="user_link">PapaBubaDiop</a> : <br>  I live in a closed city.

There are no glitches, the state is normal, I carry it without covers and films. <br><br>  Lantern SC600w Mk II L2, surveyed him <a href="http://mysku.ru/blog/usa-stores/23775.html">here</a> .  Also an indispensable assistant.  You understand it only after you forget it by chance. <br><br>  Knife.  Ordinary Chinese knife.  Small, comfortable.  The knife should be in the EDC of any man, no matter, expensive or unpretentious, but it should be.  Otherwise, even a snack nothing to cut :) <br>  A simple card reader, rescued more than once, also lying in the bag. <br><br>  Keyring  There is one more flashlight (yes, I love flashlights) - Thrunite Ti.  This is a keypad, with something very good, on one AAA battery.  Also there is a 32GB Kindston flash drive visible, constantly losing it somewhere because of its small size (it's hard to find in a bag), so I hung it on the keys. <br><br>  Charging <a href="http://www.xtarlight.com/05-chanpin/p-001-1.asp%3Fstyleid%3D294%26style%3DNew%2520Arrival">XTAR SP1</a> for many sizes of lithium batteries, mainly 18650. Why carry it with you?  It's simple: it has the Powerbank feature.  On the USB connector produces 5V 1A.  And instead of one healthy powerbank, I take it with me and as many batteries as necessary. <br><br>  Unlocked HUAWEI E1550 from MTS.  Very often it helps if someone tweaks something on the IT part, but there is no Internet. <br></div></div><br><h4>  And what do you carry with you every day?
