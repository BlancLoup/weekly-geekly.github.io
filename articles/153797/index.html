Here I dream a little, can I? <br><br><h4>  1. Distributed robotic production </h4><br>  Due to the Russian long distances, traffic jams and the quality of the roads themselves, distributed production becomes very relevant: <br>  - an online service for collecting applications for manufacturing parts / prototypes is created <br>  - managers accept payment and applications in the form of drawings or models, make the necessary clarifications on the production method, tolerances, etc., if necessary, connect modelers to create a 3D model <br>  - they send the updated request and payment for the work to the processing centers located closest to the client's location.  In the processing centers there is a modern CNC equipment (3D printers, milling machines, lathes, engravers, metal bending, polishing, polishing, manufacturing of printed circuit boards, assembly and installation, etc.), plus operators.  Detail / prototype manufactured. <br>  - after production, the part / prototype is sent to the customer in the shortest way using the delivery service <br>  - the customer can observe the manufacturing process online (broadcast by webcam) <br>  - the system interface is gamified (see p.2) <br>  - the client who has sent a photo or video of the use of the created thing in his work receives a prize. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  2. Gamification of jobs in business </h4><br>  Due to the fact that a lot of people are engaged in a rather boring and routine office work, it is proposed to increase their motivation to turn the information system in which the employee works into the game: <br>  - a map of the enterprise is drawn up with an indication of departments, buildings, related services and a description of their activities, etc. in a game form (2D, isometric, 3D), by which one can walk, and hovering over the department, find out information about it (information component useful for new employees) and department news (news component).  There is also easy access to company news. <br>  - each employee has his character in the game, which he can dress, decorate, etc. Employees can arrange virtual meetings in the form of group chat meetings without leaving the premises. <br>  - the employee is assigned tasks in the form of quests.  Quests are put as a result of a collective webinar or video conversation one-on-one with the bosses, plus a set of documents that is shared by the participants of the webinar.  To solve them, he contacts other people in the team, or works independently. <br>  - For the successful implementation of the task in time points are given.  Each employee earns points during the month, for the month to fix.  a salary can be given a premium or a fine (bonus system), or points can be given out in general (piecework).  You can also enter the transfer of money to each other, with points = experience displayed separately (the introduction of local currency) <br>  - The employee can take courses within the company, for example, English.  After that, the skill ‚ÄúEnglish +1‚Äù is added to his personal profile.  Similarly for other skills. <br>  - The corporate email, video chat, mobile client for drivers, etc. are integrated into the game interface. <br>  - Users are grouped into clans - ‚Äúaccountants,‚Äù ‚Äúdispatchers,‚Äù ‚Äúsales managers,‚Äù etc. The clan has symbols, a leader, students, and its own list of references / courses for beginners to learn. <br>  - Company reports on achievements are performed in the form of a ‚Äútransition to the next level‚Äù.  Each employee can see at what level the company is at the moment, and see the overall statistics: the number of "players" online, a report on profits and losses, market share and so on. <br>  - Training courses inside (and outside) of the company are held according to the system of p.3 <br><br><h4>  3. Gamification of education </h4><br>  Due to the fact that education has become a very inefficient, boring and lengthy process, it is proposed to revive it with the help of the Internet and modern multimedia technologies.  The lesson should take place as an MMORPG game: <br>  - courses of physics, mathematics and other sciences are processed into sets of presentations and videos (illustrative material), flash movies (intellectual games) and visual aids (for this you can use the factory of claim 1) <br>  - the profile of the student and the teacher is a description of the character with his portrait and selectable appearance, list of achievements, etc. <br>  - teachers become showmen leading their webinar, to which students from all over the world are connected <br>  - lessons consist of different activities.  One lesson can consist of a theory (the teacher explains several points with an example), practice (several puzzle tasks), role-playing (team decision of a complex task with several steps) and homework checking (‚Äúcalling the blackboard‚Äù of one of the students or teams, i.e. giving him / him the focus of the camera and the demonstration of his work in front of the class) <br>  - lessons include exact and natural sciences (mathematics, physics, Russian, geography, astronomy, history, literature), but are not limited to them.  Sports, home economics (learning how to use household appliances, mending clothes, washing and ironing), cooking, landscape design, plumbing (fixing wooden things), making toys (soft, felting, carved from wood, wire), learning how to work with various computer programs, language training, orienteering, fishing, making a fire and caring for a child are also lessons.  Lessons in high school can include time management, organization of your enterprise, training in setting tasks.  Well, in addition - courses of image, oratory, riding, writing poems, swimming, etc. <br>  - the changes in the lessons (as well as some lessons) are replaced by the days of the ‚Äúsports Internet‚Äù (see p.4), by themselves they go without any interruptions.  The duration of the whole school day is 4 hours. <br>  - students in a team and under the guidance of a teacher carry out tasks, informing about readiness, and the teacher notes successes in the online system.  According to the results of the day, week, month, each accumulates a set of achievements, which is an adequate assessment of the student's activities.  A lesson can be built in the form of a CTF (capture the flag) -match, when two teams, competing, each under the leadership of their leader-teacher, are trying to achieve a solution to some major task. <br>  - when a student reaches a certain level, he can proceed to real work (practice) in manufacturing centers of claim 1, become a manager, driver, modeler or someone else.  And after a while, it can change the line of business and become someone else, even the organizer of a new business. 2.  When a team reaches a certain level, it begins to solve real business problems.

    <h4>  4. Sports Internet </h4><br>  Due to the fact that a lot of people are forced to sit at the computer, and the movement is necessary, it is proposed to link part of the lessons with field work. <br>  - lesson options: drawing on the edge of the forest under the guidance of an experienced artist (the artist leads a lesson via the Internet), dancing on the river bank under the guidance of the best dancer (she also leads the group online), searching for minerals for geology, plants and insects for biology, assembling quadrocopter electronics , training in working with hand tools - a hacksaw, an ax, a chisel (labor lessons, wood carving), work in the garden (learning to interact with the ground), carried out in the open air, in a group and online.  There is another way to use the Internet - the same dances or football in a clearing can be broadcast live to millions of viewers. <br>  - you need an instructor, an operator, a car with installed speakers and a large TV (exit), as well as several video cameras and microphones (input).  All of this connects to wireless fast internet and provides communication with other mobile groups around the globe.  The instructor monitors the group, the operator for the equipment, coordinators and presenters of the webinar can be anywhere. <br>  - The organization of departure from the city on the nature for a group of students (or adults) can be quite difficult, but it's worth it. <br>  - it is important that everyone learns something in this process.  According to the results, for example, football games in the system can be marked and the best players are marked.  Good points of the match can be posted on YouTube. <br>  - The organization of the departure can be done by quest. <br><br>  For each of these interrelated areas, you can even now sit down and write a detailed TK and begin recruiting a team.  Personally, I am confident in the stunning success of such services.  And you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153797/</a></p>
