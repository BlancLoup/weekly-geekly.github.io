The growth will be at least 30%, as in 2014. It will ensure its continuous development of network technologies, lower prices for mobile traffic, growth in the penetration of smartphones and the number of applications entering the market . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the revenue structure of the market, more than half is occupied by the App Store service with $ 9 billion, which is 60% of the total market volume.  Google Play is more than 4 times less than its competitor in terms of profitability.

      Analysts at MarketsandMarkets predict that Europe will become the largest mobile software market by 2015.  Its volume by this time could reach $ 8.4 billion, with an annual growth of 33.6% over the course of 2010 - 2015.  It is on the European market that the efforts of a large number of mobile developers from the CIS are often concentrated.  But it is sometimes difficult to advance on it now. <br><br>  Today, there are many examples of the tremendous success of mobile applications.  And they are often created by very young technological geniuses.  So, in April of this year, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> officially announced the purchase of the popular news service <a href="https://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a> .  This news aggregator was created in 2010 by 2 students at Stanford University.  Initially, Pulse was only available on the iPad, but soon migrated to other platforms and got a web version.  Today, the service has about 30 million users from 190 countries.  At $ 90 million, the amount of the purchase transaction is estimated. <br><br>  A similar story happened with another <a href="http://summly.com/">Summly</a> news aggregator.  It was also acquired by the giant Yahoo! .. According to AllThingsD, the transaction amount was $ 30 million. Considering that the author of the idea was Nick Daloisio, who was then only 15 years old, this result can be considered amazing. <br><br>  The main chance for any application is to see your horizons and opportunities.  So, in the case of Pulse, the acquisition of this service gave LinkedIn the opportunity to evolve from a site with statistics about specialists in a news resource. <br><br>  And, of course, do not forget about the constant and systemic development.  So, the founders of one of the most promising companies in the market for mobile applications, the British <a href="http://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a> , believe that a good application is never complete: if you want your application to succeed, make it easier, improve and constantly think about your users.  Now the company is preparing for an IPO with an estimated capitalization of $ 1 billion. <br><br>  In addition, one of the three whales of the tremendous success of many applications is a bright, powerful, viral promotion.  The creators of the same <a href="http://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a> say that their main marketing tool is word of mouth.  It is also worth remembering the classic example of viral promotion, which had a tremendous impact on the continued success of the project.  The <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> team created a stir around its product even before it appeared, and the result was 25,000 registrations on the first day of the service. <br><br>  To discuss examples of the effective promotion of mobile applications, as well as their output to the top positions in the App Store, it will be possible at one of the interactive workshops that will be held at the Startup AddVenture conference (to be held in Kiev on December 4-5).  Leading the workshop for 2 hours will work with its participants practical promotion cases.  And also develop a marketing plan for mobile applications from scratch.  Separately, the speakers will focus on the question - how to hold the leading positions of their products in the App Store. <br><br>  The workshop will be conducted: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/speaker-profiles/igor-zhadanov/">Igor Zhadanov</a> - CEO, <a href="http://readdle.com/">Readdle</a> <br>  The company creates high-class applications for business and personal productivity, in particular ReaddleDocs.  Stimulates managers to abandon paper and use tablets instead of laptops.  Also known for developing gaming applications for iOS. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/speaker-profiles/mark-johnson/">Mark Johnson</a> , CEO, <a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a> (CNN) <br>  Zite CEO, which was bought by CNN.  The company is changing the way people search for content.  Mark was previously a product manager at <a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> , and then he took up three search startups: <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sidestep">SideStep</a> (bought by <a href="http://www.kayak.com/">Kayak</a> for $ 180 million in December 2007), <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kosmix">Kosmix</a> (bought by <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Walmart</a> in April 2011), and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/powerset">Powerset</a> (acquired by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in July 2008). <br><br>  3. <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/speaker-profiles/eran-ben-shushan/">Eran Ben-Shushan</a> , co-founder of <a href="http://www.bizzabo.com/">Bizzabo</a> <br>  Bizzabo, in which Eran became one of the founders in 2011, helps visitors of various events to meet and communicate with other people.  The project is positioned as a system for establishing business contacts.  Under the leadership of Eran and in just over a year, Bizzabo raised $ 1.5 million in seed investment.  Prior to founding Bizzabo, Eran was a project manager and systems engineer at <a href="http://www.elbitsystems.com/elbitmain/">Elbit Systems</a> . <br><br>  You can find out more information about the workshop and register for participation at the Startup AddVenture website <a href="http://www.venturesummit.eu/">www.venturesummit.eu</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203878/</a></p>
