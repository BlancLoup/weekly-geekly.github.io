  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do I conduct myself on a freelance website</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am engaged in ‚Äúfreelancing‚Äù for about 3 years, I already have some experience in communication, so I would like to share with my colleagues in the workshop. <br>  So, I have to be both in the role of a performer, and sometimes publish my projects (for example, when I don‚Äôt have time or when I don‚Äôt want to spend time on some work) on the site of one well-known web-site resource.  I worked out for myself a certain system of definition with whom I want to work, and with whom not.  This system is only the fruit of my observations, in no way can it be imposed on everyone, and especially on those whose opinion is different from mine. <br><br>  What I am guided by when working on a freelance resource. <br><br>  a) If I act as a customer <br>  1. I try to describe the task as accurately as possible and what I want to get in the end, I describe the add.  conditions (for example, a personal meeting is necessary and the performer must live in the same city as me) <br>  2. I do not indicate the cost of the project, I propose to the applicant to evaluate his own work in accordance with its complexity, volume and other factors at the discretion of the contractor. <br>  3. If I get an offer like ‚ÄúWrite, I will do‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo problem‚Äù, in the trash. <br>  4. If the candidate could not simply master to finish reading my description (for example, a performer from Magadan, but is needed only from Kiev, which is indicated in the description), in the trash. <br>  5. Next, sift the kings of the mountain.  "I work only on 100% prepayment!".  Work but not with me <br>  6. We eliminate too greedy.  For example, with an average cost of layout of an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù page of about 20-30 dollars, a person for 150 times will do me something congenial. <br>  6. I try to communicate with other applicants.  I ask what he did, on what he writes, how he would have done this and that.  I say goodbye to those who write ‚ÄúI'll do it like two fingers‚Äù or with those who try to impersonate who they really are (according to their own subjective assessment). <br>  7. The so-called ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù also fall into the previous item, i.e.  intermediaries.  In the process of working with such comrades, direct contact with the developer does not work, but I did not come across quite adequate managers.  Their function is a broken phone.  It only hinders. <br>  8. Another category of lamers, a very terrible category.  Sometimes in a short conversation you will not reveal such people. The favorite answer of such people to claims arising after doing all the work or the stage is a counterattack with hysteria.  ‚ÄúB $ #, I was busy with your project, and you are my brain @ # $ w ... wow! <br>  9. I can give the job to a newbie, if I see that the person is really trying to earn money and: <br>  - the work is not difficult and it is easy to fix or redo it in case of incorrect execution <br>  - sufficient time reserve. <br>  Difficult things do not give, sorry, but this is not the case.  Either we learn, or we earn money. <br>  10. Web studios for the name of a nameless hero with big ambitions, but small possibilities and knowledge make me laugh (Example: Once I come across a project in which a person cannot overcome the UTF-8 encoding in MySql .. I‚Äôm doing it for 5 minutes. I write him a very short sentence. In response, I receive a message in which he says that I would like to save the text in the database "in this encoding" and then the line of krakozyablikov. Explain that this is wrong. People disappear. After a couple of days I publish a completely different project. And what do you think? This is the same Comrade writes that ‚ÄúVery experienced teams  make me full of chocolate. zhah! Mom, Rodi me back).

      <br>
      b) If I am a bidder for the project <br>  1. I do not submit applications for all projects in a row, but only those that are interesting to me or those that I know better (I have more experience) or just liked the idea (for example, I love everything related to online video). <br>  2. I don‚Äôt put bids for projects that seem to me price recognition (for example, how much will it cost to make the site showsiski.ru?). <br>  3. I do not regret 10-15 minutes for writing a detailed sentence in an accessible language (without technical details), but without childish babble. <br>  4. If I did projects like this, let me know it, if not, then I say what I have of the functional and what I will do from scratch. <br>  5. If, according to the description of the project, I can assume the deadline, I say indicative, but with an indication that I will say more precisely after discussing the details. <br>  6. Similar to the preceding paragraph, pricing occurs.  There are exceptions.  If the work is for the soul, I can make it cheaper. <br>  7. At the beginning of a conversation, you always contact you, even if the customer is younger than me.  In the process of work, we can move to a more formal communication, it is easier. <br>  8. NEVER agree on the percentage of profits and future bright prospects!  My part is creation, please earn millions on your site, the toad will not crush me <br>  9. I do not require prepayment (it scares away any normal person), but I strongly prefer a secure transaction, which is a guarantee that the customer ‚Äúwill not forget‚Äù about me.  I show small works on my server.  There is a negative experience.  If the client does not appeal for the first time, then, of course, the rules change, some trust arises. <br>  10. I do not like all know-alls who manipulate terminology (except when the customer is really in the subject).  Make me a ‚Äúmodule wrapper‚Äù.  B # $ me!  Often the use of terminology by the customer leads to a misunderstanding of the task.  If I feel that the terminology is in the way, please do not be offended, but explain it in human language. <br>  11. Often, before starting work, I try to discuss with the customer a scheme of mutual explanations, I ask the customer (however, this happens with the performers) to avoid the expressions ‚Äúthere‚Äù, ‚Äúthis‚Äù, ‚Äúall‚Äù.  For example: ‚ÄúThe picture is wrong there!‚Äù Please rephrase ‚ÄúThe logo is too close to the left border of the browser. <br>  12. I try to discuss with the client what he gets for his money.  For example: The cost of 10 dollars includes two logo designs.  ‚ÄúA little poiigratsya with color,‚Äù as customers sometimes like to express (where they dug up this phrase?) You can endlessly.  I think no one wants to go into slavery for $ 10. <br>  13. Patience to the opposite side.  The customer is a person paying money.  Before writing an angry response, ‚Äúto a stupid idiot who himself does not know what he wants,‚Äù I switch to something else, letting myself cool down, and only then write. <br>  14. The customer and the contractor - partners, cooperate on mutually beneficial terms, and do not do a favor, having come down to conversations with the other party.  Behave yourself with dignity, but without licking ass, though, arrogance is also not welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78103/</a></p>
