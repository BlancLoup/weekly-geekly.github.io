      How to choose Magento-developers to create a quality product? <br>  Pay attention to the following points and you will definitely not regret your choice. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Official Magento Partners</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/d5c/a39/676d5ca39fac4d419b72b75bd8ff54bb.png"><br><br>  If the company has the status of a partner Magento, this indicates a decent level of its competencies.  To obtain the status of "Partner", you must go through several stages of checks from the head office of Magento Inc.  Among them: checking the quality of the code on active projects, the presence in the portfolio of works of a certain level of complexity and budget, the presence in the staff of a team of certified developers, analysis of feedback from real customers. <br><br>  The list of official partners of Magento in Russia can be viewed on the official website of Magento. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Certified Magento Developers</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/953/bce/ef5/953bceef5dde42d6ae3409672852247c.png"><br><br>  Only a small percentage of Magento-specialists have a certificate confirming the qualifications and professionalism. <br>  This is due to the complexity of training and passing the final certification testing in a specialized center. <br>  When choosing contractors, we advise you to pay attention to those teams whose specialists have confirmed their knowledge at the international level, have been officially certified and received a license to develop in the field of Magento. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/550/dea/0ce/550dea0cec9f42119c0b6cd6557b1517.jpg" align="left" width="78" height="163" hspace="10" title="Magento 2 ready partner"><br>  In November, the first version of Magento 2 was released, so certification for working with version 2 of the system is also very relevant.  And there is one important point. <br>  Today, only Magento partners have access to Magento 2 training, and only employees of partner companies can be tested for knowledge of the platform. <br>  If all the necessary verifications are successfully completed, the partner receives the status of Magento 2 ready partner. <br><br>  If you decide to create a project based on Magento 2, you cannot do without proven partners who have been trained. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Magento Experience</b> </li></ul><br>  The longer the team works with Magento, the wider range of problems it can solve in a short time and at minimal cost. <br>  It is experience and long-term practice that allows you to choose the right architectural solution and avoid a lot of problems in the future. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Warranty and support</b> </li></ul><br>  Sites on Magento are known for their rich functionality, so when planning a project, you should immediately rely on additional estimates for support after the release.  If contractors do not provide support for the project, you should consider. <br><br>  In addition, you need to pay attention to whether the warranty period for the work done.  It usually takes half a year from the project release date. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Portfolio</b> </li></ul><br>  Before you make a choice in favor of a particular agency, you need to familiarize yourself with the portfolio of work.  If you liked a couple of cases and you would like to create a similar project, this is a good sign and you are going in the right direction. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Feedback</b> </li></ul><br>  Feel free to ask questions.  Experienced Magento developers should have the answer to any question regarding project work and the technical nuances of development.  If professionals work at the agency, none of the possible questions will be able to perplex them. <br><br>  ______ <br>  If when choosing contractors for creating your project you will be guided by these points, you will be able to find talented developers and reliable partners for long-term cooperation. <br><br>  Experienced teams always effectively cope with projects of any complexity at the expense of all the advantages described above, namely: <br><ul><li>  Advanced training and inspections by leading experts Magento Inc .; </li><li>  An established process of internal training and certification; </li><li>  Access to unique affiliate materials and training; </li><li>  Constant practice in the field of Magento development. </li></ul><br>  We hope that our advice will be useful.  Good luck on the projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296234/</a></p>
