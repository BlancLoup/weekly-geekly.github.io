    <h3>  Tasks &lt;/ h3 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/a7/aa/j6a7aawoyqcq9cthku1_qmm8qja.jpeg"><br><br>  Proper task setting is half the success.  Nowadays, 3D printers are not designed for toys, figurines, pots and other decorations, or rather, they can print everything on them, but the main tasks of additive technologies are now much more global: this is reducing production costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/d0/ax/ddd0axlidwuiyl21v0_qpilbhvk.jpeg"><br><br>  All this must be understood when integrating additive technologies into the learning process. <br><br>  Scanners are usually used for the following purposes: reverse engineering, quality control, rapid prototyping, virtual assembly, analysis of shapes and sizes, preparation of design documentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eo/ce/f3/eocef3pokq3txkbyceufffzgi2q.jpeg"><br><br>  One of the problems of digital technology in Russia right now is a shortage of qualified specialists who can solve these problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/dx/qs/yddxqs6ighygfhqkl-ph28a4bbo.jpeg"><br><br>  In the field of education, the crisis with the training of specialists capable of working with modern equipment, one of the most important tasks of the industry is the training of qualified personnel, which are so scarce in production. <br><br>  To prepare these professionals, you need the appropriate equipment for their training. <br><br>  Before we talk about the appropriate equipment, we will talk about the fact that there is no sense to acquire for educational purposes.  Many see it as a purchase option as textbooks, aided by low prices, but it will bring little benefit.  Further - more about it. <br><br></h3><h3>  What equipment can not buy for vocational training and production </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5q/rp/zk/5qrpzkdz4qmmtentberquupdsi4.jpeg"><br><br>  The vast majority of printers worth up to 100 000 rubles.  These include various assembly kits and other Chinese printers that do not have the necessary structural rigidity and reliability. <br><br>  A cheap 3D printer is endless settings, calibrations, crashes, all this violates the training plan and reduces the quality of the issued specialists. <br><br>  A similar situation with 3D-scanners - scanners costing less than 150,000 rubles, as a rule, are also unsuitable for educational processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3s/-9/ae/3s-9aeudaw61zi6ipg8a9_pqcu4.jpeg"><br><br>  Having bought this equipment for the organization of the educational process, you just throw money away, this can be confirmed by those who have already purchased it.  In our experience of communicating with various educational institutions that unknowingly acquired these scanners and tried using them to teach scanning, reverse engineering and quality control organizations, we can confidently say that these scanning systems could not. <br><br>  Then they turned to us and we solved their problem. <br><br><h3>  Suitable equipment </h3><br>  This is how the equipment used in production looks like from the inside, suitable for education and for business: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4-/ov/tl/4-ovtl8xhrv1i1prj8tegz0llaq.jpeg"><br><br>  Here we see a printer printing with PolyJet technology, which provides high-precision printing and is used to create prototypes. <br><br>  This is how equipment in enterprises looks outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/3i/b4/og3ib40gth20byyw1oqxd5wqes0.jpeg"><br><br>  Nothing to do with household amateur 3D-printers, which, through ignorance, sometimes buy to solve problems that they are not designed for. <br><br>  The production operator is busy with printing, not setting or repairing the printer, this is the main difference between professional equipment. <br><br><h3>  SLS </h3><br>  The SLS technology is one of the most demanded and used in industry, in particular, in mechanical engineering and foundry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/rh/ic/aprhicnlypwkhbmrk2lfnytuffo.jpeg"><br><br>  Its main advantage is that there is no need for support elements, because the surrounding powder - print material - serves as a support for the model.  Due to this, many of the most sophisticated forms become available that are impossible to print on printers with other technology.  In addition, the technology allows you to fill the entire volume of the working chamber with prints, since there is no need for their contact with the platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/ky/mj/emkymjw97ej3iqyf3beuiuwvt8s.jpeg"><br><br>  Products after printing can be used as a final product, as their strength characteristics are as close as possible to cast and molded specimens. <br><br>  The cost of this decision previously started from 10 million rubles, so that it was not available for most educational institutions. <br><br>  The first SLS printer available for education: Sinterit Lisa. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/sinterit-lisa.html">Sinterit lisa</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vh/t4/ru/vht4ruimpul0q6q8qjrpbzomo2s.jpeg"></div><br><ul><li>  Power supply: 100/130 V or 220/240 V </li><li>  Dimensions, mm: 620 x 400 x 660 </li><li>  Weight, kg: 41 </li><li>  Laser: IR, 5W </li><li>  Maximum power consumption: 1.6 kW </li><li>  The maximum size of the workpiece: PA12 - 90110130 mm, flexa Black - 110130150 mm </li><li>  Minimum wall thickness: 0.4 mm </li><li>  Power consumption: 0.9 kW </li><li>  Working chamber: 150 x 200 x 150 mm </li><li>  Chamber temperature: 105 ¬∞ C </li><li>  The temperature of the printing table: 190 ¬∞ C </li><li>  Printing technology: SLS </li><li>  Layer thickness from: 0.075 mm </li><li>  Accuracy on axes X, Y, mm: 0.1 </li><li>  File Format: STL, OBJ, 3DS, FBX </li><li>  Supported materials: PA12 smooth, flexa Black </li><li>  Interfaces: Wi-Fi </li><li>  Print speed: 15 mm / hour </li></ul><br>  The cost of the complex Lisa is about <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/sinterit-lisa.html">1,300,000</a> rubles.  The package includes a printer, a powder sifting station and a sandblasting chamber for processing prints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/ne/pr/mxneprdslklba888_k6ytuno-z8.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a turnkey solution at the industrial level.  It can be used in medicine, for printing prototypes of implants and parts of prostheses, exoskeletons, splints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/oa/sq/shoasqulkj76upxyhx0tnf-y9dc.jpeg"><br><br>  A good solution is also for TsMITA - they are now actively developing and receiving support from the state, and for a technical college. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/eq/co/theqcoy9jz1gyjwiwg05iw3vspe.jpeg"><br><br>  Sinterit also recently introduced a new printer, the Sinterit Lisa Pro. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/sinterit-lisa-2.html">Sinterit Lisa Pro</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/-v/ri/h_-vriefj_rnvkifjmzfsamtncc.jpeg"></div><br>  It differs from its predecessor by an enlarged camera and printing in a gas atmosphere - the printer is equipped with an integrated nitrogen system, which allows the use of more materials. <br><br><ul><li>  Working chamber: 150 x 200 x 260 mm </li><li>  Chamber temperature: 192 ¬∞ C </li><li>  Printing technology: SLS </li><li>  Layer thickness from: 75 microns </li><li>  Printing accuracy XY: 50 microns </li><li>  Supported materials: PA11, PA12 Smooth, Flexa </li></ul><br>  The cost of the printer is <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/sinterit-lisa-2.html">less than two million</a> rubles.  It is well suited to a large industrial enterprise for running in the use of SLS in the production cycle and making a decision on the purchase of larger and more expensive equipment. <br><br><h3>  SLA </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/mv/e3/0tmve3say0lgrfel2mgn4asl5-u.jpeg"><br><br>  SLA is a generic technology name.  It has several proprietary analogues of different manufacturers, such as PolyJet and MJP, as well as variations on the light source used - DLP, LED. <br><br>  The essence of the technology is layer-by-layer curing of photopolymer resins with ultraviolet light. <br><br>  By virtue of its main advantage, the highest printing accuracy has the widest application: medicine, dentistry, jewelry production, printing foundry equipment, master models, burning out models. <br><br>  Due to its popularity in production, this technology is also in demand in education.  Since there are specialized SLA-printers for the dentistry and jewelry industry, and it can be very expensive to purchase several such devices in an educational institution, we offer you the most versatile and applicable printer for training. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-xfab-2500sd.html">DWS XFab</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mm/ah/ul/mmahulqtzjed9u-qdwlcjds5fss.jpeg"></div><br><ul><li>  Operating temperature and humidity: 20-25 ¬∞  / 60% </li><li>  Power supply: AC 240 / 100V / 50-60 Hz </li><li>  Sizes, mm: 400 x 606 x 642 </li><li>  Software: Fictor, Nauta </li><li>  File formats: .stl, .slc, .nauta, .fictor, .mkr, .3dm, .3ds, .ply, .obj, .lwo, .x </li><li>  Light source: BlueEdge solid state laser </li><li>  Operating system: Windows7 and above </li><li>  Working chamber: √ò 180x180 mm </li><li> System requirements: 2 GB of memory, graphics card compatible with OpenGL I / O, USB port, 1 active Internet connection, </li><li>  Specialization: Design, Souvenir industry, Jewelery, Education, Production </li><li>  Printing technology: SLA </li><li>  Layer thickness, from: 10 microns </li><li>  Interfaces: USB </li></ul><br>  It is suitable for both production and education.  It costs <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-xfab-2500sd.html">about 700,000</a> , and exceeds all printers in its class and price range in accuracy, most printers are up to two million rubles, and some models cost about five million.  In addition, the printers of the series have a significantly larger working chamber than the analogs of other companies that are similar in price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y-/uz/5z/y-uz5ztkdpez6vdyvd4tevpgrj0.jpeg"><br><br>  The manufacturer himself develops consumables and a laser printer system, thanks to which the quality of his prints surpasses the analogues, in particular, in terms of the strength of the models obtained, among other SLA printers, he has no competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/nt/g5/mcntg5urt1yormkfmv-i0sqpjn4.jpeg"><br><br>  A wide range of materials significantly increases the scope of the models printed on this printer. <br><br>  The weakest point of all SLA printers is the elements responsible for radiation, which is why DWS gives a lifetime warranty on the laser system of its 3D printers. <br><br><h3>  Fdm </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/wk/hb/gqwkhbhzyrx_3yni3gca9wsyarm.jpeg"><br><br>  FDM is the most popular and widely used 3D printing technology.  Its accuracy is constantly increasing and it gets more and more applications. <br><br>  Increasing the temperature of the print increases the list of available materials, which previously could only be processed in large-scale industries and plants with a cost of 10 million rubles or more.  These are ULTEM, PEEK, PEI and other refractory construction plastics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/9k/87/el9k877ndzr9mlhfm2q_jlejssa.jpeg"><br><br>  Competition to industrial equipment is ready to make a printer of the Latvian company MASS PORTAL, working with these materials and costing much cheaper. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/prof/mass-portal-d300.html">MASS PORTAL</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/oj/7o/rpoj7oklylknvr9gaegxtjkdsme.jpeg"></div><br><ul><li>  Dimensions, mm: 480x620x855 </li><li>  Software: FabCloud, Simplify3D, FabControl </li><li>  Country of manufacture: Latvia </li><li>  File Formats: .stl, .obj, .3mf, .gcode </li><li>  Working chamber: 300x300x300 mm </li><li>  Movement speed: 250 mm / s </li><li>  Specialization: Design, Architecture, Packaging, Advertising, Layout design, Souvenir industry, Education, Production </li><li>  Plate temperature: up to 120 ¬∞ C </li><li>  Extruder temperature: 75 -

it can be input, output, intermediate, and so on.  We scan, get a scan and compare the results with the CAD model to see the degree of compliance and all possible deviations.  This is done using <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/soft/3d-systems-geomagic-control-x.html">Geomagic Control X.</a>  This software is worth one million rubles, which is also not every educational institution can afford. <br><br>  There is a ready-made educational solution: hardware-software complex CREAFORM Academia. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/creaform-academia.html">CREAFORM Academia</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/8h/0b/yk8h0b9yogpdv1tcc4wrg0nf0ok.jpeg"><br><br>  The kit includes not only a 3D scanner, it also ships with: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/nq/uz/klnquzvhdtwsjrjjgtzmivbs5hq.jpeg"><br><br>  Software for scanning, reverse engineering and quality control, with a license for 50 jobs / training places and support for five years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/nr/sx/cynrsxudft3b-giwcpg_7gngrms.jpeg"><br><br>  Teaching materials, video tutorials and custom presentations. <br><br>  The cost of the educational package, <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/creaform-academia.html">Teaching package</a> , begins with an amount of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/creaform-academia.html">less than a million</a> rubles. <br><br>  Also available is an engineering version of the complex - Research package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t0/uc/nw/t0ucnwyt9nvbv3tgeczsvw1z9ky.jpeg"><br><br>  Its cost starts from 4 million rubles.  It differs in the complete scanner model - in the training set it is the Academy scanner; in Research Research, options are possible;  a set of software and the availability of certification as calibration metrology equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/qm/zb/vcqmzbimatpv5ukjom6xiv8vsac.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  If you want to save time and money, and usually these factors are very closely related, then you should contact the selection of equipment from professionals. <br><br>  Not so terrible is the loss of some sums from the budget of the institution in connection with the purchase of inappropriate equipment, such as failure of the curriculum or irrelevant knowledge in the program.
