And it is strange, because it is in its ‚Äúsign‚Äù and, apparently, we are on the verge of tremendous changes in the trade turnover in the Russian Federation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  RFID in brief </h2><br>  What <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) is</a> and what it is eaten with is explained and shown <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/161401/">here</a> .  Soon I will try to make a detailed review of the material accumulated in recent years.  Stay <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/tiberius/">in touch</a> , but for now let us return to our <s>sheep</s> fur coats ... <br><br><h2>  Gray fur coats unexpectedly settled </h2><br>  What is actually fuss?  From January 1, 2016, the Government of the Russian Federation obliged all suppliers and sellers to chip fur products for accounting in the marking system of the tax service.  The project was launched to run technologies, solutions and administer product verification using RFID chips. <br><br>  The very note about this was published in November 2016, but it caught my eye quite by accident.  According to the figures, I quote: <br><blockquote>  In just <b>8</b> months, the number of fur coats sold in Russia increased <b>16</b> ( <i>sic!</i> ) Times compared to 2015. </blockquote><br>  Just think, <b>16 times !!!</b>

      As of the end of 2016, it was possible to legalize about 20% of market participants, and for one it was possible to chide the Accounting Chamber, which provided data to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of only 400,000 products subject to mandatory chipization, while the real RFID order exceeded 6 million pieces. <br><br>  Each tag contains information about the origin and movement of a particular fur product.  Labels operate in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">UHF</a> range and comply with ISO / IEC 18000-63, EPCglobal Gen2v2 standards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/062/f2d/e73/062f2de7338c4cd0acbdc395a5111ad7.png"><br>  <i>Design a new RFID tag for fur coats.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.rusnano.com/about/press-centre/news/20160121-rst-invent-razrabotala-rfip-metku-dlya-shub">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Also, from January 1, 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Trade launched an experiment on (so far) voluntary labeling of medicines, additional chipping of light industry goods (in particular, footwear), precious wood, air components, and so on is being further developed. <br><br>  As you, my dear Habrayusers, you understand, this is not <s>only valuable fur</s> just chipping and product accounting, but on top of this model a block chain is superimposed, and the codes embedded in RFID become unique product identifiers.  Accordingly, the introduction of these technologies does not allow in the future to use any ‚Äúcalculators‚Äù of RFID numbers and makeshift recording devices for tag falsification.  This is undoubtedly a great achievement of Russian science and technology in the practical implementation of tags, which is currently not equal anywhere in the world. <br><br><h2>  The future of RFID in Russia: drugs, museums and much more </h2><br>  The developer of the RFID equipment and the promotional company in the Russian Federation is the RST-Invent portfolio company RosNano.  Therefore, having collected several press releases from RosNano and RST-Invest, we will look into the future of radio frequency identification in Russia. <br><br><h3>  Automatic accounting of museum and library storage facilities </h3><br>  So, the <a href="http://www.rusnano.com/infrastructure">Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs (FIEP) of RosNano</a> initiated a project in which employees of cultural institutions, private collectors, representatives of security companies and IT companies can learn how to use modern radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies to protect, record and control the movement of art objects. <br><br>  In particular, in the fall of 2016, <a href="http://www.rusnano.com/about/press-centre/news/20160901-kompaniya-tekhnologiya-identifikatsii-razrabotaet-dlya-pushkinskogo-muzeya-sistemu-okhrany-na-baze-rfid-metok">it was announced</a> that the technology engineering company FIEP ‚ÄúIdentification Technology‚Äù will develop an RFID system for the A.S.S.  Pushkin. <br><br>  The implementation of RFID will begin with the education of museum staff in the field of contactless radio frequency identification.  It is planned that the first pilot group, which will include about 100 people, will complete training in September 2017, that is, very soon. <br><br>  As for the libraries, the first pilot project was launched <a href="http://www.rst-invent.ru/rfid-news/news/114/">in the STC-GasProm library in St. Petersburg</a> , where storage, accounting and distribution of books are carried out automatically, thanks to RFID. <br><br><h3>  Valuable and unique products industry </h3><br>  In principle, it will be logical to continue the initiatives on chipping goods to be the arrival of RFID in the jewelry industry and aviation technology (especially after the <a href="http://xn--b1aga5aadd.xn--p1ai/2017/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F19/">recent scandal</a> with the repair of Indian fighters, this becomes especially important).  The PCT-Invest website offered <a href="http://www.rst-invent.ru/solv/">several solutions</a> for different industries. <br><br><h2>  Instead of a conclusion: in a barrel of honey a spoon of tar </h2><br>  When I began to write this review and reached the real numbers of the tags shipped, it seemed to me that here it is the Holy Grail of the semiconductor industry in Russia.  There is a company that produces labels - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Micron</a> , which is part of Sitronics / RTI holding, there is a company that offers interesting RFID solutions on the market, both technical (antennas) and innovative ones - RST Invest, and there is a government order - Tax Service plus Minpromtorg.  It would seem that the idyll, the first produce (recall that Micron has a full production cycle and stamps tickets for the Moscow metro, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/161401/">1</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/254138/">2</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/218171/">3</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/181119/">4</a> ), the second introduce, and all this (so far) is sponsored by the state order (see success stories or Brandson, who are not stopping mastering the money of American taxpayers). <br><br>  But, apparently, my rose-colored glasses are already dented by life, and something nevertheless made me turn to the press service of the PCT-Ivest for the answer to one simple question: <i>where</i> did the <i>chips for the tags come from, Zin?</i> <br><br>  It turned out that they still carry these tags to us mainly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXP_Semiconductors">NXP</a> , while the PCT-Invest company itself produces only antennas and mounts ready-made chips on them.  They even came up with the design of such an antenna so that at once the labels of three different manufacturers could be mounted: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXP_Semiconductors">NXP</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impinj">Impinj</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Technology">Alien</a> .  Although the five-year plan has already passed since the writing of <a href="http://www.rusnano.com/about/press-centre/news/76508">this note</a> , it would be possible to establish contacts with Sitronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/ac5/6a7/e73ac56a74cf4a55bc2f2eb90f904605.jpeg"><br>  <i>The design of a new RFID tag at once for the chips of three manufacturers.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.rst-invent.ru/rfid-news/news/120/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Again, the bright dream broke on the harsh reality ... <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> About the defects noted in the text, please write in the LAN. <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> Sometimes briefly, and sometimes not so much about the news of science and technology can be read on <a href="https://telegram.me/TiberiusRu">my Telegram channel</a> - welcome;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403279/</a></p>
