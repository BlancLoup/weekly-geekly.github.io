Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Robert Boyle was a physicist, chemist and theologian.  At 22, he already became a professor.  He discovered the Boyle-Mariotte law.  In this post we will talk about him as a person who, 350 years ago, wrote a ‚Äúwish list‚Äù of 24 points, many of which came true.  It is about the ‚Äúsecond youth‚Äù, organ transplantation, telemedicine, the art of flight and the transmutation of vegetables. <br><br>  In the post, I sorted out the first six points of Boyle‚Äôs ‚Äúwish list‚Äù and described how they came to life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/b61/ab6/859b61ab65782ba6b3b6d022cb2c965f.jpg" width="300" alt="image">

At the moment, it is one year less than the average life expectancy of a man in Russia, but in the 17th century it was a tremendous period.  Then the Englishman could hope that he would be able to reach 37-38 years old.  The development of medicine led to the fact that by 1900 the life span in Europe had increased to 46 years, and in fifty years to 67 years.  At present, the average life in the UK is 80.3 years - so this desire can be considered fulfilled, albeit largely due to a decrease <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241434/">in the mortality rate</a> . <br><br>  And, of course, thanks to the possibilities for the return of youth, that is, the second item on the list that has come true. <br><br><h4>  2) Return to youth, or at least partial rejuvenation of a person: new teeth, hair color as in youth </h4><br>  Once health really could not be bought.  Because then the doctors had only plantain.  And now, humanity is already very close to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/208850/">creation of a cyborg</a> .  And transplantology is very advanced. <br><br>  Hair color is boring, and teeth are interesting.  Boyle did not live to see Pierre Fauchard‚Äôs ‚Äúsurgical dentistry‚Äù color ‚Äî the father of modern dentistry (although artificial teeth have somehow been hammered in the jaw for more than a thousand years). <br><br>  At that time no one treated the teeth; therefore, Foshar‚Äôs great achievement was fillings for the treatment of caries.  Now we have at our disposal a technique that could not even have thought of in the 17th century, various materials and 3D printers to make a tooth of any size and shape. <br><br>  <i>Tools Foshar.</i>  <i>Still afraid of the dentist?</i>  Now, because <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/232593/">dentistry looks very different</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c77/5c6/172/c775c6172d8694b3991bbf693312334d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Youth can not only be restored, but also retained.  Vitamin complexes, proper nutrition, fashion for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212811/">playing sports</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">health gadgets</a> and even <a href="http://www.adme.ru/tvorchestvo-dizajn/dozhili-zubnaya-schetka-podklyuchaetsya-k-iphone-i-pomogaet-vam-chistit-zuby-641005/">helping to brush your teeth</a> - this is what helps this dream come true. <br><br>  And organ transplants, including artificial ones, also help.  As early as 1969, the first transplantation of an artificial heart to a patient was performed.  It worked for 64 hours, after which it was replaced with an allograft.  Then it seemed a miracle, but today a two-stage heart transplant is common. <br><br>  In the photo - "Hertz-02", an artificial heart, developed in 1976 in the USSR.  Unfortunately, there was not enough money to continue working with him, so they didn‚Äôt build him into a living human patient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a82/0fc/408/a820fc4086e172eb4c1067f102e95b85.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  AbioCor - has a number of disadvantages, but at the same time completely artificial heart, the battery of which is charged through the skin without wires, punctures and other troubles.  The development of 2006, in public, has already been tested.  Term life with him - up to 17 months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b72/130/7e4/b721307e41ec109da169c5e4b7922eba.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  3) The art of flying </h4><br>  If Boyle did not mean levitation, then that desire came true.  Moreover, over the past time, a man learned to lift into the air and even send into space the hardest objects (about a miracle, not knocking on a heavenly stronghold!), Began to jump from an incredible height with a bag with a folded rag into it, provided the suit with membranes and hung it on his head helmet with GoPro. <br><br>  <i>And I learned how to upload it on Youtube ...</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsV3bGPMTXo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhitGr4aBm6E6kmhJl5Qtm0ZhGo34A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>The world's first passenger plane - "Ilya Muromets", 1913.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/a1e/667/af0a1e6678bf7021c07e94824ccccee5.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The fastest passenger aircraft is TU-144, 2013.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e5/989/863/5e5989863b6751057377887a357d6a81.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  There is not much time left before <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241792/">Solar Impulse 2 will fly out of Abu Dhabi</a> in order to make a world tour using only solar energy. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA5cPuhEinU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwGvajZQIiSJLJSKEdvESzVclNIw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/703/763/513/703763513f9340f482c8fe013602dbbc.jpeg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  But Boyle did not think about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/222915/">flying cars</a> for obvious reasons.  In the end, and such a miracle was. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/8b1/f81/58d8b1f8160444ea40876e7580ad4357.jpg" width="600"><br><br><h4>  4) The art of staying under water for a long time and functioning normally there. </h4><br>  This drawing was made a year before the death of Robert Boyle.  And besides him, then there were dreamers who believed that a person can be sent under the water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b4/3cb/370/5b43cb370e35bdbe5a510f89e52b572a.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Diving suit with hand pump for air supply, 1900</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e4/d01/054/7e4d010546cd1c2913c40a650365ed44.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Another dreamer was Jules Verne, who described the device for breathing under water invented in 1866 by Benoit Rueuleir in the novel Twenty Thousand under Water.  The handyrol is a mining engineer, and his creation was intended for use in mines.  The idea was repeatedly developed, and in 1943, Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Emile Ganian, in occupied France by the Germans, created the first safe and effective apparatus for breathing under water. <br><br>  <i>Did you watch the Cousteau films about the underwater world in childhood?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec5/49c/d13/ec549cd132410094a88657448b1e3c24.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  And submarines are widely used for military purposes (to surf the oceans and expel Americans, for example), for research and even just so that tourists can take a look at the fish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83a/6db/b5f/83a6dbb5f35d03260f64582106c96e0d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  5) Healing wounds at a distance </h4><br>  Obviously there were no spells meant.  So what?  Perhaps it was about some devices that can heal wounds.  But, perhaps, what did he mean by the possibility of conducting analyzes and operations at a distance, that is, <a href="http//habrahabr.ru/post/238937/">telemedicine</a> ?  Smart toilet <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/222467/">Toto and Daiwa House</a> - home complex, allowing you to collect information about body weight, blood sugar levels, follow blood pressure and urine analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1b/28b/e62/f1b28be629e561ef8b8a0ddea43ed206.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  6) Treatment of diseases at a distance or with the help of transplantation </h4><br>  Now there is a separate market - mHealth, or mobile health.  It includes a variety of devices for maintaining a healthy life, for sending data about the condition of patients to doctors and so on.  Opportunities to make money on this market are great, including thanks to crowdfunding - just draw a beautiful bracelet and ask for its refinement 50 thousand dollars.  And if the device eventually hits the market - the program is fully implemented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f1/1ee/2bf/0f11ee2bfad47c4ef455550798d485da.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  If consultations with doctors and their training are possible even via Skype, for example, right in booths installed in pharmacies, then everything is a bit more complicated with surgery. <br><br>  In the world for 2010, 1000 Da Vinci robotic surgeons were built.  In Russia, 20 of them are installed.  The doctor works remotely, he sees a 3D image of the patient and with the help of joysticks controls the robo-hands.  The topic itself was used many times in the stories, also by Isaac Asimov, and in 1980 the first Da Vinci was created.  New technologies allowed to improve it constantly to the current state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bc/996/766/3bc996766ace8c6d5d88ed99c0378025.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  What about transplantation?  Kidneys, liver, heart, skin ... You can transplant different organs.  Even hair - remember the advertisement about "from here to here, from here to here"? <br><br>  <i>This picture is called ‚ÄúSaints Cosmas and Damian transplant the diseased leg from the deceased Moor‚Äù by artist Jaime Uge, 1459-1460.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f86/e22/7a3/f86e227a3c0ced930ed8666cb62f256d.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361131/</a></p>
