  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Herrmann Dominanz Instrument (HDI). Part III</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We talked a lot about people, it's time to draw a line. <br>  This article will be my last in a series of articles about HDI: the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144837/">first part</a> , the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144933/">second part</a> . <br>  I also decided that it would only consider the following aspects: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145011/">Growth vectors or much better to grow</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145011/">Needs for people, how to determine which type you need</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145011/">findings</a> </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><a name="vector"></a><h5>  Growth vectors or much better to grow </h5><br>  The main rule - no need to aim at the opposite dominant.  Happiness will not bring you, but add problems, with rare exceptions.  Let's try to quickly consider the vectors of development. <br>  "Innovators" will be better and easier to develop in "analytics", but you can also go to <b>C.</b> <br>  ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù prioritize going to ‚Äúengineers‚Äù (developing A), but D is also not prohibited. <br>  I also advise ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù to develop B. The rest is problematic for them. <br>  But the socially-oriented type ( <b>C</b> ), in order not to lose touch with reality, it is necessary to develop analytical skills (the main thing is not to ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù).  On the other hand, empaths can also easily grow. <br><br><a name="need"></a><h5>  Needs for people, how to determine which type you need </h5><br>  Any organization goes through different periods of its existence, like any living organism.  She is born, grows, ages, dies.  True without the last: people die faster, and new leadership, like new blood, changes and forces fairly stagnant processes to move. <br>  Business needs in different periods are different, which means that different characteristics are valued, in relation to HDI - people of different dominants. <br>  So people with type <b>B</b> : "administrators", "engineers", "executors" - should be preferred if your company has entered the stage of stagnation;  when all internal processes are streamlined, the expansion is no longer relevant, and it is required to keep operating activities at the right level, while trying to reduce costs. <br>  Owners of type <b>C</b> , as I have already paid your attention, it is necessary to give preference in the maple-oriented business, the service sector.  The required percentage of such people is always needed if you want to create a ‚Äúsolid team‚Äù, in some cases they subconsciously play the role of a catalyst for creating a team.  Do not be afraid that their chatter distracts from work and create informal relationships within.  Without this, the team will not be created, mutual support and mutual assistance will not appear, the business may eventually lose more than it will gain if you don‚Äôt have an Empath or an actor, in rare cases a performer. <br>  In the first stages of the life of an organization, when it is necessary to generate new ideas, concepts, implementation of unique projects, you will not do without type <b>D.</b>  Being owners of very high-quality awls in a place where other people usually sit, ‚Äúinnovators‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúactors‚Äù and ‚Äústrategists‚Äù (the latter are doubly needed and usually occupy strategic posts) - will be key figures in business development.  When everything is ‚Äúsettled down‚Äù, the especially bright owners of dominant D will leave you.  This is normal.  If you plan to work with such people for a long time, then you should take care of unique projects for them. <br>  Who are the "analysts" and when they are needed, I will leave without explanation.  I suspect that you have already guessed everything. <br>  For harmonious development, all dominants in the team are necessary, but business needs dictate which dominant should prevail.

    <a name="doubt"></a><h5>  findings </h5><br>  Much has been said and written.  And it is still possible to discuss a little, but in order not to ‚Äúgo into circulation‚Äù and the respected Reader did not have the feeling that the material was ‚Äúsucked from the finger‚Äù - it was decided to put an end. <br><br>  Having decided to abandon the practical examples of using the MQM mechanisms (delegation, motivation, control) based on HDI that I proposed earlier, I was guided by the fact that your leadership style may not coincide with mine, and examples from my experience will not always be successful with you.  Here the main principle ‚Äúdo no harm!‚Äù, In time, you yourself will be able to tell examples, and I will gladly join the discussion. <br>  Before looking at HDI on HDI, you first need to consider just what a DMK is and ‚Äúwhat it is eaten with.‚Äù  I am sure that few people know how to properly use it.  And those who know would gladly refresh their memory (at least I would definitely not refuse).  Perhaps I will write about it next time.  ( <i>Considering that the audience is small, I will leave this question to the vote: ‚ÄúDo I have to write?‚Äù</i> ) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I will not hide, it was pleasant to receive positive feedback, there were various questions.  But also, as it is important for an artist to find <i>‚Äúthat one smile‚Äù</i> , it is also important for any author to find his reader.  I am grateful to everyone who read my articles for help, discussions, and even for indicating spelling and stylistic errors. <br><br>  As for the conclusions on the material, each of you have already made them.  I wish everyone successfully apply HDI. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145011/</a></p>
