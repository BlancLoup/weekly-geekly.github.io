  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I-Bolit Team Presentation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The i-Bolit team was created to participate in the Skolkovo MD Selection on the basis of the company Anameson LLC, which was formed in 2011 to develop and market the ultra-wideband sensor networks based on the ultra-wideband chaotic oscillations.  The concept of the team is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwireless wearable sensor networks, implemented on the basis of ultra-wideband chaotic radio pulses.  Chaotic radio pulses, as a storage medium for wireless sensor networks, were first included as an optional solution in the IEEE 802.15.4a ultra-wideband wireless personal communications standard.  Now this technology is also included in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, which is specifically designed for creating wireless networked medical applications.  In this standard, wireless direct communication of information is now used as one of the main solutions.  Data transmission technology using chaotic radio pulses is patented in several countries.  Intellectual property rights in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Republic of Korea, France, Germany, Great Britain, Canada and the United States belong to citizens and organizations of the Russian Federation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The central idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device concept is a medical wireless ultra-wideband sensor network, which includes several medical sensors (whose composition may vary) and a central unit based on a device like a smartphone, which will have software that controls the operation of the MDU and with which the user will interact.  The use of ultra-wideband signals for the organization of interaction between the modules of the MDU allows you to create a highly reliable high-speed communication channel that is absolutely safe for humans, completely abandoning the wires.  This allows medical sensors to include not only devices that generate small amounts of information (such as thermometers or tonometers), but also video or audio sensors. <br><br>  The device will be used according to the principle: <i>turn on &gt;&gt; follow the instructions from the MDU screen &gt;&gt; get the diagnosis and recommendations from the device</i> .  The interaction between the user and the MDU will be carried out using the familiar button interface displayed on the screen of the central unit.

      The proposed concept has an open architecture and allows you to enter into the device additional sensors as developed by the team, and other manufacturers.  In addition, in the process of analyzing possible scenarios for using the MDL, it was concluded that, under certain conditions, it would be advisable to supplement its functions with remote video surveillance of sick children and the elderly from relatives and to ensure acoustic contact with these groups of users. <br><br>  To date, several types of ultra-wideband sensor networks based on chaotic radio pulses have been developed and are present on the market.  All of them are designed and manufactured in Russia and will be used as prototypes in the proposed MDL concept. <br><br>  Of course there are a number of technical problems that must be solved during the implementation of the Project.  But one of the main and decisive factors is to ensure maximum ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù of the device to the Consumer. <br><br>  The device can be used in the following areas: <br><br><ul><li>  remote monitoring and monitoring of the condition of children and the elderly in everyday life; </li><li>  sports, expeditions, life and travel in isolation from the centers, where you can get full medical care; </li><li>  remote counseling, use in extreme situations; </li><li>  use in personal transport, as a regular means of primary diagnosis. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160877/</a></p>
