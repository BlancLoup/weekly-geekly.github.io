He usually becomes a bad programmer, because he is not allowed to concentrate on programming, but he is constantly twitching on managerial issues, because many team-leaders prefer to program either in the early morning or late at night, when no one distracts. <br><br>  But why does he become a bad leader?  There are actually many reasons, you can read about them in detail with Sasha Orlov, I will tell you about one of the most striking. <br><br>  Why do programmers find it difficult to learn how to manage people, but in our lives we have played so many strategic games, both computer and desktop.  It would seem that we know almost everything about strategy and tactics.  Many even won brilliantly not only military, but also economic strategies.  What is the reason?

    <a name="habracut"></a>  In games, we easily manage both powerful empires and a special forces team, but in real life we ‚Äã‚Äãcan‚Äôt normally manage even two programmers? <br><br>  Again, you can come up with a bunch of arguments, but I will highlight the most important, in my opinion: <br><br>  In most games, your subordinates are perfect! .. <br><br>  Did you notice?  They always do what they are entrusted with without mistakes, always from the first time and 100% accurately understand the order, always ready to go into battle, despite the fact that today is a weekend or holiday.  They never get sick, always happy with their salary and work schedule.  Robots, in one word! <br><br>  There are, of course, exceptions like the Jagged Alliance, but most games are exactly as described above. <br><br>  And when you become a leader you cannot even think that your tank sent to destroy the enemy turret did not find it, although he had a map and decided to read Habr or bash.org for boredom. <br><br>  But this is not the worst.  It happens that a tank found a turret, fired at it, and it even exploded, but when you lead a convoy of food past this turret, you will find that a couple of soldiers who had a grenade launcher left behind in the turret.  Those.  the task seems to be completed externally, but in fact the threat of the turret has not been eliminated.  Who thought that you need to check after this tank, that the turret is not really effective? <br><br>  And have you ever had such that you send your fleet to shoot the port city from guns, but instead your brave sailors, armed with dirks, land on the shore and try to take the city by storm? <br><br>  But this situation has happened: you urgently need reinforcements to finally capture the city or vice versa, and your paladins, who can come to the rescue, declare that it is already the end of the working day, and tomorrow is a day off. <br><br>  Ridiculous situations, is not it?  But in life everything is exactly like this: the marine infantry can get the flu down, and an artillery regiment can go to the service of your opponent, because it is closer to his home.  A squad of night elves may even be in a non-working mood today and with a sad face all day depicting that they are shooting at an enemy from a bow, while they themselves will watch videos on youtube. <br><br>  In general, what advice to novice managers: play necessarily in the Jagged Alliance and pump (educate yourself) specifically in managerial skills. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285404/</a></p>
