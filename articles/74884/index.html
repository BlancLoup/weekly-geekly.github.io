  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Developer Day. Complete</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26591993.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/bRu2YSkJQ9.jpg" align="left"></a>  Good night,% username%. <br>  I want to tell about the last Google Developer Day 2009 Moscow conference. <br>  For most visitors, this day began very early, because until eight in the morning, about 30 people gathered at the entrance to the October cinema, Google turned out to be very punctual and did not let anyone in before.  I had to freeze, but this was compensated for by quick registration (Those who came later, another hour were registered somewhere).  The least lucky people were those whose surname began with ‚ÄúK‚Äù, most of all this section of registration was filled, ‚ÄúA‚Äù - ‚ÄúZ‚Äù was practically empty at first. <br><br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26592104.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/FOU9I43MWW.jpg" align="left"></a> <br>  This time they immediately issued a pen, a questionnaire and a badge, respectively.  Then it was possible to take a translation receiver from English under a passport or driver's license.  Further, as they climbed to the second floor, the fact that the tables were covered with all sorts of goodies, tea, coffee, juice, etc., was very pleased.  (after the street, it's just a fairy tale). <br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26591707.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/4dRSdVC9i8.jpg" align="right"></a> <br><br>  When the bulk of the enrollment was registered, everyone was invited to the main hall and had a review of what would happen at the current conference (they were very pleased with the video, while they were waiting for the beginning, which they didn‚Äôt do with chrome).  Looking at speakers from Google‚Äôs overseas offices, it seemed that they had invited showmen, ours are still far from them in terms of the quality of information presented. <br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26592206.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/O1qJD2ZoRk.jpg" align="left"></a> <br>  Then everyone was invited to visit the sections of interest, taking into account the fact that the first two will be shot on video and uploaded to YouTube (not yet posted).  By the way, the sections were named as films, which successfully combined with the cinema (The Matrix, The Fifth Element, Men in Black, The Day After Tomorrow, Star Wars).  The last two were constantly overflowing, some had to listen to them in the aisle (in principle, there were places, but it was difficult to reach them). <br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26592157.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/U1MPDazYUQ.jpg" align="left"></a> <br>  It seemed to me that all the lectures were for beginners, only some of the points seemed new.  Speakers were happy to answer questions exchanged contacts, the atmosphere was very friendly and pleasant.  Chewy especially stood out among all, constantly joking and interested in the audience, but translators often didn‚Äôt keep up with his speed of speech :) In fact, I noticed only one translator who was ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù, the rest were just poorly familiar with the web and technologies, therefore translation sometimes it turned out like ‚ÄúPromt‚Äù :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, Google conducted a good PR campaign, I think everyone was convinced that you could make good money with them, I felt an emphasis on this, and I really want to make the web better and make money with them :) <br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26592281.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/kOg4TW3k6E.jpg" align="left"></a> <br>  Event service was top notch, thanks google!  And also at the end, those who filled out the questionnaire were given gifts, namely: a T-shirt, a notebook, stickers of all the main Google services and everything in the GDD 2009 corporate package. <br> <a href="http://ipicture.ru/Gallery/Viewfull/26592314.html"><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091111/thumbs/7m3V68awMJ.jpg" align="right"></a> <br>  I forgot to say, all participants were sent an invite to Google Wave, a special thank you for that.  (By the way, it was fun to listen to the comparison, which is more difficult for Google Wave or ... someone else devoted a whole site to it, it was more difficult for GW to be only the US tax law and some other girl (I don‚Äôt remember what to call :), otherwise GW is more difficult, even nuclear technology)
