  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As a web studio does not quarrel with the customer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Few would argue that good communication with the customer is extremely useful for a web studio.  Therefore, I would like to discuss the problem of personal relations ‚Äúcustomer-performer‚Äù as one of the most important components of a successful project. <br>  First of all, the customer must understand that you are a professional.  If your customer understands this, then the project will be successful, completed on time, and you will be recommended to others (of course, provided that you are really good at your job).  About how to achieve an understanding of your professionalism and will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Faith in yourself </h5><br>  Understanding your professionalism begins with whether you believe in it yourself.  If you are not confident in yourself and your services, you are not sure that you will cope with the task, then any further recommendations will hardly help you.  Your step should be firm, your voice sure, and your speech clear.  You must be competent enough to effectively communicate both with the company's management and with technical and advertising specialists.  You should not be a walking encyclopedia, but you should be well aware of what you are selling.  You must be appropriately dressed, you must make the right impression, because looking at you and your behavior, the customer will draw conclusions about what your company is. <br><br><h5>  Do a site project </h5><br>  Designing a site is important for understanding the goals, objectives of the project and customer expectations regarding their ways to achieve.  Spend a meeting with your customer, spend half a day to find out everything he wants to achieve and how he sees it.  I will not delve into the subtleties of design, but you should document the results of this meeting, summarizing the main points.  This stage will allow you to learn a lot about the project.  You will be less mistaken in estimating the time it takes to develop a site.  Site design layouts will take into account the wishes of the customer and, as a result, you will reduce the likelihood of a conflict situation. <br><br><h5>  Make a presentation of your design layouts. </h5><br>  This is a truism, but not always.  You must print your layout on a good paper, prepare a description for it, which substantiates the correctness of the chosen concept.  Very often, the perception of design is subjective, and you have to be close to your brainchild to create the right impression and answer the question why it‚Äôs done this way and not otherwise.  The presentation must be attended by a working group and a decision maker.

    <h5>  Be a little bureaucrat </h5><br>  Document the results of your work.  All documents are not signed by an ordinary manager, but by top management.  If you are doing a preliminary project design, sign the project.  About the technical task and the contract, I think you can not talk, everything is obvious.  As soon as you receive content for posting on the site, if possible, sign it too.  This can be done by writing it to a disk and fixing a unique disk number (it is usually written around the central hole).  Sign mandatory accepted design layouts.  It would seem that the bureaucracy, on the contrary, will only worsen relations, but in practice this is not the case.  Our task is to give as few reasons as possible for disagreements and discrepancies.  For example, verbal acceptance of design layouts by a line manager at times increases the likelihood of hearing from company management that everything needs to be redone when everything is done.  And this is a conflict. <br><br><h5>  Be able to defend your opinion and argue your words. </h5><br>  Very often, many believe that for a good relationship with the customer they do not need to contradict it and it‚Äôs better to once again agree than to aggravate the relationship.  This is a very fine line, and it is important to maintain a reasonable balance.  If you always go on about the client, you can get into a psychological trap and in the person of the customer will lose the right to their own opinion.  It is very difficult to get out of this situation without conflicts, because  the client sits down on the idea that he is always right.  So you risk to make a weak product that does not solve the problem of the customer.  The result will be a negative in your direction - you and only you will be to blame.  This process can take the most disgusting forms, to the point that you stop thinking and only do what you are asked to, if only you accept the work.  Sometimes the result of this is parting with you at one stage or another.  To avoid this, set a boundary for yourself - let the recommendations of the customer at least not interfere with the achievement of a common goal.  In the case of crossing this boundary, you should not argue about who is smarter, you should explain that the customer‚Äôs ideas hinder the achievement of goals from the project, referring to the signed and agreed project of the site.  Your words must be confident and have a strong argument.  It is better to spend time thinking about your arguments, they should be as tangible as possible, and not be in the ‚Äúugly-ugly‚Äù metrics space.  If the customer insists on changes, then these changes should begin with the correction of the project site, in other words, your client consciously needs to change the original goals of the resource. <br><br><h5>  Minimize the distance between the decision maker (DM) and you </h5><br>  Even if you comply with all the recommendations listed above, but there will be a series of managers, deputies and other employees between the studio and the decision maker, you still run the risk of facing a conflict situation.  I think it‚Äôs obvious why: the director said ‚Äúa‚Äù, you will get ‚Äúb‚Äù, but in the end you risk doing ‚Äúg‚Äù.  In order not to get into this situation, announce your requirement for the customer to form a working group for the development of the site.  In which will go and decision makers.  All work should be done only within the framework of this working group. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130947/</a></p>
