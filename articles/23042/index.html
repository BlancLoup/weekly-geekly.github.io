In our reality, ‚Äúbounty hunters‚Äù walk around with suits and ties, and outwardly resemble nothing more than aborigines with curved knives. <br><br>  In a word, headhunters - or, in other words, ‚Äúheadhunters‚Äù refer to employees of personnel agencies who are looking for employees for top management positions.  It can be said that such agencies and their approach to finding employees is fundamentally different from regular recruiting, where a selection is made from the available free labor resources to close vacancies.  Top managers are usually not free.  They are already working in solid positions and may not even think about moving to another company.  Moreover, for senior executives such a transition may not be such a simple task.  And to get the right employee headhunters show wonders of ingenuity worthy of their native brethren, going hunting in the jungle.  Here is one of these cases. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Recruitment agency perepal good order, namely to find the chairman of the bank.  The order is interesting, given that all more or less suitable people have been working for a long time somewhere.  And at the same time, a fee of 30% of the annual salary of the chairman of the board is also a good motivator for such a task. <br><br>  How long is it short, but the right person was found.  Naturally, he worked in one of the large banks and was also deputy chairman of the board.  So the offer was tempting for him - a transition with a boost.  The candidate himself agreed, and his candidacy very much suited.  It seemed to be done, but it was not there. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey will not let him go from the old place,‚Äù the candidate stated.  Just do not let go.  Though not the 90s in the yard, the candidate did not want any problems for himself in the future life.  The guys from the agency thought, and decided that all these fears were nonsense and that a professional psychologist was sent to him to calm the candidate. <br><br>  Two weeks after the conversation with the psychologist, they again called the candidate.  His wife picked up the phone: <br><br>  "What?!  From the agency ?!  - The woman on that end of the wire huddled in hysterics.  - You call here again ?!  Why did you send this fucking psychologist?  My husband lost his job, you brought him to a mental hospital!  Why are you calling again, is not enough for you ?!  You are terrible people! ‚Äù <br>  And hung up. <br><br>  And this is what happened: <br><br>  Approximately a couple of days after the conversation with the psychologist, the candidate did not go to his old job.  Without waiting for the patron at the entrance and not calling on the mobile, the personal driver went up to the apartment.  And there something terrible was happening, the Chief rushed about the house, tore up some papers and threw them into the toilet, threatened to go somewhere and shouted at his wife.  Seeing the driver, the chief brightened his eyes a little and ... asked to save him, take him to the border, and then he himself! .. Judging by vague explanations, the driver realized that there was some danger to the patron, that he was being pursued and wanted to be killed, that his wife Last night I tried to poison him.  Without hesitation, the driver called the security officers of the bank. <br><br>  From the window of the apartment, the deputy chairman of the board on the heads of the SC staff members who promptly approached, things flew.  Having turned away from a large television set, which unexpectedly flew out right under their feet, the security officers, drew their pistols, rushed to the rescue.  Judging by the cries, someone was killed in the apartment. <br><br>  Inside, there was a smell of burning.  Between the smoked walls, the disgruntled deputy chairman of the board thrashed around.  With crazy eyes, he ran around the apartment, and one by one threw out electronics items in the window.  And before that, as the crying wife told, she burnt some papers in bundles, muttering slurredly about the ‚Äúshrinking ring and close interchange‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThis is clearly a job for a psychiatrist,‚Äù the head of the Security Council decided, removing the weapon. <br><br>  Carefully, in order not to make the story public, the bank was rather large, brought to the doctor‚Äôs house, who announced the diagnosis: ‚ÄúSchizophrenia, Classic case: a persecution mania, followed by attributing close friends to the enemies, in this case a wife, an attempt to escape, getting rid of compromising papers, getting rid of electronic devices ... Perhaps some kind of shock, shifted the dormant heredity in the brain.  Unfortunately, this is not completely cured, a breakdown is possible at any time, followed by a relapse. ‚Äù <br><br>  From the bank, the deputy chairman was quietly dismissed, with all the compensation due.  But it is not difficult to guess his further fate.  After a couple of months of rest on the islands, schizophrenia went off by itself and the candidate quietly went to a new job, but the agency did not forget to receive their commission. <br><br>  Here they are bounty hunters. <br><br>  I am interested in referring to the original source of the article <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/community/articles/649664/">‚ÄúTerrible People‚Äù by</a> Alexey Boyarsky. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23042/</a></p>
