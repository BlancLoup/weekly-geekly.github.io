  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IoT devices - the favorite target of DDoS attacks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Viruses are parasitic on a growing number of Internet of Things devices, while their owners may not even be aware of this.  The number of viruses aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT) has increased many times over the past year.  In 2015, a record number of attacks was registered, with 8 new virus families registered.  More than half of all attacks originate in China and the United States, but the number of attacks from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands, Ukraine and Vietnam is also constantly growing.  The low level of security on many Internet of Things devices makes them easy targets, and device owners are often unaware of their infection. <br><br>  Only this month it became known about a large <nobr>DDoS attack</nobr> launched from 3 different types of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">botnets</a> (surveillance <nobr>botnets</nobr> , home routers and infected <nobr>web servers</nobr> ).  According to forecasts, the number of such attacks using devices Internet of Things will steadily grow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c10/5f1/54d/c105f154d0df4c5199eb0bee7961a7e9.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1.New vulnerability families.</i>  <i>In 2015, the number of threats to Internet of Things devices has multiplied and many vulnerabilities continue to be active in 2016.</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Attacks on devices of the Internet of things predicted for a long time, most often it was about home automation devices and home security.  Today, the attacker's policies have taken a different form: now they are usually not as interested in the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù as they want to capture the device in order to add it to the <nobr>botnet</nobr> , most of which are used to perform <nobr>DDoS attacks</nobr> .

    </p><h2>  Most vulnerable devices </h2><br>  The most common targets of intruders are embedded devices.  Many of them can connect to the Internet, but <nobr>due to</nobr> operating system limitations and processing power, they usually do not contain <nobr>any</nobr> additional security features. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"><br><br>  Embedded devices are often once connected to the power grid, go through a simple installation process, after which they are forgotten.  For such devices, no firmware upgrades are performed, and they are subject to replacement only at the end of their life cycle.  As a result, any compromise or infection by viruses goes unnoticed by the owner, which is a sweet lure for intruders. <br><br><h2>  China and the United States - the birthplace of most attacks </h2><br>  Analysis of Symantec, which resulted in the collection of many malware samples, showed that the largest number of attacks originates in China, which accounts for 34% of all attacks in 2016.  26% of attacks come from the US, followed by Russia (9%), Germany (6%), the Netherlands (5%) and Ukraine (5%).  Vietnam, Great Britain, France and South Korea close the top ten. <br><br>  The numbers in the figure indicate the location of the <nobr>IP address</nobr> used to launch malicious attacks.  In some cases, used <nobr>IP addresses</nobr> could be proxies, used to hide the true location.  The most frequent threats have become Linux.  Kaiten.  B and Linux.  Lightaidra. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e5/e24/d05/2e5e24d057434a49950d6e32f33424da.png"><br>  <i>Figure 2. <nobr>Top-10</nobr> attack <nobr>countries</nobr> in 2016 (by the number of unique addresses)</i> <br><br><h2>  Top Passwords </h2><br>  The analysis also showed what are the most common passwords used by malware to enter devices.  Not surprisingly, the combination of ‚Äúroot‚Äù and ‚Äúadmin‚Äù leads, showing that most often no one changes the default passwords. <br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  TOP usernames </td><td>  Top Passwords </td></tr><tr><td>  root </td><td>  admin </td></tr><tr><td>  admin </td><td>  root </td></tr><tr><td>  DUP root </td><td>  123456 </td></tr><tr><td>  ubnt </td><td>  12345 </td></tr><tr><td>  access </td><td>  ubnt </td></tr><tr><td>  DUP admin </td><td>  password </td></tr><tr><td>  test </td><td>  1234 </td></tr><tr><td>  oracle </td><td>  test </td></tr><tr><td>  postgres </td><td>  qwerty </td></tr><tr><td>  pi </td><td>  raspberry </td></tr></tbody></table>  <i>Table 1. Top 10 logins and passwords used in the attacks of <nobr>IoT-devices</nobr></i> <br><br><h2>  The most common threats </h2><br>  While malware for <nobr>IoT devices</nobr> are becoming more sophisticated, the fact that they are mainly used for <nobr>DDoS attacks</nobr> allows us to highlight several common features that can be traced in the variety of existing malware. <br><br>  The more widespread the virus, the more straightforward the attackers.  While some malware must be manually installed on a device, the most common method is to scan random <nobr>IP addresses</nobr> with open Telnet or SSH ports and then try to log in using frequently used credentials. <br><br>  <nobr>Due to the</nobr> different architectures of the processors on which embedded devices work, malware can try to randomly download bot executables for several architectures and run them one at a time until the scheme is successful.  In other cases, the malware can also include a module that checks for the platform of an existing device and downloads the correct bot files. <br><br>  The usual tactic is to use wget or TFTP commands to load a script (.sh), which in turn loads the bot files.  In one of the cases, a <nobr>shell script was</nobr> used where street drug names were used to distinguish bot binaries for different architectures. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f83/861/253/f83861253a0446afaf4ca3f6d55321ca.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3. <nobr>Shell script</nobr> used to load binary <nobr>bot files</nobr> for different architectures</i> <br><br>  When executing the bot files, a connection will be established with the C &amp; C server, awaiting commands from the remote <nobr>master bot</nobr> .  Communication can be established via the <nobr>IRC channel</nobr> , and malware can also include functionality for encrypting traffic to a remote server. <br><br><h2>  Cross Platform Vulnerabilities </h2><br>  <nobr>Cross-compiling</nobr> different architectures is a fairly common fact.  While the most common targets are the x86, ARM, MIPS and MIPSEL platforms, attackers continue to expand the number of potential targets, and also create options for PowerPC, SuperH and SPARC.  Thus, the list of potentially vulnerable devices is growing, and more and more <nobr>web servers</nobr> , routers, modems, network storage devices, video surveillance systems and other devices are being added to it. <br><br>  One interesting feature: many malwares are seen in the ability to kill other processes, in particular processes belonging to other viruses.  In some older versions, this feature was used only to eliminate potential competitors from an infected device.  The most common reason is that embedded devices come with very limited system resources, and the malware is trying to free the processor from "extra" procedures. <br><br>  To achieve the same goal, but on the basis of a more complex approach, malware can also modify the rules of the IP table on an infected device so that only certain types of external access can be attempted.  Such changes make it possible to effectively block access to the device for other intruders, as well as to block the actions of admins (blocking the telnet port). <br><br>  <nobr>DDoS attacks</nobr> remain the main target of viruses targeting IoT devices.  With the rapid growth of the Internet of things, an increase in computing power in devices may cause changes in tactics in the future, and attackers will have new opportunities for the extraction of cryptocurrencies, theft of information and network espionage. <p></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314334/</a></p>
