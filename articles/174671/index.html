  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dual core brain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear reader <br><br>  Today I would like to share with you one story, more precisely, a description of one of my experiments and what it led to.  It does not make sense to read this article in fragments, or read in solid text, or <s>do</s> n‚Äôt read <s>davidosvidanya</s> at all!  It is absolutely not recommended to use something that you learn about - it can lead to completely unpredictable consequences. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Theory </h4><br>  Once, while still a student, I thought about technological progress.  Then the processors just started to build cores.  And in some incomprehensible way, my thoughts were crossed into the idea that the human brain was multi-core deprived.  But how cool it would be to be able to use human input devices from several different consciousnesses.  Each of the consciousnesses could cognize the world, passing data through itself and creating neural connections in the brain for their memorization, understanding and awareness.  Several consciousnesses in one physical brain could use different eyes for different purposes, from the outside it would look like reading two books at the same time, or one of the eyes would look at House and the other would read lectures.  In this case, one of the consciousnesses would rest, and the other processed the material, forming more and more new connections.  Then the resting and working consciousness could change. <br><br>  It is possible that cohabiting consciousness in the beginning would be less effective than the one.  But gradual development would bear fruit in the form of a higher total productivity of several consciousnesses.  After all, everyone has room to grow, at least the record was set by a single consciousness.

    <h4>  From theory to practice </h4><br>  How to get two consciousnesses in one head?  Obvious options: to engender the second and develop or split the only thing.  The first option seems to be more secure (with a split consciousness, a direct road to the psychiatric hospital, or are we already there?).  The second option is more likely to succeed because it is unclear how to cultivate the second consciousness from the embryo, how to train it?  Do you disconnect the first consciousness?  It was decided to try the splitting of consciousness.  It remained only to choose the method and start the experiment.  A few days these thoughts did not give me rest, until one day the method was not invented ... <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe method was to use two input devices simultaneously and try to get information from both at the same time.  I armed myself with two players, set the same volume, turned on completely different playlists and went down to the subway.  At first, the feelings were contradictory, I heard both tunes at the same time, but I could only listen to one of them.  I tried to keep both motives in my head, by the way, while there is no way to keep track of anything else ... It was very hard to focus on both melodies at once, then one or the other escaped from my attention and had to return attention to both songs.  Then I realized that my eyes were open and I really didn‚Äôt see anything - I just didn‚Äôt notice what was going on around me.  It would be easy to drive your station, it lasted a little longer.  Closing my eyes slightly increased my concentration on music ... <br><br><h4>  First successes </h4><br>  For half an hour I kept both sources of sound under my attention - this exhausted me more than any night of coding.  When I pulled out my headphones, I felt the cortex of my brain relaxing its folds.  I understand how it sounds, but the sensations were just that.  Since then, I regularly repeated the procedure gradually increasing the dose.  After a couple of weeks, I felt that I could hear and listen to both melodies without the former tension, I would say even more, while communicating with people, I began to hear what was happening around me.  It was at McDonalds on Chistye Prudy.  He began not only to hear scraps of harsh phrases coming from all sides, but he was able to really listen to some of the neighboring conversations while he was talking to someone. <br><br>  I continued training with other external data sources, these were sources of different types.  What I used to do, to be honest, was not very good, such as watching a TV show and reading news.  Reading and delving into the news, I tried to delve into the series.  The series is not like house, light, tbv - in my opinion they are too monotonous - it was a series with an interesting and dynamically developing plot.  Gradually, I began to succeed, so what can I say - every time it went out better and better.  It's time to move to simultaneously solve a pair of linear and then quadratic equations in the mind ... <br><br><h4>  History reference </h4><br>  Everyone knows that Guy Julius Caesar could do several things at once.  I think it is clear how he did it.  I do not know how he achieved this, but I can imagine how he felt during the session of simultaneous execution of several tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174671/</a></p>
