  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parking - to the people!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Find a piece of asphalt to leave his iron horse, in the modern metropolis - not an easy task.  And at the same time it is definitely one of the main skills in the life of any car owner.  Being late for an important meeting you either leave the car far from the place, or act at your own risk with the prospect of circling for half an hour in search of your 15 square meters. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But you are not alone in your misfortune, and the world is not without good people (this phrase could be put up as a motto for most of the projects that have become the theme for this blog).  Following the advent of special radio programs, through which we have become accustomed to finding out about traffic jams and traffic in parking lots in the city, and the dynamic development of modern communications, it was quite logical to organize an online community, through a site where its members can quickly inform each other about available seats. in parking lots. <br><br>  The already open but not yet functioning site <a href="http://spotscout.com/">SpotScout</a> is already generously endowed with press attention.  And, admittedly, his idea and its implementation are really worthy of all praise!  By registering (free pre-registration of members is already open), you get access to a constantly updated database on parking in any city, filled with both the user community and the owners of commercial parking lots and supported by the authorities.

      The base is available from almost any modern cell phone, PDA, laptop and other equipment that has a connection to the Network.  The interface is implemented on the basis of a simple static page, without the need to download and install any software. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b32/a1d/2ed/b32a1d2ed89a65fe4d085e73b07079bf.gif" width="450" height="350" alt="SpotScout Mobile Access Scheme" vspace="10"><br>  Entering the address of the destination, you will see a list of parking places close to it.  The list can be sorted by one of 9 signs (including user rating), find out the type of each parking (with or without prior reservation), the estimated time to walk from it to the place and, of course, the cost per hour. <br><br>  By choosing a parking lot you can reserve a place on it or, in the future, find out the exact time when a place will be made available on the municipal street parking in order to manage to occupy it before anyone else. <br><br>  The business model of the service promises to be very successful.  Profit is planned to receive from placing information about commercial parking, including parking in front of private houses, whose owners would like to earn extra money for them.  SpotScout will provide partners with all the necessary software, through which they will be able in real time to update the data on the workload of their parking space and set a price on it. <br><br>  The creators of the project have a <a href="http://spotscout.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where you can read about all the SpotScout news and give them suggestions and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3531/</a></p>
