  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to learn to read someone else's code</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Suppose your eyelids gradually become heavy from such an occupation, and ... You have to wake up from the need to understand someone else's code and put it in order.  In my opinion, visually scanning hieroglyphs is not as difficult as it may seem at first.  Anyway, it is necessary to be able to read someone else's code and edit, and one process does not exist without the second. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Understanding this comes during exhausting workouts.  We remember especially well when we encounter our mistakes many times due to the lack of skills to correctly read someone else's code. <br><br>  Speaking about the likelihood of errors, we note that in the old, a thousand times worked files are fewer.  Usually we encounter a lot of errors in files that have never been changed. <br><br>  Before reconstructing a code, it is sometimes easier to bring it into order that is convenient for you and then make small changes than writing styles or events first, and then changing the layout, for example.

      It is better not to leave draft options in the working files, because you will forget about something. <br><br>  When a team works on a project, it becomes necessary first to take care of understanding the concept of a future service.  You will definitely recall this advice when you notice that you have worked productively without returning to questions about how it should be.  Each specialist knows his work, and you should not be mistaken that someone has the same idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the task will be implemented and that it will coincide with yours.  Therefore, do not be afraid to consult with your colleagues in the workshop so that the consequences do not come out of your area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontrol and come as a surprise. <br><br>  If you re-search for something that took a decent amount of time again - you need to pay attention to it. <br><br>  Analyze - with what often had to re-encounter;  what kind of elements are you looking for long and why.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that you would have written a specific piece of code differently, or the logic is not completely clear.  In any case, we must act on the basis of the realization that working with the code is already your task, and not the one who wrote it first. <br><br>  Working with other people's files, we begin to understand what the person wanted, how he saw the future service.  The course of coded thoughts becomes for us more and more logical, and sometimes the most correct for the realization of a specific task. <br><br>  Many tasks are waiting for you on the Internet, and searching for them does not take as long as it seems at first. <br><br>  It's nice to take advantage of ordinary notebooks.  For example, CTRL + G (search by line number) and other convenience, which saves time. <br><br>  Working with the code is desirable to leave comments.  Over time, they will get a concise form and will be placed in the right place.  This facilitates the work not only for you, but also for other colleagues. <br>  Approximately in the middle of work on changing the code for a small download, you can view it for the contents of syntax errors. <br><br>  It is also recommended to edit files in small parts, and start with the most difficult.  If you are stuck for a long time at some point - switch to something else.  Return to the difficulty tomorrow, in the morning, so as not to spend a lot of time recovering the last thoughts. <br><br>  I have no doubt that often you have a stream of thoughts about what needs to be fixed in different parts of the code.  For this it is better to write everything down.  At the end of the day it will be a good help.  So it is easier to calculate the time required to complete the task, as well as useful for reporting. <br><br>  When you go on a break or home, see what else needs to be done.  When there is no code in front of you and a task will ‚Äúhang‚Äù in your memory, you will notice the appearance of fresh original thoughts, even if you don‚Äôt deliberately think about a solution.  Especially this technique is suitable for complex tasks.  Not to mention trifling, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143503/</a></p>
