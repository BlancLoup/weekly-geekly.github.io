The time of the stylus is over, guys!  The guys from Cupertino didn‚Äôt give up feathers for nothing ... But as time goes on, everything changes, and perception - including.  After six months, I changed my mind by almost 180 degrees. <br><br>  While everyone is trying to catch up with the iPad, Samsung decided to step a little to the side and developed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Galaxy Note, making it ten inches.  Apple abandoned the stylus once and for all, but perhaps they still have a meaning.  Especially if the screen itself remains capacitive, and the stylus is designed by Wacom!  Six months ago, at the company's booth at the MWC exhibition, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa large Note really seemed rather strange: the tablet was separate, the pen was separate ... But since then, the gadget has changed quite a bit.  And I do not exclude that this time, perhaps even through the efforts of Apple.  Samsung has done everything possible so that the Cupertins will not again sue for the allegedly copied design. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRxng6MPTRE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1L1jbmswVMmabV_Z8sJZ21bhJIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Design </h4><br>  Starting with the Galaxy Tab 2, Samsung tablets have their own recognizable look, the main feature of which is a pair of speakers at the edges of the silver front panel.  Firstly, it turned out beautifully, and secondly, it is functional, since the sound is no longer muffled by the user's palms.  I would even say more: the sound was great!  The volume reserve is very impressive, and besides, finally there is a sense in two channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/45e/7a7/fcc45e7a7ef1eadaae055b0af7381792.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Otherwise, everything is almost as before.  Bottom 30-pin connector for charging, and on top - everything else.  There is a power button, a volume control, a slot for micro-SD memory cards, a headphone jack and a SIM card slot, which remains full-size in this tablet.  In addition, here, as a phoenix, an infrared port for controlling home appliances emerged from the flame, which we saw in the Galaxy Tab 7.7 prototype, which never went into series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68e/2a6/04e/68e2a604e1579f7fcfbe652e821184bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In front of the screen there is a 1.9 megapixel camera.  With it, you can make video calls, and she also knows how to monitor the owner.  If he looks at the screen, the brightness rises to the desired level, and if not, the backlight goes out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d8/f23/db2/1d8f23db27c0d2d56f880874a8161be7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind the camera too.  Its resolution is 5 megapixels.  She makes good shots, but only with sufficient light.  And in the dark, only the LED flash saves, which hits, however, only a couple of meters, not more. <br><br><h4>  Examples of photos and videos </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d1/737/162/2d1737162e8b3b79b3eb5550fecb730b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Original Resolution Image</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ac/d29/b53/0acd29b53b1c017b0bc7e545217defdf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Original Resolution Image</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/691/4c1/ca5/6914c1ca5681f8be81e79921fd14cee9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Original Resolution Image</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdd/bc2/96f/fddbc296f84bb7089e6d4ee54f34bc99.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Original Resolution Image</a></i> <br><br>  If someone was hoping for Full-HD video, you will have to be a little upset, the camera can only shoot in 720p format.  Although the matrix seems to allow.  Maybe this will be fixed in future firmware ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCXN7YkYRQ8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgBqFzWQSEBhEgUhrNv5QokvmYhxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  The diagonal of the Galaxy Note 10.1, as you might guess, is 10 inches, and the resolution of the PLS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã1280 x 800 pixels.  This technology was developed by Samsung as a cheaper alternative to IPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a2/27f/516/1a227f516d973ca127912a41b1d246e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Its advantages include excellent color reproduction, wide viewing angles and low power consumption.  In reality, it's almost like that, but personally, I lack some brightness.  Although, perhaps, I just got used to the fact that Samsung is embedding AMOLED in its devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/c92/0f7/028c920f75f8594613139b63e28218f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Recently, Samsung has been releasing monstrously powerful devices.  And this Note was no exception.  It is based on the Exynos chipset, which includes a 1.4-GHz quad-core processor, a Mali-400 MP graphics chip, and (attention!) Two gigabytes of RAM!  All this once again allows the Samsung device to deal with all rivals in the synthetic test Quadrant Standart and AnTuTu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ad/7b2/2ec/8ad7b22ec445b42635be665a9edb41b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e0/504/83f/2e050483f5dd7cc081677384e3061311.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main memory can be 16, 32 or 64 gigabytes depending on the selected configuration.  But if anything, it can be expanded using micro-SD memory cards up to 32 gigs. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  The gadget is running Android 4.0.3.  As always, the branded Samsung shell - TouchWiz, is stretched on top of the operating system. There are a lot of branded widgets with a resizable size, and in addition, the S Note, S Planner and S Suggest applications, and Photoshop Touch.  Here, perhaps, it is again worth remembering the prototype, on which, among others, Adobe Ideas was installed - a great environment for drawing sketches.  In the final version of this software, unfortunately, no, so you have to download it for a separate money from the Google Play Store.  Or, as a cheaper alternative, I can recommend Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d4/473/a5e/2d4473a5e0d257da36124e819bb399c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everyone is used to the fact that the proprietary panel of the mason tablets comes out below.  And here, in general, too, but there is another one that floats to the side when the user pulls the pen out of the canister. <br><br><h4>  Stylus </h4><br>  The stylus was developed by Wacom, who ate the dog on classic tablets.  And this fact alludes to the fact that it‚Äôs a pleasure to make sketches on a tablet.  It is stated that the screen relative to the five-inch Note has become twice as sensitive, and the number of sensors has also doubled.  Subjectively, the resolution of the sensor for a pen does not yet reach its own Wacom devices, but this is a big step forward.  The next generation of Note, if it appears, will be no worse than the initial tablets like Bamboo Pen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/309/d40/5d1/309d405d12a22d0f5caa85b668686756.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to simply drawing, the tablet within the S Note application can do several other useful things: recognize handwritten (including Russian) text, draw geometric shapes, and even solve equations.  However, for the latter, you need to connect to the Internet, since it is not the tablet itself that solves the puzzles, but the Wolfram Alpha online service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b9/c5c/e48/9b9c5ce48c023b72d4938e1d0c550878.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04b/bb5/f71/04bbb5f71e354c413c9b22803086826f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c8/c04/c3f/4c8c04c3f88646dc8cb5ef9232a33e2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  And now about the most important!  The operating time ... The battery here is set to 7000 mAh, which allows the tablet to work under hard load from morning to evening without any problems.  Closer to the night, he will, of course, be asked to charge, but this is normal, given the gluttonous Android and advanced stuffing. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  The price for the Galaxy Note 10.1 has not yet been officially announced, but reliable sources say that it will not rise higher than the corresponding iPad 3 models in terms of memory.  I would very much like to believe this, since Samsung managed to make such a good device.  I would even say original.  It will be very unfortunate if an inadequate price tag is put on it, and the gadget will be a niche product. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Samsung Exynos 4412 Quad, 1.4 GHz <br>  <b>Video:</b> Mali-400MP <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 16-64 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 10.1 ", PLS, 1280 x 800 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 3.0, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB 2.0 (USB Host), 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> 5 megapixels, flash, autofocus + 1.9 megapixel for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 7000 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 256.7 x 175.3 x 8.9 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 583 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> Unknown </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149190/</a></p>
