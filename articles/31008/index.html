Do not make plans for a domain that is still free, thinking that you can register it at any time. <br><br>  3. If possible, do not use hyphens in the domain name.  Also, do not use numerals unnecessarily.

      4. Notice if the domain looks good in upper and lower registers? <br><br>  5. Speak loudly the domain name before registering it.  Is it perceived well by ear (for example, if you want to say the address by phone)? <br><br>  6. Watch for new terms and register domains associated with them. <br><br>  7. Do not register domains in a state of drug or alcohol intoxication.  Just tell yourself no. <br><br>  8. Do not overdo it with the length of the domain.  On average, take domains in which no more than 10 characters. <br><br>  9. Do not overdo it with the number of words in the domain.  Three still all right.  Four - bust! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  10. Please note that the domain name and its zone (s) match each other.  (For example, the football.aero domain would not be very successful) <br><br>  11. Check queries in Google and Yandex for this term.  Also see the Wordstat.Yandex.ru statistics. <br><br>  12. It is very good if PPC advertisers (Pay Per Click - Pay Per Click) bid on the words that belong to your domain name. <br><br>  13. Do not register many domains at once - think that all of them will need to be renewed. <br><br>  14. Restrain yourself.  Do not register all domains that seem good, but choose the best ones.  The sale of domains is not as easy as it may seem at first glance, even for those of us who have had any success in this.  Good domains can simply get lost in millions of other published (at auctions, forums, etc.). <br><br>  15. If your research and domainer intuition suggests that a registered domain can be sold at a price of a certain order, do not be disappointed if you do not receive offers of such an order.  Be patient. <br><br>  16. Explore different domain markets. Find the one that suits you best, be it domains in .com, ccTLD or something else - you decide. <br><br>  17. If you really want to promote a domain in a particular market, make sure that it is a top quality domain.  Otherwise, it will be difficult to find (in the listing).  Check the number of visits on your best names, select the domain with the highest number of visits and promote it. <br><br>  18. When you believe that you can recognize a top-quality domain ($ x xxx and above) and feel that you have one or more of these domains, try to place these elite domains in a premium listing on those marketplaces where you have published.  Usually it is free and can increase the attendance of your domains. <br><br>  19. Do not check whether a domain is registered or not, if you do not have the opportunity to register it immediately, upon finding a suitable one. <br><br>  20. Analyze possible acronyms.  View dictionaries. <br><br>  21. Domain hack can add value if you approach it wisely and with imagination, and also register a domain in the corresponding zone (for example: del.icio.us, click.it, domainpla.net). <br><br>  22. Use the catalog of domain resources - <a href="http://link.idnf.ru/">Link.IDNF.RU.</a>  There you will find something new for yourself. <br><br>  23. Do not fear ccTLDs (ccTLDs - Country Code Top Level Domain - national top-level domains, for example - .ru, .fr, .uk) <br><br>  24. Buy domains that are confusingly similar to TM (trademark) at your own risk and risk and be prepared to lose them at any time. <br><br>  25. Try to buy one good domain, than register 10 "not so" for the same money. <br><br>  26. Do a PPC study before registering a domain. <br><br>  27. Be prepared to vacate the domain if necessary. <br><br>  28. Do not spend more than you can afford. <br><br>  29. Do not make it your main business. <br><br>  30. If you enter into a partnership with someone - fix your agreement in writing.  Clarify clear commitments to you of all parties, even if they do not require such from you.  In extreme cases, save screenshots of all correspondence and / or all written (email) discussions. <br><br>  31. Do not regret selling more than a few seconds!  If suddenly you learn that the name was much more valuable, the buyer wanted to pay more, etc., consider your ‚Äúloss‚Äù as well-spent money for a well-learned lesson. <br><br>  32. Ask questions to those who know more than you, and respect their answers. <br><br>  33. Do not buy domains that you are not going to renew, unless they are associated with some event. <br><br>  34. Develop your own budget policy and stick to it. <br><br>  35. Keep a reserve for unexpected costs / purchases / registrations. <br><br>  36. Do not spend a lot on the type of names that you have little experience with. <br><br>  37. Use the search engine <a href="http://dnse.ru/">dnse.ru</a> (domain names search engine) - it searches the largest resources of the Runet (forums, blogs, news), dedicated to domain names and everything connected with them, as well as the websites of official organizations.  In other words, you can find the necessary quality information in the domain world much faster. <br><br>  38. Another search engine <a href="http://dncheetah.com/">dncheetah.com</a> will help you find the right information on foreign domain (English-language) resources. <br><br>  39. Do not forget to use discounts when registering or renewing, it will save you a lot of money. <br><br>  40. Check whether the names are not blacklisted (for example, <a href="http://black.idnf.ru/">black.idnf.ru</a> ). <br><br>  41. Invest in the future.  The past has already been bought. <br><br>  42. It is much easier to find a ‚Äútasty‚Äù domain in the lists of exempt names than to invent a new one yourself. <br><br>  43. If you start registering a lot of domains - create your own reseller account to reduce the price for the domain. <br><br>  44. Use search software (domains) to hunt domain names more professionally. <br><br>  45. Choose a registrar carefully.  You need a registrar with modest prices, a good reputation and free push.  Using a well-known registrar will increase the confidence of users buying domains through you.  GoDaddy is a good choice - you can save discount codes to be able to register at their best prices.  Moniker is also a good choice, with discounts for NamePros members. <br><br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãTake your time.  If you come up with 10 solid domain names, register only the best one or two. <br><br>  47. Be careful when combining words.  The result may have an ambiguous (unexpected) value.  For example: Pen Island -&gt; penisland.com -&gt; Penis Land. <br><br>  48. Domain name parking can provide additional income when your domains are ‚Äúidle‚Äù. <br><br>  49. If you have found a free name - check that its plural / singular version is also possibly free. <br><br>  50. If you have found a free name - check, perhaps the names similar in meaning to it are also free.  For example, I registered GreedyCash.com, but before that I checked GreedyMoney.com and GreedyBucks.com - both were busy. <br><br>  51. If possible, find end customers for domains, because  selling domains to resellers is not the best way to extract the maximum benefit from selling a domain. <br><br>  52. If you are interested in a domain that should be released, contact its owner and offer your amount for which you would buy it.  When the name is released, you may need to pay more as a result. <br><br>  53. Find a friend online manager you can trust and discuss the domains you are interested in before registering them.  It is always good to know the opinion of another person. <br><br>  54. Do not make a transfer / domain transfer until payment is received from the buyer! <br><br>  55. Become a user of IDNF.RU - forum of international domain names. <br><br>  56. Topics for sale with the word "premium" in the title very rarely contain really premium domains. <br><br>  57. Use special software to keep track of your domains (DNS, transfer, blocking, etc.) and for the domains that interest you. <br><br>  58. Watch for the registration of specific words, for example, those close to your TM or brand. <br><br>  59. Stay tuned for new TLD launches. <br><br>  60. Late night domain registration is not a good idea.  Waking up in the morning, you may regret buying. <br><br>  61. If you create a website - register the corresponding names in all popular zones.  It will save your money in the future, because  then, you may have to redeem each for $ 100, whereas now you can take them for regfies. <br><br>  62. The cheapest is not always the best.  Such a registrar may have paid services that others have for free. <br><br>  63. If you own a domain that violates the rights of a TM, do not offer to buy it out to the company owning the TM.  Unless you are not afraid to lose it.  This will allow the company to "complain" that you are violating its rights. <br><br>  64. Before buying a domain specifically for resale - think, would you buy this domain from someone else? <br><br>  65. Do not use the alternative spelling (love you -&gt; love u; domain -&gt; d0ma1n) of the domain - this narrows the range of its application, and also makes its reading / promotion more difficult. <br><br>  66. Use Whois Privacy (Whois Privacy is a service that allows you to hide your personal data from Whois) to hide your contact information from others, otherwise it will become publicly available. <br><br>  67. Use The WayBack Machine to find out what was on the domain before.  Due to this, you may be able to increase the price or just find out interesting information. <br><br>  68. Before registering a domain, check in which zones it is already occupied. <br><br>  69. If you are expecting the release of a domain - check its status at once with several registrars.  While one shows that the domain is busy, another can show that it is free! <br><br>  70. Other things being equal, a good domain in .com is better than any very good one in .net / .org / .info, etc. <br><br>  71. Write your letters to potential buyers in a text editor;  Use the spell checker, edit and only bulk insert into the mail program.  (If you are writing a letter in the mail program, you can accidentally click "Send" when the letter is written only half. Sadly, but I am writing from my own experience!). <br><br>  72. After registering a domain, do not try to ‚Äúmerge‚Äù it immediately for a small price.  Park your domain for a short time (at least a week or two) to look at traffic that may increase its cost. <br><br>  73. Thank the people who helped you.  (For example: someone created a topic with a list of free domains, one of which you registered or gave a meaningful assessment of your domain, opening your eyes to its possibilities - increase the reputation of this person, throw off a pair of WMZ, Yandex.Money, etc. ) <br><br>  74. Free online domain rating systems very often produce erroneous results (usually overestimated). <br><br>  75. In some cases, when a good domain is released, it may be best to contact the owner immediately before the release - because  you can be almost sure that the domain will be intercepted, and he will go to the auction, where he will have to pay more for it. <br><br>  76. If you have experience in creating concepts for logos for domains that you sell, it can help to show your vision of the domain to a potential buyer, as well as increase the chances for sale. <br><br>  77. When choosing a registrar, pay attention if you have the opportunity to refuse the domain (the domain per trial service) and return the money within a few days after registration.  Some, though not all, registrars provide this feature. <br><br>  78. If you expose your domains on eBay - try to indicate the real price. <br><br>  79. Be aware when interrupting bets on Sedo.com.  Do not overdo it. <br><br>  80. Don't just write something on IDNF.RU or NamePros.com.  First read the rules.  It will take a few minutes, at the same time will give you answers to many questions and warn you against errors. <br><br>  81. If your domains are listed on GreatDomains.com, you cannot sell them anywhere else for 6 months. <br><br>  82. If GreatDomains.com did not accept your domains - no need to express your dissatisfaction with them.  Write better about it on IDNF.RU or NamePros.com.  Perhaps users will be able to explain to you what's the matter. <br><br>  83. Be careful when purchasing IDN domains from people who have previously registered them, thinking that you are acquiring a very good and high-quality domain, especially .com <br><br>  84. If you are registering a specific domain for sale, check whois - it must contain reliable information about you and ways to contact you so that a potential buyer can make contact quickly and without problems. <br><br>  85. Check domains using DNAnalyzer.  If he shows that the domain is busy, go to bname.ru or whois.net and make sure of that.  The use of several registrars for checking domains can lead to the domain being stolen by a registrar, a business or a Kiebrskvotor. <br><br>  86. Be scrupulous and diligent in extending a domain / domains.  Do not hesitate and do not postpone from day to day.  If possible, focus your domains on one reliable (!) Registrar, then it will be easier for you to keep track of them. <br><br>  87. Avoid single-event domains.  Today's news is domain blast next year. <br><br>  88. Learn the basics of TM legislation, contract law and UDRP processes. <br><br>  89. Your domain is good for as much as the buyer will be willing to pay for it, and NOT as much, how much others will value it. <br><br>  90. Estimation is an estimated cost based on experience, often objective guesses, but NOT the final price. <br><br>  91. Do not keep all your portfolio, hoping to sell each domain for high $ xxx xxx, spending a lot of money on renewal each year.  Instead, leave a few really standing, selling the rest cheaper.  Update your product. <br><br>  92. When you sell 10 domains for $ 50 each, instead of buying 50 mediocre names with the money, think about buying one, but a good dotcom for the same $ 500. <br><br>  93. When planning your budget, consider paying for: registration, renewal, brokerage, software, transfer, private whois, etc.  Otherwise, you risk an excess of expenses over income in the overall standings, even if there are sales. <br><br>  94. Take domain parking seriously.  Parked domains need only be configured once and you can forget about them.  But many simply do not customize ... <br><br>  95. Park your worst 20% of your domains.  Some may bring more in other parking lots - just give them time. <br><br>  96. Publish your domains everywhere. <br><br>  97. Create a good website for your portfolio. <br><br>  98. Make your brand name - release a t-shirt or something. <br><br>  99. If you have .com, - do not think that the owners of equivalent .co.uk, .de, .fr, and others will absolutely pay you a lot of $ for it. <br><br>  100. Remember that the end user / business owner does not necessarily think the same as the domain manager. <br><br>  101. Invest in .info!  It will become popular in the near future!  (Hmm-mmmmm) <br><br>  102. Domain conferences are an excellent place to more thoroughly study the domain industry and networks from within with other domain owners and businessmen.  DomainFest: <a href="">www.domainfest.com;</a>  Forum of International Domain Names - IDNF.RU;  Domain Roundtable: <a href="http://www.domainroundtable.com/">www.domainroundtable.com</a> TRAFFIC: <a href="http://www.targetedtraffic.com/">www.targetedtraffic.com</a> . <br><br>  103. Check the readability of domains (for example, coollinks are not as easy to read as coolsites).  Also pay attention to the end of the first word was not perceived as the beginning of the second - for example gamershell (gamers hell? Gamer shell?). <br><br>  104. Stay away from domains with a negative connotation or meaning.  For example: SlowPay, DownHost, etc. <br><br>  105. If the noun is busy (fish), check the plural (fishes), or other forms of the word: fished, fishing, fisher, fishy, ‚Äã‚Äãetc. <br><br>  106. For beginners: there is an erroneous opinion, as if you need to register domains with your hosting provider.  It is recommended to ‚Äúkeep‚Äù domains and hosting separately. <br><br>  107. Use dictionaries to find out the meaning / meanings of words. <br><br>  108. The free idnf_ru_4in1 program will help you: generate 1/2/3/4-character domains in any zones;  implement mass coding of IDN domains in Punycode and back;  add to the list of words any number of any zones;  remove from the list of domains zone to create a list of words.  At any time the program can be downloaded here: <a href="">soft.idnf.ru/idnf_ru_4in1.exe</a> <br><br>  109. Beware of alternative spellings UK / US (eg ise vs. ize) <br><br>  110. If you count search statistics for a wordy domain, a search for a specific phrase will yield more realistic results. <br><br>  111. And the last.  Develop spiritually!  Look at the picture ‚Äúdot‚Äù - Picture For All Domainers, relax, think a little about what you do.  How to look at everything from a bird's eye view ... <br>  ... joke ;-) <br>  (or not? - <a href="http://dot.idnf.ru/">dot.idnf.ru</a> ) <br><br>  English source: <a href="http://knd.ru/">knd.ru</a> - Domain Sales Reports <br>  Translation and additions: <a href="http://idnf.ru/">IDNF.RU</a> |  Forum International Domain Names </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31008/</a></p>
