The title is already covered with a hint that a surprise awaits guests of the presentation - the flagship smartphone of the new generation Samsung GALAXY S5, of course.  On the eve of the official announcement on the network there were a lot of rumors about the appearance, stuffing and possibilities of new items.  Whether expectations and forecasts were justified or not - learn under a cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a35/c76/f80/a35c76f80882add5c52ec5a12282d4cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN</font> </h2><br>  The ‚Äúface‚Äù of the GALAXY S5 remained virtually identical to its predecessor, except that its corners are more rounded than that of the S4.  The pattern for perforated leather on the back panel is a key feature of the look of the new flagship.  The smartphone will be available in several colors, including black, white, blue and gold.

    <h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SCREEN</font> </h2><br>  The new smartphone has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  There were rumors around the network that the display of the flagship would receive a resolution as much as 2560x1440.  In the fact that this did not happen, understanding people will not see anything critical, since a further increase in pixel density on a 5-inch screen seems to be a rather meaningless idea, because Full HD resolution for a smartphone is more than enough. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/f38/904/0d4f38904c6e06a8dbd9438339ab698a.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/0d3/4d3/fba0d34d324a795323b2c2e550867eb6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The GALAXY S5 screen is adaptive, and, thanks to the use of Local Contrast Algorithm technology, Super Dimming and Adaptive Display is able to adapt to ambient light conditions, changing the brightness when necessary.  Yes, of course, these are not such revolutionary features - many competitive smartphones can do this, too, but the GALAXY S5 can change the brightness in the range from 2 to 500 cd / m2.  The direct rays of the sun will no longer be such an annoying problem for the readability of information on the screen, and even in the dark the screen will not be blinded by bright light. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  Improved 16-megapixel camera Samsung GALAXY S5 boasts enhanced functionality, improved menu and user-friendly interface.  The new smartphone has the highest AF speed in the world (just 0.3 seconds) and a wide range of High Dynamic Range (HDR) brightness.  New selective focus feature allows you to select a certain part of the image, leaving the background blurred.  Thanks to the capabilities of the GALAXY S5, to create a shallow depth of field (DOF) effect, you no longer need to use special lenses and lenses.  The camera also supports shooting video in 4K format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a1/ee7/fcb/3a1ee7fcb53c37b1cae922e1ac6e12da.jpg" alt="image"><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">MAIN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  Samsung GALAXY S5 is equipped with a 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with a clock frequency of 2.5 GHz.  The processor was announced literally the other day and provides an increase in performance of 14% and a graphics performance increase of 28% compared to the Snapdragon 800. Qualcomm also claims a 45% increase in the speed of processing data from the camera.  Another version of the GALAXY S5 with an 8-core Exynos processor with a clock frequency of 2.1 GHz on board will also be on sale.  The RAM of the new flagship is 2 GB, the built-in flash memory varies between 16 and 32 GB and is expanded with memory cards up to 128 GB. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS</font> </h2><br>  Samsung GALAXY S5 supports the latest LTE and Wi-Fi network protocols.  The smartphone works in the fifth generation of Wi-Fi 802.11ac networks with 2x2 MIMO support ‚Äî in this mode, data can be received and transmitted in two streams, that is, up to two times faster than in the first generation of devices compatible with 802.11ac.  In addition, GALAXY S5 provides support for a large number of 4G LTE frequencies and speeds conforming to the LTE Category 4 standard - up to 150 Mbps.  For users who care about the fastest possible access to the Internet, Samsung has developed a new technology, ‚ÄúDownload Booster‚Äù, which increases the speed of data transfer due to the parallel operation of Wi-Fi and LTE. <br><br>  The flagship has an IP67 protection standard - against dust, moisture, splashes and even full immersion in water to a depth of 1 meter and a duration of up to 30 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e96/514/59c/e9651459c91887af4f1ba9377db2bac5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, the smartphone is equipped with a biometric fingerprint scanner (it is built into the Home key) to protect the device and make mobile payments: unlike a password or a usual unlock pattern, a fingerprint cannot be overlooked or picked up manually.  Samsung has secured affiliate support for PayPal, so that owners of GALAXY S5 will be able to make purchases online, paying with a fingerprint. <br><br>  It is extremely curious that the Ultra Power Saving Mode is a special economical battery mode, which disables all additional functions and puts the screen into monochrome.  Similar to unpretentious AMOLED screens, in this mode the GALAXY S5 screen consumes significantly less energy, which allows the smartphone to work until late in the evening, even if the battery remains only 10% - an indispensable feature in situations when you find out that forgot to charge your smartphone, but can not afford to miss important calls.  However, even in normal mode, the time spent on one charge increased by 20% compared with previous generations of the smartphone, thanks to the battery capacity of 2800 mAh.  Batteries should be enough for 10 hours of web surfing (with the most "voracious" LTE-connection) and 12 hours of video playback.  By the way, you can charge your smartphone without wires - for this you need a separate charger S-Pad. <br><br>  Another useful feature was the so-called ‚ÄúChild‚Äù mode.  It allows you to give the device to the playful little hands of children without fear of being left without important data and applications, or to detect a bunch of toys for a lump sum.  In this mode, children will be able to use only those applications and functions that their parents have previously approved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa3/245/ad7/fa3245ad77e1d5a66ff34be0c7579272.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a0/6d1/084/3a06d10841a22e35388d5e2db09be3df.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a2/edd/18e/3a2edd18e808f2e8ab3bb3e30f6eb4f0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/fe5/ab0/cabfe5ab048853fe21a0622b2d9c0c94.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">HEALTH CARE</font> </h2><br>  The functionality of GALAXY S5 in the field of fitness and health care has also undergone a number of improvements.  Using S Health 3.0, the user gets access to a personal fitness tracker with a wide choice of functions: pedometer, diet planner, exercise recording and a built-in heart rate sensor, unique for smartphones, which is located on the back panel of the GALAXY S5, right under the camera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f4/267/09a/4f426709a58de86193fcdd15e8b5e10e.jpg"><br>  As an additional accessory to the new flagship, Samsung released Gear Fit, the industry's first wearable device with a curved Super AMOLED screen.  The novelty will be pleased with a large selection of fitness applications that will help keep you fit and fit.  Regardless of whether Samsung Gear Fit is connected to a mobile device or works independently, the owner of the new product will not miss a single important moment in life and will always stay connected. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22a/420/140/22a42014099d8c2b579070d5351b2c17.jpg"><br>  Curved Super AMOLED screen repeats the shape of the wrist, providing complete freedom of movement.  The novelty notifies about incoming messages, calls, emails and reminders from the calendar.  There are three colors of the strap: black, gray and orange.  Samsung Gear Fit also features IP67 dust and moisture protection. <br><br>  The Samsung GALAXY S5 will go on sale worldwide, including Russia, on April 11, 2014.  Prices for a novelty, as well as for accessories to it, remain unknown. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0558BE">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS SAMSUNG GALAXY S5</font> </h2><br>  <b>Cellular communication:</b> 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE cat. 4, up to 150/50 Mbit / s) <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 5.1-inch FHD Super AMOLED (1920 x 1080) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor, 2.5 GHz / 8-core Exynos processor, 2.1 GHz <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 16 megapixel (main), 2.0 megapixel (front);  Video: UHD 30 frames / s, HDR, video stabilization <br>  <b>Interfaces:</b> WiFi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac HT80, MIMO (2x2);  Bluetooth 4.0 BLE / ANT +;  USB 3.0;  NFC;  IR transmitter (remote control) <br>  <b>Sensors:</b> accelerometer, gyroscope, distance sensor, compass, barometer, magnetic field sensor, light, gestures (infrared), fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 2 GB RAM;  internal memory: 16/32 GB;  microSD up to 128 GB <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight:</b> 142.0 x 72.5 x 8.1 mm;  145 g <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2800 mAh;  standby time: 390 h / talk time: 21 h </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213905/</a></p>
