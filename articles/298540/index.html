Not so important that.  Could you believe that you have a chance to help people ‚Äî including adults ‚Äî learn to read?  Or, that the skill demanded in all corners of the world, is <a href="http://blog.testutor.com/10-preimushhestv-on-lajn-prepodavaniya-inostrannyx-yazykov/">teaching English</a> ?

      To send emails you need some knowledge.  And people have a huge need to learn basic programs, for example, Excel and Word.  People also need support in performing such elementary tasks as a set of letters, sending emails, posting updates in social media, etc. <br><br>  You have the skills to help others.  By giving in what you have ‚Äî time ‚Äî you can better understand what kind of activity pleases and inspires you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Write about it in a blog.</font> </h2><br>  Are you interested in a specific topic, career or new business?  One of the effective ways to get acquainted with new areas of activity and areas of knowledge is to keep a blog about them. <br><br>  Blogging is a great tool for sharing, teaching, learning new things and exploring your own passion.  Starting a blog is not so difficult, and by doing this, you will get a simple internet outlet for stories, communication and activities devoted to hobby. <br><br>  If you like cooking, invent your own recipes and share them with friends and family on your blog.  If you are interested in moving up the career ladder, write about what matters in your industry. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Read books that are on the shelf.</font> </h2><br>  Books are often undervalued, but they can be called terrific coaches, teachers, mentors and advisers. <br><br>  Different people have left invaluable recommendations, wisdom and a guide to action in their books.  The works, filled with important practical advice, were created by the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/8-shagov-k-uspekhu-ot-samykh-uspeshnykh-lyudey/">most inspiring and successful personalities</a> . <br><br>  You will not be able to meet at lunch with Ekhat Tolle, Seth Godin, Donald Trump or the women from SharkTank and get advice from them, but you are fully capable of buying or borrowing their books in the library to join their knowledge, recommendations and strategies. <br><br>  These people of their own accord and with pleasure are ready to give you 2 hours of their time for less than 15 dollars! <br>  Not ready to go and buy another book?  Take the works already on your shelf and read them.  Take a few notes in the process and apply them in your own life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Find what energizes</font> </h2><br>  Everywhere - at home or at work - there are things that you do simply because you like it.  They delight you, excite, entertain.  What do you enjoy? <br><br>  No, in the office you will not be able to swim with the mask, but are you able to embed your favorite things in your daily work? <br>  Or can you constantly remember which of these responsibilities bring real joy?  You may hate sales organization meetings, but enjoy holding workshops.  You have the right to despise the provision of reports, while adoring the creation of expert reports. <br><br>  Think about what you like and dislike about your work.  Find the tasks that please you, and more actively dive into them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Leave the house.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">And leave your hometown</font> </h2><br>  Go and do what you want.  This need not necessarily have anything to do with your career or goals.  Go and take a look at something new.  Attend a lecture, go to a museum, go to a bookstore.  Do what suits you and - ideally - does not require payment.  It will inspire you. <br><br>  If you have never left your hometown, buy a ticket somewhere.  No, you should not act like Chris Gilbo (and visit 193 countries), but why not consider a trip to your grandparents? <br><br>  Go to a city where you have never been before, or take a trip to the country you wanted to go to all your life. <br>  In the new setting, you can easily meet a soul mate, find a dream job or understand the purpose of life. <br>  In extreme cases, you will see something unusual and expand your own horizons. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Speak not only with the cat</font> </h2><br>  Your pet can be a great companion and a great companion to watch "Bachelors."  We do not doubt it!  But he has no chance to contribute to your personal growth. <br><br>  If you are interested in a new industry or industry, try to discuss it with someone.  Take advantage of their knowledge, point of view and advice.  If <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-prostykh-deystviy-dlya-povysheniya-effektivnosti-obshcheniya/">you ask the right questions</a> , people will be happy to tell how they got their way or walked along the path of life. <br><br>  Instead of embarking on building a new career or launching another blog called ‚ÄúBlow up the brain‚Äù, discuss the profitability of your idea with someone. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Go to a meeting with like-minded people.</font> </h2><br>  If you have a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest, a desire to move onto a new road or a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kakie-professionalnye-navyki-stanut-znachimymi-v-blizhayshie-gody/">need for another job</a> , then start communicating with people doing what you are looking for. <br><br>  The easiest way to meet with representatives of the industry that interests you is to attend specialized events.  People belonging to any industry or sphere have groups created to communicate and discuss professional issues. <br><br>  There are writers.  Bloggers hold meetings.  Freelancers communicate with each other (even if they do it online).  There are restaurateurs.  Hey, even morgue owners and insurance specialists have their own conventions!  Call a friend and go to one of these events to meet new people and learn something about the industry. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Work for a penny.</font> </h2><br>  Yes, sometimes you need to have at least some work experience to study the industry and get a new position. <br>  There is no better way to get it than to work for free.  Volunteering and internship at any age will help to explore the situation in the new sphere. <br><br>  And you will not work for a penny actually.  In exchange for your services, you will receive experience that enhances the value of your resume, industry connections and, if you play the cards correctly, good recommendations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Go to courses and workshops</font> </h2><br>  Before you spend a 6-digit amount to get a master's degree that you may never need, or becoming a dentist, think about your interests. <br><br>  If you are passionate about the new sphere or subject, start with courses where classes are held on weekends, or master classes.  They are much cheaper, require less time and have a low load.  Use them to check if you're really interested? <br><br>  If you are confused and confused, use one of the methods described above and check your interest in the new. <br><br>  Start with small things and take a few steps every day, trying different things to understand how they carry you. <br>  Little effort and experimentation will become a kind of impetus and help you find your goal. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-sozdat-kontseptsiyu-razvitiya-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">How to create a concept for the development of your own life</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298540/</a></p>
