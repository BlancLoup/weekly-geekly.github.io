  <section class="page js-page"><h1>97% of people do not achieve their goals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Skill planning is one of the key to achieve the objectives.  At the same time, the overwhelming number of people do not do this.  According to statistics, in our modern world less than 3% of people achieve more than the other 97% combined. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And this seems to be true.  For about, you can take the Forbes list and calculate that approximately, about the same, about 3% of people own almost all the financial benefits of the world.  Of course, this is an indicator of success, but only a reflection on one of our areas - financial.  But many of them are very harmonious personalities and have achieved success not only financially, but also in all other industries.  Many of them devote a lot of time to their spiritual and physical development.  So these numbers are similar to the truth. <br><br>  And it is well demonstrated visual experiment.  In 1953, an experiment was conducted at Harvard University.  All graduates were asked whether they had a purpose in life and whether they pursued it.  It turned out that just less than 3% of all respondents have a clear goal and a plan for achieving it.  The rest could not clearly articulate what they want from this life.  Over the next 25 years, monitoring the success of these graduates showed that these 3% were able to achieve much more than everyone else. <br>  As we understand, goal setting is a very useful tool for achieving success. <br>  But as a rule, at this step, a number of difficulties arise and many of them are cut off. <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <br><ul><li>  Just forget to plan. </li><li>  They do not use any planning tools, even the simplest ones - they keep everything in their head, as a result, everything gets into a mess. </li><li>  They set impossible tasks and do not even start to fulfill them. "I want to buy a villa and will live as well."  - says the man lying on the couch, seeing a beautiful picture on TV. </li><li>  Constantly set aside everything for later.  Well, I'll do it tomorrow, today I'm tired. </li><li>  Do not prioritize.  Want to learn a language, for example, but all hands do not reach the start, familiar? </li></ul>

      From here follows a number of rules: <br><br><h5>  <b>Set a goal.</b> </h5><br>  I often meet people who want to engage in one thing in life, but for one reason or another, they are engaged in something completely different, and all because they either have no goal.  Here it is important to catch the difference, they all have a dream!  And there is no goal.  For example, they dream of a villa, but they have no purpose to buy this villa. <br>  How to set a goal I described in a previous article.  What is important now is to understand the difference between a dream and a goal.  The goal implies the intention to achieve it and for this you need a path!  The path, in turn, is one of the many small steps - the tasks that need to be solved on the way to the goal.  We solve these tasks every day; if we perform them every day, every day we are one step closer to our goal. <br><br><h5>  <b>Learn to prioritize.</b> </h5><br>  There is a priority square out of which all cases are divided into Urgent / Non-Urgent, Important / Non-Important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/682/310/b88/682310b887a5a2d79e40af4a2d472f03.png" alt="image"><br>  (Fig. 1 table of case survival. Priority order: 1-&gt; 2-&gt; 3-&gt; 4) <br><br>  So first you need to understand to which quadrant your current tasks and goals belong.  Once your goals prioritize how important they are to you.  Tasks related to this goal will have a corresponding priority priority.  You should make your schedule giving preference to important matters.  The sequence is as follows: <br><br>  <b>Important urgent -&gt; Important not urgent -&gt; Urgent not important -&gt; Not urgent not important.</b> <br><br>  And the last two points should be sought to get rid of, or even throw these tasks out of their schedule, or reassign them to someone.  A good example is household chores, why wash yourself when you can take things to the dry-cleaner and focus yourself on your goals.  Appreciate your time and effort! <br><br>  For example, your goal is to learn a foreign language: you set for this goal and the tasks associated with them High priority.  In your calendar today is the task - "Make the 2nd lesson from the textbook, from 17.00 to 18.00."  For you, this is an important, but not urgent task.  The coveted hour has come well, you sat down at the textbook and then it started ... a phone call rang out, the best friend rang, she was bored.  You can not not answer the phone, how so.  Here friends start to write in Contact: "How are you doing, what are you doing?" It‚Äôs necessary to answer, but that‚Äôs not good.  And then the neighbor comes and forgive me just for a minute to help him, hold the shelf.  Well, how not to help a neighbor!  Was it something like that? <br>  As a result, you are pulled apart into ‚Äúurgent and important‚Äù matters that are not really urgent or important!  And the fact that it is really important for you that time does not remain.  Of course this example is greatly exaggerated for clarity.  But in life everything happens like this, because of the inability to prioritize, we very often devote our time to things that are not important or urgent, but to what is really important due attention and not paid. <br><br>  And all this happens because a person does not see his goal, and if he does, he doesn‚Äôt give it enough attention!  Therefore, it distributes its attention, energy and strength to what is important not for him, but what is important for others, and they impose this importance on you, and you accept it.  Here the level of awareness of a person plays an important role.  What is this I will tell another time.  Here I will just note, the higher your level of awareness, the easier and more enjoyable it is to go through life. <br><br><h5>  <b>Learn to set tasks and plan your time.</b> </h5><br>  At this stage, we come to the fact that we need to learn how to set ourselves small workable tasks and do carry out them.  Details on how to set yourself the tasks will tell another time.  Now I would like to focus your attention on the tool for tracking these tasks.  Be sure to get yourself an "assistant" it could be: <br><br><ul><li>  Notebook </li><li>  Diary </li><li>  Notebook </li><li>  Organizer </li><li>  Some kind of program </li></ul><br><br>  The most important thing is to make it comfortable and convenient for you to use it, namely to perform two key actions: ‚Äúput‚Äù tasks there and ‚Äútrack‚Äù their implementation.  It is likely that the search for such a convenient tool will take you some time and will have to spend time and energy, but in the end it will pay off. <br>  I've tried a lot of things and eventually settled on Google Calendar, it is synchronized with the phone, it can be accessed from any gadget.  And the most pleasant thing he sends reminders about the upcoming event.  And one more bonus, there you can separate cases and tasks. <br>  But you can choose what is convenient for you. <br><br>  And so summarize: How to set yourself the right tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  Choose a goal </li><li>  Prioritize this goal. </li><li>  Break goals into tasks </li><li>  Every day, monitor the progress of their tasks, according to their priority. </li></ul><br><br>  Following these simple principles will make your path to the goal shorter and more joyful. <br><br>  I will be glad to your comments, comments, suggestions. <br><br>  Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts, I hope they were useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296170/</a></p>
