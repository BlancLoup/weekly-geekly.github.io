But, as a rule, such people do not pay attention to others and simply use what is convenient. <br>  If you think so, then headsets have a lot of advantages - with small size and weight, they allow you to be in touch when it is problematic to use a regular phone.  For example, when both hands are busy - driving, with a bunch of bags, on the run, on an exam or somewhere else.  Well, in general, they allow you not to be distracted and not to make unnecessary gestures ... and so much more can be invented.  In general, I decided to try to join the slim ranks on the example of the new <b>Jabra GO 6430</b> .

    <h2>  In boxing </h2><br>  In the box, the dimensions of which are commensurate with the box from the mobile phone, were: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c07/9f4/93b/c079f493b41433c615559a8f5c16b8e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Headset <b>Jabra GO 6430</b> ; <br>  - USB receiver <b>Jabra LINK 350</b> ; <br>  - Arcuate ear hook; <br>  - Small cradle for transportation; <br>  - USB-microUSB wire + charging from the network; <br>  - Two additional nozzles, ambyushury; <br>  - Paper + CD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02d/b3d/898/02db3d898f651b0e76ff7e9efe193964.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among the papers there was a quick start guide - in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand with pictures.  On the disk software, about it later.  Wire and charging the most common, "ends" connector microUSB - well, so be it.  ‚ÄúGags‚Äù - rubber, of different shapes (you can only insert it into the headset) - I like this customization. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  A symmetrical ‚Äúplastic piece of plastic‚Äù - finally there is no gloss. It has a low weight (only 18 grams), but at the same time inspires confidence from the first seconds - the crumb is collected very carefully.  Black matte body, the outer side of which is covered with a plastic surface with the texture of finely ground metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0b/533/3b8/c0b5333b83aa2325f570846d3418daf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Already on top of all this is a fine microphone mesh, a touch stripe (to control the volume of the sound) and a multi-function button on the far end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc4/c2f/763/cc4c2f7633d7501541c393fb428742d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d75/889/ced/d75889ced39173250415acd19eb992c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the inside, there is a status LED, a replaceable earmold, a hole for earmuffs and 4 contacts for charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/275/f54/18c/275f5418cf1ce0bb258c24af89080713.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are no large inscriptions or simply flashy decorative things - all grown-up. <br><br>  The earhook (hook-hook), included in the kit, is made of flexible plastic - thanks to which it can be put on even on the largest ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/456/4c3/e98/4564c3e98a54a9448c3fefb1b22e8ef6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And so that it was not painful and held better, on the inside of the handle there is a special form of gum.  Inserting the headset into the headset in two ways, so you can wear the device both on the left and on the right ear. <br><br>  The Bluetooth receiver is inserted into the USB port on the computer and allows you to connect the headset to a computer or laptop - to talk on any soft phone calls such as Skype, listening to music, flashing, or something else.  Above is the connect button.  Dimensions are the same as a regular flash drive, inside - a green LED. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/baa/698/cf3/baa698cf34a298c114a6046a8c08fc76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for listening to music, by the way - the headset supports 2 audio bands - narrowband (300Hz - 3400Hz) and wideband (150Hz - 6800Hz).  This, of course, is far from sound quality even from the most simple Bluetooth headphones, but the sound is more than good - with urgent need you can easily listen (yes, with one ear) to music. <br><br>  The cradle at the bottom has a groove in which the Bluetooth receiver described above is hiding.  And on top - a platform with contacts for landing the headset itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/3e0/551/e103e0551545eb8353ec1278a250e01d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ce/7b9/e2c/9ce7b9e2cfe523ba615c7e99beade89d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the side there is a microUSB connector through which charging takes place (from a computer or in a car).  In a fully assembled state, everything is securely held and takes up minimal space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/408/dda/d03/408ddad032363d75d3ac141445d7b01b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Use it </h2><br>  The button on the back is really multifunctional - 12 functions are already assigned to it!  During the reading of the manual, in order to remember, I had to write out all the combinations on a sheet of paper ... and only then I saw the pivot table :) So, there are 4 ways to influence the button - tap (up to 0.8s), double-tap (with an interval no longer 0.5s), short press (1-3s) and long (3-5s).  Depending on the pressure and the moment at which it occurs, the following consequences are possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5e/2a9/81d/a5e2a981d6e252ed0408cf747320324b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, some of these functions work only if they are supported by the device itself.  For example, in my HD2 there is no voice dialing initially, so a single press of the button on the headset does not cause anything.  I had to conjure ... in the end, "on crutches" and along a <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D130187%26st%3D1100%26p%3D3699923%26">workaround,</a> I came to the cherished goal - voice dialing through <b>Cyberon Voice</b> software fully earned - with reference to the headset button and with recognition of Russian speech.  But, you see, speaking about the headset itself - is more than enough for one button of functions? <br><br>  Additionally, there are two more tables in the manual, but there is no point in placing them in the article.  This is the decoding of the headset's sound tones in response to actions (19 variants with the ability to listen) and a diode light indication (10 variants).  Well, a small touch strip on the outside of the headset - with the movement of your finger, you can adjust the volume ‚Äúin the ear‚Äù, and double-tap to turn off the sound - very convenient.  In general, it would seem a little trinket, and so much inside! <br><br>  It should be noted in a separate paragraph instructions in Russian, which is available only in electronic form - this is a good example to follow.  In addition to a detailed description of all the capabilities of the device, there are many pleasant little things - a list of all accessories with their articles, a table of LED indication and functionality of a single button (with the ability to play a sound signal that sounds with every action!) And a lot more. <br><br>  As everything was set up and ready, the headset was firmly fixed on my ear.  The landing is quite comfortable and reliable - you can safely turn your head or, for example, jump (it was with a standard nozzle, the other two did not suit me).  After pressing the button and the phrase "dial brother", the dialing process starts on the phone screen.  A second press immediately resets the call.  Press the button twice quickly - the set is repeated.  The first call and talk about something ordinary;  closer to completion, the question ‚Äú <i>How can I hear, by the way, is it normal?</i>  ‚ÄùA positive answer was given - so I think there‚Äôs really no problem with the quality of communication.  I was just as well heard bro, and the artifacts of sound was not in the car with the music, or in a noisy MEGA.  I do not know, maybe it is the merit of some kind of noise reduction technology in the microphone or something else, but for the sound - a solid five.  Moreover, unlike many wired telephone headsets, you do not need to keep the microphone at the mouth all the time - in fact, it keeps itself. <br><br>  A little later, I tried to cross the headset with Skype.  I inserted the ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù into the free USB port, set up the software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6d/a39/179/b6da39179e8c2cb9b4324541422f4dac.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/874/692/d83/874692d8390c9cd724298d8be7118c24.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0c/d32/e7e/c0cd32e7e719b8c6d183610f2ef3cf3d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In order not to torture people for nothing, I first talked to <b>echo123</b> - it all worked the first time.  Then I chatted with real people - the same thing as on the phone, only without voice dialing.  In video conferencing, you can not reach for the microphone of the camera and not put on wired ears, in normal conversations you can safely roam around the room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27b/6d4/e47/27b6d4e47ec75ae94b5bb269a2402f35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I used to use a separate hardware skypephone (there was no review and, perhaps, due to the rarity of the device, it won't be), but now the headset replaces it to some extent (though it doesn‚Äôt have a screen with contacts).  I think that there will be no difficulties with other dialers either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/294/472/5cc/2944725cc0ac450d885717bae7d6c9da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The range of action is very different.  For devices with Bluetooth, they promise about 25 meters, and in the mode of working with a softphone (via usb-receiver) as much as 100. But I tried to turn on the music in the player (so that it went to the headset) - the sound was already gone when I got up three floors up.  The point, apparently, is in concrete floors, and 100m is for a clean field in clear weather?  :) Otherwise, there were no problems with the quality of signal reception. <br><br>  In talk mode, the device keeps well done for no more than 6 hours.  In the standby mode - longer, but I will not say for sure (since I connected it a couple of times to the cradle, for pampering).  Charging - via USB-port in about an hour, from the outlet even faster. <br><br><h2>  CD </h2><br>  The disk contains all sorts of documentation - instructions, information on accessories, etc.  In addition to these PDFs, which no one has ever watched, there is a useful <b>Jabra PC Suite</b> program.  By the way, you can use the headset without a program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57e/f89/048/57ef89048dfabbb466b7015dc0d9f036.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A couple of clicks and several new icons appear on the desktop - we need the <b>Jabra Control Center</b> .  The program is a device manager, where it almost immediately finds a connected receiver from the headset (it is inserted into the USB port of the computer).  It is a pity that there is no Russian language - some moments in it are not obvious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d62/826/b6a/d62826b6a9ed34a693937dfbd43239dc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Two modes of settings - simple and difficult) In the second, much more than any options, so leave it.  All settings are divided into several tabs. <br><br>  <b>Headset</b> - here you can see the status of connecting the headset (to the computer and to the phone) and buttons for connecting and disconnecting the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f05/e91/794/f05e91794015d57f72aeaf4f2df0eef9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Audio</b> - here are the tone settings.  It can be high, normal or low.  In addition - several presets technology <b>IntelliTone</b> , which protects the ear from sudden loud sounds and other disasters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25a/940/8fa/25a9408fa9493728417198d220fcefe8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Softphone</b> .  Actually, for the sake of this, the receiver was inserted into the computer - for conversations via soft dialers such as Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa5/ed2/573/fa5ed2573e854ca8fbe7110edab41795.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Additionally, you can adjust the frequency range for each application separately.  From the program menu, you can update both the softphone itself and the firmware for the headset - everything is just as simple and in a couple of clicks.  First, the availability of a new firmware version is checked, then it is downloaded and then installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf5/fd5/dab/cf5fd5dabe868225479695dd3f18c3ba.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d8/5d9/420/3d85d9420090c718c7244b8a0cd27e51.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e9/8bb/12d/7e98bb12d3399a2c717ddc85bd2b8e5f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good equipment; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Low headset weight <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Excellent build and quality materials;  cheers, no gloss; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The ability to adjust the attachment to the ear;  2 additional tips; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Works with the phone and with dialers on a laptop / computer; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Touch control and sound / light feedback; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The mighty button on the back is all in the manual; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Ease of operation and superb sound quality; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Functional driver; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Still, charging the car in the kit would not be superfluous; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The microphone mesh is very small and easily clogged with dust; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The headset itself is quite large (relatively, of course). <br><br>  About the microUSB keep quiet - with a fragile standard, it remains only to accept.  In general, this is a really useful thing :) It allows you not to be distracted by unnecessary movements - at least behind the wheel is a big plus. <br><br>  The price will be about $ 150 per set, which is quite competitive, although more expensive than many other devices. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that, along with the GO 6430 model, another professional model <b>GO 6470</b> was released, which is ‚Äúwell, yours!‚Äù.  In appearance, it is the same as the 6430, but additionally it comes with a damn stylish base-base with a touchscreen display that seems to perform half of the functionality of the Jabra Control Center + program, which allows you to do something else ( <a href="http://campaigns.jabra.com/Sites/NA/GO/index.html">interactive demo</a> ).  Well, in addition - in addition to a mobile phone and softphone, it is possible to chat on the landline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5a/3f7/1d6/a5a3f71d671f02e3fcdcf12d53f7d13a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Almost all the wired headsets that I came across in the device, I left in the box - some of them boring, as if for a tick.  Whether business when functions of calls and all-all-all is delegated to the separate device.  And although I have practically nothing to compare with (in quality and capabilities), this does not prevent me from drawing a conclusion about the tested headset.  Given that absolutely all the tasks that are assigned to her, she solves in the best possible way, we can assume that the model has taken place.  Add here all the above advantages (yes, the same software and workmanship) and it is already becoming clear why they are asking for money. <br>  The device works perfectly and allows you to not be distracted, for example, from the road - perhaps this will save you more than once from a fine.  On the other hand, it is possible to consider the device as one of the attributes of a lifestyle - in the thoughts involuntarily drawn clipart images of business men and aunts.  But in any case, before buying, you should decide for yourself exactly whether it is really needed or not. <br>  Earlier, I heard earlier that the Jabra company is one of the best in its industry - I was convinced of this by the example of just one model, but something tells me that in other devices the situation is no worse. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85725/</a></p>
