  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Adequacy mentality: there is enough for everyone in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Have you ever rejoiced at the defeats of other people?</b> <br><br>  I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I‚Äôm sure that many people have come across this feeling, especially at a young age.  I think many will agree that the thought ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right for him‚Äù appeared in their heads at least once in relation to another person who failed.  It is not so important who it is: a competitor or just the hero of the next publication on the pages of the news portal.  The fact is that the thought ‚ÄúIt is right for him‚Äù, which is actually interpreted as ‚ÄúI am glad that he failed,‚Äù is familiar to many people, especially in developing countries. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When you treat the defeat of a stranger or your competitor so much, gloating is rather normal, although it would have been better not to pay any attention to the incident.  However, some people go to extremes - they are not able to enjoy the success of their friends and relatives, they do not know how to empathize and sincerely thank others for their help.  Such people constantly compare themselves with others, strive to gain imaginary success in society, expressed only by the presence of material values: an expensive car, an apartment, and a ‚Äú10-pound gold chain around the neck.‚Äù

      Even if such a person smiles at you and congratulates you on your victory, internally he will envy and resent because of your achievements.  The reason for this behavior is that these individuals consider the amount of resources and opportunities limited, and if someone else has won, it means only one thing - they have lost. <br><br>  <b>Stephen Covey calls this type of thinking the ‚ÄúFailure Mentality‚Äù.</b>  It is based on the idea that victory can only be personal.  People with a failure mentality live with the sincere hope that others will fail, they constantly compare themselves with others and arrange fictional competitions, trying to get ahead of anyone. <br><br>  Fortunately, in the modern world for such people there is less and less space in teams and communities.  After all, such a negative attitude towards colleagues is clearly not conducive to strengthening the team spirit and cooperation between them. <br><br>  The opposite phenomenon is the sufficiency mentality, a paradigm in accordance with which in the world there is enough for everyone.  The result of this attitude to life is a sincere desire to share recognition, profit, the right to participate in important decisions.  The sufficiency mentality recognizes the existence of unlimited possibilities in the development of human relations and the need to work together to solve complex problems that one person cannot cope with. <br><br>  <b>What is so good sufficiency mentality</b> <br><br>  If we talk about purely practical value, then the point is in the possibilities - a person with the Sufficiency Mentality has more of them.  Imagine a situation in which you have a great idea to sell coffee, but, unfortunately, there is no means to implement it.  No one gives you a bank loan, there is no one to borrow such a sum, but you remember that you have a wealthy friend who is ready to make a monetary contribution to the creation of a business.  You have a choice: to bury your idea or to turn to a friend for help, giving him 40-50% of the company (Assume that it will not be in principle). <br><br>  If you look at the consequences, the choice will be as follows: either you will be left with nothing, or together with your friend you will succeed, ensure yourself a stable income and improve the quality of your life.  The only thing you need is to share your income, success and recognition.  It is imperative to do it sincerely, and for this you need to have the Sufficiency Mentality. <br><br>  If you are not ready to agree with this statement, remember any situation in which the success of your business would be more dependent on another person.  For example, you are trading system blocks.  One of the key customers made a very large order, but the number of system officers in the warehouse does not allow it to be fully implemented.  In such a situation, you contact your supplier, whose key customer is you. <br><br>  Now imagine that a supplier, having learned of such a large order, communicates directly with your customer and offers him system units at a lower price.  Of course, in most cases the client will leave for him, however, the supplier, having shown a failure Mentality, will lose his key client - you.  In the long run, everyone will lose: you because your company will suffer losses, your client because they will not be able to contact you anymore if you need a smaller batch of system units, the supplier because they lose you and in a year their lost profit significantly exceeds the short-term benefit. . <br><br>  <b>By developing the Sufficiency Mentality, you get a unique tool that not only helps you to achieve significant results in relationships with people, but also makes you happier.</b>  After all, a person who is unable to envy and gloat is much less nervous, which means that he feels much better (For information on how excessive anxiety affects health, read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149874">here</a> ). <br><br>  The highest degree of development of such an attitude towards life is the ability to sincerely rejoice in the successes of others and the desire not to pay attention to other people's failures, even if these are the failures of your competitors.  It makes no sense to focus on other people's problems - it will not bring you any joy. <br><br>  <b>Of course, having written this post, I do not pretend to be the ultimate truth, but sincerely I believe that it is the Sufficiency Mentality that plays a key role in achieving corporate and team success.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285504/</a></p>
