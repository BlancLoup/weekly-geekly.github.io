  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The category "Indie" appeared in the App Store. But it's not about that.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is a hello from the past.  All that it describes is relevant only on one single day, September 20, 2017, when the category ‚ÄúIndie‚Äù appeared in the App Store, as well as ‚ÄúGames with AR‚Äù, ‚ÄúChildren‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuizzes‚Äù (instead of ‚Äú Curious little things "- finally an adequate translation!) And" Educational "(instead of" Education ").  However, we will not talk about this, but about search engine optimization for iOS11, and more specifically, about category names. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that in the community of ASO-experts someone started a rumor that the issue in iOS11 now includes category names.  The source of the rumors was the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search/">official application of Apple</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f46/6ac/aa5/f466acaa58d64da3ae62fc75322af2d4.png" alt="Apple Search Information"></div><br>  OK, but what follows from this in practice?  Practice, this hard-to-spell demon, daily tormenting ASO-experts, until this great day showed about the following.  Previously, category names, at a minimum, were among the keywords by which the application is indexed, although they rarely featured in word combinations.  If, for example, the keyword field is not filled at all for the country in question, then the game will be indexed only by the name and category name (for example: my, talking, cthulhu, games, simulation, simulation games, etc.). it‚Äôs an honorable 2700th place, and you shouldn‚Äôt hope for a good place on cthulhu simulation. <br><br>  After reading the statement of Apple, we immediately imagined an absurd situation.  You enter the word puzzle in the search.  But instead of games indexed, for one reason or another, by the word puzzle, you immediately fall into the appropriate category. <br><br>  The reality was even more absurd.

The banner is in the search by the words: board, role playing (as well as role play, but not roleplay), simulation, sports, strategy, word. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the search does not distinguish between games and other applications that also "deserve" no less awful category banners.  The word music shows the general category of applications, not a game subcategory.  The word educational shows the general category of education.  Word connects Word Connect advertisements and Microsoft Word. <br><br>  And here is another interesting thing.  In the search for the word action banner categories in the issue is missing.  But instead of him, right under the ad, Story, in the genre of The List, is about Adrenaline-pumping action games. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7ce/4e4/4a9/7ce4e44a9c4b40528bd482fb2438e4d0.PNG" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Do you know what the most adrenaline thriller in the App Store?</i>  <i>Of course, Super Mario Run.</i> <br><br>  By the word kids, too, immediately found the corresponding Story - a selection of the best games.  According to the word indie - a selection of "the best games that you have not played," - The Best Games You've Never Played.  By ar - the whole story, almost longrid, about what augmented reality is, and if you really need a feature, go ahead to AR, but remember: the deadline was the day before yesterday. <br><br>  It is likely that this innovation will soon become the norm.  It is already spreading like a plague, and we are experiencing the last happy days when you can search in the puzzle and immediately find Candy Crush Saga.  But stop laughing, let's start crying.  The main conclusion that can be drawn from this is that ASO experts may soon be unnecessary to anyone, since the impact of search engine optimization in iOS11 has become even less.  If you want to argue - argue, but, only, please, on specific examples, and not on quotations from those same ASO-experts who anticipate a great revelation. <br><br>  And finally, an urgent question from our readers in real time: how to get into the top category "Indies"?  As of September 20, there was no stamp in the indie category as such, but there were several editorial selections like ‚ÄúBest games of all time‚Äù (Russian story) or Our Favorites (American story).  Apple editors have repeatedly expressed their sympathy for independent developers, so you can easily name most of the games presented here, except perhaps the unexpected hit in the Russian selection ‚ÄúLet's play!‚Äù ‚ÄúAssasin's Creed: Identification‚Äù and other things in the same vein. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/997/962/41b/99796241bc274834ad43885f96bf42a5.PNG" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>Transformers: now in the category "indie"!</i> <i><br></i> <br>  And in the first place in the American market by the word indie was Indie Shuffle - New songs shared daily.  Something does not look like a game, you say, and you will be right.  It really was just an app for those who want The National and Arcade Fire-style depressive music in their headphones to last forever.  An exemplary example of indie games, LIMBO, was only in fourth place. <br><br>  By the time, in a happy future when some of you read this article, the Indie category is likely to appear in iTunes Connect.  In our sad past it is not yet, how to get to the top, we do not know, and we are very grieved about this.  So please write to us as soon as possible a comment from the future and tell us that in iTunes Connect you can officially call yourself a worthy son of Jonathan Blow, a nephew of Rami Ishmael, or Luke Winky's father. <br><br>  In the meantime, this did not happen, do everything that you did before to get a feature: for example, get drunk at conferences with everyone who could theoretically be sent by an Apple Cossack.  They say that it really works! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338354/</a></p>
