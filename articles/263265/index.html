  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human processor model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The development of human-machine interfaces should be based on scientific knowledge.  It is necessary to know the quantitative and qualitative comparative assessments of different interfaces, the behavior and reasoning of users in specific situations. <br><br>  The science that answers these questions is cognitive psychology.  Cognitive psychology studies the models of the cognitive processes of the human psyche and includes such sections as attention, memory, pattern recognition, ways of presenting information, logical thinking and determines the ability to make decisions.  A key part of cognitive psychology is the development of models of human behavior.  And one of the most useful achievements in this direction is what is called the ‚ÄúModel of the Human Processor‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d8/297/fff/2d8297fffed93d5bc3dd5d0c9f1a34b7.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This concept "breaks" the human body into components similar to the computer.  Thus, it is possible to distinguish a block of input data based on visual and auditory perceptions, information processing and storage nodes, and an output block responsible for muscle contraction.

      At the initial stage, a person, using remote sensory organs, receives incoming information.  After the information is processed by the <i><b>perceptual processor</b></i> , it is stored for storage in a short (almost fleeting) memory.  At this stage, the knowledge gained fade quickly enough.  It is very important to understand that visual and sound information is stored separately.  Thus, the half-life of visual memory is in the range of 90-1000ms, and sound - 90-3500ms.  If this information is not used and not processed further, it is permanently deleted. <br><br>  Selected data enters the <i><b>working memory area</b></i> .  The peculiarity of this memory is that it combines several information flows within itself.  Thus, a more complete picture is formed of what is happening around the user.  Therefore, the interface of the software product should not contain conflicting information, such as warning about an error pop-up window, accompanied by a positive sound signal.  In psychology, the feeling of discomfort caused by a collision in the minds of at least two conflicting ideas is called <i>cognitive dissonance</i> .  It is important not to forget that the amount of working memory is very limited ‚Äî ∆í working with memory is most effective while storing 7 ¬± 2 items.  For example, a seven-digit mobile number plus an operator code.  The interface developer must take into account this feature of the working memory, it will warn users from forgetting information, and, as a result, making mistakes.  Time constraints are also very important.  Statistically determined that the half-life of the working memory is 5-226s.  But the average value of the sample is 7c., This is the value that should be used in further calculations. <br><br>  The next stage, after the merging of information flows in the working memory, is its processing in the <i><b>cognitive processor</b></i> .  The main task of the cognitive processor is to combine the threads of working and <i><b>long-term memory</b></i> .  Such an operation gives, already, a complete picture of what is happening around.  If necessary, the new information will also be stored in long-term memory.  For example, you got behind the wheel of a new car, by and large, nothing has changed, a few buttons have been added and the appearance of the cabin has changed.  So, as you already have experience driving a car, you need quite a bit of time to adapt to the changed conditions.  The newly received information about new elements of the environment will be recorded in the long-term memory, and, in the future, you will not have the need to get used to this environment again.  That is why, in order to speed up the process of learning the user and warn him from making mistakes, should take into account his previous experience and habits.  A good indicator of the productivity of working with the interface is the reaction time to an event.  Such models as <b>GOMS</b> (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) and its implementation describe a number of rules and methods of communication with the user, allow you to build a plan for interacting with the interface and calculate the approximate time of the operation according to this plan. <br><br>  The propulsion system is the final part of the human processor model.  Output data are actions that are performed immediately after the processing of incoming commands by the <i><b>motor processor</b></i> .  It is noteworthy that a person has a so-called <i><b>muscular memory</b></i> .  This suggests that in order to perform a familiar action, he does not need to think.  For example, when typing this text on a computer, my fingers know exactly what movements need to be done to enter the next word.  For an experienced user, this will not be difficult; on the other hand, a person who does not have the skills of computer typing will spend more time and energy to perform the same task.  Muscular memory is the most difficult type of memory.  Data recording is carried out by a lot of re-performing mechanical operations - training.  Only the motor processor can read data, the information is local and is not transferred to the working memory. <br><br>  Although the human processor model is complete, it does not apply to all human information activities.  This model assumes that a person is engaged in only one business and does not take into account the ability of the brain to multitask.  The same model does not take into account the environment and external factors affecting the user.  Nevertheless, the human processor model proves its effectiveness in the disciplines of the ‚ÄúHuman-computer interaction‚Äù research area and makes it possible to more clearly present the picture of human cognitive abilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263265/</a></p>
