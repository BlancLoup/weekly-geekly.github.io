      If, before the elections, they returned the elections of governors and simplified the registration of parties, then the government does not need to deal with Article 146.  Moreover, no one heard about the election of governors, and the criminal prosecution for torrents concerns everyone.  From their legalization to the authorities there will be a real bonus in the eyes of the runet.  At this step, they will go. <br><br>  I have been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/135544/">defending the Lopukhovs</a> for half a year now, and in spite of the first hearing won, I clearly see that without political resonance we cannot stand against all of Hollywood.  Therefore, Andrei has now recorded a video message: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYBTdSDRiKE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZFLZpTMuKZwQqtMZ2NsPbL5hQoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Collecting so many signatures in the week and a half remaining before the election is not an easy, but achievable task.  There are 40 million people in runet, and we need only a hundred thousand! <br><br>  Today, I will contact the administration of all the major sites in RuNet and ask them to support the action.  Tomorrow I will go out with my friends to collect signatures for Baumanka and Moscow State University.  If necessary, on the same day I will go around all political movements asking for help - from ‚Äúours‚Äù to ‚Äúapple‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://www.observer.com/files/2011/11/Occupy_HOPE1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mr. President, we hope you are on our side.</i> <br><br>  Elections are too rare for us to miss such a chance.  The text of the appeal under the cut, suggest edits if you see fit: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  <i>Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The state of social life in modern Russia is such that it is difficult for ordinary people to coordinate their activities and achieve at least some improvements.</i>  <i>Everywhere corruption, bureaucratic obstacles and the strangulation of public initiative.</i>  <i>Therefore, we ask for your help and participation.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We understand that the legal regulation of the Internet space is not included in the list of your duties, but as a prime minister you have the opportunity to directly influence the social life of our country.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We, the Russian Internet users, ask you to pay attention to the critical situation in the field of intellectual property protection on the Internet.</i>  <i>Due to the imperfection of our legislation and its incompatibility with the realities of the Internet, a legal incident has arisen that makes it possible to prosecute every Internet user for unauthorized copying of intellectual property.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Such actions fall under 146 art.</i>  <i>Criminal Code and are prosecuted by imprisonment up to 6 years.</i>  <i>It turns out that the punishment for copying a file on the Internet is stricter than for killing a person.</i>  <i>We consider this situation to be deeply flawed.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The very copying and distribution of information is the essence of the Internet, so when working on the network, it is impossible to avoid violating the 146 article written in 1993 that does not take into account the realities of the Internet.</i>  <i>For example, for it is simply impossible to assess the damage, because</i>  <i>There is no direct link between copying on the Internet and the copyright holder's profit.</i>  <i>This is actively used by American corporations and constantly subject our citizens to criminal prosecution under questionable pretexts.</i>  <i>Every year the situation becomes worse and begins to acquire fantastic proportions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thus, the Lopukhov family in 2012 was charged with copyright infringement of 38,000,000,000 rubles.</i>  <i>They are accused of the fact that they allegedly distributed 24 films on the Internet, and ‚Äúon a large scale‚Äù.</i>  <i>As reported in the media, the unprecedented amount of damage imputed to Andrei and Natalia Lopukhov is equivalent to the annual turnover of the Russian film distribution.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>From the text of the indictment it follows that the Lopukhovs did not take active steps to sell counterfeit audio-video products.</i>  <i>They simply placed links to audio-video works, but the Lopukhovs did not influence and who could use these links and how they could not.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Daily actions of millions of users, similar to the actions of the Lopukhovs, are subject to Art.</i>  <i>1272 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and on the basis of this are legitimate since each of them, both during the posting and further downloading of information, acts to satisfy its own needs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An analysis of civil law norms and clarifications of the Plenary Sessions of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation allows us to conclude that the placement and further exchange of information using torrent trackers is legal in cases where the information placed on the torrent tracker was obtained from a copy works.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Therefore, non-commercial file sharing should not be subject to Article 146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>The use of torrents and similar sites should be officially recognized as legal.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We ask you to use your high moral authority to contribute to the transformation of the Russian segment of the Internet from the gray zone of legal speculations used by foreign corporations to blackmail Russian citizens and organizations under given political circumstances into a cultural legal space destined to become a bastion in the near future. freedom of speech, democracy and economic development.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>To remedy the situation, it is necessary for the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to adopt the Resolution or otherwise clarify the use of torrent trackers, social networks and other sites for the exchange of information between users.</i>  <i>In such explanations, it should be noted that the exchange of information by Internet users through torrent trackers is legal if the information originally placed on the torrent was obtained from a copy of the work's carrier, legally entered into civil circulation.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We express our modest hope that our letter will be published in the Russian mass media, for example, in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, where a number of your articles have recently appeared, so that our problems will become public knowledge and free unbiased discussion.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Perhaps our problems may seem comical to you, and not worth the attention of the Prime Minister.</i>  <i>But now over 40 million people use the Internet in Russia.</i>  <i>Given the dynamics of Russia's development, we will soon have 80 million, and these 80 million will be recruited from the most educated and enterprising part of the 140 million people.</i>  <i>The 21st century will inevitably create new means of communication, new forms of power and new types of political life.</i>  <i>This is already happening before our eyes.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Speaking out for legalizing non-commercial file sharing, you can count on the sympathy of all Russian netizens.</i>  <i>The Internet will see in you a national leader, to whom the rights and freedoms of citizens are more important than the dubious incomes of foreign companies.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A detailed description of the problem and proposed solutions are set out in a <a href="http://trupirate.ru/details.html">20-page appendix</a> prepared by the leading Russian expert on copyright R.A.</i>  <i>Tyurina.</i>
