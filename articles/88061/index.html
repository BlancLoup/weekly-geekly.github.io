  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I roasted the video card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello Habrasoobschestvo.  I want to tell a little story of one dish that I cooked just a couple of hours ago.  I am still in a state of shock, because  did not expect a successful outcome of this story.  It's all about the non-working video card of a friend and about the successful attempt to restore it by roasting in the oven. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/ac/b3/16/3150502/0/800/pic9.jpg" alt="Introduction"><br><br>  <b>Carefully, under the cut many photos!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the end of the previous week, a friend called me and complained that his computer was starting up, but the monitor did not turn on.  I asked him to count the number of signals that the BIOS issues when testing equipment, because I thought that the person before the call to me, he could check whether the power was connected to the monitor, and whether he plugged the cord from the monitor into a different port or hole ( happened).  To which I received a bold answer: ‚ÄúComp squeaks, 1 time long and 8 times short.‚Äù  Without thinking, I found a table of possible signals from his AMI BIOS.  I do not think that I was very surprised at what device the BIOS complained about - the video card.

      I hurried to report this to a friend.  After that, he got ready and went to him in order to take a look at the video card himself. <br><br><h4>  Disappointment </h4><br>  I want to draw attention to the fact that I am far from being an expert in the field of iron, my knowledge ends where electronics begins, of course there are some basic knowledge, but they are not essential. <br><br>  Having seen and examined the video card, we did not find any burns, smudges, or tracks.  Cleaning contacts did not help.  We were already a bit angry at the sistemnik, constantly escaping from the dynamics, a nasty combination of peaks.  A friend was upset, I was tired, but did not want to give up.  I took the system unit with the monitor home, and began to repeat attempts to revive the video card.  In vain. <br><br><h4>  hope dies last </h4><br>  I repeat a little that I understand in electronics, soldering irons, boards.  But the desire to help a friend took over.  I did not stop looking for a solution.  And suddenly, quite by chance, I came across the topic discussed at the overclocking forum, in which people shared their knowledge and impressions of how they ‚Äúroasted‚Äù their dead processors in the oven, after which they began to work again. <br><br>  It became very interesting to me, there was nothing to lose, the repair of a video card at a cost was close to its price in the store.  I read it.  Found a couple of forums with a discussion of similar topics.  Later, I even found an article in which the ‚Äúcooking‚Äù of a video card in the oven was discussed and decided! <br><br><h4>  How was it or recipe? </h4><br>  <b>I note that if you decide on such preparation, then you should understand that you will do the further at your own peril and risk</b> .  I did not have more solutions, and I had nothing to lose! <br><br>  You will need: <ul><li>  The realization that this method may not work </li><li>  Video card (better of course damaged) </li><li>  The furnace is able to warm up to 200-220 degrees Celsius </li><li>  Screwdriver to remove the cooling system (although someone likes the hammer) </li><li>  Strong nerves (if for the first time) </li></ul><br>  After you have all the "ingredients", follow the further instructions. <br><br>  Take a non-working video card. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/9a/54/47/3150488/0/800/pic1.jpg" alt="Front view"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/de/0e/73/3150490/0/800/pic2.jpg" alt="Back view"><br><br>  Remove the cooling system. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/a4/3d/29/3150489/0/800/pic3.jpg" alt="Naked :)"><br><br>  To leave or not to leave the thermal paste - I do not know, I did not find a definite answer, so I decided to remove it. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/c3/75/60/3150491/0/800/pic4.jpg" alt="We remove thermal grease"><br><br>  Screw everything that can interfere with us in the oven. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/7c/a2/d6/3150494/0/800/pic5.jpg" alt="We screw the excess"><br><br>  Last time we look at our ‚Äúdish‚Äù, completely disassembled. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/cb/a3/40/3150493/0/800/pic6.jpg" alt="Dish"><br><br>  We dress a little foil on the elements that do not want to tolerate high temperature. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/42/95/00/3150495/0/800/pic7.jpg" alt="Foil on non-sagging places"><br><br>  And we begin to spread on a baking sheet. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/a8/aa/22/3150499/0/800/pic8.jpg" alt="On the baking sheet"><br><br>  We put the baking sheet in the oven, and set the temperature to 200-220 degrees Celsius, I understand that you can not climb beyond the temperature limit of 250 degrees, and the temperature below 200 may not melt the soldering, where necessary.  In fact, at this temperature, there will be a soldering of small elements.  If you do not keep the video card in a furnace for a very long time, the process should be completed successfully. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/ac/b3/16/3150502/0/800/pic9.jpg" alt="Into the oven"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/85/a1/b7/3150506/0/800/pic10.jpg" alt="Set the temperature"><br><br>  I tried, gradually, to raise the temperature, so as not to damage the chip, and upon completion of the whole procedure, just as carefully reduce the temperature.  Keeping the card in peak for only about two minutes.  The whole process of frying took about 10-13 minutes.  After that, a rather hot baking tray can be pulled out and the video card can be allowed to cool already in the air.  Which by that time was already littered with smoke from cigarettes, nervously smoking people watching the process. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/28/72/04/3150509/0/800/pic11.jpg" alt="Out of the oven"><br><br>  After all the horror of the experience that I transferred to these horribly long 10-13 minutes, all that remained was to put a layer of thermal paste on the chip of the video card and put it on! <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/cb/18/0c/3150512/0/800/pic12.jpg" alt="Thermal paste"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/64/3e/7c/3150511/0/800/pic13.jpg" alt="Applied layer"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/46/75/38/3150514/0/800/pic14.jpg" alt="Clothed video card"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Hands were shaking, legs were not obeying, but the video card was ready and smelled delicious.  My nerves were burning hot and hope began to fade away, but after pressing the Power button, I heard nothing but a soothing peak that said that the video card was working.  The monitor turned on.  Hats flew into the sky, a smile appeared, the sun shone.  The world came to life around.  It was a great gift for me for such a nervously agonizing and undoubtedly very valuable experience. <br><br>  I hope you enjoyed this little story.  If something goes wrong, do not swear strongly, this is my first experience on the site. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Thanks for the karma, transferred to the blog Iron</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88061/</a></p>
