  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Valid TK, very short</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often, on duty, including, you have to write all kinds of TK, as well as to delve into and (command) to create documentation on products and solutions.  TK - for customer relations, documentation - for developers.  The basic principles that should be short, under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So let's say, how does your superfood cms work?  How to explain?  ‚ÄúWell, we have a bunch of classes here, a template engine, logic, all sorts of interesting pieces, and finally it is a superfood, because on xml (phptemplate, HTML :: Template)‚Äù, we often hear from developers.  It is, of course, good, guys, but it's not clear. <br>  Explain better what happens between how I enter the address in the browser line, or enter in the form on the page, and what I see on the screen. <br>  This seemingly simple question sometimes confuses even the main developers of the architecture of an application.  But, as a result, a good picture is obtained, according to the type ‚Äúhere we start the bootstrap, parses the line of the get parameter, calls the modules according to such a rule, collects those templates, unloads the data into them and displays the HTML files.  such a module is responsible for outputting this part of the page, another is responsible for the other, and so on. ‚ÄùWe draw a picture, a block diagram as it is more convenient for everyone, and everything is clear to everyone, it becomes even clearer to the developers themselves. <br><br>  On the client side, the same thing: I press this button, and where should I go?  And what's next?  Yeah, that's understandable, in contrast to the description ‚Äúwe need a modern, super-modern system in pastel colors and with the most satisfying functionality of the managers.  for $ 500, not more. " <br><br>  Generally described <br>  <b>1. What will be at the entrance, and what will happen at the output</b> <br>  This is the basis of all TK.  Clarify the needs of the client, for himself and for him.  Argument in case of disagreement at the end of development.  It is done before the project.  If this part is not described, or it cannot be done, then politics and confusion deal here.  To undertake such a project is more expensive.  You go out in a minus or even fail.

      <b>2. How in and out are interconnected</b> <br>  Algorithms of system behavior.  The second part is important for developers, in fact - project documentation, which is none.  Often, it is not necessary, but when transferring the code to another developer (if more than one person works), it is NECESSARY to describe.  Otherwise, you will have hemorrhoids with a disassembly of the code and its quality, often.  It is done, usually, at the end of the project. <br><br>  The description may be in free form, in general.  Often this is obtained in the form of a scheme with footnotes (for algorithms), or in the form of exemplary screenshots (in the case of the site).  Well, if this is an official document, then all this is described in detail in words. <br>  This is how you can briefly describe the minimum TK and documentation.  In general - enough in 90% of cases. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : They ask, why is all this written? <br>  Yes, there are complex and large development projects for which huge books have been written on the preparation of TK and documentation, and there it may be necessary.  Documentation in thousands of sheets, TK in hundreds of pages. <br>  But there is still a huge mass of not very large projects, especially in the web development environment, where there is no sense to write this large and complex TK and documentation.  But even without him, it‚Äôs also bad, the minuses are known and indicated.  This note is your own experience, the minimum that is needed to, on the one hand, protect yourself and the client from risks and clarify the situation, write something that another developer can support, and on the other, spend a reasonable amount of time and effort . <br><br>  Heh, interesting stuff on this site with "karma".  at the moment, 47 have added to favorites, 11 + and 12 -, total ‚Äúkarma‚Äù -1, I cannot vote and write comments. <br>  And who these -12 is incomprehensible at all - there are no comments.  Great anonymous?  In general, with such a thing, it seems, not to write me anything more on this saytik - the system does not give.  And it would be possible to continue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144936/</a></p>
