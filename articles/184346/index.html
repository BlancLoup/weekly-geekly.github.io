Compare prices.  Trying to find acceptable.  Looking for movers.  Tormented by doubts, but not deceived? <br>  But why, actually, the one who pays the money must also look for ‚Äúto whom‚Äù to pay?  In our opinion, this approach is not logical.  If you pay money, the performers themselves must search for you and offer services. <br>  This is exactly what happens on the <a href="http://perevezi.ru/">Perevesi.rf</a> service.  Here you just need to place an application, and carriers and transport companies will offer their own terms - your choice. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All bids come in an auction format, thus ensuring a reasonable reasonable price, confirmed by the market.  In addition, there is a very good chance to get substantial savings on the way of transportation, if one of the carriers travels on this route with another cargo. <br>  You can choose a carrier not only on the basis of price.  Each carrier has its own profile on the service, where there is a history of its work, reviews, car photos and other information. <br>  More information about how all this works can be found on the website.  Here we will talk about the history of development, monetization and statistics.

    <h4>  Current statistics </h4><br>  At the moment, the service has more than 30 thousand carriers registered.  About 250 orders for transportation are placed on a weekday.  The fulfillment of orders at 18% is due to the fact that we also position ourselves as a service that allows you to ‚Äújust find out the price‚Äù and do not oblige customers to carry out transportation. <br>  For each order an average of 6-7 offers.  And for large cities, they really get in 20-30 minutes. <br>  Feedback: We ask all customers to leave feedback about the carrier, so that future customers find it easier to choose a performer.  Percentage of completed orders with feedback: 72% <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  Starting this project in 2010, we had no doubt how, as a result, this service should be monetized - this is the commission for each shipment.  According to this scheme, similar services work in the USA and Europe. <br>  Now we take from 5% to 9% of each shipment.  If the customer chooses the winner of the bidding for the order, the carrier must pay the service fee to be able to contact the customer. <br>  Despite our confidence in the choice of the monetization method, we were in no hurry to launch it immediately, because we needed to get some critical mass of carriers and decided to try first alternative ways to monetize - these are paid sms mailing about shipments and a subscription to access to trading.  Now we can say for sure why these ideas did not work and could not provide sufficient income to maintain and develop the service. <br>  In the case of SMS, we deliberately overestimated the value of notifications about new cargoes, most carriers are simply not ready to pay for information about the application, without contact details.  In addition to that, cargo notices also arrive in the mail and are available on the site completely free.  SMS mailing is used, but apparently, only those that do not have email programs in the mobile phone. <br>  As for the paid subscription, the problem here is that access to the service itself does not guarantee the receipt of orders.  Carriers must still compete for the order and offer the best conditions for the customer to choose.  Now the subscription has been transformed into a so-called ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù account, with the possibility of postponing payment of commission on orders and extended functionality. <br><br><h4>  What can be transported? </h4><br>  At the service you can find a carrier not only for moving or transporting a refrigerator, but also ordering the car and motorcycle transportation, food and any building materials. <br>  Moreover, we constantly analyze the market and attract orders and carriers engaged in the transportation of any other goods that are not yet in service. <br><br><h4>  The reverse side of the competition </h4><br>  When a critical mass of carriers appeared at the service (about 15 thousand) and for each order (primarily in Moscow and St. Petersburg), serious competition arose (more than 25 bids for one order), the service service providers began to appear on limiting the minimum bid for the order , since in most cases the price for transportation of a refrigerator began to drop to a cost comparable to the cost of a taxi. <br>  The proposals were supported by the fact that when the minimum rate is limited, the service will receive more revenue (the commission will increase). <br>  Naturally, we could not accept this, since this restriction of competition is the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service. <br>  We carried out a small analysis, in order to understand whether the customers really choose the minimum proposed cost of transportation.  It turned out that this is by no means always, much more often people choose a larger rate, but for a carrier with a good profile and reviews. <br>  If, for example, to take new carriers without feedback, then they are chosen only if the rate is minimal (64% of cases).  And for carriers with 10 or more reviews only in 35% of cases. <br><br><h4>  Plans </h4><br>  It is clear that we are still at the very beginning of the journey and we plan to develop our service further.  In addition to the existing mobile version of the site, we are planning to launch mobile applications for Android and iOS, attracting more companies and carriers, and entering the B2B traffic market. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184346/</a></p>
