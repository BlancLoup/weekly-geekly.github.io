      We continue to publish training materials that will help you in building effective marketing, since marketing is the only thing that you cannot use for us :-).  Today we will talk about effective mailing lists, an extremely important element with which, as it turned out, the absolute majority of Internet businessmen face a problem. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br>  E-mail offers the best return on investment compared to any other digital industry, 68 percent of marketers surveyed rate this tool to make a profit of ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù or ‚Äúgood.‚Äù  But too many companies do not see and do not realize what privileges e-mail can offer, and do not use its advantages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/663/910/ec2663910f6e4bc6bdacbf3404b70c66.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Customer interaction is a new battleground for marketers seeking to attract and retain customers.  When you email the right message to the right customer, and even at the right time, this strategy helps to form a strong connection that leads to greater brand loyalty and, consequently, more sales. <br>  If you don‚Äôt see the profit you‚Äôd like to see, it‚Äôs probably worth taking a step back and see if any of these time-tested lessons can add value to every email you send. <br><br>  <b>Yes: treat the customer exclusively</b> <b><br></b>  <b>No: Send the same boring messages throughout the mailing list</b> <br><br>  If something is created personally for you and for you, it is much more likely that you immerse yourself in this item.  That is why personalized emails attract six times more interest to the brand.  However, it was found that 70 percent of companies still ignore personalized content sent via email. <br>  You simply add the name of your recipient in the subject line or work more deeply - for example, by using dynamic content or pictures selected for each client, in any case, an exclusive attitude to the client helps your brand send highly relevant emails that show customers what you are take care of them.  Starting from caring and courting new customers, ending with delight and satisfaction from existing ones, personalized emails give recipients a reason to dive into your content every step of the way. <br>  If you are not sure where you should start, then first, divide your audience based on data such as location and order history. <br><br>  <b>Yes: Inform and satisfy your customers.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>No: Permanently send unsolicited advertisements.</b> <br><br>  Sales and marketing have come a long way in recent years.  Instead of relying solely on annoying cold calls, companies now have the opportunity to interact with customers by talking to topics that are preferred and interesting to the customer.  Many can do this by email. <br>  Email is the preferred way to communicate for 70 percent of Internet users. <br>  However, this does not mean that every letter sent to the client must necessarily contain information about the sale.  Many successful companies win the trust of their customers, acting as a resource, not advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/904/602/d619046028b043e4a01a1863924541d3.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Sending tips, exclusive reviews and educational materials creates an effect in which recipients are really looking forward to emails.  They will have less chances to unsubscribe from your newsletter, and your company will be the first thing that comes to mind when a customer wants to make any purchase. <br><br>  <b>Yes: Supports information with pictures.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>No: Turn an email into a story.</b> <br><br>  When the subscriber opens your email, you only have a couple of seconds to get interested and to continue reading.  What's the secret?  Do not treat the letter without proper attention, but share the information, accompanying it with exciting pictures. <br>  Save details on the conversion page, ranging from news announcements to product promotion.  Pictures and visually prominent images make a strong impression on readers from the very beginning.  The total number of views increases by 94 percent if the article contains a corresponding photo or infographic, compared to articles without images! <br>  Do a simple experiment: visualize your entire email, do not use text, only images.  If your message is still understandable without studying the headlines and calls for action, then you are on the right track. <br><br>  <b>Yes: benefit from custom content</b> <b><br></b>  <b>No: downplay the importance of agitators and lovers of your products</b> <br><br>  Imagine that you are visiting a new city for the first time.  You know for sure that recently your friend published a post from a restaurant in this town on Instagram, saying that it was the most delicious food in his life.  If you are nearby and know the name of this restaurant, will you go for lunch there?  Or choose some unknown place that you have never heard of? <br>  The choice is simple, and experienced marketers are well aware of this.  That‚Äôs why custom content is becoming an increasingly valuable marketing tool, and that‚Äôs why your customers can have valid claims regarding your subsequent email marketing campaign.  As many as 84 percent of the people who participated in the survey say that they trust the recommendations of people they know personally much more, and the advertising messages emanating from the companies themselves are much less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6e/bf9/7d5/b6ebf97d50f54b818caaa5304d59b6d5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you have not yet used social content, here are a few recommendations: <br><br><ul><li>  Create and promote distinctive hashtags for your company or product. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Download already existing hashtags and keywords that users can use when describing your product. </li></ul><br><ul><li> Offer incentives for users who are willing to share information about your product with their subscribers. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Combine all received materials to constantly update the content and maintain the interest of readers </li></ul><br><br>  If you can combine the personal experience and interests of your potential customers with the information they receive daily via e-mail, the value of your messages will increase exponentially (along with the profits of your companies).  But if you do not listen to your audience and cut out your strategy accordingly, then the potential of using emails will not be fully revealed. <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog, there will be a lot of interesting things further. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300438/</a></p>
