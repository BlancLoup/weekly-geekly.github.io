  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web Pathology: Website for yourself, not for customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite often in consultations on UX design one has to repeat the same thing to many clients and it makes me a little nervous.  Therefore, I decided to periodically briefly publish the most popular topics, in the naive hope that people would read them and these topics would not arise so often.  Something like Lebedev's ‚ÄúKovodstvo‚Äù.  In my case, it turns out some kind of UX-management, which in Russian is funny to read as ‚Äúearring‚Äù.  The logical title of this proposed series of articles is ‚ÄúFrequent Pathology of UX Design‚Äù, which can be shortened to ‚ÄúWeb Pathology‚Äù.  Do not be afraid of the terrible word ‚Äúpathology‚Äù, it means only a systematic deviation from normal development and is generally harmless. <br><br>  Many companies refer to the creation of their own site, as a home improvement apartment.  They scrupulously select the wallpaper design, the color of the parquet, the fabric for the curtains, the shape of the chandelier, arrange the icons, hang pictures of the hunt and portraits of the heads of the families with the caught salmon.  Russian style in the kitchen, art deco in the living room, suprematism in the bedroom.  Carefully open the pages of family albums on the sideboard and wipe from dust all three thousand volumes of novelists of the last century (so that guests have something to read).  After everything is ready, the site opens and the first visitors to the banking site quietly slide along the wall ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You have already seen this many times.  Sites with a welcoming speech, with the company's mission, with milestones of her career, with panegyrics to her holy collective and wisdom of leadership, with a dollar rate and a horoscope, with the address of the general director and his photograph in the style of ‚ÄúI and my glorious business‚Äù.  Sites made by companies for themselves.  In light form, this problem exists in almost all sites.  It even happens that they forget to write on websites - what exactly the company is doing and what products it sells. <br><br>  Do not think that this is some kind of contagious form of stupidity, not at all.  This is a phenomenon that is quite natural for all people and relates to the ‚Äúmental traps‚Äù of our consciousness.  It also appears when choosing a gift for your friend on his birthday.  After all, you need to choose a gift that your friend will like, and not yourself.  That is, you have to choose, not using your own taste and experience, but using your friend's experience (or at least your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit).  If you deliberately think about it, then you will immediately find yourself in this very trap and quite naturally buy what you find interesting for yourself.

      In the same way, companies also make websites for themselves, while completely forgetting about customers, and if they find themselves in the role of a customer, they rightly start to resent, they say, ‚Äúwhere are the goods?  where are the prices?  What kind of crazy site have you done here? ‚Äú, because they have customer experience at this moment, they can judge the site's compliance with their goals and objectives.  I am now even more scary thing to say: "Your site is not obliged to like you at all."  But it must necessarily please your customers. <br><br>  And here comes the UX design, whose main task is to understand the experience of your users (User Experience) and design a website based on the results.  I hope that after reading this small note, most of you will say about this mysterious UX design: ‚ÄúOh, now I understand!‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107055/</a></p>
