  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What kind of game is Google playing on the online advertising market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The online advertising market is growing at an intensive pace compared to other segments of the advertising market.  The main driver of the Internet advertising market worldwide is the growth of the Internet audience. <br><br>  Contextual advertising today is the main driver of the development of Internet advertising, in contrast to the media segment, which was strongly affected by the unstable economic situation. <br><br>  According to LiveInternet experts, the share of the American company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> in the Russian market of search engines <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/02/02/2015/54cde5919a794776519a5a68">is</a> about 30%.  Google <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdWords">AdWords</a> is the global leader in the contextual advertising market.  In Russia, its share is also close to 30%.

      Google does not ‚Äúbore‚Äù advertisers and its users, constantly improving (in the opinion of the company) the search engine and advertising services.  Each such innovation, as a minimum, attracts the attention of online advertising players, and perhaps even determines the development of this market. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In early February, it became <a href="http://itc.ua/blogs/google-nachnet-preduprezhdat-kogda-na-saytah-ozhidaetsya-feykovaya-reklama-knopki-skachivaniya/">known</a> that Google will begin to warn users about fake advertising.  The developers have updated the service Safe Browsing. <br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing">Safe Browsing</a> - Google service to combat attacking and phishing sites.  Updated Safe Browsing will warn not only about malicious files, but also about the presence of fake ads and download buttons. <br><br>  If the site has fake ads copying the original and offering to download a malicious file or follow an unwanted link, Safe Browsing (used by Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers) will warn the user with standard text on a red background.  As before, you can skip the warning and follow the suspicious link at your own risk. <br><br>  However, in cases where advertising is not fake, and causes suspicions of a legal nature, a moderation of another plan is needed. <br><br>  On February 19, the Moscow Department of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in Moscow <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24222/">found</a> Google and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru">Mail.ru</a> guilty of violating the law ‚ÄúOn Advertising‚Äù.  Now companies must pay a fine: Mail.ru LLC - 100 thousand rubles, Google LLC - 150 thousand. <br><br>  The fact is that through advertising networks Google AdWords and myTarget, for which representatives of Google and Mail.ru are responsible, advertising of LLC Ruscredit was distributed.  But this company does not have a license to conduct banking operations. <br><br>  According to representatives of the antimonopoly service, IT companies should be responsible for moderating the advertised ads. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGoogle LLC and Mail.ru LLC, having a real opportunity to control the content of distributed ads, did not take sufficient measures to prevent violation of advertising legislation,‚Äù explained the decision of the deputy head of the Moscow OFAS Irina Gudkova. <br><br>  Of course, to close your eyes on violations is easiest.  And when it is also commercially profitable, the eyes see only financial indicators. <br><br>  But practically no one can push the American Internet giant to any changes - Google makes its decisions independently, being ‚Äúon its own wave‚Äù.  So, quite recently, the company decided to please advertisers and users (at least, Google thinks they would be pleased) and disappoint SEO specialists. <br><br>  February 20 edition of The Verge <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/20/11077472/google-search-ads-change-position">reported</a> that Google will reduce the number of ad units that are shown in the search results on desktop platforms.  Changes to AdWords will be launched worldwide. <br><br>  Contextual advertising will remain above and below the results of the issuance, while the number of ads in the upper part can be increased from three to four.  An extended block will be shown in a highly competitive query.  On the right side, only product advertisements (Product Listing Ad) and the knowledge panel will remain. <br><br>  Reducing ad units will make search results on desktops look like a mobile version.  Usually, gadget users see two or three ads at the top of the page. <br><br>  In this case, four ads will not be visible at every request, but only in the case of its high popularity.  This will provide the user with the most relevant results and increase the effectiveness of advertising. <br><br>  Unfortunately, SEO-specialists in this situation will again feel like ‚Äústrangers at this celebration of life‚Äù.  Their importance and degree of comfort will once again decrease. <br><br><blockquote>  At the dawn of its existence (1997-1999), SEO was reduced to skilled spam in the text.  TOC was easily achieved by simple manipulation of the simplest text analysis algorithms, taking into account quantitative metrics as the main ones.  Simply put, the more words from the query were encountered on the page, the more relevant the document became. <br><br>  Since the creation of the <a href="http://www.wikireality.ru/wiki/Google_PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, in addition to relevance, the authority of the resource and a separate page has been taken into account. <br><br>  The creators could not even think to what extent the link trading industry would grow. <br><br>  But over the past five years, behavioral metrics of users have become increasingly important when ranking.  As the main ranking algorithm (and PageRank was such for a long time), the links no longer appear.  They are certainly counted as a signal for ranking, but not to the same extent as before. </blockquote><br>  However, once again turn our gaze to the future, where the advertising market is waiting for new vicissitudes. <br><br>  Google has officially <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/%2BGoogleAds/posts/dYSJRrrgNjk">announced the</a> date of full refusal of Flash advertising on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDN">Google Display Network</a> . <br><br>  From June 30, 2016, advertisers will not be able to upload new ads in Flash format, but the old ones will still be displayed. <br><br>  On January 2, 2017, even the old Flash ads will be completely disabled and advertisers need to transfer all their banners to HTML5 by that time. <br><br>  Let's see what else will please Google users or advertisers, and how this will affect the advertising market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298832/</a></p>
