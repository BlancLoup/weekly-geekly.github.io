  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frequencies that can explode an atomic bomb, zombie people and help us know the mystery of the soul</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In amateur radio there is a special direction - monitoring of departmental radio stations: government radio, special services radios, military transmitters.  Special chic is interception of communication sessions between the base and atomic submarines in the range of superlong waves - ADD.  In the English-language literature, ADD have received the excellent name ELF (Extreme Low Frequency - "extremely low frequency").  So ELFs - by this abbreviation we will mean ADL transmitters - are found not only in fairy tales. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  CHILDREN AGAINST ZEUS </h3><br>  ADD is pierced by both the earth and the sea.  Therefore, they are used to communicate with nuclear submarines, hidden at great depths. <br>  The Russian Alpha-Zeus system (radio transmitting station (hub) P-161U) operates at a frequency of 82 Hz with narrow-band frequency modulation of ¬± 2 Hz.  Those who understand physics will ask: ‚ÄúHow can an antenna with a length of 3658.5 km be placed in Europe?‚Äù The fact of the matter is that such an antenna is not needed - its role is delegated to Earth. <br><br>  The Electronic Intelligence Service (DER) of NATO called the Russian system, excuse me, the Penis-Cola.  The fact is that the Zeus transmitter is located on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Kola Peninsula</a> , which in Finnish is called the Kola Peninsula.  In one of the documents, the secretary of the North Atlantic Department of the DER has missed the second letter N from the second word. The remaining letters were removed as superfluous.  And it turned out what happened.  "Zeus" is heard anywhere in the northern hemisphere and the main task - to transfer the Kremlin orders to Russian submariners - performs flawlessly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a8d/71a/2a5/a8d71a2a5e8edf24f31253b6dec27a37.jpg" width="300" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br><br>  Until 2004, the USA had its own ELFs in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan (they worked at a frequency of 76 Hz).  Closed them because of ... inefficiency.  A more modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAARP">HAARP</a> system uses a frequency of 2.2 Hz, the transmitter is located in Alaska.  The abbreviation HAARP is consonant with the English harp - harp.  And here, Russian REARs, who called the woodpecker's Alaskan ELF, in a non-print sense, had a little sense of humor. <br>  ADD are also classified because the command to explode nuclear warheads is transmitted using ELFs - their signals penetrate even through the skin of the missile.  If there is no such team, the bomb will not explode.  It will fly to the target, fall, fall apart, self-destruct, finally, but not explode.  Although there are two exceptions to this rule.

      From time to time, ELFs broadcast new target coordinates, route control points, etc. Transmission duration is 30 minutes, but strategic sessions are shorter, about 20 seconds.  They encoded one of two messages: "Everything is fine" and "Emergency."  In the latter case, the nuclear warheads are transferred to a mode that allows the submarine captain and the GRU missile to activate the detonation system with personal ciphers.  An automatic platoon of warheads also occurs if the ELFs fall silent for a long time.  According to the logic of the bomb, this means that a nuclear disaster has occurred, the communications center has been destroyed and it is time to visit the territory of the enemy.  I want to believe that ‚ÄúZeus‚Äù will sing with ‚Äúwoodpeckers‚Äù, and freelance pauses or the message ‚ÄúTovs!‚Äù Will never appear on their frequencies. <br><br><h3>  TESLA-EINSTEIN SYNDROME </h3><br>  Physicists have long dreamed of creating a universal theory.  It even has a name - TNA, general field theory.  The closest to this goal came Einstein and Tesla.  Both used in the work of ELFs.  Working with add-on transmitters and various modulations, Nikola Tesla learned how to transmit powerful energy flows over long distances.  Both from the military and commercial points of view, such studies were of great interest.  But both scientists stopped work on the ULP and destroyed the records on this topic.  Einstein commented on the decision: ‚ÄúHumanity has not grown yet‚Äù.  From the lips of the godfather of the atomic bomb, such words sound special ... <br><br>  What scared scientists?  The ability of ELFs to influence a person.  And, perhaps, going into other dimensions with consequences that Tesla and Einstein caused panic.  Note that Tesla was not only a physicist, but also an esoteric. <br><br><h3>  RANGE OF MATHEMATICAL PARADOXES </h3><br>  Our body emits ADD in the range from 0 to 500 Hz.  The most studied of them - from 2.2 to 10 Hz, in this band there is a peak of electromagnetic activity of the brain.  And the instinctive communication of man with nature occurs in the range of 70‚Äì500 Hz.  The key point here is 100 Hz - the average frequency of lightning discharges on the earth's surface.  If the field strength at this frequency is within the cozy limits in terms of genetic memory, the person is calm.  Any deviations give rise to either fear of drought or anticipation of a storm. <br>  The least studied range of ADD is the lowest one, where the mathematical paradox is observed: the frequency here tends to zero, and the wavelength - to infinity.  Here and ‚Äúfonti‚Äù the main human cycles: from the daily alternation of sleep and wakefulness to the monthly renewal of the female body.  The maximum wavelength is characteristic of the full life cycle - from the first to the last breath.  Believers theoretical physicists believe that in the range of mathematical paradoxes, you can fix the radiation of the human soul.  And with the help of correctly modulated ELFs - to influence the fate of a person. <br><br><h3>  ABOUT MUSIC AND NOT ONLY </h3><br>  In the early 1990s, in Moscow, radio amateurs recorded the work of ELF, broadcasting at 300 Hz.  The cycles of his activity miraculously coincided with the turbulent events that accompanied the collapse of the USSR.  The modulation parameters of the ELF-300 could not be cracked.  And it was in them that the secret of the impact of the Moscow transmitter on people lay. <br>  What is modulation?  We give a simple analogue - music.  A disco with a characteristic major structure makes the listener have a desire to dance and uplifting.  Heavy metal, having a different musical system (modulation), provokes aggression and suicidal feelings.  And music like playboy mansion with an abundance of bass lines and languid percussion rhythms awakens sexual fantasies. <br>  The effects of music on the psyche have long been known to clerics.  Most prayers, regardless of denomination, use a frequency of 7-12 Hz.  Why?  Let's get away from the banal mention of brain alpha rhythms (6‚Äì8 Hz).  More interesting than the other.  At a frequency of 10 Hz, gray matter scans the memory in search of patterns ‚Äî patterns by which faces are recognized, speech recognition, interaction with external signals.  With music, for example.  Thus, during collective prayers, the process of searching patterns is suppressed and the natural reactions are replaced by cult ones.  Alas, this feature of ADD is used not only by clergymen. <br><br><h3>  "Pyatnashka" IRON FELIX </h3><br>  At the end of 1918, an institute was opened near St. Petersburg, later called NII-15 (aka Leningrad-15).  Until his death, he was supervised by Felix Dzerzhinsky.  The founder of the Cheka / GPU was well versed in psychology and religion, as he was a zealous Catholic in his youth and dreamed of becoming a Jesuit.  Formally, in the "Fifteen" dealt with the problems of psychiatry;  really - applied psychology.  Scouts, commissars, political workers were trained there.  Judging by how quickly the Bolsheviks gained power over the former Russian empire, specialists ‚Äútag‚Äù worked in full soldering. <br><br>  NII-15 used ADL transmitters.  According to indirect data, some of the Tesla-Einstein experiments were repeated here, after which a section of esoteric appeared on the object.  Rave?  The fact of the matter is that the experiments of "Leningrad" are documented. <br><br>  In the early 1990s, the White Brotherhood charismatic church was established in Kiev. It was created by journalist Marina Tsvigun and microelectronics operator Yury Krivonogov.  According to the generally accepted version, the founders of the fraternity possessed extrasensory abilities, which made it possible to keep the entire sect in check.  However, the examination conducted during the court hearings in the BB case did not establish the presence of such abilities.  How, then, to explain the phenomenon of the "White Brotherhood"? <br>  The court case file says that BB had a third co-founder, who left Ukraine on the eve of the seizure of St. Sophia Cathedral.  The investigation found that at least twice this person visited the NII-15.  In the Soviet times, Krivonogov experimented with ADD.  Changing the modulation parameters, he, for example, learned to evoke a wide range of sensations in experimental animals - from orgasm to death.  Whether such experiments were conducted with people, the consequence is unknown ... <br><br>  And the last.  In preparing the article, the author tried to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù an add-on receiver on the Internet.  The result was unexpected.  The pages on which such devices were offered turned out to be blocked.  And professional receivers that fell into my hands refused to work at frequencies below 100 kHz.  The only exception was the device, unlocked by the capital's craftsmen and capable of receiving transmissions at frequencies from 30 kHz (this is the formal beginning of the super-add-on).  Such a receiver cannot catch military signals, but it can be used to control the upper range of the VLA.  Lovers of numerology will be interested to know that one of the ELFs works around the clock.  The frequency of its broadcasting is 66.6 kHz. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://24.ua/news/show/id/30793.htm">24.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21235/</a></p>
