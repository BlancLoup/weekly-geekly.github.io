      In total, the company sold 245,240 cars last year: 145,846 Model 3 and 99,394 Model S and Model X. For comparison, in 2018 almost as many cars were sold as in all previous periods. <br><br>  Sales of Model 3 were only in North America.  More than ¬æ orders for Model 3 came from new customers.  Accordingly, only a quarter of the cars were bought by those who had previously booked.  The company expects to increase sales in the future due to the expansion of markets in Europe and China, as well as through cheaper versions of the car and leasing programs.  Start of sales of Model 3 cars in Europe and China is planned in February of this year. <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that from the 1st of this month, the credit returns to the USA for Tesla decreased by 2 times (from $ 7,500 to $ 3,750), the company reduced the cost of all its vehicles by $ 2,000.  There may be several options for such actions - to keep current demand by reducing revenues, or due to the fact that the production process has been simplified.  In any case, lower prices for electric cars are a good incentive to buy them.  Perhaps the hour is not far when the company releases the base Model for $ 35,000, as promised earlier. <br><br>  The company also noted a 3-fold increase in production.  At the beginning of 2018, the production capacity was 120 thousand cars, and at the end of the year they reached 350 thousand units per year. <br><br>  Specified data on production and sales will be announced in the financial report for the 4th quarter, so the error may be 0.5%. <br><br>  <a href="http://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q4-2018-vehicle-production-deliveries-also-announcing-2000">Link</a> to the original press release. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435008/</a></p>
