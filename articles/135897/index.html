      However, in this small post I will take the liberty to list the TOP-5 of those very books that won the vote, translated into Russian.  And to give small comments, because the books are really worth it.

The first Russian edition was in 2004 in the ‚ÄúProgrammer‚Äôs Library‚Äù series. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a great book for programmers who have somehow learned to program somewhere, maybe at the institute, but are not quite sure what to do.

On <i>stackoverflow they</i> write that the book will literally enlighten us (will enlighten you) and after it there will be a desire to write great programs.  And what if all the other books make us a better (better) programmer, then specifically this one will make a programmer out of a reader. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>4.

Perhaps because the book by Kernigan and Ritchie is a cult book on C programming from the creators of the language, where they tell their readers about the wide possibilities of C and the features that distinguish it from other structural programming languages.  Indeed, at one time the C language was developed specifically for the Unix operating system, but the created language was so universal that it found its application in other areas of programming. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>5.</b> And completes the top five with a score of ~ 680 votes book: <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="200"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e8/7a9/87a/5e87a987a63658fb39c48a259f3b4b64.jpg"><br></td><td>  <b><a href="http://ebdb.ru/Search.aspx%3Fp%3D1%26s%3D%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%2B%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%26x%3D0%26y%3D0">Algorithms.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://ebdb.ru/Search.aspx%3Fp%3D1%26s%3D%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%2B%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%26x%3D0%26y%3D0">Build and analyze</a></b> <br>  Authors: Thomas Kormen, Charles Lazerson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein <br><br>  The book is a translation of a textbook on the course of constructing and analyzing effective algorithms, written at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology;  it deals with the most important classes of fast algorithms and methods for constructing them.
