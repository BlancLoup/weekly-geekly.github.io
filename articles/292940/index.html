Next, we will tell you which areas, in addition to FinTech, experts consider the most promising and in which projects they would like to invest. <br><br><h3>  Dmitry Chikhachev </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a52/521/ad6/a52521ad60a240aa80f1e95d75d9f4ba.JPG" width="320" height="226" align="left">  Dmitry Chikhachev, the founder and managing partner of Runa Capital, points out several promising areas for potential investors: cloud technologies for business, sophisticated software and IT solutions for the financial sector, education and public services.  The expert notes that the least developed today is the educational sphere, in which, contrary to modern trends and digital technologies, outdated methods are still used: paper textbooks, exercise books and classrooms. <br><br>  The global education market is about 4 trillion dollars a year.  This is the amount that governments of various countries spend on education.  Of these $ 4 trillion, about $ 90 billion is accounted for by online education, and every year this figure grows by about $ 20 billion. The development of digital education gives people additional opportunities, it is interactive, adaptive and personalized for the needs of the student.  Educational content, according to Dmitry Chikhachev, is an excellent growth point for start-ups and, accordingly, for investors. <br><br>  The expert considers medicine to be another ‚Äúinteresting sphere‚Äù.  Currently, almost any process in the human body can be monitored and measured.  However, in medicine there are still not enough tools for storing, processing and transmitting an array of such data.  Chikhachyov considers promising the direction of ‚Äúdeveloping software for systematizing and processing large amounts of genome decoding data by searching for marker regions responsible for determining pathology‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Alexander Ivanov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/148/918/b8c148918e1c4c658515817640c8c851.PNG" width="320" height="226" align="left">  Former partner and co-founder of the Life.SREDA fund, Alexander Ivanov, is confident that the venture capital market is driven by global trends.  Based on this, the expert calls the most promising areas Big Data and m2m (machine interaction), and also predicts the growth of FinTech. <br><br>  Another important trend Alexander Ivanov considers the economic recovery after the crisis, followed by the growth of small and medium enterprises (SME).  Because of this, services designed to optimize internal processes for SME (invoicing, loyalty services and communication with customers, mobile payment services) can be the most popular. <br><br><h3>  Oleg Seydak </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e8/ce9/f0b/8e8ce9f0b09842a8abdf9c5f06f8e361.PNG" width="320" height="226" align="left">  Oleg Seydak, a Flint Capital venture fund partner, considers the financial industry to be the most conservative.  The additional regulation introduced after the 2008 crisis significantly limited the freedom of action of traditional financial institutions.  At the same time, the growing popularity of the Internet and mobile devices has led to the emergence of new players and business models on the market.  This prompted many investors to invest in fintech projects. <br><br>  Another trend is projects working with Big Data.  The main consumers of products based on processing large data arrays are medicine, large-scale production and other industries where instruments are equipped with an increasing number of sensors.  Currently there are still few projects focused on Big Data on the market, which means that in this area new players have great opportunities. <br><br><h3>  Other experts </h3><br>  Alexander Chachava, the initiator of the foundation of the LETA Capital fund, calls the most promising areas Big Data, robotics and mobile applications. <br><br>  Lyubov Simonova, director of Almaz Capital, believes that it is worthwhile to develop domestic projects by investing in technological Internet companies that have big ambitions.  The expert also notes that you need to invest in what you understand yourself and in the one who can realize the idea. <br><br>  Managing partner of the fund iTech Capital Gleb Davidyuk relies on fintech and the Internet of things. <br>  The creator of the QIWI group of companies and the managing partner of the Run Capital fund, Andrey Romanenko, prefers projects aimed at optimizing and simplifying the routine tasks of a wide audience (service aggregators, transfer services from offline to online space). <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog on <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/web_payment_ru/">Megamind</a> , as well as to the newsletter on our <a href="http://web-payment.ru/">website</a> , you will find many more interesting posts about payment services, development, fintech start-ups and more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292940/</a></p>
