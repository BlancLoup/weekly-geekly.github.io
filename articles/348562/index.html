Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are convinced that by combining financial and intellectual capabilities, we will build a modern, highly profitable business and utterly surpass our competitors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/bd/um/ekbdum-imo4chcwas9ucz59r8xy.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>James Shurovyeski</i> <br><br>  The previous introductory article, which describes the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/345754/">history of our activities</a> turned out to be quite long.  And, as correctly noted in the comments, the article did not reveal the essence of the idea.  But, as I wrote earlier, without a description of history, it is difficult to understand the <b>process of transforming the thoughts of the</b> founders of a small local business with the strategic goals of entering the international market. <br><br>  Therefore, I advise you to start exploring our history with the first part of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  IT market = catering solutions </h3><br>  In May 2017, we opened our first experimental catering facility.  Confectionery cafe with a large production hall in the Open Space format.

      At the time of construction (which lasted 8 months), we studied IT products and solutions that will help us automate some of the business processes of the establishment and the work of the establishment itself.  In the end, I got this list of applied solutions and IT tools: <br><br><ul><li>  POS system for restaurant and cafe automation (includes warehouse automation) </li><li>  cloud ticket (this is the law) </li><li>  CRM system (for working with online delivery customers) </li><li>  IP telephony (intercom and intercom) </li><li>  cloud surveillance system </li><li>  communication tool with staff </li><li>  cloud solution for support services (use as a knowledge base). </li></ul><br>  Seven different tools and everything from different suppliers (suppliers of IT products).  It is important to note that already at the stage of searching and exploring the presentations of various products, we realized that we would not find a fully embedded solution with all of our wishes.  For example, out of a dozen suppliers of CRM systems, only one of the suppliers was ready to offer services for the implementation of certain services.  Here is the standard list of add-ons and the cost of services for refinement: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/4v/_o/b94v_ojbxwlehjgv4t45b63_has.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, the complex of tools that we use allows us to conduct business and <b>adapt</b> to the capabilities of IT tools.  It categorically does not suit us.  Moreover, the business and the ideas that we implement are based on a simple approach - the idea, the primary (test) implementation, analysis, re-implementation, taking into account adjustments, etc. <br><br>  In other words - the empirical method. <br><br>  The key fact here is the fact that we initially generate an idea, discuss the concept and the consistency of this idea.  Then we test it in our business.  That is why, our institution has received an experimental prefix. <br><br>  Most of the products on the IT solutions market for the automation of a business (a restaurant, cafe, factory, etc.) cannot be called a fully functional product that takes into account the specifics of a particular business.  And the whole point is that summarizing businesses operating in a particular area - internal processes are also summarized. <br><br>  According to our observations, the restaurant business is often led by creative people, and <br>  not engineers.  Automation of warehouse accounting, development of control systems, creation <br>  various technological schemes of production are carried out with the separation from production <br>  in a budget deficit.  It is psychologically difficult for restaurateurs to invest in <br>  that in itself will not earn.  For enterprise management are used <br>  inefficient universal third-party IT tools that <br>  offer a solution to common problems, losing sight of the details.  But everything is made up of details. <br><br>  Making a test environment out of one‚Äôs own business is an expensive pleasure and a rather bold decision. In terms of psychological perception of the fact that each experiment costs money, and the return from the highly efficient solution found will not be instantaneous. <br><blockquote>  If we had no plans to enter the international market with a project to build conceptual establishments under our brand, we could be quite comfortable with IT solutions and products offered by the market. </blockquote><br>  Strategic plans make adjustments to each process.  And it is thanks to the right strategic plans that the future is built and great companies are born. <br><br>  Already today our business is working efficiently.  However, we are planning <br>  to develop further and make a real breakthrough by combining blockchain and IT technology with <br>  real production. <br><br><h3>  SIMT Concept and Principles </h3><br>  SIMT - Smart Investment Management Tool.  <b>Mining tool.</b> <br><br>  All information about the work of the existing establishment and business is open to investors and <br>  will remain open in the future.  It is on this that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating <br>  collective decision making functionality within SIMT. <br><br>  Immediately, I note that SIMT is a concept.  SIMT is not a complete product even in our heads - people who invent it.  However, SIMT is based on specifically formulated principles.  And these principles are unchanged: <br><br><ul><li>  Absolute transparency of business and openness of information on all aspects of business, including decisions and plans of managers and founders; </li><li>  The opinion of the unit can be supported by a majority by voting; </li><li>  All participants have the same voice weight, regardless of their status, experience and investment in the project; </li><li>  The value of an idea is determined by the majority of votes, and not by one person with a ‚Äúcontrolling interest‚Äù; </li><li>  Criticism, ideas, questions, comments - this is what gives us the strength to develop, grow and build new plans; </li><li>  SIMT serves the business and the main goal of the implementation is the automation of business processes / technological processes of production, increasing the efficiency of each individual operation within the organization. </li></ul><br>  The ability to see complex business indicators, analyze and propose ideas or solutions to certain problems based on the analysis done is only one of the SIMT functionals. <br><br><h3>  Ticket for participation in the game </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/2u/8x/kw2u8xr-0fyqebtue2bsw_wmtgo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  We cannot with 100% probability say that everyone who gets access to SIMT will use the functionality, analyze information and offer ideas and solutions to existing problems.  For someone, it will be a game.  Business game or business quest in reality.  We all know for sure that an interesting game is addictive.  Moreover, the ‚Äúticket to participate in the Game‚Äù ( <i>quoted from the description of the film ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù by David Fincher</i> ) is available to absolutely anyone and costs less than a cup of coffee. <br><br>  You are most likely familiar with the concept of the game in an alternate reality.  We offer the game in the existing reality.  However, some principles are similar to ARG. <br><br>  The creator of the famous game ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù, Sean Stacy defines ARG as a kind of chaotic fiction - games with improvisation, with an uncertain scenario that can develop one way or another, depending on the actions of the audience (participants).  The audience at the same time does not fully understand whether it is dealing with fiction or with a set of real events.  Everything happens in real time and in real space. <br><br>  Transfer it to the business with a slight clarification in the wording - the <b>audience is fully aware of the reality of the events</b> , has all the necessary information about the existing reality of the business, and the reliability of these events <b>is beyond doubt.</b> <br><br><h3>  Blockchain </h3><br>  The technology that allows you to implement the first element of the game is to ensure the accuracy of events occurring in a particular business. <br><br>  We create and test a model, and our real business becomes a testing ground and financial support.  As a result of the development of the project, we will receive both an innovative business tool and the results of its work - a successful international, scalable business. <br><br>  I think enough theory and reasoning.  Let's move on to specific examples. <br><br>  So, one of the main functions of SIMT is to enable the holders of tokens to see all business processes from the inside as we see it - the founders of businesses.  The only difference is that the founders of a business spent 4 years of their life on business development and hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own investments :) <br><br>  There was a supply - it is clear, the sale - it is clear, it was stolen - it is clear that the staff did not go to work - everyone knows about it. <br><br>  Further, on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of all indicators, the user of the SIMT has the opportunity to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù their ideas.  Offer your ideas for evaluation, by voting.  It is important to note that the proposed idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeach individual user will contain a subjective opinion based on the level of development, experience, case studies from life, and so on.  <b>For us, this is unique knowledge!</b>  And in case of support of a constructive subjective opinion by the majority, we receive a bell signaling that our knowledge in this particular area or on this particular problem is erroneous or simply absent.  So what prevents us from listening to expert opinion in terms of analyzing business performance? <br><br>  I will quote one of the comments to look at an example of how SIMT can help.  This comment was left to the previous article, and we are very grateful for the feedback. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand why they should fix it in the blockchain and then show all nonsense to all investors.</i>  <i>For example, the same late cook.</i>  <i>I don‚Äôt care about his labor discipline, if I were an investor in such a project, I‚Äôm primarily interested in that when a client comes to a pastry chef, he can buy a fresh and tasty cake ‚Äî that is,</i>  <i>the main thing is that the cook would cope with the work assigned to him and could get an award for it.</i>  <i>But some other investor with a single token will say that discipline needs to be fought and the cook's premium must be stripped altogether.</i>  <i>The third will support the second, but will additionally require the imposition of a fine.</i>  <i>The fourth will call the cook an incorrigible asshole and will demand his dismissal.</i>  <i>What is all this nonsense ??? "</i> <br><br>  The author of the commentary writes that the question of the freshness of the products produced is important for him.  Also, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsupporting the award of employees who do their work efficiently is clearly read.  At the same time, the author " <i>pofigu on labor discipline</i> ." <br><br>  But what is labor discipline?  Labor discipline is the conscious, conscientious fulfillment by an employee of his job duties, voluntary observance of the established procedure, timely and accurate execution of orders and instructions of the administration for work. <br><br>  What conclusion do we draw from this?  The goals voiced by the author, namely, the freshness of the products produced and the decision on awarding for the work assigned are directly related to labor discipline.  Violating labor discipline, the employee violates the duties assigned to him.  And there are no ideas or solutions to any particular problem in this comment. <br><br>  I agree that in some areas, indeed, labor discipline is not so important.  But not in the field of catering. <br><br><h3>  Case with milk </h3><br>  Using a third-party solution, the company's management has the ability to automate the warehouse.  Namely, monitor the supply, the costs of ingredients and their write-off. <br><br>  Case from the work of our experimental cafe - for 6 months we observe a situation with milk overuse.  At the same time, a trigger is set in the settings of the automated warehouse - to receive an SMS / email message if milk remains in the warehouse are less than 5 liters.  The problem we are seeing is that the actual milk residues are always less than the residues that are in stock.  The management learns that the milk ends up from a barista, and not from a system based on configured triggers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ky/vw/ye/kyvwyeej6sezy4hbdpe7pcrzilu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, it may seem that the voiced problem is related to the problem of informing the management (or the institution manager).  And of course, the problem of informing is solved quite simply.  But this case is about something else.  Case about milk overuse. <br><br>  Here are just a few reasons why overruns are possible: <br><br>  1. Barista spilled and hid this fact. <br>  2. Barista uses more milk than is prescribed in the flow chart. <br>  3. Milk consumption according to the technological card does not coincide with the consumption prescribed in the POS system. <br>  4. Personnel steal milk or use for personal purposes (for example, drinking tea with milk at work). <br><br>  Is this trifle so important?  Well, lost 5-10 liters of milk per month - in cash equivalent to 500 rubles per month.  In a year - 6000 rubles per institution.  60000 rubles for a network of 100 institutions.  And this is just milk.  And, of course, in the framework of one institution you can close your eyes to this fact.  As a last resort, write off all the problems on the barista and subtract from the sn. <br><br>  <b>The whole catering is built exactly on the little things.</b>  .  And the profitability of the catering business is very dependent on how to work with these trifles.  Our task, as people who have come to this area from different areas, with different knowledge, is to do so in order to reduce the error in the influence of trifles on business profits. <br><br>  As an IT person, I see one of the possible solutions to this problem.  It is necessary to analyze the sale of drinks with milk, enter a daily inventory of residues of the problem ingredient. <br><br>  So what should I write in SIMT? <br><br>  <i>Based on the data of my analysis (for a month) of the sale of beverages containing milk, I suggest introducing a daily inventory of milk.</i>  <i>This will reveal the fact of the influence of human factors on the overrun or inappropriate consumption of milk.</i>  <i>Daily inventory will provide an opportunity to conduct additional analysis.</i> <br><br>  How difficult is it to implement this proposal?  In one particular institution, this can be implemented the very next day.  And in a few days, the author of the idea will already have reliable data for analysis, recorded in the blockchain.  These data will help to identify the problem, or suggest a thought about the next experiment. <br><br>  The solution to a problem, found locally in an experimental institution, can be easily transmitted to the establishments of the network. <br><br><h3>  How does the data get into the blockchain? <br></h3><br>  SIMT itself does not record anything in the blockchain.  SIMT is a ‚Äúdata reader‚Äù from a distributed database.  SIMT will provide comprehensive information in a readable form.  Imagine that you have two tabs in Excel - in one heap of information, grouped by some parameter.  In another, a beautiful graph that visualizes a set of related data.  The second tab is one of the functions of SIMT.  The first tab is the blockchain (distributed database).  At the same time, along with access to SIMT, each tokenholder has access directly to the database. <br><br>  The data in the SIMT get automatically from the tools that are used for work.  The IT product, the service that we use for warehouse automation, has an API.  Like most other IT solutions.  Cloud tills will directly write data on the blockchain, and SIMT will ‚Äúdigest‚Äù and give away in a readable form. <br><br>  Another comment I would like to cite from the last article. <br><br>  <i>- About the voice system, I understand that the ideas with the majority of votes will fall on the CEO table.</i>  <i>Attention is the question, what percentage of these ideas will be implemented?</i>  <i>You can use an example to describe an approximate scheme of action.</i>  <i>Suppose the community decides that the confectionery should start producing mango muffins in the form of cats.</i>  <i>Let's say the CEO's offer arrives on the table.</i>  <i>You can consider the option of failure, and that will go to the community.</i>  <i>And the option of adopting an idea and how it will be implemented, the ‚Äútransparency‚Äù of the implementation, control of the initial idea and implementation.</i>  <i>Because you can easily make a carrot pie out of the cat-shaped mango muffin and tick off what you‚Äôve done.</i>  <i>I am interested in further work with the community after the approval of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe CEO.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  I note that at the beginning of the article the basic principles of SIMT are described and these principles do not allow us to work only to put a tick somewhere. <br><br>  On the example of the idea with a mango muffin, proposed in the comment.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãentering a new product is too generalized.  If the idea gets on the CEO table in this form, then the CEO should receive information that specifies the nature.  For example, in this particular case, a comment will be added to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãproducing mango muffins in the form of cats - ‚Äú <i>for what purpose do we plan to launch a new product?‚Äù</i>  .  One specific question.  There is nothing more to say here, because the idea itself is not supported by the analysis and arguments about why such an idea suddenly occurred to me.  Based on the response from the CEO, the user will be able to receive feedback and contribute a new idea with clarifications. <br><br>  A good example of what can be implemented is an example of a milk case idea.  After approval of this idea, the leadership imposes on the barista ext.  responsibilities, and the one who proposed the idea - receives additional, clarifying information that will be used to further analyze the problem.  Found a solution to the problem will increase the profitability of the business. <br><br>  The first article gave the opportunity to hear the opinions of people far from the production in the field of catering, but having a strong technical background.  Comments gave us the opportunity to look at your product from the side. <br><br>  The meaning of the idea and mechanisms of work will become clearer and more visible after the initial community of SIMT users begins to form.  And through comments on the articles, we get feedback that helps us develop a test concept.  Perhaps the next article will be created in the blitz question format - short questions and detailed answers for building a logical chain of connections. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348562/</a></p>
