As a result, this leads to the fact that motorists who go to Italy or Germany, trying to bypass traffic jams, arrange them on local roads.  Now local authorities <a href="https://tirol.orf.at/stories/3001188/">are trying to</a> prevent this by prohibiting transit traffic on local roads until September 14.  Information about this was transmitted to manufacturers of navigation equipment through the Ministry of the Interior.  Therefore, Reiner F√ºgenstein in the Austrian ‚ÄúMailing‚Äù mailing list <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-at/2019-June/009940.html">asks</a> the OSM community to pay attention to this and make the appropriate edits. </li><li> Michael Brendner <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-June/046186.html">proposes</a> to introduce a new tag - <code>amenity=power_supply</code> , which could mark the places where you can access (paid or free) to the electrical outlet.  In addition, his proposal includes <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/amenity%253Dpower_supply">subtags</a> that clarify various nuances: outlet type, payment, operator, power, and much more.  (Talk to <a href="http://gis.19327.n8.nabble.com/Idea-for-a-new-tag-amenity-power-supply-tt5942164.html">Nabble</a> ) </li><li>  The Australian cartographer directly examined the banks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwydir_River">Gvidir</a> River, which he had previously remotely submitted to OSM, relying only on official sources, and <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-au/2019-June/012740.html">found</a> that in some places it was dry.  After talking with the locals, he concluded that this was due to the fact that this river was intensively used for irrigation.  Therefore, he proposes to remove most of Guidir.  Reflecting on why this river in official documents is still listed as full-flowing, he assumes that this is due to political motives and the will of the government. </li><li>  Richard Fairhurst <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/389711">talks</a> about the new features of the online editor Potlatch-2.  Now route mapping can be noticeably easier, since it is possible to assign certain relationships to function keys.  He also shares several tips in the comments on how the function keys can be used, for example, to add groups of tags. </li><li>  The user WoodWoseWulf in his diary tells <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/WoodWoseWulf/diary/382394">in some detail</a> about the world of the game Pokenom Go from Niantic from the point of view of OSM.  He shares the terms of this game, shows how OSM data affects the mechanics of the game, leads the classification of vandals-pokommoschnikov and explains their motivation, and also shows the different ways of manipulating OSM data for gaming purposes. </li></ul><br><h2>  Community </h2><br><ul><li>  Now the site OpenStreetMap transferred to.  As you probably know, this is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA">Burmese</a> - the official language in Myanmar, which is spoken by 33 million people.  Andy Allan <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1142050797431218179%3Fs%3D19">asks</a> Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1142050797431218179%3Fs%3D19">to</a> help him translate the OSM website into this language.  He wants the degree of localization to be more than 25%. </li><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1140899902748274688">Andy Allan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iandees/status/1141851336360812544">Ian Diz</a> are looking for ways to make the aggressive and destructive behavior that the OSM community sometimes displays, especially on some mailing lists and on GitHub, come to naught, and people become more affable and ready to support each other.  Ian Diz is ready to tell open source community managers about how to deal with rude manners, which are particularly common and vivid when people use anonymous communication channels. </li><li>  Do you know anyone worthy of receiving the annual OSM Awards?  Then take your time - <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2019/06/18/calling-for-nominees-for-the-openstreetmap-awards-2019/">applications</a> are accepted until July 15. </li><li>  A group of five volunteer cartographers from <a href="https://osmghana.org/">OSM communities in Ghana</a> and open source lovers <a href="https://twitter.com/Enock4seth/status/1136986639006412801">traveled</a> around Ghana as part of the Open Source Way project.  On the way, they mapped, filmed street panoramas for Mapillary, and also promoted OpenStreetMap and open source software in every possible way. </li><li>  The OSMF Council <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2019/05/09/osmf-board-face-to-face-meeting-suggest-the-topics-and-issues-that-matter-to-you/">published the</a> results of the OSM community survey, during which it was proposed to choose a topic to be discussed by the Council at the next meeting.  Christoph Hormann, in his blog, <a href="http://blog.imagico.de/on-surveying-the-surveyors/">criticizes</a> some dubious ideas and trends, and also expresses his point of view regarding the study of community opinion. </li></ul><br><h2>  OpenStreetMap Foundation </h2><br><ul><li>  We are joining <a href="https://twitter.com/josmeditor/status/1142204233422426119">the JOSM team</a> and many others who are helping to spread the <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2019/06/21/help-the-owg">announcement of the</a> OSMF Operations Team, which is now looking for volunteers.  Let us clarify that this working group is responsible for the operation of servers owned by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. </li></ul><br><h2>  Developments </h2><br><ul><li>  Kristina Karch on the mailing list of the OpenStreetMap Foundation <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2019-June/006090.html">proposes to</a> discuss where next year you can hold the conference ‚ÄúState of the Map-2020‚Äù, as this issue has not been resolved at the moment. </li><li>  The conference ‚ÄúState of the Map-2019‚Äù is not far off.  The program of this major event in the world of OSM, which will be held this year from September 21 to September 23 in the German city of Heidelberg, is posted on the official <a href="https://2019.stateofthemap.org/program/">website of</a> this conference. </li></ul><br><h2>  Humanitarian OSM </h2><br><ul><li>  On World Refugee Day - June 20 - material on joint work of the University of Oregon (USA), HOT and Development Seed to search for refugees and IDPs as a result of military conflicts or natural disasters in order to support them was <a href="https://medium.com/devseed/missing-millions-finding-the-forcibly-displaced-efed41856f16%3Fsk%3D346a53f350643bfcb3d7be02f4100286">published</a> on medium.com.  The article shows the scale of the problem and how it is solved; it also concludes that in the near future it will be possible to help even more people with the help of artificial intelligence. </li><li>  The Maptime Salzburg team (regular cartography conferences in Salzburg) <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-at/2019-June/009939.html">will hold</a> two youth workshops as part of the upcoming AGIT exhibition.  At the <a href="https://www.conftool.com/giweek2019/index.php%3Fpage%3DbrowseSessions%26amp%3Bform_session%3D65">first</a> meeting, the basics of humanitarian mapping will be discussed, at the <a href="https://www.conftool.com/giweek2019/index.php%3Fpage%3DbrowseSessions%26amp%3Bform_session%3D66">second</a> , the creation of youth cartographic clubs in European educational institutions.  Note that the youth mapping of OSM - <a href="https://www.youthmappers.org/">YouthMappers</a> - was founded by students from US universities; currently it consists of 143 branches in 41 countries. </li><li>  <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Board_Elections_2019">The nomination of</a> candidates to the council of the non-profit organization HOT ended on June 17, 2017.  8 people apply for 7 vacancies.  By decision of the organization‚Äôs organization, the number of seats in the council has been increased from 2 to 7. </li><li>  Rebecca Firth from the non-profit organization HOT <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/updates/how-map2020-mappers-use-street-level-imagery-to-tackle-humanitarian-challenges/">tells</a> how street panoramas help to make OSM more accurate, especially in regions with low quality map rendering.  In particular, panoramas provide information on waste management, road conditions and much more. </li></ul><br><h2>  Training </h2><br><ul><li>  The founders of a small online seminar <a href="https://openschoolmaps.ch/">OpenSchoolMaps</a> , implemented as part of the local OSM community in Switzerland, published a tutorial (PDF) - ‚ÄúIndependent environmental mapping‚Äù.  While it is available only in German.  It tells you how to organize a field meeting and what you need.  The authors are waiting for feedback, but it is desirable that it be framed as a problem (issue) in the Git repository. </li></ul><br><h2>  Cards </h2><br><ul><li>  Sven Geggus <a href="https://twitter.com/realgiggls/status/1143117249567428610">turned off the</a> ‚ÄúOpen Brewpub Map‚Äù, but instead started supporting a new project - the ‚Äú <a href="https://brewmap.openstreetmap.de/">Open Brewery Map</a> ‚Äù (brewery map), which is based on the <a href="https://github.com/giggls/osmpoidb">osmpoidb</a> technique. </li><li>  <a href="https://gk.historic.place/historische_objekte/translate/pt-br/index-pt-br.html">Updated</a> Portuguese version of the site Historic Place.
