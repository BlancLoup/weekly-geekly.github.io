  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The dynamics of the market for video recorders in Russia over the past few years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past few years, DVRs from the little-known electronics segment have become the main contenders for the title of the most popular automotive gadget on the Russian market.  The Russian market of video recorders has appeared capacious and rapidly developing. <br><br>  According to statistics, in 2011, 200‚Äì300 thousand DVRs were sold.  In 2012, the Russians acquired more than 900 thousand of such devices, and last year the number of DVRs sold reached 1.2 million. In 2014, the market continued to grow, but slowing down a bit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/934/57f/260/93457f260f1c39385c23ce2d77397e80.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, high demand is due to the growing car market - in Russia every year the number of cars increases by two to three million.  Also, DVRs got their popularity due to their impartiality in identifying those responsible for a particular incident on the road.  This quality of ‚Äúassistant drivers‚Äù begins to be maintained at the legislative level. <br><br>  All these factors together give us the opportunity to expect the growth of the market for DVRs in 2015.  Perhaps due to the difficult economic situation, the growth will be insignificant, but it will be.  We have dealt with the demand, and now we will move on to the offer.  And no wonder about it, with this, everything is just fine.  In the market of video recorders, Chinese and Korean manufacturers continue to set the tone. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxCUmTrJP_U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGRM5osPXCS860DyeKzm9tcHVXWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Key players in the market. </h4><br>  Russian companies, working with Asian manufacturers, as a rule, slightly modify the device.  Some companies limit themselves to ‚Äúdecorating‚Äù devices with their own label, and such as teXet and Supra prescribe software, localize the product, organize technical support and service.  Asian companies in this case act as OEM (original equipment manufacturer) manufacturers. <br><br>  The work scheme of ODM (original design manufacturer) is far from being available to many Russian companies, since it is necessary to independently develop all DVR systems, trusting the Chinese only to the assembly.  In terms of sales, umbrella brands Prestigio, Explay, Mystery occupy leading positions due to the large number of low-end models in their lines. <br><br>  They successfully compete with foreign firms DOD, Karkam, BlackVue, etc.  In addition to large umbrella brands, they strengthened their brand positions, for which the registrars are either the only one or one of a pair of activities.  Such brands have their own production and, as a rule, rely on rich functionality, high technical characteristics, new technologies and certain "chips" - for example, CANSONIC, AdvoCam, Highscreen, Mio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/689/d77/75a/689d7775aa00a7fc6f216650080bb656.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Largely due to the efforts of these companies, the segment of ‚Äúnon-budget and premium‚Äù registrars has strengthened, but we'll talk about it next time!  We will continue to monitor the emerging market of video recorders and in new articles we will share with you interesting information that will be useful to all motorists and not only. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364315/</a></p>
