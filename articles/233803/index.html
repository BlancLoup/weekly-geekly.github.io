  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a quality design with a limited budget?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often when discussing a task with a customer, having learned the cost of the project, the customer disappears, since he had completely different expectations.  The customer is looking for another designer, finds, gets a terrible result from him, all lost.  Common situation? <br><br>  I want to tell how you can make high-quality design with a limited budget. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Example.</i>  <i>The customer has a budget of 100 thousand for website design and he absolutely needs a super cool designer who would agree to make a design within this budget.</i>  <i>Suppose the customer was lucky and he found a professional designer, who estimated the work at 200 thousand rubles.</i>  <i>Two scenarios: the first is to bring down the price, the second is the search for another designer.</i> <br><br><h4>  How does the customer think? </h4><br>  This designer does not suit me, as he is expensive and I am not ready to pay so much.  If he pays less, he will work poorly or somehow.  What happens next?  The customer chooses from the remaining candidates and compares them with each other according to the criterion of price - quality.  And chooses within its budget, "acceptable" quality.  The customer is satisfied, he thinks he has saved money, the work is in full swing, but the result is not encouraging.

      Time for design ends, you need to typeset and program, as a result, they accept the option, just like at the very beginning of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù quality, just to start.  Obvious losses: time is gone, money is spent, there is no result.  At the new coil, they begin to search for a new designer, but with the same approach to the search.  History repeats itself. <br><br><h4>  What does a professional do? </h4><br>  He tries to agree to do this project within the budget of the client, but with the same quality.  You may have to sacrifice some chips, remove something or postpone it for the next iteration, but the quality remains the same.  A professional can not work somehow.  Because working poorly is unprofitable, the result is embarrassing to put in the portfolio, the reputation is spoiled, and the customer has to redo everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/a40/5fe/c23a405fefd8e49a644f53dba6313441.jpg" alt="A still from the film ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù, directed by Georges Lautner with Jean-Paul Belmondo in the lead role."><br>  <i>A still from the film ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù, directed by Georges Lautner with Jean-Paul Belmondo in the lead role.</i> <br><br>  If you pay less, the designer will work somehow - this is a fallacy.  The reality is that if a person does not know how to do something or does something somehow, then how much you do not pay him, he will not do it better, simply because he has not learned.  <i>A professional, if he embarked on a project, will not bungle, regardless of the size of the budget, since reputation is worth more.</i> <br><br><h4>  Project.  Customer.  Budget. </h4><br>  In my work I use the principle, peeped from Yana Frank.  The principle is simple and effective, it perfectly helps to make the right choice: ‚ÄúTo take or not to take an order?‚Äù.  To take when two of the three components are positive, for example: ‚ÄúAn interesting project, a good budget, but a customer is a bore.‚Äù And so in different combinations - an interesting project, an adequate customer, but a useless budget.  And do not take it when two of the three components are negative.  For example, no budget can compensate for an inadequate customer and an idiotic project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/211/f45/3c8/211f453c8391ab5a88d0f4be5e6ba995.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Not </h4><br>  When a designer tells you no or an amount you don‚Äôt count on, this is only the beginning of a negotiation.  Most customers perceive no as the final answer and leave.  They find another designer, he easily agrees to all your conditions, tells you "yes", in the end you get a disgusting result.  Such is the price of a quick "yes."  Do not leave, continue the negotiations.  If you like the work of a designer, his approach and attitude is close, why should you sacrifice quality and look for another designer? <br><br>  <i>Conclusion.</i>  <i>The professional is ready to work with a limited budget, while the quality remains unchanged.</i>  <i>The project should be interesting, and the customer adequate.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233803/</a></p>
