In it, he shared his opinion on DRM ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2">TZSAP</a> ) technologies applied in particular to music. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The letter, as Jobs writes, was a response to numerous requests to ‚Äúopen‚Äù the DRM technique used on iTunes so that the music purchased there could be heard on third-party players, not just on the iPod, and also on the iPod, music files were played, purchased in other online stores. <br><br>  The reason why this is now is exactly the case, according to Jobs, is the requirement of record companies to tighten control over digital music content as much as possible in order to keep its illegal distribution.  The Big Four (Universal, Sony BMG, Warner and EMI), which controls the rights to more than 70% of all music sold now.

      At the beginning of negotiations with these companies, Apple offered to introduce fairly soft restrictions: the music could be heard on no more than 5 computers and an unlimited number of iPods.  However, as we can see, the record labels insisted on it.  And what's more, they still continue to regularly demand improvements in the DRM system. <br><br>  But "the problem, of course, is that there are many smart people in the world, some of whom also have a lot of free time."  The FairPlay technology, with the help of which Apple protects the files sold on iTunes, is still considered to be quite reliable and so far copes with its purpose.  But is it worth it?  Therefore, <b>Steve offers three ways to further develop the situation</b> . <br><br>  <b>The first</b> way is to leave everything as it is.  A very competitive market, gigantic investments in maintaining stores and players in proper condition and constant strengthening of the DRM grip.  It will play into the hands of everyone except ... consumers.  Now Apple (by the way, unlike Microsoft and partly Sony) can allow its users to listen to unprotected files on their iPods.  But who knows if the media giants will demand that they take away this opportunity too. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> way is to license all popular DRM systems, including FairPlay, for all competing companies.  It would seem that immediately it will significantly expand the capabilities of users and give them a wide choice of music.  But in actual fact there are very serious problems.  First, the more people know the secrets of DRM, the greater the risk that they will not be able to keep them in themselves and pass them on to the pirates, who will have effective arguments of conviction.  Secondly, the fight against holes in protection systems will become much more difficult, since it is not possible to control the chaotically expanding circle of consumers.  Hence again problems for music producers. <br><br>  <b>The third</b> alternative (hold on) is to abandon DRM entirely.  Imagine a world where anyone can listen to any music on any player, wherever he bought both.  This is similar to the line from John Lennon's song, but it will undoubtedly be the best solution for consumers!  If the Quartet approves of such a path, Apple, Jobs says, will immediately switch iTunes to sales of exclusively DRM-free content. <br><br>  Why should she approve?  Very simple: <b>DRM does not work</b> .  And companies understand this, because they continue to sell 10 times more unprotected music than protected.  So why invest billions of dollars in the most difficult campaign to change this ratio in favor of DRM?  Jobs sees for the labels only positive sides, once they leave this occupation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3035/</a></p>
