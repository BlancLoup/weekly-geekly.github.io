This time this action took place in Prague on February 16 and 17.  Televisions, tablets, telephones, laptops, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and much more were presented.  Hurry to find out how it was! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12d/ac9/066/12dac9066063528baf164dde895d0183.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå Past</font> <font color="000000">achievements and future strategies</font> </h2><br>  Before showing its new products, Samsung held a press conference and told about the results achieved in 2011.  For a long time, the company sought to become the first in the market, and it succeeded: in 2011, Samsung took the largest market share in the CIS in seven product categories, while, for the first time in its history, the company approached market leadership in phones and smartphones, coming in first place in Russia.  Last year, Samsung‚Äôs sales worldwide totaled $ 143 billion.  Representatives of the company talked about what sponsorship events were held in 2011 in the CIS countries.  Among them was the ‚ÄúHope for Children!‚Äù Corporate social responsibility program.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/488/383/ab6/488383ab6279f5320c5c4cc47ad1294a.png"><br><br>  Such impressive successes could not fail to entail even more ambitious plans for the coming year: in 2012, Samsung intends to win the leadership in ALL product categories in the CIS market.  Well: good technology is not enough, is not it?  ;) And to achieve such heights of the company will help already known to us at the January exhibition <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/136184/">CES 2012</a> strategy, or rather, the philosophy, as its name is called by the representatives of the company, called <b>"Border Extension"</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b25/44a/577/b2544a57741080c415442ba9a98da008.png"><br><br>  It is planned to expand the boundaries with the help of simple and fast information exchange between any devices.  At the same time, few people will turn the language to accuse Samsung of idle talk: now the company offers a diverse range of devices interacting with each other.  For example, new cameras equipped with a Wi-Fi module can not only connect to a computer and automatically save the footage on the drives of the latter, or transfer them directly to social networks, but also use a smartphone as a viewfinder, which greatly expands the possibilities for shooting. <br><br>  Well, let's move from words to deeds. <br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Mobile devices</font> </h2><br>  Of the new phones, only the GALAXY Nexus was introduced (the official review is coming, friends).  There was also an opportunity to play with the flagship <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/118129/">GALAXY S II</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/136645/">GALAXY Note</a> .  GALAXY S III, around which so many rumors are circulating, could not be seen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b8/34c/2d2/4b834c2d2570f5def405df38fd7de54c.jpg"><br><br>  The exhibition was able to notice two new devices from the squad "tablet-like".  The GALAXY Tab 2 tablet was introduced to the attention of all comers. Inside the new 10.5 mm thick, a 7-inch PLS-screen with a resolution of 1024x600, a 1 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8, 16 or 32 GB of flash memory, a card slot are installed. microSD, 3 MP rear camera and 1.3 MP front camera, 4000 mAh battery, Bluetooth 3.0, USB 2.0 Host, Wi-Fi, A-GPS, 3G and GLONASS modules (the latter is only in 3G versions).  By the way, there is support for a USB host via an adapter cable.  Weight is only 344 g. <br>  This will be the first Samsung tablet on the Android 4.0 platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e88/193/05c/e8819305c590ce2c884b6dd692de806f.jpg"><br><br>  Also, it was possible to see the familiar to many in the early announcements of the Samsung Slate - a Windows tablet or, as the Samsung representatives say, ‚Äúa laptop in a tablet case‚Äù.  It is quite possible that such hybrids will occupy their niche in the foreseeable future: very often we hear users complaining, they say, a good device, but there would be Windows, and all the usual programs instead of the ‚Äúdubious green man‚Äù ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6aa/2f9/c67/6aa2f9c676317e62baf09d9296834f18.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Laptops</font> </h2><br>  The most seductive novelty in this segment was the 9-series ultra-thin notebook line in aluminum cases.  Samsung representatives say that 33 thousand man-hours were spent on the development of these premium devices: 9 thousand for creating sketches and layouts and 24 thousand for research and development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/462/c6a/f0d/462c6af0d306908e28174322a4b9e15d.jpg"><br><br>  The forum featured two models of the second generation of the top Samsung Series 9 laptops: 13.3-inch and 15-inch.  A detailed and colorful review of their predecessor (model 2011), entitled <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/129218/">‚ÄúEverything is serious‚Äù</a> , we already presented to the court of Habravchan last fall.  Both models are impressive in their thickness: 12.9 and 14.9 mm with a mass of 1.16 and 1.56 kg, respectively.  This did not affect the power due to the use of SSD-drives and processors Core i5 and Core i7.  They need only ten seconds to boot the system and less than one and a half seconds to exit from sleep.  Unfortunately, in each barrel of honey no, no, and a portion of tar will get into: for the sake of minimum thickness of laptops, developers were forced to embed mini versions of VGA and LAN ports.  To work with them, the user will not be able to do without the appropriate adapters. <br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Televisions</font> </h2><br>  It's time to turn to one of the most important areas of activity of Samsung Electronics - the TV segment.  No wonder the company has been the world leader in this niche for 7 years.  The presentation again described in detail the concept of Smarter Life implemented on Samsung TVs, which will be developed in three directions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64a/7d8/a8e/64a7d8a8e837b19ddccdd31dfb8aef08.png"><br><br>  <b>Smart Interaction</b> - The Samsung ES8000, ES7000 and E8000 flagship TVs are equipped with an HD camera and two directional microphones, so you can control them with gestures or voice without using the remote.  At the moment, 26 gestures and voice control in 30 languages, including Russian, are available to users.  Moreover, now the smart TV has a face recognition function, which is designed to simplify the process of authorization in social networks, for example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b28/502/8da/b285028da94965fa50c93a5c4b670c61.png"><br><br>  <b>Smart Content</b> - Smart TV applications that are available on Smart Hub on company TVs.  At the moment, in the CIS market, Samsung offers about 300 applications, 40 of which are created by local developers.  Also in the clip Smart Content includes AllShare technology, which allows you to send and store content from a smartphone in the "cloud" and download it to your TV.  Now AllShare works exclusively through the synchronization service SugarSync, however, in the near future, Samsung plans to add support for the more popular DropBox and SkyDrive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a5/af3/d27/2a5af3d27cd9b9523d48f29a721d4d9e.png"><br><br>  Samsung is completing its plans for developing Smart TV this year with an initiative called <b>Smart Evolution</b> .  It is, without exaggeration, a very non-standard solution for updating TVs.  Owners of models with support for the Samsung Evolution Kit, which include all the same ES8000, ES7000 and E8000, in 2013 will be able to upgrade both their software and hardware.  Carrying out such an original upgrade by installing a special module, and, as Samsung representatives say, is very simple and can be done at home. <br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Photo equipment</font> </h2><br>  Samsung cameras also acquired new features and interesting functionality.  The main innovation is the work with Wi-Fi-networks.  Now the camera is able to immediately upload the captured images to photo hosting servers and social networks.  In addition, there is another non-standard way to link the camera and mobile phone, using it as a viewfinder.  The bundle works through the Remote ViewFinder application: so far only for Android devices.  In the foreseeable future, Samsung promises to make a version of the program under other operating systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/963/c79/7ae/963c797ae72d7e108f4901125d3da3f6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Audio / Video</font> </h2><br>  At the stands, you could see and hear docking stations designed for use with mobile phones and tablets.  You can connect your gadget to the docking station in two ways: through a special connector or by air (AirPlay, AllShare, Bluetooth).  In the audio systems applied technology hybrid tube amplification.  For radio tubes in the model DA-E750 even made a small transparent window in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/609/783/6a8/6097836a8355210e9c7fd27d52abacab.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="111111">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Household appliances</font> </h2><br>  At one of the stands, Navibot S. was actively crawling and collecting sham-like washer. The robot cleaner - well, just a blue dream of every ... modern person, is equipped with a navigation system that helps him to map the premises and create routes, with a memory that makes him not vacuum the same place twice and a special object recognition system.  It remains only to teach the gadget to distinguish between garbage and dust from coins and necessary small things - then there will be no price at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ada/e4a/dad/adae4adad077c4d66098359c2570df7e.jpg"><br><br>  Another no less interesting product was the O'table portable induction panel.  This is the world's first portable induction stove with one hob.  Equipped with lighting, security system, residual heating indicator, auto-boiling system and keeping the temperature at the same level.  The maximum power plate is 2200 watts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9e/5b6/60a/d9e5b660ac070e566a1255285b0cc4d8.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the products described above, the exhibition featured printers, refrigerators, washing machines and a touchscreen tablet-tablet Samsung SUR40 with Microsoft Surface 2.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/928/f5a/36a/928f5a36a14eeaf9f78b72890780e7dd.jpg"><br><br>  We look forward to new events and hot announcements from Samsung.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138644/</a></p>
