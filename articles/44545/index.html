  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The face of Volgograd on the Internet or how competitions are held</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The city of Volgograd has an official website: <a href="http://www.volgadmin.ru/">www.volgadmin.ru</a> <br>  This site is the face of the city on the web, solves serious information problems.  The site contains a huge amount of information. <br><br>  The site design should embody the great historical past of the city, show its life and prospects, be convenient for the citizens and for the city administration. <br>  Site design is important for citizens. <br><br>  At the beginning of autumn 2008, the administration of Volgograd announced a competition for the best new design of the informational portal of Volgograd volgadmin.ru. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It would seem that such a serious question should be discussed with the public of the city, the problems that the new design of the site is intended to solve should be identified and formulated.  There was no public discussion on this topic.

      The competition was not conducted through the system of public procurement or municipal order, that is, there were no formal criteria and a transparent selection procedure.  Who and how selects?  Unclear. <br><br>  The composition of the jury was again announced, which in general is nonsense for such events. <br>  The official announcement of the competition and its conditions can be found here: <a href="http://www.volgadmin.ru/ru2/Information/Claims.aspx%3Fids%3D8">www.volgadmin.ru/ru2/Information/Claims.aspx?ids=8</a> <br><br>  Among other things, the announcement says that: <br>  1st prize - 18 thousand rubles <br>  The prize winner, who is awarded the 1st prize, also gets the right <br>  to conclude an agreement with MU "GIC" (city information center) for the development of html-templates for the main and thematic pages of the new version of the portal. <br><br>  It should be understood that the price of a municipal contract for the development of a portal design will not be at all 18 thousand rubles, but tens and hundreds of times more. <br><br>  What is MU GIZ?  This is a municipal institution, which since 1999 has been coordinating the entire information policy of the city. <br><br>  In the middle of 2008, its permanent director of the State Educational Center, Elena Mikhailovich Ogol, was dismissed from the post by the head of the city, and a certain Folomeev, Yury Anatolyevich, was appointed to replace her. <br>  Mention of Elena Ogol and her work as a director of the GIC are given here: <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%2B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%26stpar2%3D%252Fh1%252Ftm693%252Fs2%26stpar1%3D%252Fu0">yandex.ru/yandsearch?text=%D0%B3%D0BB%</a> D1%86+DDBB% D0%B3%D0BE%D0%BB <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%2B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%26stpar2%3D%252Fh1%252Ftm693%252Fs2%26stpar1%3D%252Fu0">% D1% 8C &amp; stpar2 =% 2Fh1% 2Ftm693% 2Fs2 &amp; stpar1 =% 2Fu0</a> <br>  If to summarize and summarize, Elena Mikhailovna at her post worked a lot and well, enjoyed serious prestige, was an arbitrator in many matters and a completely unbiased figure. <br><br>  But information about the new director on the site GIC: <a href="http://gic.volgadmin.ru/structure.htm">gic.volgadmin.ru/structure.htm</a> <br><br>  Who is Yuri Folomeev?  Where did this man come from? <br>  Several simple queries in Yandex allow us to establish that, until very recently, he supervised one of the Volgograd web studios. <br>  Studio Mechanical Frog. <br>  <a href="">www.volgograd.ru/catalog/m_frog.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://pulset.ru/usl/find13_1u.php%3Fid%3D81090%26typeusl%3D18">pulset.ru/usl/find13_1u.php?id=81090&amp;typeusl=18</a> <br><br>  The jury of the annual contest of the Electronic Volgograd sites, traditionally including the director of the GIC and its employees, will look strange.  Will Yuri Folomeev be represented on both sides, both as a participant and as a judge? <br><br>  Let's go back to the competition.  Results summed up and officially published: <br>  <a href="http://www.volgadmin.ru/ru2/Information/Claims2.aspx">www.volgadmin.ru/ru2/Information/Claims2.aspx</a> <br><br>  The winning design work anyone can evaluate on their own.  In my opinion, the design level of works of winners is extremely low.  No thinking through the real use of design for site design, no sensible navigation.  Try to imagine how the information that is on volgadmin.ru now will be placed on any of these designs? <br><br>  Let's look at the winners. <br>  The first place was taken by a certain IP Popov Alexey Alekseevich.  Who is this? <br><br>  I allowed myself an experiment that can still be repeated (I think that after the tenth ring the studio will take precautions). <br>  I called the studio Mfrog, which until mid-2008 was headed by the current director of the MU GIC, conducting the competition and introduced himself as the customer.  After short negotiations, I agreed to cooperate and requested an agreement. <br>  The contractor is listed as IP Popov Alexey Alekseevich. <br><br>  Was the competition accidentally announced shortly after the appearance of a new director? <br>  Is the strange form of the competition random? <br>  Why are so few professionals taking part in the competition? <br>  Are the winners fair? <br><br>  And it would not be so offensive if the work of a certain studio close to the newly appointed head of the MU GITS deservedly won first place. <br><br>  But this primitive will now be the face of Volgograd in the global information network. <br>  Citizens of Russia and foreigners who want to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city cannot be explained that such a design is simply a consequence of a more than strange competition. <br>  After all, the subsequent development and development of the official site of Volgograd at all times will now be carried out at the expense of the city budget by a company actually owned by the head of the MU GIC of Volgograd Yury Folomeev. <br><br>  Draw your own conclusions, big or small money will be spent on a new design.  We don't know that yet.  Only now, quite recently, on television, there was a report about the wonderful mayor of the city N, who stole several million rubles on the creation of a city site.  Is history repeating itself in Volgograd ?! <br><br>  And maybe on such a sensitive issue as the official city information site is it worth to know the opinion of citizens?  It is not for nothing that the format of public hearings, which are held on projects for the construction of significant urban areas, was invented. <br>  Even a simple discussion on the Internet on the basis of the same volgadmin.ru or any of the portals, the forum - and that would be better. <br><br>  Yes, by the way, the composition of the commission is not known to anyone.  On the sidelines they say that the ‚Äúbest‚Äù design was chosen personally by the head of the city of Volgograd Roman Grebennikov. <br><br>  So what do you think about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44545/</a></p>
