In fact, there are other types of systems, they can be called entry-level video glasses.  They also demonstrate virtual reality, but the display is not your own, using the phone's screen.  In most cases, the entire relatively modern iPhone model range is supported, starting with the iPhone 5S and ending with the iPhone 7, plus phones on Android OS. <br><br>  In general, if you do not have a VR headset yet, but there is a smartphone and you want to see and try what virtual reality is, check out our selection (and also <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/282474/">our article</a> on how VR is changing the XXX industry).  Perhaps a selection of video glasses that we are publishing today will help you take the plunge, the last one before full immersion in virtual and augmented reality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Fibrum pro </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzAIjkVjzhs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In these glasses of virtual reality, as in all the others from the selection, a smartphone is used instead of the display.  The device is easily worn on the head and does not cause inconvenience.  We like the special mounting system in them, which provides ventilation of the smartphone.  As a result, there is no overheating of the helmet and fogging of the lenses.  The device has its own application (Google Play, Appstore or Windows Phone Store).

      Compatible glasses with a large number of smartphone models with a display size from 4 to 6 inches.  Mobile OS is supported by any: IOS, Android, Windows Phone.  Technology head-track allows you to get easy navigation in any of the applications of virtual reality. <br><br>  Together with the glasses, the user gets the opportunity to ride a roller coaster, wander through the underground labyrinths or watch a 3D movie. <br><br>  <b>Fibrum Pro Features</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Materials: ABS plastic, glass; </li><li>  Lenses: 30 mm, auto-focus; </li><li>  Viewing angle: 110 ¬∞; </li><li>  Color: black and blue; </li><li>  Size: 100 x 145 x 80 mm; </li><li>  Weight: 120 g; </li><li>  Compatibility: support for any smartphones based on iOS, Android, Windows Phone with a screen size from 4.5 to 5.5 inches (recommended settings) and from 4 to 6 inches (possible settings). </li></ul><br>  These glasses are sold in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/shlem-virtualnoy-realnosti-fibrum/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">our store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Google Cardboard by Minkanak </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54e/a6a/ce0/54ea6ace033127b70f6f58088e37ab5a.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  The most basic and universal model of cardboard headsets.  Its developer is MINKANAK, which already offers the second version of such a system.  It is suitable for use with most phones, where the display size is not more than 6 inches.  All functions work on both iOS and Android devices. <br><br>  There are quite large lenses, the size of which is 37 mm.  According to the developer, this provides a more complete immersion in a virtual environment (of course, to the extent that this is possible when working with a smartphone). <br><br>  Users who have tried the system say that it is quite convenient.  The kit includes several optional accessories, including an NFC tag.  Such headset is on sale in several places, <a href="https://goo.gl/1rnALn">including Amazon</a> . <br><br><h3>  Xiaomi Mi VR Play </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/651/f9f/a65/651f9fa65f0bd828f54be4fcab5caf7b.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  The company Xiaomi and the Swiss, and the reaper, and the dude the igrets.  They produce a large number of various gadgets, from fitness bracelets to copters.  The Chinese decided to produce and sell more video sets, which, I must say, turned out quite comfortable. <br><br>  They are versatile and suitable for almost any phone with a diagonal from 4.7 to 5.7 inches. <br><br>  The cost is traditionally low for gadgets from Xiaomi.  You can buy, for example, in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-vr-play/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">catalog Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Carl Zeiss VR One GX </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eee/28f/6cd/eee28f6cd0b9ae4683c4606c79924298.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  Most video glasses where smartphones are used are a body and a pair of lenses.  In Carl Zeiss decided to go further (much further) than usual, having built in high-quality optics, which gives the feeling of almost complete immersion in virtual reality.  This, of course, is not an Oculus Rift and similar devices, but close to that. <br><br>  In addition, the manufacturer has built a magnetic touch panel that allows you to control the application without getting the smartphone from the plastic tab.  Here it is worth remembering that if you have an iPhone 6 Plus, then you need not this model, but a larger system - VR One Plus. <br><br>  As for the price, here it is higher when compared with all other devices of this type.  On Amazon Carl Zeiss, the VR One GX is <a href="https://goo.gl/Gkrg0m">priced at 120 euros</a> . <br><br><h3>  VR Box 2.0 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emXY7StwZhs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  These virtual reality glasses are the golden mean in terms of price / quality.  Excellent build quality and a high degree of compatibility with most smartphones - this is what VR Box 2.0 represents.  The viewing angle here is 95-100 degrees.  Aspherical lenses, they can be adjusted in width, as well as adjust the sharpness under the eyes of any user. <br><br>  The smartphone is inserted into a special tray, where it is securely fixed.  There is also an opening for the camera in glasses - it should be used in games and applications that work with augmented reality.  On the sides of the device - connectors for headphones, charging cable and other devices. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Signal source: smartphone </li><li>  Built-in headphones: no </li><li>  Compatibility: iOS or Android device with dimensions of no more than 16 x 8.2 x 1 cm </li></ul><br>  By the way, the complete set also includes a joystick that controls the functions of glasses without physical contact with them.  It's comfortable. <br><br>  VR Box 2.0 is for sale in many places, in Russia - <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/vr-box-2-0/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">in the Madrobots store</a> . <br><br><h3>  View-Master DLX VR </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b74/984/850/b74984850a31dd6e797073f8c94ca061.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  This headset is optimized for the iPhone, although it also works with Android.  There is support for headphones, plus, according to the manufacturer, there are excellent lenses.  About the quality of the View-Master DLX VR can say that this is the first VR headset, which is sold in Apple stores. <br><br>  This is the first generation of video headsets from Mattel, but as far as you can understand, the glasses turned out to be excellent.  Everything is configured here - both the location of the lenses and the belt configuration.  The mask is fixed securely, does not cause discomfort. <br><br>  Now sold on <a href="https://goo.gl/xWuQt1">Amazon at a price of 27.95 euros</a> . <br><br><h3>  Yesvr </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m6f1xS_DU0s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another universal VR headset that allows you to view videos, play or work with specialized applications.  The body here is plastic, the diameter of the lenses is 30 mm.  Everything is regulated - there are no problems even if the user has vision problems. <br><br>  The device is compatible with the widest mobile range of iPhone, Android OS or WP devices.  Supported devices with OS Android 4.1 and above or iPhone 4 and above. <br><br>  You can buy YesVR virtual reality glasses in many places, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/ochki-virtualnoy-realnosti-yesvr/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">including the Madrobots store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Freefly vr </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e67/450/21a/e6745021a580e413f9c9dc71b54ba573.jpg" width="900"><br><br>  Video headset FreeFly VR looks, frankly, unusual.  There are a lot of possibilities, including a wireless Bluetooth controller, compatibility with Andoid and iOS devices, and a viewing angle of 120 degrees.  The device works with smartphones from 4.7 to 6.1 inches.  The lenses in the headset are biconvex, diameter - 41 mm, diopter power +27.  The weight of the device is only 295 grams. <br><br>  Joystick well thought out.  There are several function buttons that can be used when working with ordinary applications, and in games.  You can customize the buttons on your own. <br><br>  The headset has full compatibility with any Google Cardboard content.  Interestingly, the Europeans were developing this headset, not the Chinese. <br><br>  The cost of the device is 39 euros, you can buy on <a href="https://goo.gl/63nTTJ">Amazon</a> . <br><br><h3>  Homido v1 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/790/563/f5c/790563f5c123001411e6db24fd56fb10.jpg" alt="image" width="900"><br><br>  Another, the last for today option of virtual reality glasses, which are compatible with all smartphones with a diagonal display from 4 to 5.7 inches.  As in the previous versions, here you can watch movies in 3D, play games or even broadcast your gameplay to the network by connecting a gamepad. <br><br>  In this model there is the possibility of fine-tuning individual parameters of the gadget.  So glasses can also be used by children by adjusting a small distance between lenses and people with problematic vision, for example, patients with astigmatism. <br><br>  Glasses have their own Homido Center app, available to both Google Play users and the App Store. <br><br>  Where can one buy?  In Russia, these glasses can be purchased from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/shlem-virtualnoy-realnosti-homido/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">Madrobots</a> .  Why go far :) <br><br>  In general, we can say that headsets for virtual reality, including those that work with smartphones, continue to be improved.  Manufacturers have long taken into account the problems of gadgets, which were not too successful, and try to release systems to the market without obvious flaws and with additional features like improved optics or a wireless controller.  After getting acquainted with the listed devices, you can already try full immersion into the world of virtual reality with the help of <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/htc-vive-pre/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">HTC Vive</a> , or Oculus Rift ( <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/oculus-rift/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses">pre-order</a> ). <br><br>  In any case, there is something to choose from.  The number of models of VR headsets is already in the tens.  We indicated the best models in this compilation, but, of course, there are more good systems in general.  We also offer to share in the comments opinion about those VR headsets that you have already used or continue to use. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvrglasses"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402317/</a></p>
