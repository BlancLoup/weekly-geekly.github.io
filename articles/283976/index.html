  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copy trading on eToro, TraderGlobal, Myfxbook, Zulu</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the last six months, I am interested in copy-trading, because  There is no particular time to engage in self-trading in forex, this should be devoted to my trading style many hours a day. <br><br>  So, if we consider the main proposals on the platforms for copy-trading (social trading), we can dwell on several platforms, the difference between them in some aspects is very significant. <br><br>  If you are a copyist like me, then platforms like ZuluTrade or Etoro can hit by the number of bloatsets, complex filters, and the number of participants is huge, which is good, there is always someone to attach to.

      In Zulu, it is somewhat embarrassing that traders from different brokers trade there, this makes some kind of chaos, because if Zulu was previously integrated with MT4, and I knew that this particular trader was sitting behind his MT4, and everything is OK, now when MetaQuotes banned Zulu, they are forced to go directly to the Zulu platform and trade in an unusual platform.  In this regard, platforms like Etoro, TraderGlobal, Myfxbook seem to be much more systemic, everything is simple there, one broker is one platform. <br><br>  In Etoro, you can get a bit lost in the abundance of traders from different countries, TraderGlobal - mostly Russian-speaking contingent, and in the general chat, you can immediately talk with the trader.  In Zulu, I did not find this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my opinion, an important point when a general chat forms the social network itself.  But in Etoro there is a display of the tape as in Twitter, with hashtags and other things, but this is an amateur twitter for teenagers, in my opinion.  In Mirrortrader, traders are a good filter, but a very annoying design with a pretense to an institutional platform, and the ‚Äútraders‚Äù are mostly anonymous, if not robots, signals. <br><br>  In TraderGlobal, unlike other large networks / platforms, the news feed is a more or less serious set of articles, analysts from the traders themselves, but there are not enough elements like Vkontakte or Facebook to repost, etc. <br><br>  From the point of view of the profitability of providers, ranking, everything changes very dynamically; one can‚Äôt say that more profitable traders to certain sites.  I copy trades at several sites, while I am constantly present in the TraderGlobal chat, and I do technical analysis on the MT4 platform, which serves me as an analysis tool.  There are no normal tools in social trading platforms yet. <br><br>  With regard to the settings for copying transactions, Zulu and TraderGlobal (not sure about Etoro) have an interesting possibility of backing up transactions, i.e.  If you see, as it often happens, negative dynamics, or expect its inevitability, then simply choose this option.  It may seem strange, but I did it and do not regret it). <br><br>  In Zulu and TraderGlobal, you can also select specific pairs for which to copy, while only in Zulu can you set specific time ranges for copying (such selective distrust to the provider).  Design, display of open positions, the history of the platforms is different.  Zulu, etoro is a bit cumbersome, TraderGlobal and myfxbook are minimalistic. <br><br>  In general, there is a variety on the market, as well as a field not plowed in terms of a detailed analysis of platforms, including, for example, from the point of view of commissions for copying. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283976/</a></p>
