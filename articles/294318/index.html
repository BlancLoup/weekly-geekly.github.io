    <h4>  2) If possible, leave work in the office. </h4><br>  In the modern world, in which e-mail and working documentation are in one click away from you, it is not so easy to rest and completely get away from work at the end of a busy day.  But it is simply necessary to rest from work in your free time - this will help you recuperate and maintain clarity of mind. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  3) Make a schedule for your holiday. </h4><br>  Usually we put our free time at the end of the list of priorities.  But it is also useful for him to draw up a schedule and to treat him with the same responsibility with which you approach your work commitments. <br><br><h4>  4) Do not give in to guilt. </h4><br>  Sometimes things do not go as we would like, and we start working until late at night or have to tell our family and friends that we cannot attend with them at some event, although we would really like to.  And spending time with guilt in these unavoidable circumstances, we only exhaust ourselves and cannot concentrate energy on our main priorities. <br><br><h4>  5) In the evening, turn off the computer. </h4><br>  Turn off the electronics as soon as it becomes possible, and do not take it with you to the bedroom.  Keep it away from your resting space - it will help you not to be distracted and rest more effectively without the prospect of being woken up by the sound of an incoming email-notification or SMS. <br><br><h4>  6) Watch your health. </h4><br>  Such simple things as regular drinking of water throughout the day and a balanced diet will provide you with productivity in all areas of your life. <br><br><h4>  7) Do not do several things at once. </h4><br>  Although we all think that we can cope with several tasks at the same time, but research shows that multitasking actually reduces our productivity.  Allocating time to solve one specific task will ultimately make your work more efficient. <br><br><h4>  8) Rest. </h4><br>  It is important to find time away from your duties.  Even a long weekend spent at home will give you the opportunity to relax and fill you with new forces. <br><br><h4>  9) Rely on your loved ones. </h4><br>  Each of us needs family and friends who understand our goals and needs and can support us.  Although a request for help is not always easy, knowing your limits and the need for support will help you balance your priorities. <br><br><h4>  10) Understand that the perfect balance between work and personal life is just an illusion. </h4><br>  Finally, despite the fact that we are working to achieve a balance of work and rest, it is very important to come to the understanding that it is impossible to keep them in perfect balance all the time.  Awareness of this will help you avoid stress when the balance is lost, and prevent convulsive attempts to achieve the initially impossible goal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294318/</a></p>
