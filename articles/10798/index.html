Technology modestly named id Tech 5, allows you to use textures of ANY volume in future games without sacrificing performance.  Full support for Windows, MacOS X, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms should provide this technology with a good future - which is emphasized by the modest title (invented by id Software itself) ‚Äúthe first true technology for the new generation platforms‚Äù. <br>  id Tech 5 was shown as part of the report by Stephen Jobs at the 2007 Worldwide Developers Conference. Jobs demonstrated the track from the racing arcade running on the Macintosh running MacOS X. The level completely consisted of unique textures totaling 20 GB. <br>  With the help of special tools, artists working with id Tech 5 are free to change the world at the level of individual pixels, and their actions will not affect performance.  In addition to the easy-to-use editor, id promises equally fast work with highly detailed open and closed spaces. <br>  The new top-secret project from the Doom authors, of course, will use id Tech 5. In addition, the studio is already accepting applications for the purchase of licenses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Aristocracy garbage</strong> <br>  About "normal heroes" (always go around!) A lot of ballads were made and a lot of games were made.  However, not everyone still wants to be a good knight on a snow-white horse rescuing a princess.  For the "abnormal" renegades, Firefly Studios is working with the help of the young publisher Gamecock Media.  It is thanks to the efforts of these wonderful people in the next year should appear role-playing game Dungeon Hero, tells about the heroic adventures at the bottom of the sewers, catacombs and dungeons.  The developers set themselves the task to realistically show the life of goblins, imps, trolls and other reptiles.  Having made friends with the ghouls, the hero will be able to live with them side by side, trade, help them ... If any frostbitten troll gets you across the road ... Well, the heroic skills in Dungeon Hero allow you to solve such problems. <br>  The release of the game is planned both on the PC and on the Xbox 360 console. <br><br>  <strong>Spies like us</strong> <br>  Sony Online Entertainment Corp. officially announced The Agency spy multiplayer action game for PC and PlayStation 3. <br>  The plot of The Agency tells about the confrontation of two spy organizations of the near future: Unite and Paragon.  Enrolling in one of the ‚Äúfirms‚Äù, the player performs basic and side missions, earns rewards, experience, titles, and sooner or later leaves the alma mater in order to create his own office. <br>  Missions at The Agency are deployed in locations where only a player and his teammates can enter (no more than four people in total).  Whenever someone goes on a mission, the game creates for him a unique copy of this part of the world.  The authors promise to arrange exciting battles, saturated not only with shooting from various types of weapons (from pistols to sniper rifles), but also with spectacular episodes such as a shooting range on wheels or a car crashing into a helicopter. <br>  The approach to character development at The Agency used a simple, but giving the opportunity to try all the content without creating new alter-ego: all skills depend on the clothes that were put on at this moment.  Changing uniforms, depending on the purpose of each particular mission, it will be possible to increase the stealth capabilities, increase the chances of survival of your own ward and comrades in an open fight or disguise themselves as other characters.  The role of local pets will be performed by NPC operatives, who extract the information about the location of their opponents via satellite or important details about the upcoming mission from the boss player's light hand. <br>  The Agency‚Äôs ultimate goal is to create a virtual world where spyware firms (analogue of guilds from fantasy MMORPGs), managed by users, are fighting for territory.  The authors call this war "World Domination Mode".  Questions about the compatibility of PC-and PS3-versions, distribution models and possible methods of payment are still open.

      <strong>Genius of the place</strong> <br>  The official confirmation of the imminent release of the new part of the urban development series SimCity had just happened, as the details of the future project fell from Electronic Arts and Tilted Mill Entertainment ... <br>  Since the new SimCity is subtitled Societies, developers are focusing on social management of citizens.  ‚ÄúWhen we began to think about the direction in which the SimCity series should develop, we wondered why some cities are perceived differently than others.  For example, what is the difference between Paris and Mecca?  Or Oxford and Munich?  Or San Francisco and Salt Lake City?  - says Rod Humble, vice president of Electronic Arts, in charge of the company's ‚ÄúSim-line‚Äù.  - The sensations are clearly influenced by local culture and society.  So we found that by focusing on the driving forces within the community, you can create many dissimilar, amazing places. ‚Äù <br>  By adjusting the balance of the six ‚Äúsocial flows‚Äù (such as, say, wealth or obedience), gamers will be able to determine the atmosphere and appearance of the city.  So, the mayor, who rests on humility, will achieve the appearance of security cameras on the streets and buildings, and the metropolis itself will acquire a totalitarian look.  In order for the player to always know what is happening in his land, SimCity Societies will generate current goals for him within the framework of his chosen course, and residents will respond with decisions from above.  SimCity Societies will award the virtual mayor with new building types and other bonuses for fulfilling the goals.  This is important when you consider that at the beginning of the game only 15% of the buildings are available.  The authors consider this type of gameplay more interesting than a set of ready-made missions. <br><br>  <strong>Pristavochnikov will call</strong> <br>  Microsoft has taken another step towards world domination.  According to the signed agreements with the publisher Ubisoft, the Xbox 360 will get one of the most popular and popular multiplayer brands - America's Army. <br>  Supergame, created with the direct support of the US Department of Defense, will be released on Xbox 360 this September under the name America's Army: True Soldier.  The project is being developed by the publisher‚Äôs own studio, Red Storm Entertainment, which recently completed work on the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 project. A new game about the everyday work of American soldiers will be made on the engine of the latter. <br><br>  - when creating news materials used sites <br>  <a href="http://www.ag.ru/">www.ag.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.dtf.ru/">www.dtf.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10798/</a></p>
