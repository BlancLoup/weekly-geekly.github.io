     <a href="http://budgetapps.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e83/357/687/e833576871bf4e9e94ebb90d8f7ec7b0.png"></a> <br><br>  The data is very different.  These are data on budgets, data on audit organizations, public debt, government reserves and much more. <br><br>  Well, it turned out that my name is Ivan Begtin and I am a member of the jury of this competition. <br><br>  All of them are on the link on the website of the Ministry of Finance - <a href="http://minfin.ru/ru/opendata/">http://minfin.ru/ru/opendata/</a> <br>  And a lot of budget data is on the Single portal of the budget system - <a href="http://budget.gov.ru/data/opendata">http://budget.gov.ru/data/opendata</a> there is a budget structure in CSV format, the data itself, reference books and much, much more.  As well as data on all official institutions here <a href="http://bus.gov.ru/public/opendata.html">http://bus.gov.ru/public/opendata.html</a> .  Pay special attention to this resource.  There indicators, budgets, charters and many other things are published for each state organization and municipal institution in Russia.  If you conceive any regional project, then these data will be invaluable. <br><br>  This does not mean that it is impossible to use any other data, certainly it is possible and necessary, however, since this is a contest of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, it is certainly expected that other data will be used along with this. <br><br>  I personally think that you should not be limited to only those data that have already been translated into a machine-readable form.  There is also data that can be turned into open data by yourself. <br>  Many people can write parsers, but for those who have not done this before, good support can be ScraperWiki ( <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">https://scraperwiki.com/</a> ) to collect information from the pages, as well as different libraries for parsing Excel files, extracting tables from PDF documents - using <a href="https://pdftables.com/">pdftables.com</a> or Abbyy services or their Abbyy Finereader. <br><br>  On the website and other resources of the Ministry of Finance, in addition to data, there are many other interesting things that can be turned into data.  Starting just from the news that has become particularly relevant in recent days, continuing with everything else. <br><br><h2>  Historical budgets </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a huge direction in the discovery of data that we have so long missed - this is the direction of historical data.  Those that are stored in the archives in the form of large volumes of reference books with a myriad of tables and which are simply necessary at the moment when we begin to refer to the history, referring to the facts, creating special projects dedicated to any event. <br><br>  In the very next few days, the first scanned budgets of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union will be published.  A little later, but also very soon, all scanned budgets of the Russian Empire, the USSR and the RSFSR will appear, which only exist. <br><br>  In addition to scans, the data itself will be published, converted into Excel and CSV tables, reconstructed from the reference books in the primary form and put in order by us for subsequent visualization or project. <br><br>  Frankly, if I were not a member of the jury of this competition, I would personally make a special project on this data.  Or maybe I'll do it again when the contest is over, or maybe someone will do it before me. <br>  Already prepared are budget budget data for several years, both primary data obtained from the texts of books, and processed and compared for different years. <br><br>  Therefore, the historical data is about to be soon, but for now you can start using the available ones and look at the public project ‚ÄúHistorical materials‚Äù ( <a href="http://istmat.info/statistics">istmat.info</a> ) where many of the budget reference books of the USSR and the Russian Empire are collected. <br><br><h2>  Where to find more data? </h2><br>  What additional data sources do we have. <br><ol><li>  Hub of open data - <a href="http://hubofdata.ru/">hubofdata.ru</a> non-state register of open data supported by NP ‚ÄúInformation Culture‚Äù.  A lot of things, more than 5000 arrays of data, but everything is unofficial. </li><li>  The data of the Federal Treasury - <a href="http://roskazna.ru/opendata/">http://roskazna.ru/opendata/</a> </li><li>  Web Services of the Central Bank of Russia - <a href="http://cbr.ru/scripts/Root.asp">http://cbr.ru/scripts/Root.asp a</a> lot of interesting data on Russian finance. </li><li>  The open data portal of Russia - <a href="http://data.gov.ru/">http://data.gov.ru/</a> its advantage is that it aggregates a lot of Russian and not only data. </li><li>  World Bank data - where there is also information about Russia <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">http://data.worldbank.org/</a> </li><li>  UN data - <a href="http://data.un.org/">http://data.un.org/</a> </li></ol><br><br>  And much more. <br>  I know that many use data from Wikipedia and DBPedia, someone collects them himself, and who comes up with something of their own. <br><br><h2>  What can be done? </h2><br>  First and foremost, these are projects for the clarity of public finances.  To visualize how the budget or public debt is arranged, or some particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãfinance. <br><br>  Secondly, of course, an infinite number of projects can be done on data from bus.gov.ru. <br><br>  Want to make a registry of hospitals and compare them?  They are all there. <br>  Want to compare all public universities?  And they are all there. <br>  Want to make a map of the availability of public services and such data is there. <br>  Want to visualize the budgets of MSU, St. Petersburg State University, MEPI, MIREA or any of your favorite university?  And it is possible. <br><br>  And according to historical data, it is easy to even visualize them and compare them with what it was and what it is now - this is already a big and interesting task. <br><br><h2>  Why do you need it? </h2><br>  In addition to the opportunity to get quite a material prize, and the prize fund is 400 thousand rubles, of course, this is not all.  If the project turns out to be good and interesting, of course, it will be mentioned on the website of the Ministry of Finance and this in itself is an additional advertisement for any good project. <br><br><h2>  How to participate? </h2><br>  The competition began on December 23rd and its website is located at <a href="http://www.budgetapps.ru/">www.budgetapps.ru</a> .  There is a description, several nominations.  A description of how the jury will work and more.  Look, think, and of course ask me questions.  I will answer here and or directly email me - <a href="">ibegtin@infoculture.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247117/</a></p>
