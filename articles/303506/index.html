  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creation of e-sports organization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Good day to all who decided to spend a couple of minutes of their time reading this blog.  For more than 15 years I have been following the cybersport community with varying success, then falling out, now joining back into the community.  It seems to me that it‚Äôs impossible to leave eSports, it‚Äôs just like a drug.  He who has known the adrenaline of unforgettable victories and the all-embracing emptiness of defeat understands me perfectly. </p><br><p><img src="https://pp.vk.me/c630124/v630124991/3524e/56rkII2-Bbs.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  About a week ago, eSports was listed on the official sports list.  Now the competitions will be officially held under the auspices of the Ministry of Sports of the Russian Federation and all participants in these events have real chances to get ranks and titles of masters of sports.  For people far from this topic, this information may sound crazy, for others it is the reality of a changing world.  Sport for some people is a serious business, as it attracts huge masses of people, and that is why many world organizations such as FC Valencia, West Ham, Wolfsburg, Sampdoria are beginning to pay more and more attention to eSports. and many others.  The prize of the largest world tournaments has passed for $ 15 million, and the audience has hundreds of millions of people.  Comparing all these numbers, the mere fact of popularity and excitement around eSports does not seem so illogical. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p><img src="https://pp.vk.me/c630124/v630124991/35257/pWfMvDFvHIU.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The situation in modern eSports is not very straightforward.  On the one hand, there are serious organizations, the number of which can be counted on the fingers, on the other, millions of gamers who for one reason or another cannot reach the pro level.  The main reasons for this are the finances and the unwillingness of the CIS community to take cybersport activity as seriously as any other job.  It is because of the negligence and the "sloppy" approach that very strong teams and organizations disintegrated.  Also, the eternal disassembly, squabbles and gossip - a distinctive feature of the CIS community. </p><br><p>  As you may have noticed from the narration above, there is no middle ‚Äúlayer‚Äù throughout this structure.  Therefore, before even thinking about creating a new cyber-sports structure, you need to look at the facts: </p><br><ul><li>  How many people play games? </li><li>  Hundreds of millions. </li><li>  How many of them team up and start training? </li><li>  Hundreds of thousands. </li><li>  How many people of them fall into the coveted International or Major? </li><li>  A few dozens. </li></ul><br><p>  If you think that you have at least some real statistical chances to get in the number of these "elite" dozens, then you are either overly confident or infinitely stupid. </p><br><p><img src="https://pp.vk.me/c604517/v604517991/11ac7/tpB1QHTvUb0.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Also, no serious organization can exist without sponsorship.  Therefore, you need to answer the question: "What do sponsors need?".  Winning the biggest tournaments?  By no means.  They need publicity and the largest reach of the audience, that is, in essence, the media organization, which can be obtained in our time and not winning the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International">International</a> . </p><br><p>  Now we are smoothly approaching the topic of this topic, namely the creation of a new e-sports organization.  I believe that the tendency to create such communities will have increasing polarity from year to year.  And maybe in 5-10 years eSports organizations will be in each city on a par with football and basketball clubs.  Since I raised this topic, having signed myself thus to the organizers of this event, it will not be superfluous to introduce myself. </p><br><p>  I started my cybersport course at the age of 13 in a small town in southern Russia and acted in the CS 1.6 discipline, was the team captain, went to the WCG and Asus qualifiers.  At the age of 15 he organized his first tournament, gathering more than 20 teams from all over the South.  Remembering this now, I can not even imagine how the owner of the computer club entrusted his establishment to the young boy.  In consequence, I organized several more local tournaments. </p><br><p>  At the age of 17 he left for the Czech Republic.  By lucky coincidence, my fellow hostel turned out to be a guy from Novokuznetsk, who also played in CS in his city.  So we made our team in Prague from a Russian-Czech, a Vietnamese and our friend who went with us just because we made him.  In the end, after a year of training, we entered the top 8 of the Czech Republic (then local tournaments gathered up to 60 teams in our discipline).  Then you had to either go into the league about, scoring for work and study, or finish with the "counter", because the training took too much time.  I chose the second option. </p><br><p>  I am 28 years old now.  I own my own brand and small production in China.  And I think that the time has come to go back to eSports, only in a different role. </p><br><p>  As you could understand from my short biography, I don‚Äôt have to take experience in organizing and managing people.  This idea also appeared due to the fact that after living in China for more than a year, I acquired useful contacts and skills that can later seriously help the organization pay for itself financially. </p><br><p>  Since I do not do charity work, of course, for the successful existence of such a structure, a development plan should be drawn up and every effort should be made to implement it, but again I don‚Äôt want to create an army type organization, precisely because of my approach to this issue.  I would like to move away from the stereotypes of the CIS communities and create a place that people can call their second home, and the people in it as their second family. </p><br><p>  And now let's move from philosophy to specifics. </p><br><p>  <strong>What can I offer:</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  Name and appropriately help our brand (in the state there are designers, programmers, engineers). </li><li>  Provide teams or people who deserve attention with all the necessary ammunition (since now I am locally in China and work directly with factories producing any gaming attributes and accessories (carpets, mice, headphones, etc.)). </li><li>  To provide the organization of the initial base (website, team server and other things for the most comfortable development of the project). </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>I want to see in the team:</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  Adequate and goal-oriented people who are ready to carry this difficult burden along with me and who want to realize themselves in the eSports industry (managerial team). </li><li>  People who are related to the media who are interested in this project and format (thematic groups, sites, channels on YouTube or twitch). </li><li>  Programmers and designers (we need to create a product from the organization, and it is almost impossible to do this without these people). </li><li>  Former pro or semi-pro players from various disciplines (coaching staff and analytics department). </li><li>  Teams and players who want to join the organization and act under our banners (any cyber disciplines). </li></ul><br><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that I have been pondering for a long time how best to start this project. There were several options, from finding old contacts and establishing new ones, to ‚Äúthrowing money‚Äù in the style of modern cyber organizations.  After weighing all the pros and cons, I decided to just write this blog and the reason for that is absolutely trivial - unwillingness to make life easier for someone, imprisoning everything ready. </p><br><p>  99% of the "sofa" critics emanate from the forums and in the social.  networks that it is impossible to get into serious organizations, schoolchildren are flooded with questions about how to get into eSports and what needs to be done to do this.  Perhaps each of them thinks that a skill is measured by the number of posts or angry comments and that all the people who play now in serious teams got there by accident.  So I will answer that for each of them there are thousands of hours spent in the game, huge risks of remaining ‚Äúout of work‚Äù upon reaching a certain age and another million associated problems. </p><br><p>  Therefore, for all those who believe that he was not "lucky" and this topic was written, here it is your chance, you only need to "raise your backside" and <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/so34043SJzzF1F7i2">submit an application</a> .  Let's call it a social experiment, if this topic finds a response from the public, we will do with you a new e-sports organization in the CIS, and then there will be victories, bootcamps and sponsors.  All in your hands! </p></div>
