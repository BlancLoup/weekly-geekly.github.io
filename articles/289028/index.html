"Obama button"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In previous episodes: Big Data is not just a lot of data.  Correct Big Data provide positive feedback.  In the 3rd series: <b>‚ÄúThe Obama button‚Äù</b> as the embodiment of the rtBD &amp; A class tasks through the eyes of Big Data analyst. <br><br>  According to one of the modern legends, the reference to the term ‚ÄúObama button‚Äù appeared during the presidency of D. Medvedev, when the latter went to the USA  At the meeting of two presidential lawyers and two big fans of Apple products, Barack Obama allegedly praised an interesting solution: an iPad, which has a specialized teleprompter program installed with the function of displaying the reaction of viewers and listeners. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The principle of the standard teleprompter, which shows the running text of the text and is used for numerous public speeches by the American president, was supplemented by a new functionality: depending on the positive or negative reaction of the audience watching Obama‚Äôs speech on TV or listening to the radio, the background color and text on the screen changed iPad.  If the population liked what the president is talking about at the moment, then the screen is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, if on the contrary it is colored in red tones and brighter, the stronger the reaction of the people.  At the press of a button, it was possible to expand the text with additional inserts on the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù topic in order to prolong the positive wave as a whole from the whole speech, or vice versa, to complete the negative topic and move on to the next part of the message. <br><br>  Again, this is just one of the modern technocratic legends, fairy tales, but as we remember - in each fairy tale only a fraction of the tale.  Is it possible in practice to implement the "Obama button"?  The answer, of course, is positive.  During the elections in 2012 in France a new term was actively used - ‚Äúsocial television‚Äù.  Here's how the situation was described by CNN correspondent Alice Antheaume in her article dated April 20, 2012:

      <i>‚ÄúTelevision broadcasts words spoken by candidates, and these words are discussed in social networks.</i>  <i>It is in social networks that people draw conclusions regarding the credibility of candidates.</i>  <i>This happens because their promises and the numbers with which they juggle are checked for real-time credibility by journalists and experts, which guarantees instant and competent comments on politicians' rantings. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  In 2012, the journalistic fraternity had not yet seen the beginning of the sunset of its role as an ‚Äúintermediate expert‚Äù between information sources and readers, therefore, in the paragraph above, the only beneficiaries from social TV are ‚Äújournalists and experts‚Äù who are supposed to (through their accounts in social networks) ‚Äúwith the voice of God to explain to the human herd‚Äù what is happening in the world.  But more about this in another series. <br><br>  Returning to the ‚ÄúObama button‚Äù: Big Data analysts are required to approach any field of activity in terms of: <br>  1. The <b>process</b> - continuous and merciless: it is now they are Himalayas, and after a hundred million years - small mounds.  No static!  Stopped - died.  Like a heart. <br>  2. <b>Information data channels</b> : source - environment - consumer - reaction force - transmission. <br>  3. <b>Continuous monitoring of the entire information field</b> - new data is more valuable than old ones. <br>  4. <b>Positive feedback</b> - the results of any tasks should lead to the continuation of the process. <br><br>  Based on the above, in the real-time procedure of the ‚ÄúObama button‚Äù there is only a source (president) and consumer (viewer), other actors (journalists, experts) can potentially and contribute their personal perception to the information field (evening political shows, news discussions with experts), but not in real-time mode. <br><br>  Turning to the technocratic level, let's talk about the specifics of the implementation of the ‚ÄúObama button‚Äù.  In the US, the main and, in fact, the only source of ‚Äúsocial TV‚Äù is Twitter, microblogging service beloved by many technocrats - developed API, commercial receipt of the entire data stream and free 1% of the stream, high structured messages (hashtags, maximum 140 characters, connections, reaction in the form of retweets and "favorites"). <br><br>  In the coming ‚Äúsaturation period,‚Äù when the majority of the world's population is somehow tied up with the Internet and social networks, Twitter users generate 500 million tweets per day.  Very rough estimate: 60% - in English, 30% - Spanish / Portuguese.  Since a huge amount of Hispanic population lives in the USA, it means that the amount of processing during the president‚Äôs hourly performance can be estimated as: <b>(500.000.000 / 24) * 1.5 = ~ 30 million tweets</b> (a factor of 1.5 takes into account the distribution of tweets during the day), which corresponds to about <b>10,000 messages per second</b> .  And it remains utter nonsense: to isolate the original language, to determine what it is about Obama's speech, to determine the tone of the reaction, to geo-locate the author (enough at the country or city level) and visualize the current state of the process. <br><br>  In addition, Big Data analysts will appreciate Twitter‚Äôs important factors for the ‚ÄúObama button‚Äù as: <br>  1. <b>The reaction rate of people in ‚Äúsocial TV‚Äù</b> : try to tell your friends (or a mirror) some coherent idea, thought, problem.  Many will be surprised how much speech is a low-information data channel!  It takes 3-5-7 minutes to at least something more or less articulate.  The first reaction through the social network begins to be generated within 30-45 seconds.  So in 2-3 minutes for the analytical system there is already enough data to assess the attitude of the population. <br>  2. <b>The format of</b> Twitter <b>messages</b> is undoubtedly very advantageous for such tasks: for the context ‚ÄúObama is af * cking idiot and the world hates him‚Äù even 140 characters is a whole book. <br><br>  American analysts of Big Data are lucky: linguistics and thesaurus of national American is much simpler than national Russian, besides, in Russia for ‚Äúsocial TV‚Äù not only Twitter is used (this is ‚Äúlove of big cities‚Äù), but VKontakte and Odnoklassniki with ‚ÄúMy World, and Facebook with Instagram - see regular Brand Analytics research on the spread of social networks in Russia - <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/socialnye-seti-v-rossii-zima-2014-2015-cifry/">br-analytics.ru/blog/socialnye-seti-v-rossii-zima-2014-2015-cifry</a> - analysts are obliged to know factography. <br><br>  Therefore, the implementation of real-time analytics by the speech of the President of Russia (for clarity, the President did not have any ‚ÄúPutin button‚Äù, like the iPad-prompter) required much more effort for the technical development and operation of analysts: from the enhanced data collection platform to HiLoad- linguistics, capable of putting down an object key on a powerful message flow. <br><br>  Here are a couple of public links on the results of similar tasks: <br>  <a href="http://vox-populi.ru/pl2013.phtml">vox-populi.ru/pl2013.phtml</a> - Straight line with President of Russia V.V.  Putin (April 25, 2013). <br>  <a href="http://vox-populi.ru/p121213.phtml">vox-populi.ru/p121213.phtml</a> - Address of the President with the message (December 12, 2013). <br><br>  For those who like to think (test your analytical skills): is there a difference for analysts in the implementation of rtBD &amp; A between the Straight Line and the Appeal?  The answer is given after a brief presentation of the 3rd series. <br><br>  <i>Brief summary of the 3rd series: Big Data is a process spreading through information control channels.</i>  <i>Frozen ‚Äúbig data‚Äù is a crypt and an instant cast.</i>  <i>But even the archives can be revived by the ‚Äúkiss of life‚Äù of the beautiful prince-anti-artist, by including the data in the chain of making the following decisions.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Answer: ‚ÄúThe Message‚Äù is an order of magnitude more difficult task than the two-way ‚ÄúStraight Line‚Äù, even though the ‚Äúshort format‚Äù is less than an hour (the length of the Straight Line was 5 hours).  It is possible that someone from the readers in comments or a personal message will try to give an extended answer (and why the Appeal is much more complicated) :-) <br><br>  In the next series: Brazilian BigData-samba - power + HANA, as well as the new expected news - the big road of big data IBM: the company forgets about hardware, why is the Blue Giant freed from PC departments and servers? <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/palitrumlab/blog/11658/">1st series: Big Data - like a dream</a> <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/palitrumlab/blog/11716/">2-nd series: Big Data negative or positive?</a> <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/brandanalytics/blog/13922/">4th series: The revolution of the brain</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289028/</a></p>
