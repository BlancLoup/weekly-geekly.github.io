Today, this can be found, for example, in the machines Dance Dance Revolution. <br><br>  A copy in the best condition was put up for auction - it was not even opened, it is still in its original packaging.  Authenticity - 85 points out of 100 according to the <a href="http://www.vggrader.com/">Video Game Authority</a> .  At the moment, the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/111567662630%3F_trksid%3Dp2055119.m1438.l2649%26ssPageName%3DSTRK%253AMEBIDX%253AIT">amount is frozen at around 99,850 dollars</a> .  This is about 6 million rubles at the current rate. <br><br>  The rarity is due to the fact that Nintendo bought Family Fun Fitness right at the time of the release of the game.  Copies were recalled for rebranding, but some were leaked anyway.  Of all the products that have appeared on the counter, this is the rarest game for the Nitendo Entertainment System, the game console, known in Russia for its clone Dendy.

      But do not think that the lot will really go beyond 100 thousand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/nintendo/nes/the-rarest-and-most-valuable-nes-games">It is widely</a> believed that 2000 copies of Stadium Events were made, of which only 200 were on the shelves.  Several were purchased, but only two copies are known that were not opened from the original packaging.  And one of them is now at auction. <br><br>  RacketBoy <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/nintendo/nes/the-rarest-and-most-valuable-nes-games">claims</a> that usually copies of this game cost from 1,800 to 8,800 dollars.  Four years ago, a copy was sold in a package for $ 22,800. <br><br>  The game consists of a simulation of cross-country sports athletics based on Family Fun Fitness, connected as a second controller.  It has a barrier run of 110 m, a run of 100 m, regular and triple jumps.  Players are invited to fight with several types of opponents with different levels of difficulty. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQNDSbZHtHY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJ_4srHOSfcrqNCps7ScqZNCvd0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The seller <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-rare-nes-game-bidding-hits-100-000/1100-6424548/">told</a> GameSpot that he had worked for 22 years at Nitendo, and it was thanks to this that the game fell into his hands in the early nineties.  In 2011, he accidentally found out that a copy of Stadium Events went to eBay for 44 thousand dollars.  Only then did he realize the true value of the game. <br><br>  The auction began with a mark of 5 thousand dollars and quickly began to gain momentum.  In total, 23 people took part in the auction.  The end is scheduled for January 15th. <br><br>  It is likely that the Internet media is to blame for the sudden increase in rates.  Using one-time accounts, Internet trolls intentionally place requests that they are not going to carry out.  Perhaps no one will part with 100 thousand dollars, the amount that was quoted by all the writers of the publication. <br><br>  This has happened, for example, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/nwc-gray-mario/">with a copy of the Nintendo World Championship</a> in a ridiculously poor condition.  The starting price of 5 thousand dollars quickly increased to 100. Later, the seller said that he still sold it for $ 5000. <br><br>  The function of the white list of bidders helps fight jokers, even if it requires some actions from the organizer.  But this seller did not think too much about his auction. <br><br>  Astronomically huge numbers are often found when selling rare game values.  For example, in 2010, Eric Novak <a href="">spent</a> 330 thousand dollars on a gaming station in the game Entropia Universe.  In 2013, the courier from Dota 2 <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-06-someone-bought-a-dota-2-courier-for-USD38-000">went</a> for $ 38 thousand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375431/</a></p>
