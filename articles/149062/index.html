  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a distributed network infrastructure of mixed type for the publication of electronic educational resources</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Over the years I have had to get acquainted with a variety of educational content distribution models: from autonomous LMS (Learning Management System) to federal centralized repositories (for example: <a href="http://www.ariadne-eu.org/">www.ariadne-eu.org</a> , <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/">www.oercommons.org</a> , <a href="http://www.montereyinstitute.org/nroc/index.html">www.montereyinstitute.org/nroc /index.html</a> , <a href="http://nrocmath.org/about/%3B">nrocmath.org/about/;</a> domestic resources for school education: <a href="http://school-collection.edu.ru/">school-collection.edu.ru</a> , <a href="http://fcior.edu.ru/">fcior.edu.ru</a> ).  The principle of organization of the proposed solution is different from the options with which I had to become acquainted.  At this stage, this material is positioned as a potential application or a topic for reflection ... <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project is the integration of university (school) computer support systems for the educational process with peer-to-peer networks in order to organize integrated networks of general access to educational material (with the possibility of organizing a single register), including: text documents, videos, unified training modules, etc. P. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This solution could contribute not only to the development of a socially significant network of exchange of learning resources, but also to the involvement of a wide range of potential stakeholders (students, graduate students, teachers) in the process of developing e-learning resources.  The best design works of schoolchildren (with whom they speak at regular school conferences) could be published in similar school networks.  If resources will have free licenses, there will be an opportunity to spread the experience of free software development in the field of preparing educational content, as well as to combine for collective use the training resources of Russian universities and training centers, thus reducing costs and efforts to develop similar (similar) design solutions. . <br><br>  The following is a basic model of an integrated learning network. <br>  The backbone components of this network are: software designed to store and display electronic training modules;  the server hosting the Torrent tracker and computers of users of this network.  In the development process, similar network structures of universities, schools and other organizations may be included in the network.  In the future, the system can be supplemented with a central repository (repository). <br>  The proposed organization of an integrated network infrastructure can be used to target (thematic) distribution of educational resources, according to the needs of specific (specialized) educational institutions.

      <br>
      Consider the features of the model on the example of a single institution.  A separate institution has its own repository of electronic educational resources (ESM).  Part of the training modules of this institution is made publicly available for distribution via the P2P (peer-to-peer) network, and publishes information about this module on the tracker (the process of publishing the module and accompanying data should be classified and automated).  Users connected to the designated P2P network should have the opportunity not only to download modules, but also to publish their own (modules executed as part of course, diploma projects, teachers ‚Äôauthoring works, modified versions of modules presented by the institution of higher education) (you should probably have a rating mechanism, by analogy with "karma" in Habr√©).  The peer-to-peer networking features are such that the more popular the module and the more users download it, the less load on the distribution server, and the modules hosted by users are initially distributed from the local storage located on the user's computer (and selected modules from the storage of educational servers).  By exploring the social ratings of ‚Äúuser-defined‚Äù modules, loading into open storage (with status, for example, ‚Äútemporary modules‚Äù) and viewing selected modules, representatives of training organizations can select new relevant modules published by other users for their internal storage.  The modules selected for the needs of the university also remain in the open repository for further distribution in the P2P network, but with the status of "permanent (selected)".  ‚ÄúTemporary‚Äù modules that are not selected are removed from the open storage of the university, but following the rules of the organization of the peer-to-peer network, they remain available as long as there are users who distribute them.  The repository of the proposed Federal or industry server can select the most significant resources by encouraging active developers.  Thus, it is possible to consider both a descending and an ascending model for the development and publication of learning resources. <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf6/4a4/e0b/bf64a4e0ba8bf735ba0581b0948f8dec.jpg">  "alt =" image "/&gt; <br><br>  Abbreviations: <br>  LMS - (Learning Management System) - Learning Management System: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system</a> <br>  EOR - electronic educational resources. <br><br>  One of the most common LMS: <a href="http://moodle.org/%3Flang%3Dru">moodle.org/?lang=en</a> <br>  An example of a learning resource (the aforementioned NORC) hosted at MOODLE: <a href="http://nroc.remote-learner.net/course/view.php%3Fid%3D4">nroc.remote-learner.net/course/view.php?id=4</a> <br><br>  The relative ease of implementation of this model is due to the lack of tight centralization, since the system is based on the principles of a modular extensible architecture, and the global repository can be connected after some initial network of organizations (or several disparate networks of organizations) is formed. <br><br>  As for the content, as I wrote above, it can be various digitized information resources, it‚Äôs only important that they be classified.  (Probably, on the database of specifications: <a href="http://spec.edu.ru/sights/spec.nsf/specialisation%3FOpenPage">spec.edu.ru/sights/spec.nsf/specialisation?OpenPage</a> ).  The same applies to video materials. <br><br>  A few words about intensively developing educational information resources, positioned as autonomous applications (autonomous educational units) - electronic multimedia interactive learning modules that can be imported into the available educational organization LMS.  In order for this to be possible, these training modules (from different developers) must conform to a specific standard, in other words, have a common software interface to interact with any certified LMS standard. <br><br>  In my opinion today, the most functional specification (standard) is the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORM">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORM</a> , largely due to the fact that its support is provided by the majority of the most common and free) LMS and due to the fact that this standard provides a software interface (Application Program Interface (API), Run-Time Environment (RTE)), which provides the functionality of the interaction of the stand-alone training module (package) with the database of the parent LMS, which allows the developer a training resource  s to determine the logic of the behavior of the training module, depending on the actions of the student and on the results obtained in the course of the educational process.  In the above-mentioned example of organizing a training course in the MOODLE system: <a href="http://nroc.remote-learner.net/course/view.php%3Fid%3D4">nroc.remote-learner.net/course/view.php?id=4</a> , such modules are integrated into the training course and are located in the Learning Objectives section;  example module: <a href="http://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/Algebra1/U04L1T2_RESOURCE/index.html">www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/Algebra1/U04L1T2_RESOURCE/index.html</a> (loaded for a long time).  To make sure that this is the SCORM module, open the source code of the page (in the form of HTML) and find in it the line script language = "javascript" src = "SCORM_API_wrapper.js".  This javascript as part of the training module provides the interaction between the software environment of the module and the LMS software environment.  In this case, the module is presented as a Flash application that can interact with SCORM_API_wrapper.js, however, more and more often, technological solutions, including javaScript, are used to develop interactive multimedia modules (as a modern alternative to RIA <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_Application">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_Application</a> ) jQuery (and other frameworks), canvas, HTML5, CSS3;  Developments are under way to create similar training resources adapted for tablets and mobile devices. <br><br>  PS <br><br>  I am ready to calmly accept both "-" and "+" and continue the discussion of the topic (if "karma" allows));  I will be grateful to those who comment on their "-" (or "+"), since the availability of informational "feedback" for me is of practical importance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149062/</a></p>
