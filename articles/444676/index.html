  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CRM rating, tops, reviews - all lie?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  Today we will talk about ratings, tops, reviews, and all sorts of otzoviki, which our customers are guided by, choosing the software.  In my life I wouldn‚Äôt have thought to start this mini-investigation about CRM ratings, if not for a hard discussion with the user <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/gennayo/" class="user_link">gennayo</a> , where we discussed ways to choose CRM and find it initially from the Internet in general.  In fact, this concerns not only CRM, but also any product and service, however, my shirt is closer to the body :-) So, I collected some tops on popular search queries and divided them into groups.  Well, dive into the twilight? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/239/99f/c7b23999f512ef99193b35bc926623c1.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There were different thoughts about the organization of this top, but in the end I decided to start from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sources and gradually slide into the abyss of obscurity.  Therefore, if you want scandals and intrigues, read the article from the end, if objectivity - then from the beginning. <br><br><hr>  <font color="#999999"><i>Disclaimer.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>I am responsible for marketing in RegionSoft and the opinion in the article may or may not coincide with the company's position.</i></font> <hr><br><h2>  ‚ÄúClean‚Äù industry CRM ratings and tops </h2><br>  If we talk about the market of CRM and ERP, then the palm of purity and honesty belongs to independent analytical agencies, in particular, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> and <a href="https://go.forrester.com/">Forrester</a> (Forrester Wave).  Gartner annually releases the complex Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management report, in which CRM is evaluated by potential, niche players, visionaries, leaders and challengers are determined.  The same quadrants are made on the versions of other agencies, for example, Nuclear Research.  As a rule, the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of vendors in different quadrants converges, but there are also differences. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      However, none of these agencies can be called truly independent.  First, the Gartner quadrant just does not get in - manufacturing companies pay for the research in order to have a chance to get into the quadrant.  Such a position is necessary for them to have an obvious competitive and marketing advantage in the market, and sometimes an investment in research pays off well.  And secondly, Gartner several times fell into <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F:%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_Gartner">bad stories with the evaluation of technology</a> , and in 2006, experts of this company considered that Apple is the most promising way to abandon the development of hardware (of course, they may have looked into a very distant future, but 13 years, and Apple hardware lives and barely coughs). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f64/174/da6/f64174da63829c329c36448edbf1f48e.png" width="500"></div>  <font color="#999999"><i>Matrix example Nuclear Research</i></font> <br><br>  There is another caveat - to become a contender for the quadrant of some of the agencies, you need to comply with the set of formal and unnecessary user requirements, from technological to language.  Relatively speaking, we are developing <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> and believe that we could have fought for a ‚Äúniche player‚Äù, because  pumped up much as a universal CRM, including for integrated enterprise management with a warehouse, production, business processes, and so on.  And let's say we light up the idea and start moving forward, ordering a study, translating the interface into English, writing down the IFRS system, invoicing, etc.  It costs a lot of money, we will have to repel them.  How will any sane developer beat them off?  That's right, shift these payments to the cost of licenses.  The question is - we have been working for 17 years for Russian small and medium-sized businesses to make a newsletter that we are in the quadrant?  No, we just help small and medium businesses to solve automation problems. <br><br>  You understood correctly, all participants in quadrants are very expensive software - due to ambitions, global presence, marketing costs, etc. <br><br>  This also includes ratings and research conducted by Russian companies and research institutes (for example, the Institute for Enterprise Issues, J'son &amp; Partners, private laboratories, etc.).  With the difference that they do not have such a weight in the world (they have no, in fact), they are called upon to solve local problems, that is, private tasks of vendors or system integrators, therefore each report, each study has a ‚ÄúBy request of the company XXX.  It costs from 500 thousand rubles.  up to 2 million, and gives certain advertising benefits. <br><br>  I touched on the life of research institutes and I can say that to make such a report is not just to come with a paid bill and take first place - the research is really based on real data.  Taking a report and even looking at the source of the study, you do not undermine.  But, as you probably know, data sources and methods for their processing are different.  So that same money is paid for a competent sample of the audience and methodology, if you understand what I mean. <br><br>  <b>Verdict.</b>  Information from such reports and quadrants leaks out to the media in doses, the research itself is either unavailable or cost up to $ 4-5 thousand.  Therefore, you are unlikely to read them entirely.  But any information from there - a good squeeze on the market, must be studied and understood.  However, blindly believing and taking credit for CRM from the quadrant is hardly worth it. <br><br><h2>  Thematic sites and portals </h2><br>  The foreign market is rich in websites about CRM-systems - there are really a lot of them, there are many articles, notes, experts and restrained discussions inside.  There is also a lot of advertising, without it in any way.  There are a lot of sites on CRM in Russia too, good ones are counted on the fingers of one hand (including Habr).  In the search results among expert sites in the first positions you can catch three more or less adequate sites (except Habr - we will not consider it, it is difficult to compete with it). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.crmonline.ru/">CRMonline</a> is, alas, an almost inanimate site that was once the site of the fierce battles of CRM players on the forum.  Valued by the accumulated information and catalog of CRM-systems.  There are no purchased tops or ratings - you just dig into the list of CRM solutions.  However, much of it is outdated: for example, the catalog has RegionSoft CRM 5.0, and for almost a year it has been RegionSoft CRM 7.0 (despite the fact that these are major releases, that is, at least 4 years have passed). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.crm-practice.ru/">Practice CRM</a> - the site is supported, the articles are updated, although not as often as we would like.  There is a lead generation system (for which everything was conceived, probably).  Previously, he aroused suspicions among vendors, because the publisher was Terrasoft dealer company in the Czech Republic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/557/567/b995575673a2e331c412772364c4e61d.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Proofs with TAdviser</i></font> <br><br>  But now the site of that company is parked, and the portal itself includes just a huge storehouse of information and cases about CRM ( <a href="http://www.crm-practice.ru/companies/contacts/index.php%3Fid%3D4015">for example, our contribution to this piggy bank</a> ) and allows us to select and compare solutions (without filters, according to the established list of criteria).  We also like the graphic-evaluation of CRM-systems, they, of course, are strongly averaged, but on the whole reflect the real state of affairs.  How the schedule is formed, we do not know (this is not a script on the page), I think that there is also a subjective element here - but we know for sure that we did not pay a penny for publishing, posting, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e68/4c7/575/e684c757539fc6c7d4ba736cfe93e5c8.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>RegionSoft CRM through the eyes of the portal Practice CRM</i></font> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/">TAdviser</a> should have been mentioned first, but this is a long story, so here.  This is a real mastodon of the sphere of corporate software - a huge analytical portal, which contains a large knowledge base, there are ratings and opinions, advertising and author's content.  He is still very much alive.  But we will see what's up with the CRM rating. <br>  The latter is from 2017.  Here he is: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/803/b0c/036/803b0c036b7d8b6878d0e81532e957f3.png"></div><br>  First question: are you serious, and where are amoCRM and Bitrix24?  And the question is not the only one.  So, we start to dig.  As always, with an asterisk - "according to the TAdviser database."  We know what the base is, because I made RegionSoft with my own hands and all our products on the portal back in 2013 and ... scored on this case for a number of good reasons (surprisingly, this is not about laziness).  Here is what this sign looked like: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/051/21b/f0e/05121bf0e97ca2334ab619886a8d4349.png"></div><br>  And here the most interesting begins: the vendor company submits the project itself and must necessarily add a customer card - that is, add all these firms from the first column to the directory (if they are not there).  It is clear that not all customers like it - you need to get permission to disclose the project, etc.  In general, we stopped submitting projects, but still sometimes the thought goes away - and if we had made all 6000+ of our implementations, we would have MS Dynamics and 1C: CRM ‚Äúdone‚Äù.  But what is the price rating, which <b>only</b> get <b>those who made information</b> about the projects? <br><br>  But in general, we repeat, as a source of information about companies and products of IT sphere TAdviser is excellent. <br><br>  Now about another rating, which attracted our attention, including for the reasons that you will see closer to the end.  We are talking about the search cloud service <a href="https://startpack.ru/">Startpack</a> .  It's pretty easy to get there if you're a cloud solution, and there is a CRM system rating with reviews, features, etc.  Reviews from real people (on sensations), but the need to approach is critical - because someone has a rating of 5 stars and 3 ratings, someone has 3 stars and 100 ratings, and this is a big difference for the user experience.  Well, besides, 5-20 "five" reviews will be created by the staff of any IT company, while the geolocation, IP and styles will be different - you will not stick.  But as the Startpack information base looks very good, informative, it is convenient to use.  It is a pity that we can not bring back <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> , because we are a desktop solution, not a cloud one. <br><br>  But we can get, for example, in the <a href="https://allcrm.ru/">AllCRM</a> catalog, which is positioned as an assistant in the choice of a CRM system.  Also a pleasant and informative rating.  The truth in the correspondence by e-mail, it turned out that there was a price list for the services, but they promised to send the updated price list later (which I strongly doubt for a number of reasons).  But there is no paper - there is no evidence, so we just remember that out of the goodness of the soul, even chickens do not rush, and such aggregators earn either advertising or lead generation (they sell applications to vendors), or affiliate programs with CRM systems, or everything at once.  There is nothing wrong with that, just need to remember that the rating can be configured as desired. <br><br>  For example, how do you like the orange button?  Why is it not in others?  It is enough to click on the link and the URL to understand that this is a referral. <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">&amp;client_id=site.53889571c72cf8.19427820&amp;referer=209208&amp;second_referer=allcrm&amp;addmodule=remark.edward</code> </pre> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85b/425/e2b/85b425e2bc1e91278d460817838032de.png"></div><br>  You can find a few more similar sites, request a price and find out how to grow in the ranking.  I do not really want them to get traffic from Habr, so I will not mention them, but I will say, for example, that on the site of one ‚Äútype of independent blogger‚Äù of the 15 CRM mentioned in the article disguised as analytical reasoning, 9 have referral links .  Moreover, two CRMs have not been heard even in our company, although we are closely following the market.  Here you have the entire rating from an independent expert :-) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">By the way, about masking</font> </h2><br>  This is a separate caste of sites that are intended to sell a single CRM.  For example, on the website 1crm-online.ru, which presents itself as ‚ÄúCRM selection service for your business‚Äù, you formally click on the pictures with the parameters you need, leave your details and contacts, and they will offer you a single CRM system: 1C : CRM.  However, it is easy to foresee from the site name.  I do not know, like you, I did not have even the slightest illusion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f6/523/773/0f6523773b2ea32638a89378d2c6c54b.png"><br><br>  And there are a lot of such sites - fortunately, besides the one mentioned, it was no longer found in the top.  But they disguise a lot - usually for honest reviews, posts, blogger notes, for objective analysis and even for criticism. <br><blockquote><h4>  And how are they? </h4><br>  In Europe and the United States, such otzoviki ratings are very developed, you can look at the example of <a href="https://www.toptenreviews.com/">Top Ten Reviews</a> .  Some of them are extremely strict to the participants and adhere to the policy of independence.  You can buy a banner from them or get to the first line due to payment or GiveAway (free software for everyone for a day, for example), but this line will be marked in a special way - as livev or advertising activity.  Among serious tops, finding a sales / referral rating is not so easy. </blockquote>  <b>Verdict.</b>  We all do business - someone develops and sells software, someone leads the company in terms of PR and marketing, someone sells virtual servers, and someone earns affiliate programs.  Such a business will not die out for a long time, because the level of automation is low, and IT literacy outside IT companies requires endless education, and the software vendors themselves are satisfied with everything - the extra channel of promotion did not bother anyone. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">And now about the real failure</font> </h2><br>  Some time ago I discovered our RegionSoft CRM in the <a href="https://crmindex.ru/">CRMindex.ru</a> ranking.  He has already managed to index well (hello, search engines and algorithms!).  And I would not be embarrassed if it were not for two frankly bad reviews (there were others), in one of which the user wrote about us ... as a cloud CRM.  But we are not cloudy and do not even have a WEB-interface, we are a good, reliable, functional desktop!  This is mistake.  We broke through the ‚Äúrespondents‚Äù in full name in our database, we did not find them among our clients, we realized that we didn‚Äôt get into such situations.  In short, it is not about us.  I spent several hours searching for the owner of all this disgrace to ask for help to figure it out, because no one answered the contacts on the site, only collected my data. <br><br>  When I found the owner, he was surprised, and I already knew that every single comment on the site was fake, that it was a very, very bad copy of the above-mentioned Startpack (by interface, logic and functions) and that I have the only goal - to delete my company from this ‚Äúfalse rating‚Äù once and for all. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7f/5fd/095/a7f5fd095931b9b8b6e836716a293232.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Strange question from the owner of the aggregator</i></font> <br><br>  I must say, the conversation came out unpleasant, they removed us from the CRM rating for two days, and the owner of the "index" sent me this goodbye (one, two, out): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf8/99c/5cb/cf899c5cbd564b714e8ff802a08ae162.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Beige Blurs - I, Blue - My Opponent</i></font> <br><br>  In order not to be unsubstantiated and not to look like a young PR girl, who had a ‚Äúko-ko-ko, negative thing,‚Äù I conducted a small investigation and did factchecking specifically for this post.  Here are the facts. <br><br>  <b>Fact 1.</b> One person leaves several reviews for different products of the same class (for example, there are 8 reviews from Stepan on the screen, and he is not the only one).  All reviews are deep, but it‚Äôs clear that no one will use so many services at once, and even write about them in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e03/35b/33d/e0335b33db79ec8f13b2b6afb5c017ae.png"><br><br>  <b>Fact 2.</b> Very strange top ranking CRM-systems.  We don‚Äôt like to mention the competitors, but, hell, these are definitely not the top CRM systems in Russia - neither in terms of functionality nor in popularity.  Even the second in this list does not pull to win :-) Well, the rest, and even more so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/781/b39/a64781b3949fcc6ac57344a1e6e06aa1.png"><br><br>  <b>Fact 3.</b> All reviews written from users of VKontakte are created by users who have not been active for several months (sometimes from the date of review).  They do not respond to messages, did not leave a record, the dates of the last visit are old.  This is what I found among people who have written reviews for CRM systems in this CRM rating (all information is taken from public sources): <br><br><ul><li>  For example, Maxim Tigrov - 1994 year of birth, in the subscriptions ‚ÄúSexy People‚Äù, ‚ÄúSingle Mothers‚Äù, ‚ÄúDating / Rich and Mature‚Äù.  No, I was looking for an investor to purchase a CRM system, not otherwise. <br></li><li>  A productive author with 7 reviews of Dima Lu and Nikolay Onyushkin, who befell everyone, was the genius of the expertise, which I could not find to ask questions personally.  31 reviews! <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/ead/4c5/f34ead4c526a57befe6743fe64d256fc.png"><br><br>  <b>Fact 4.</b> Many, many referral links (which is not surprising, on the CRM from the top). <br><br>  I do not know how other vendors relate to posting on such a site, but it‚Äôs not pleasant to be among false and empty reviews from the mass of VKontakte accounts.  Therefore they asked to remove. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Who are these ratings for and why do they work?</font> </h2><br>  When choosing a CRM, a project management system, an accounting system and even software for personal use, users consult with their main consultant, the Internet.  They drive in a search query and expect that someone will help them, but in the end they come across such different ratings and expert reviews.  There are several reasons for ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù. <br><br><ul><li>  Low computer and technical literacy of managers and decision makers.  They can understand their business as geniuses, but they do not have to understand IT.  However, they often have to choose automation systems. <br></li><li>  Distrust of vendors - some entrepreneurs and their employees believe that the vendor has a goal to cut the money and throw, and there is no need to grow grass there.  Yes, it happens, but only with irresponsible partners.  If you complain to the vendor, the issue will be resolved, as a rule, honestly and professionally - no one is interested in the fall of reputation. <br></li><li>  Often confusing negative reviews written by people who refused to learn, full implementation, did not understand, demanded something illegal, and are now unhappy that the vendor did not fulfill their wishes.  Shoot this right from the keyboard, write a bunch of negative reviews so that life does not seem like paradise!  Vendor doesn‚Äôt care, he is ready to respond on the merits, but users looking for CRM are frightened. <br></li><li>  Trust in "independent" experts and bloggers as heralds of truth.  Alas, it is not so long ago.  Bought everything: tech bloggers, reviewers, amateur bloggers, famous people, etc.  Just the price is different.  Rarely-rarely (and mostly on Habr√©, Hacker, etc. - that is, the classic UGC) there are enthusiasts who are ready to tell the world about cones stuffed in the process of choosing a technology. <br></li><li>  Finally, for many people who choose CRM, there is no other Internet than social networks and a search with CRM ratings - where they are, that‚Äôs true.  This is a smaller segment, but it is. <br></li></ul><br>  Alas, this situation can often lead to tangible problems in the implementation of corporate software, because the grounds for a serious and rational investment in the development of a company are selected on the basis of someone's subjective opinion, without understanding the factors that influenced this very opinion. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Epilogue</font> </h2><br>  You will say that no one is looking for ratings, everyone is oriented towards the requirements.  No, they are looking, only in one Yandex: <br><br><ul><li>  CRM rating - 1076 requests per month <br></li><li>  top CRM - 508 <br></li><li>  choose CRM - 486 <br></li><li>  best CRM - 1052 <br></li></ul><br>  The issuance of these requests for the most part sad (the one that is not advertising in Yandex.Direct - here at least everything is fair). <br><br>  There is the only right way to choose a CRM system for your business: collect requirements and correlate them with the capabilities of different vendors, test demo versions, and communicate.  Listen to your business processes and hear your needs. <br><br>  Where to choose a CRM pool for tests?  Very difficult question - but definitely not in such tops.  You can rummage through the portals that we have mentioned, read Habr, Forbes, vc.ru, cossa, etc.  - serious vendors write about themselves quite a lot and well, because they are not ashamed to go one on one with the audience, tell about the product, get feedback, work out the negative.  In general, it is important to consider several sources and form your own opinion, because you are the only adequate expert for your business.  Get out of your way :-) <br><br><hr><blockquote>  <i>Well, we are with you on the way.</i>  If you are looking for a CRM system, then on <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Ddiscount/discount_2019_03"><b>RegionSoft CRM until March 31, a 15% discount</b></a> .  We are often asked: give a comparison of your system with such and such and such ... And we always answer that we do not have the practice of comparing our decisions with others, if only for the reason that such comparison will be subjective.  If you need CRM or ERP - carefully study our products and match their capabilities with their goals and objectives.  There will be questions and difficulties - write, call us, we will organize for you an individual presentation online - without ratings and puzomerok. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/aw/py/0xawpyz6uykl0ml9sgnrjzeezk0.jpeg" width="40" align="left">  <i><a href="https://t.me/bizbreeze">Our channel in Telegram</a> , in which without advertising we write not quite formal things about CRM and business.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444676/</a></p>
