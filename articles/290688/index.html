Which on the one hand is rather difficult for the decision makers and accountants to understand, and on the other hand is very reliable in the long term and requires only regular prophylaxis.  At the same time, in most scenarios, the organization of the server part is fairly unified:

      - a server, or two, or three; <br>  - infrastructure that ensures the functioning of the necessary roles and components; <br>  - database management system; <br>  - 1C server; <br>  - licenses for 1C server and the required number of user licenses; <br>  - Microsoft Windows licenses and SQL server and user; <br>  - the ability to conveniently connect to 1C employees of the franchisee to update and modify. <br><br>  The main problems that have to be addressed by the service provider: <br>  - the client‚Äôs desire to spend as little money as possible; <br>  - client's desire to control everything. <br><br>  A separate point to mention the obvious and common problem - the reluctance of the client to go to the clouds (Rent 1C).  Leave this for the next time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, based on my own experience, I know that many customers want to save money on licenses.  Especially on users' computers (Windows + Office - decent expenses in the company's budget when organizing new workplaces). <br><br>  From the point of view of the outsourcing company, this is solved by organizing a terminal server.  All that needs to be done on users' computers is to copy the remote connection shortcut to the desktop from the mail.  Users will do it themselves.  An outsourcer does not have to adminit computers with a pirated Windows.  And it will remain on the conscience of the management of the client company until the next stage of development (looming software rental or subscription, which can not be avoided). <br><br>  At the same time, the entire server infrastructure must be correctly licensed (one-time purchase of full licenses or monthly rent).  Or 146 of the Criminal Code. <br><habracut><br>  There are many ways to significantly reduce the cost of licenses, using the installation of free or free software.  But I am not a supporter of these solutions at the moment, although I am 100% sure that this is the only way to develop software in the future. <br><br>  So, for the organization of work in 1C will need: <br>  - two combat physical servers (let's take the cost of 150,000 rubles conditionally); <br>  - any old server (for organizing the storage of long-term backups). <br><br>  Now let's see how Microsoft sees it.  Up to 25 users - the all-in-one Essentials server OS version is offered.  Everything is fine, of course, but what kind of installation is it on one server?  That is, it is assumed that if the server has failed, then the work in the company stops until the server is replaced and the entire installation is restored from the backups?  Is it a day or two?  Or a week? <br><br>  More professionally consider installations with at least two servers.  And if we need a little more users and a little more features, then welcome to the world of the software giant Microsoft! <br><br>  A whole bunch of different OS licenses, DBMS and client connections will be required: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  License </td><td>  Qty </td><td>  Price </td><td>  Amount </td></tr><tr><td>  Windows Server 2012 R2 standard </td><td>  2 </td><td>  36,000 </td><td>  72000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Windows Server 2012 User CAL </td><td>  20 </td><td>  1400 </td><td>  28,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  RDS CAL 2012 </td><td>  20 </td><td>  4800 </td><td>  96000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Microsoft SQL 2014 Standard Runtime </td><td>  one </td><td>  20,000 </td><td>  20,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  SQL CAL 2014 runtime for 20 users </td><td>  one </td><td>  172,000 </td><td>  172,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  TOTAL </td><td></td><td></td><td>  388,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Server 1C Enterprise x64 </td><td>  one </td><td>  86,000 </td><td>  86,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  License for 20 users </td><td>  one </td><td>  78000 </td><td>  78000 </td></tr><tr><td>  ITS subscription </td><td>  one </td><td>  22,000 </td><td>  22,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  TOTAL </td><td></td><td></td><td>  186,000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Paul Leman!  On the license. <br><br>  So, server licenses will allow you to license 2 physical servers and install 4 virtual machines on them: two domain controllers, 1C + SQL server, an all-in-one terminal server.  As we know, the terminal server in 2012 officially requires a domain, and these are two domain controllers (on different physical servers for fault tolerance).  And the WSUS update server will be hosted on the SQL server. <br><br>  To organize a file or mail server or resettle WSUS to a separate server, we either pile up these roles on existing virtual machines, or purchase licenses and add virtual servers. <br><br>  Technically, I am a supporter of the second option, practically - as lucky as the client is not always ready to pay for licenses and configuration.  Ideally, it is important for me to do it well and reliably.  In reality, I have not yet seen clients who are ready for this, especially now, in a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù.  Yes, and the price of monthly maintenance of one or two extra servers for the client is often like a bone in the throat, since he understands the cost reduction more than investing in increased profits. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Service </td><td>  Approximate cost, rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Audit of existing infrastructure </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting up physical servers, testing them, preparing raid arrays, setting up remote administration tools </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Installing physical servers </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Installing Virtual Servers </td><td>  7500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setup of the server 1C Enterprise </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting SQL Server </td><td>  7500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting up and testing server backup </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting up and testing database backup with SQL tools </td><td>  5000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Domain Setup and User Institution </td><td>  8500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting up a terminal server and publishing 1C as a remote app </td><td>  12500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Preparing backup storage </td><td>  2500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Setting up an SSL certificate and publishing the Remote App portal </td><td>  1500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  70,000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Also, implementation services include the selection of equipment, its purchase, delivery support, including participation in the coordination of contracts and documents, and installation in the server room.  The same is true for software licenses.  That is, the customer is completely free from any work related to the project.  It only sets the task, allocates the budget, signs the agreements, NDA, SLA, and accepts the result of the service. <br><br>  Total project cost: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Servers 300,000 rubles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Licenses 564 000 rubles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The cost of implementation of 70,000 rubles. <br><br>  In the amount of 944,000 rubles. <br><br>  And this is without running Live migration or replication (more licenses will be required, since the ability of a physical server to accept migrations or replicas must also be licensed), without paid backup tools (which would give more backup and administration capabilities), with SQL Runtime restrictions (legally only for 1C, for simple things you will have to use SQL Express, and these are additional server resources, additional human resources for administration), without taking into account the introduction of large-scale improvements  1C, without the ability to work in a terminal or remote app session with Microsoft Office applications (additional licenses will be required). <br><br>  Let's sum up. <br><br>  For a client, any project on the implementation of the 1C + MS SQL bundle will cost about 1 million rubles at the start (you can stretch a little by phasing in equipment, licenses, implementation services, ITS).  For this money, the client will receive a basic set of services for all employees of the company, and are fully prepared to take the following steps - to reduce the costs of administering users' PCs, increase employee efficiency by organizing collaboration, refine business processes of interaction between internal divisions and analytical work with clients. <br><br>  For a small start-up company of a system integrator that does not sell licenses and supply server equipment, the potential profit from the implementation of the integration project is less than 8% of the total cost of implementing the solution.  Additional earnings only through monthly maintenance (cost reduction, efficiency improvement, typing). <br><br>  It turns out that in this case only the transfer of the client for the rental of licenses and the registration of the integrator company as a SPLA provider with a small increase in monthly earnings at the expense of a license fee will help?  That is, again a penny, and the main piece of cake from Microsoft? <br><br>  Most likely, we will come to this, if Microsoft (and behind it 1C) thinks over the mechanism of switching to licenses by subscription, and there will be no other alternatives. <br><br>  Yes, now there are mechanisms for leasing equipment and renting licenses.  But they include several middlemen: <br><br>  - Microsoft's basic partner, for example, 1C or SoftLine (it is impossible to conclude an SPLA agreement directly with Microsoft); <br>  - integrator (SPLA partner concluding an agreement with Microsoft and with the basic partner); <br>  - the lessor (the integrator and the client must establish a legal and financial relationship with him); <br>  - supplier of equipment. <br><br>  This reduces the initial costs, but increases the cost of the final cost of the solution for the client. <br><br>  If Microsoft directly sells a non-alternative subscription, this will significantly reduce the client's start-up costs and allow the integrator company to increase the number of implementations due to a more affordable entry threshold for more customers. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290688/</a></p>
