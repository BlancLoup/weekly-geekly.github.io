  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One of the last July evenings ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On one of the last July evenings, the doors of the bar in the Finnish town of Espoo swung open, and three respectable men in suits entered the room.  It was only their second visit to this establishment this year, but the barman recognized the guests without any difficulty and with anticipation got out a calculator, estimating the potential evening profit.  He had no idea who these elderly gentlemen were and why they came strictly once a quarter, but every time he was very much looking forward to their visit: the trio was distinguished by their love for expensive spirits, and by the complete lack of attention to the TOTAL graph in the bill.  At this time, the men, busy talking to each other, sat down at a table and immediately ordered a drink. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - ... Yes, they‚Äôve already gotten all of this up with their ‚Äúraiser‚Äù, and that's it ... <br>  - Do not swear, Ollie, you are not in St. Petersburg bar!  - Interrupted his successor, Jorma Ollila, and plunged into the memories of how famously they celebrated his resignation as CEO of Nokia. <br>  ‚Äú... They won't catch up with us in life,‚Äù Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo gracefully wriggled, adjusted his glasses and also plunged into memories of how famously they marked his entry into the position of CEO of Nokia Corporation. <br>  - Guys, can we have a drink?  Still a reason!  - David King tried to smoothly return the company's attention to the agenda. <br>  - BUT?  - both CEOs opened their eyes and looked at Nokia‚Äôs business development manager. <br><br>  David, without waiting for an adequate response of colleagues, picked up the drink brought by the bartender. <br><br>  - Well, for success!  - barked David. <br>  - Yes!  - coming to themselves, the others nodded and overturned the first batch of drinks. <br>  - How much do you say we have there?  - asked Olli-Pekka.

      David immediately enthusiastically pulled out a stack of stapled papers - the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4126495">financial report of Nokia Corporation for the II quarter</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the second quarter of 2007, Nokia delivered 100.8 million mobile phones, which is 29% more than in the same period last year,‚Äù the business development manager enjoyed the undisguised pleasure of reading the results of his work.  - Besides‚Ä¶ <br>  - Yes, God bless them with sales.  Market, how much market do we have?  - Kallasvuo knew the answer to his question perfectly well, but could not deny himself the pleasure of hearing it again. <br>  - Thirty eight!  First place!  - King snapped. <br>  ‚ÄúMmmm ...‚Äù Olli-Pekka sat back in satisfaction over the back of the sofa and yawned.  - And without the "n-gay" cope. <br><br>  Jorma Ollila muttered something in displeasure, poured himself 50 grams and with a sharp movement sent them into his mouth. <br><br>  - In addition, - King did not let up, - we managed to increase the average cost of our mobile phones from 89 to 90 euros, thanks to the launch of the N95 model.  And profits grew by more than two ... <br>  - David, good already, eh!  - Ollila stopped him, nervously pouring himself another batch.  - Let's change the subject? <br><br>  - ABOUT!  - pleased Kallasvuo took a phone out of his jacket and dialed a long number. <br><br>  The doors of the bar in the American town of Palo Alto swung open, and a sad, bald man of about sixty entered the room.  This was not his first visit to this institution this year, because the barman recognized the guest without any difficulty and hurried to pour him a whiskey.  The guest slowly took the glass, made a couple of circular movements to them in the air, shaking it up, and in a gulp discharged it from the contents. <br><br>  - Twenty-eight fucking millions have already lost.  Twenty-eight, do you hear?  - the man turned to the bartender. <br>  ‚ÄúAlas, alas,‚Äù the man on the other side of the bar continued to calmly rub the glasses. <br>  ‚ÄúTwenty-eight ...‚Äù the balding man slapped his forehead with his hand.  - Do you know who we leaked?  Samsung!  Himself-sun-gu! <br>  ‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù the bartender nodded lazily. <br>  - Twenty-eight ... Samsung ... <br><br>  The barman silently poured whiskey to the guest.  He took the glass and wanted to drain it, when suddenly the phone squeaked in his pocket.  A man with an awkward movement picked up the phone, dropping a handkerchief and a business card with the name of Motorola CEO Ed Zander. <br><br>  - Hello. <br>  - Hello, Ed?  - Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo's cheerful voice was hard to miss. <br>  - Yes. <br>  - Hellomoto! <br>  - Not funny.  And don't call here anymore!  - hissed Zander and turned off the phone. <br><br>  The head of Motorola in one gulp poured half a glass of whiskey into himself, hiccupped and thought: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already gotten all the money with this‚Äú raiser ‚Äù, and that's it ...‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12897/</a></p>
