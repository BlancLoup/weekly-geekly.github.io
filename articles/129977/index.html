I read, not to say that very much, but often: in transport, at lunch, before going to bed - 2-3 books per month in total.  Paper torn, wear out, heavy and more than one to carry is uncomfortable.  In addition, I am not an esthete, and the rustling of paper and turning the pages do not cause me a seething excitement.  So there were no difficulties in solving this problem. <br>  It remains to make a choice.  And now it is already quite extensive - every self-respecting and self-respecting manufacturer has thrown its devices onto the market.  In the same DNS-e there were quite adequate things, like L-book, PocketBook, even 7-inch ones.  But I wanted something like that.  From Google and the memory offered Amazon Kindle and Sony. <br>  Having long doubted and choosing between two undoubtedly outstanding readers, I still stopped at Kindle.  The decisive factor was the price and size of the display. <br>  I waited a long time for the price of the reading room to fall to $ 100, but did not wait for the whole week. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I ordered Kindle at Amazon for $ 139: with Wi-Fi, free 3G and advertising (without advertising it would cost $ 50 more).  To do this, for 2.5% (a little more than 150 rubles) I got a virtual card Qiwi, with which you can pay in online stores.  Through Shipito brought him to Russia.  I was a little afraid, because I did it for the first time, but there were no problems. <br>  On September 23, I made an order, on the 25th, he was lying in a spike warehouse, on the 26th I was sent to Russia immediately after payment.  Delivery cost me $ 45.  Next, the parcel lay for a week at customs, and on the 5th it was already at the post office of my city. <br>  And you know, in complete safety, without bricks inside.  Reading the horrors of our mail, frankly, I am perplexed: I have never had any problems as I had to do with them.  And people do not work Hamlo.  Even in terms of the entire delay occurs at customs.  3 days, it seems, the parcel went across Russia.

      The device itself is extremely pleased with the assembly and display and functionality.  Naturally, nothing creaks anywhere until it falls off, does not bristle - everything is neat.  The display is bright and contrast - e-Ink Perl steers - because of it and chose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebc/eea/63f/ebceea63f9bab93e8801d9f8419393e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Books </h4><br>  Fiction reads perfectly, most formats are supported, if some are not supported or it is not very convenient to read them, that is, a free caliber converter, and you can send the necessary document to your personal email on amazon.com, the converted one will be sent directly to the Kindle. in mobi (native device format) file. <br><br><h4>  PDF </h4><br><br>  As for pdfov, then, frankly, 15 cm is not very convenient even in landscape orientation - the text is shallow, and some pictures are broken into two pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec6/17d/de6/ec617dde60b5a510ad3db3dd85f9a394.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The conversion turns the document into a clockwork mechanism spread out on the shelves - everything is neat, nothing works.  In general, there is no universal solution and it is necessary to adjust each file individually. <br><br><h4>  3G </h4><br>  3G really works.  Even in rather deaf places you can check mail and open a couple of pages, the browser is not very convenient, navigation is like in mini opera, but it is and it pleases. <br><br><h4>  Other </h4><br>  In addition, two English dictionaries are already built into the Kindle, and if a text is incomprehensible in the text, you can hover over it and the meaning of the word will appear at the top or bottom of the page.  The truth is it works only in English, of course.  I, who read mostly technical literature, are very helpful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d3/38c/a64/5d338ca6411d79c20c60ef628605907b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it may also be useful to be able to play the text in voice.  If it is possible for the document and is not prohibited by the author, then any text (it seems, also only in English) can be read by the person embedded in the Kindle.  So far I have not seriously checked it, but it can help to learn English (as a first step). <br><br>  Playing music is in the <i>experimental</i> section is not in vain.  There is no playlist and no track information at all.  Something like the iPod Shuffle, but without buttons.  And this is despite the fact that the built-in speakers produce quite high-quality sound, and what you need in the headphones plays.  I would not give up the opportunity to listen to music from him, despite the cries of others, that this is "a reader and this is not necessary from it."  Earlier, they talked about phones. <br><br>  And yes, by the way, the device, it came to me not advertising, but full-fledged - different beautiful pictures are shown in the screensaver, and banners are not shown in the main menu. <br><br>  But my wife was offended that I took a photo from all angles, but I don‚Äôt want her: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12c/576/bb4/12c576bb43c67eb520868a8958be3a88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only thing that caused the inconvenience at first was that I bought it for $ 140 with a stupid keyboard and no touch screen, and just a week later Kindle Touch appeared, these ‚Äúshortcomings‚Äù deprived of $ 100.  But the rat nibbled me only a couple of days.  After I used my reader, I realized that the touchscreen, in general, she doesn‚Äôt need anything - except that surfing the Internet would be easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129977/</a></p>
