This service is relevant not only for children who still believe in it, but also for adults - oddly enough, but those who don‚Äôt believe in Grandfather anyway want to return to childhood a little bit and order his performances to his corporate parties. ;) <br><br>  In the summer, we started creating the <a href="http://idedmoroz.com/">idedmoroz.com</a> service serving this highly specialized industry.

      It turned out that we have an all-Russian resource for professional and non-professional actors, as well as specialized agencies for conducting New Year's performances. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The project is designed as a modern platform, which has no analogues in this (at least) industry.  The system works as follows: the actor is registered, the moderator checks his profile and allows (or does not allow) to participate. <br><br>  From the moment the questionnaire is activated, the actor has two ways to receive orders: <br><ul><li>  Direct requests from customers that they leave with his application; </li><li>  Monitoring of orders exchange and independent booking of orders you like. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  A little bit how it is inside </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db5/657/fc8/db5657fc865ab60a59390e94852e2339.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>General view of the exchange: bookmarks by program, a list of available orders.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e7/777/031/2e7777031494d0fc2614260ece9654c6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Information about a specific order</i> <br><br>  Naturally, I want to make money, so there are several tariff plans for working with the site: both with a small subscription fee and without it.  I would especially like to note that the pricing policy is structured in such a way that the actors could recoup all the costs of using the project at the expense of just one accepted order! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8b/e1e/1d6/f8be1e1d64163d4cb58584c1ed1acd9c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>General view of submitting an application to Santa Claus</i> <br><br>  Thus, this project can be an excellent alternative to traditional methods of promoting its services both for market participants who have been working as Santa Clauses for many years and for beginners who have paid attention to this market and have decided to make money - it‚Äôs enough just to count the costs and effectiveness.  For example, the creation of a ‚Äúbusiness card‚Äù for New Year's services will cost from 6,000 to 12,000 rubles, plus advertising, which will eat at least a proportionate amount, plus some off-line (traditional) activity - total costs will be at least 25,000 rubles.  If you look at iDedMoroz.com, then all the advantages are immediately visible: a finished page with a description, photos, lists of orders;  the total cost of promotion will be the maximum cost of 2 orders, while the budget can be stretched over time, which is extremely convenient. <br><br><h5>  What advice do I need? </h5><br>  Of course, the actors are already registered on the site, for many this kind of work is new, someone deliberately calls and says thank you.  In general, participants like the project.  But I want to talk about the project to a larger number of actors (at the moment, about 1000 actors in Russia already know about it), so - advise some other ways, maybe offer something?  Of course I will be happy to criticize and answer questions, if any. <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131345/</a></p>
