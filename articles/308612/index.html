In addition, we have been interviewing our participants for more than a year now what conferences are missing in Russia.  And here's the result: December 10, Moscow will host the first of its kind deep technical conference on testing <b>Heisenbag 2016 Moscow</b> . <br><br>  Please note: Heisenbag is the ‚Äútesting‚Äù conference, not ‚Äúfor testers‚Äù.  We invite to the conference:

    <ul><li>  testers, </li><li>  programmers developing tests for their code (or thinking about it), </li><li>  automated testing specialists </li><li>  load testing specialists </li><li>  tmlidov who think about how to increase the effectiveness of testing in their projects. </li></ul><br>  So what kind of <b>techno-tin</b> are we preparing for you?  Look under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Conference program</b> </h4><br>  First of all, it should be noted once again that Heisenbag is not a QA conference: that is, it will be a question not of quality but of practical and rigorous testing on real projects, and in this respect Heisenbag will probably be the first conference in Russia.  (if this is not the case, write in the comments those testing conferences that you know and, preferably, what do you think about them) <br><br>  It is the approaches, problems and difficulties in the field of testing that will form the basis of 20 reports in three tracks.  Despite the fact that more than three months before the conference, we have 9 reports approved by the program committee. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/4ff/6e9/bde4ff6e9a48416fa2927153daafef53.JPG"><br><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/no_such_thing_as_manual_testing_and_other_confusions/"><b>Aegerter, Ilari Henrik - No Such Thing Manual Testing and Other Confusions</b></a> <br>  Renowned speaker in Europe and the USA, activist for improving the quality of testing (organized by the International Society for Software Testing (ISST)).  Conducts workshops on software testing. <br><br>  Still testing by hand?  Then we go to you!  (c) In his keyout, the speaker will show that there is no such thing as manual testing, and with living examples he argues his position. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/shopping_list_what_you_need_to_remember_when_running_jmeter_test/"><b>Vladimir Sitnikov - Shopping list: what you need not to forget when running JMeter tests</b></a> <br>  An architect at NetCracker, 10 hours per day optimizes the performance of distributed web solutions.  On duty, you should be able to load the system and analyze the metrics.  It will be about the proper use of JMeter, a popular open source tool for load testing. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/fillip_keks/"><b>Philip Keks - How to teach robots to play games?</b></a> <br>  An experienced developer, the last few years has been developing games.  Including the agile-team involved in the automation of testing.  As a speaker, we know him in our mobile area.  For Heisenbag, Phillip will rebuild the report closer to testing and tell you how to write auto tests for unity3d mobile games when the game evolves evolutionarily. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/page_objects_better_simple_than_sorry/"><b>Alexey Vinogradov - Page Objects: less is better</b></a> <br>  An international speaker who now lives in Germany (hijacked into slavery for his services :)) and consults a huge number of companies.  The report will be devoted to Page Objects pitfalls and examples when simple code solves problems better than too clever ones. <br><br>  Alexey firmly believes that testing can be done better and therefore organizes officers RadioQA podcasts that collect tens of thousands of auditions.  Contributor to selenide. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Anton Angelov - Eight Assessment Criteria for Tests' Architecture Design</b> <br>  Anton Angelov does not speak Russian, but he speaks well with a computer - QA architect at Progress, the ideologist <a href="http://automatetheplanet.com/"><b>of the software quality movement</b></a> and the author of articles in QualityMatters Magazine. <br><br>  The report will tell you how to seize a test suite using an engineering approach: what metrics to look at in order to ensure optimal coverage of the application with tests. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/testing_distributed_systems/"><b>Andrey Satarin - Testing Distributed Systems</b></a> <br>  An expert in testing distributed systems from Yandex will tell you what distinguishes a distributed system from a conventional one in terms of development, not so much development, as correct testing.  Share the experience of testing the real system, which is developed in Yandex.  It will not remain behind the scenes and the fact that testing in distributed systems is impossible or very difficult. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/appium_automation_for_apps/"><b>Dan Cuellar - Appium: Automation for Apps</b></a> <br>  Creator of a mobile application testing framework (web, hybrid, native) and ex-head of QA at Shazam in London.  Tested MS Outlook for Mac.  Evangelist of open source and software quality. <br><br>  In his report, Dan will talk about the features of the Appium framework, look under the hood, and show, as an example, how to write scripts for webdriver in almost any programming language. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/talks/page_objects_better_simple_than_sorry/"><b>Anton Semenchenko - Variants of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù parallelization of Selenium WebDriver tests: from tools to architecture</b></a> <br>  Report on parallelization of tests in webdriver: a problem faced by all projects when the load becomes so high that one instance cannot generate multiple test runs. <br><br>  Anton, as the organizer of two powerful communities in Belarus - testing and C ++, can not only lead an active discussion, but also ignite the audience.  This report will be hot. <br><hr><br>  <b>Igor Hrol</b> <br>  In the testing industry for over 10 years.  Now he is engaged in testing in toptal, instructs testers and popularizes the engineering approach to testing. <br><br>  In the demo report, we will write tests on a web application, while not being ashamed of using full stuffing: we will analyze JSON scripts, run auxiliary modules using JavaScript, but the whole binding will be in Ruby.  Asserts, generation of get-requests, analysis of answers ... all this is done with an architectural look at the solution and tests. <br><br><hr><br><h4>  <b>Call for papers</b> </h4><br>  If you have something to talk about something technical Russian community - <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/callforpapers/"><b>give us a report</b></a> !  The list of the most ‚Äúhot topics‚Äù is below, however we are ready to consider your suggestions if you think that we have missed some questions: <br><br><ul><li>  Test automation; </li><li>  Stress Testing; </li><li>  Performance testing, benchmarking; </li><li>  Integration testing of modular / distributed systems; </li><li>  Concurrency testing; </li><li>  Testing mobile applications; </li><li>  Manual testing; </li><li>  UX, Security, A / B, static code analysis, code and product metrics, etc .; </li><li>  Instrumentation, environment for testing; </li><li>  Comparison tools for testing; </li><li>  Testing in gamedev; </li></ul><br> <a href="http://heisenbug.ru/callforpapers/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/3ea/69c/c513ea69ca454da99e1fcc946036bef7.jpg"></a> <br>  If you have already performed somewhere and have met with a warm welcome from the audience and organizers, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.
