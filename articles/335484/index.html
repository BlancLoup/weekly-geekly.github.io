All bureaucratic chores behind, helpdesk your!  What's next?  And then the most interesting - implementation.  To adjust everything so that helpdesk helped the company to improve service, but did not remain a column in expenses.  We have prepared a small cheat sheet, which will simplify your life when introducing helpdesk.  See our checklist for nothing to forget. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Why implement helpdesk </h3><br>  Before setting up, sit down with the team again and speak the implementation goals.  Describe what kind of future you see with the help.  If you find it difficult, keep a few ideas.

      <b>1. Simplify problem solving for customers</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Helpdesk should be invisible, because customers do not concern the internal kitchen support.  They do not have to memorize ticket numbers and answer the same questions several times. </li><li>  Clients are not kicking in terms of problem resolution.  They know how much to wait for a decision, and if something changes, the support will send a notification. </li><li>  Answers and instructions from the support are clear and easy to read, because they have formatting, pictures and useful links. </li></ul><br>  <b>2. Help the team focus on helping customers</b> <br><br>  The helpdesk interface helps employees answer customer questions faster.  The employee immediately sees what to work with him, and does not waste time on scavenging garbage from the box.  At hand, all the information about the client, and do not have to search the history of calls or switch between systems and windows.  No need to copy standard answers from notepad - with the staff responsible for the templates in a second.  If you need to consult a colleague, just call him in the helpdesk comments.  No endless mail forwarding. <br><br>  <b>3. Get rid of tedious manual work</b> <br><br>  Everything that can be automated, automated.  Even if the employee made a mistake with the tag or status, the helpdesk will add the necessary parameters.  Letters are sorted by subject and assigned to the responsible.  Auto-responses are sent to customers, and employees are notified when their help is needed. <br><br>  <b>4. Receive helpful reports</b> <br><br>  Statistics show how many complaints are received and how employees cope.  Immediately it is clear, then the team is filonite, and who works well.  Clients evaluate employee responses and give advice on how to improve support.  The manager sees if something goes wrong and can fix the problem on time. <br><br><h3>  Implementation Checklist </h3><br>  Understood with the picture of the future, now we take the check-list and put the jackdaws. <br><br>  <b>Customize inbox</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Check mailboxes support.  Addresses are relevant, the letters do not go to spam.  Check which box the form addresses go to on the site. </li><li>  Set up shipment from support boxes so that letters arrive in the helpdesk. </li><li>  Check the address of outgoing emails.  If the email from the helpdesk goes to the client from the wrong address, then the client will answer you nowhere. </li></ul><br>  <b>Case management</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Create tags - categories and topics of questions.  They are useful for sorting, working rules and statistics. </li><li>  Create folders or filters for query parameters.  For example, employees should see new requests or assigned to them with a specific theme in order to start work immediately, without losing time. </li><li>  Create rules according to which incoming letters are sorted and distributed among employees and departments. </li><li>  Create rules that determine the priority and change the status of requests.  For example, if a customer does not respond within a week, let the request close automatically. </li></ul><br>  <b>Answers</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  Add templates to answer standard questions for each group of employees.  Check that attachments are attached and links in the text lead where necessary. </li><li>  Add to action templates.  For example, assign a category or status depending on the content of the response. </li><li>  Set up auto-response when you receive a letter from the client. </li><li>  Create personal signatures for staff or team members.  A signature will be added at the end of each response. </li></ul><br>  <b>To train the team</b> <br><br>  After setting up, create instructions for employees on how to use the helpdesk.  This instruction will help beginners go to battle faster. <br><br>  What should be in the instructions: <br><br><ul><li>  How to use statuses, priorities and response templates. </li><li>  When and which tags to use. </li><li>  When and to whom to assign requests. </li></ul><br>  Changing query parameters will determine which automatic rule will be launched.  Therefore, if an employee chooses the wrong tag or status, the entire process logic will break.  For example, the letter will fall into the wrong queue, and the answer will be expired, or by mistake, the client will receive the wrong auto answer.  Or 100 auto-answers, and he will take you for spammers.  Therefore, it is better to conduct a small training and consolidate the success of the verification tests.  Before the combat launch, make sure that the employees have no questions left ‚Äúbut what is this button for?‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Testing</b> <br><br>  Before launching real letters from customers, it remains to practice ‚Äúon cats‚Äù.  Otherwise, instead of improving support, you can spoil everything in one day. <br><br><ul><li>  Highlight a test group of employees and assign a test schedule.  Choose the least loaded time for the test. </li><li>  Send test emails to all connected mailboxes and reply via helpdesk. </li><li>  Check the operation of each rule.  To do this, simulate the process scripts: 1) send an email with the parameters for which the rule should work;  2) check how the statuses change, which queue gets and to whom the request is assigned. </li><li>  Send a pool of typical questions.  So you check if there are enough templates and tags loaded. </li></ul><br>  If all the checkboxes are checked, exhale and go into battle! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335484/</a></p>
