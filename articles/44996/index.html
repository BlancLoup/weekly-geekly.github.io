  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Runet (2002‚Äì2009). Rip</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the 90s, Robert Metklaf, the creator of Ethernet technology, came up with a formula according to which the effectiveness of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of its users.  Many researchers are inclined to believe that this particular formula has become almost the main cause of the emergence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">bubble of the new Internet economy</a> . <br><br>  The theory of dotcoms says: the only way to survive for an Internet company is to increase the number of users as quickly as possible, even if it entails huge financial losses.  In the midst of the dotcom boom, it became possible to place IPOs by companies that did not have any income.  ‚ÄúBecome big or die‚Äù was the philosophy of that time. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Venture capitalists believed so strongly in the new economy that they began to indiscriminately invest huge sums in any enterprises whose business plans included the word ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù.

      $ 82.5 million was invested in <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">Pets.com</a> , <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys.com</a> came up with an IPO and raised $ 166 million. Financial injections into questionable Internet businesses were so huge from 1995 to 2000 that the NASDAQ index of high-tech companies reached 5048, 62 points. <br><br>  The comicity of the situation reached such a level that some ‚Äúnew entrepreneurs‚Äù issued shares, having no office, no properly registered company, or employees. <br><br>  But on March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ index dropped to its usual mark of 4580 points and continued to fall.  The flagships of the new economy were ruined one by one.  From March 2000 to October 2002, the market value of high-tech companies fell by $ 5 trillion.  It took the Internet economy three years to regain investor confidence. <br><br>  There are many theories about the causes of the dotcom crash.  According to one of them, the main problem of Internet companies of that time was that they set the same task for themselves - to monopolize the market with the help of new technologies.  Obviously, 9 out of 10 companies in this situation should have been left behind - two number 1 on the market can not be. <br><br>  Then few survived, but the best - <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> , <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>  , <a href="http://ebay.com/">eBay</a> and some others.  Now we can say that the collapse of the dot-com gave the world the Internet, which we now admire with you. <br><br>  I am telling this story, because a holiday finally happened on our street.  The crisis has put people in a very interesting position - the ru. Entrepreneur for the first time, it seems, for a long time thought about what he spends his money on. <br><br>  The words "metrics", "business analysis", "competitive advantages", "monetization", "efficiency" appear slowly and difficultly in the IT managers' daily lexicon.  With great difficulty in people, the ability to think again wakes up. <br><br>  I want very much to hope that this crisis will be long enough for the ‚Äúthinking before doing‚Äù skill to become a habit.  And the world will be better. <habracut></habracut><br><br>  * <br>  This text was first published in the Akzia newspaper as part of my local <a href="http://akzia.ru/column/wigt/">wigt</a> column.
