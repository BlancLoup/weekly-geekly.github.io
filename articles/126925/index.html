The standards have risen, the amount of data has grown disproportionately, and now there are serious requirements for collaboration systems, including not only efficiency gains, but also simplification of work with software. <br><br>  In 2010, Gartner agency analysts <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9180447/IBM_Gartner_spar_over_Notes_report">called the</a> IBM Lotus Notes <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9180447/IBM_Gartner_spar_over_Notes_report">platform the</a> most optimal implementation of the e-mail tool as a corporate communications center.

Lotus usage statistics are <a href="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/ru/download/ibm_1.pdf">truly impressive</a> - more than half of the Fortune 100‚Äôs largest companies in the world use Lotus solutions.

      It is unlikely that IBM could have achieved such success for its product if it had not updated it in accordance with technological trends and innovations.  Moreover, a Lotusphere conference is held annually in the United States dedicated to the Lotus platform and gathering thousands of listeners and dozens of speakers.  But here, in Russia, IBM does not forget to share the secrets of success - this year the <a href="http://ibm.com/ru/events/lotusforum2011%3F711BU19W">14th IBM Lotus Forum</a> will take place in Moscow. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Yesterday </h4><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5810/38354331.0/0_5158b_e57bbd1_XXL.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  IBM has held joint meetings for several decades, since 1925 and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/124135/">first meeting of the</a> Hundred Percent Club.  This is a good tradition, which allows exchanging existing experience to representatives of various organizations and companies. <br><br>  At the IBM Lotus Forum in Moscow, about 500 people gather annually in a warm atmosphere, discussing their own projects built with the help of Lotus. <br><br>  Last year, we were told about how SamarNeftegaz automated the process of agreeing documents for the development of oil fields, as a result of which the rate of completion of the preparatory stages of documentation increased by 26%. <br><br>  Moscomarchitecture has deployed an information system of urban planning based on IBM WebSphere, thus optimizing work with heterogeneous data and providing a single information to the Moscow government apparatus, for coordinating urban planning plans. <br><br>  Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia, launched a single platform throughout the branch network to work with customer appeals and analysis created on the basis of the Lotus Domino platform.  And VTB deployed an electronic document management system using IBM Lotus / Domino products and connected 57 branches of the bank to it, thus accelerating the interaction between the branches of the bank. <br><br>  In 2010, the administration of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District completed its part of the e-government program by creating a public services portal based on IBM portal solutions, integrating the Lotus Notes document management system. <br><br>  The result of this work was the simplicity of obtaining information from the registers of the state housing stock and the state.  property by all residents of the county connected to the Internet.  Now they can send applications for receiving various state services through the network and track their passage through the instances. <br><br>  Each year, many respondents share interesting experiences integrating IBM solutions into business and management.  And IBM has extensive and international experience in creating electronic administrative control systems. <br><br><h4>  Tomorrow </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8858013/ibmlotus.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Well, on September 20, 2011, we are waiting for everyone at the Renaissance Moscow Hotel (Olympic Avenue 18/1) at the <a href="http://ibm.com/ru/events/lotusforum2011%3F711BU19W">annual IBM Lotus Forum</a> , where IBM's leading experts will acquaint everyone with IBM Lotus solutions with which you can deploy an entire business network inside enterprises, use innovative collaboration tools and organize clients into interactive communities.
