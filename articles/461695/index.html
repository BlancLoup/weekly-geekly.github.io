Search for candidates, preparation of a curriculum, organization of classes - all these guys implemented together with the HR department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/gt/ic/khgticvx9forz8qpq7teh3dalfm.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Reasons for creating </h3><br>  In the Krasnodar office of Plarium, there were several vacancies of the VFX department that could not be closed for two years.  Moreover, the company could not find not only middle and senior, but also juniors.  The load on the department grew, it was necessary to solve something.

      Things were like this: all Krasnodar VFX specialists were already employees of Plarium.  In other cities, the situation was not much better.  Suitable frames worked mainly in the cinema, and this direction of VFX is somewhat different from the gaming one.  In addition, calling a candidate from another city is a risk.  A person may simply not like the new place of residence, and he will leave back. <br><br>  The HR department proposed to grow specialists on their own.  The art department did not have such experience yet, but the advantages were obvious.  The company could receive young employees living in Krasnodar and prepare them in accordance with its standards.  The course was planned to be conducted offline in order to look for local guys and interact with the interns personally. <br><br>  The idea seemed successful to everyone.  The implementation, with the support of the HR department, was undertaken by Vadim Golovkov and Anton Gritsai from the VFX department. <br><br><h3>  Search for candidates </h3><br>  They decided to search in local universities.  VFX is at the junction of technical and artistic specialties, therefore, the company was primarily interested in candidates studying in technical areas and having artistic skills. <br><br>  The work was carried out with three universities: Kuban State University, Kuban State Technological University and Kuban State Agrarian University.  HR specialists agreed with the leadership on conducting presentations, where together with Anton or Vadim they told everyone about the profession and offered to send applications for internships.  Requests were requested to attach any work that might fit as a portfolio, as well as a short summary and cover letter.  Teachers and deans helped spread the word: they spoke about VFX courses to promising students.  After several presentations, applications gradually began to arrive. <br><br><h3>  Selection </h3><br>  In total, the company received 61 applications.  Particular attention was paid to cover letters: it was important to understand what exactly the direction interested the person in and how motivated he was to learn.  Most of the guys did not hear about VFX, but many after the presentations began to actively collect information.  In letters, they talked about their goals in the field, sometimes even used professional terms. <br><br>  As a result of the initial selection, 37 interviews were scheduled.  Each of them was attended by Vadim or Anton and a specialist from HR.  Unfortunately, not all candidates knew what VFX was.  Some said this was due to music or the creation of 3D models.  Although there were those who responded with quotes from articles of future mentors, which certainly impressed them.  As a result of the interviews, a group of trainees of 8 people was formed. <br><br><h3>  Syllabus </h3><br>  Vadim already had a ready-made curriculum for an online course, designed for one lesson per week for three months.  They took it as a basis, but the training time was reduced to two months.  The number of classes, on the contrary, was increased by planning two per week.  In addition, I wanted to do more practical exercises under the guidance of mentors.  Practice in the presence of a teacher would allow children to receive feedback right in the process of work.  This could save time and immediately direct them in the right direction. <br><br>  It was assumed that each lesson would take 3-4 hours.  Everyone understood: the course will be a serious burden for both teachers and interns.  Anton and Vadim had to spend personal time preparing for classes, and also take from 6 to 8 hours of overtime weekly.  In addition to studying at the university, the interns had to learn a huge amount of information and come to Plarium twice a week.  But the result that I wanted to achieve was very important, so they expected full feedback from the participants. <br><br>  They decided to direct the course program to studying the basic Unity tools and the basic principles for creating visual effects.  Thus, after graduation, each trainee had the opportunity to further develop his skills, even if Plarium decided not to offer him a job.  When the vacancy opens again, a person could come and try again - with new knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fq/h_/br/fqh_brorrardt_neidavk_iabgo.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Training organization </h3><br>  For classes, a hall was allocated in the studio.  Trainees bought computers and the necessary software, and workplaces were also equipped for them.  Each intern signed a temporary labor contract for a period of 2 months, and, in addition, the guys signed the NDA.  At the office, they were to be accompanied by HR mentors or employees. <br><br>  Vadim and Anton immediately drew the attention of the guys to corporate culture, because in Plarium business ethics occupies a special place.  They explained to the interns that the company will not be able to hire everyone, but an important indicator in assessing their skills will be the ability to help fellow students and maintain friendly relations within the training group.  And the guys never behaved hostile to each other.  On the contrary, it was clear that they rallied and actively communicate with each other.  The friendly atmosphere was maintained throughout the course. <br><br>  A significant amount of money and effort was invested in the training of interns.  It was important that the children did not include those who would leave mid-course.  The efforts of the mentors were not in vain: no one had ever missed a lesson, did not delay the completion of homework.  But the training took place at the end of winter, it was easy to catch a cold, many just had a session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/gs/z3/mogsz3tpkb6o2ikriyerzjy9teu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  The last two classes have been devoted to test work.  The task is to make a slash effect.  The children had to apply all the theoretical and practical knowledge they had received and show the result that corresponded to the terms of reference.  Create a mesh, set up an animation, develop your own shader ... The work was ahead. <br><br>  However, this was not a passing exam: passed - passed, no - goodbye.  Mentors evaluated not only the technical potential of interns, but also their soft skills.  During the training, it became clear who is more suitable for the company, who will be able to come and join the team, so in the last lesson they checked the assimilation of the material.  And a good result could be an additional plus in the piggy bank of the intern or an occasion to reflect on his candidacy. <br><br>  As a result of training, the company made a job offer of 3 out of 8 interns.  Of course, having got into the VFX team and faced with real tasks, the guys realized that they still have a lot to learn.  But now they have successfully joined the team and are preparing to become real specialists. <br><br><h3>  Mentor Experience </h3><br><blockquote>  <b>Vadim Golovkov</b> : In addition to the mentoring skill, the course gave me the opportunity to communicate with those who are taking the first steps in the industry.  I remember myself when I came to the studio and saw a game dev from the inside.  I was impressed!  Then, over time, we all get used to it and begin to treat work as ordinary.  But, having met these guys, I immediately remembered myself and my burning eyes. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>Anton Gritsai</b> : Some things are repeated at work day after day and seem obvious.  You already have a doubt creeping in: is this precisely important knowledge?  But when you prepare the curriculum, you notice that the topic is complex.  At such moments you realize that what is simple for you is a real barrier for these guys.  And then you see how grateful they are, and you understand what useful business you are doing.  It charges you, inspires. </blockquote><br><h3>  Trainee Reviews </h3><br><blockquote>  <b>Vitaliy Zuev</b> : One day people from Plarium came to my university who told me what VFX is and who does it.  For me, all this was new.  Until that moment, I had not thought at all about working with 3D, and especially about the effects separately. <br><br>  At the presentation, we were told that everything could send applications for training and that examples of work would be a plus, not a necessity.  That evening I began to study videos and articles, trying to find more information about VFX. <br><br>  I liked everything during the training, probably in the course of the minuses.  The pace was comfortable, tasks feasible.  All the necessary information was presented in the classroom.  Moreover, we were told exactly how to do our homework, so all that was needed was to come and listen carefully.  The only thing was that there wasn‚Äôt enough opportunity to review the material covered at home. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>Alexandra Alikumova</b> : When I heard that there will be a meeting with Plarium employees at the university, at first I didn‚Äôt even believe it.  At that time I already knew about this company.  She knew that the requirements for candidates were quite high and that Plarium had not conducted internships before.  And then the guys came and said that they were ready to take students, teach VFX, and even take the best ones to work.  Everything happened right before the New Year, so it seemed completely unreal! <br><br>  I collected and sent my work.  Then the bell rang, and now I almost got into a game dev, I sit and talk with Anton.  Before the interview, I was very worried, but after five minutes I forgot about it.  I was struck by the energy guys.  It was clear that they were doing what they loved. <br><br>  During the training, topics were given in such a way as to lay in our heads the basic principles of creating visual effects.  If someone didn‚Äôt succeed, then the teacher or fellow students came to the rescue and together we solved the problem, so no one lagged behind.  We studied in the evening and finished quite late.  By the end of the class, everyone was usually tired, but despite this they did not lose their positive attitude. <br><br>  Two months passed very quickly.  During this time I learned a lot about VFX, learned basic skills for creating effects, met cool guys and got a bunch of pleasant emotions.  So yes, it was worth it. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>Nina Zozulya</b> : It all started when people from Plarium came to our university and offered students free tuition.  Before that, I hadn‚Äôt focused on VFX purposefully.  I did something on guides, but only for my mini-projects.  After the courses I was hired. <br><br>  In general, I liked everything.  Classes ended, of course, late, and leaving the tram was not always convenient, but it‚Äôs a trifle.  And they taught very well and understandably. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461695/</a></p>
