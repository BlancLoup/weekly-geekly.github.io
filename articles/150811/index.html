And the son of Tsiolkovsky, too. <br><h6>  <sub>the answer is attributed to N. Kozyrev</sub> </h6><br>  <b>Who is Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev?</b> <br>  - the owner of the "diamond star" of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) - the highest award among astronomers (only two Soviet citizens had such an award - Y. Gagarin and N. Kozyrev). <br>  - The author of the theory of extended stellar atmospheres <br>  - author of the theory of sunspots <br>  - the creator of "Asymmetric causal mechanics" of one of the most interesting scientific theories about the properties of time. <br><br>  On the last point and will be discussed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  N. Kozyrev published the first article on "Causal Mechanics" in 1958, but he began working on this topic as early as 1951. Therefore, the very first publication turned out to be quite well developed, suggesting a fairly voluminous and completely revolutionary theory.  For the mechanics being created (in the sense of Newton) he proposed the following axiom system: 
      <br>

      <br>
      1. Cause and effect are always separated by space, between them there is an arbitrarily small but non-zero <i>dx</i> <br>  2. Cause and effect are always divided by time, between them there is an arbitrarily small but non-zero <i>dt</i> <br>  3. Time has an absolute property - directionality, the cause always precedes the effect. <br><br>  So far, nothing new.  The first axiom is the basis of Newton's mechanics, but <i>dt = 0 is</i> assumed there (you didn‚Äôt know? I, too).  The second axiom is used in the mechanics of the microworld. <br><br>  From such a system of axioms, it follows that a cause passes into a consequence only through a non-zero ‚Äúempty‚Äù point with dimensions <i>dx</i> and <i>dt of</i> arbitrarily small magnitude.  Attitude <br><br>  <i>dx / dt = c <sub>2</sub></i> (1) <br>  may well be a finite value and will represent a measure of the relationship of the course of time with the value of space.  Thus, in all Newton's laws, and in general, wherever the concept of space is used, an additional quantity arises that influences the result.  In addition, based on the third axiom, the value of <i>c <sub>2</sub></i> should have some similarity with the vector, although in formula 1 it appears as a scalar.  Kozyrev proposed the term ‚Äúpseudoscalar‚Äù for her, emphasizing the fact that a change in the sign of <i>dt</i> does not mean a change in the direction of the flow of time, but only leads to a change in the spatial arrangement of the pair ‚Äúcause -&gt; effect‚Äù.  Those.  if we look at the process from the cause to the effect, <i>dt</i> must be positive, and if vice versa, then negative.  In this case, by the way, Newton's third law (force of action = force of counteraction) acquires a slightly different meaning.  In the case of a gain or loss <i>dt</i> , the transmission of the interaction will result in a positive or negative difference in forces, which can be easily measured.  The estimated order of it, though it turns out 10 ^ -6 g., Is not enough, but laboratory scales allow us to notice this change.  This very rough argument causes a lot of substantiated criticism and is found only in early works on causal mechanics. <a href="http://www.nkozyrev.ru/bd/023.php">Later, the</a> analysis of the transition of time into energy (force) is made much more thoroughly and cannot be simply refuted.  According to Kozyrev's reasoning, the ‚Äúpassage of time‚Äù rotates clockwise in the plane perpendicular to the axis ‚Äúcause-&gt; effect‚Äù and counterclockwise for the opposite direction.  Time as two gyroscope rotating in opposite directions - one collapses the space in the cause, the other unfolds in consequence.  This difficult moment is always analyzed in detail in his <a href="http://www.nkozyrev.ru/index.php">works</a> .  After formulating these hypotheses, Kozyrev comes to the conclusion that it is not necessary to argue further and is simply harmful, it is enough to draw conclusions for an experiment.  For understandable reasons, for experiments, various tops or gyroscopes were initially used, where the maximum numerical effect can be achieved. <br><br>  However, it turned out everything is not so simple.  The first experiment with a toy gyro on ordinary laboratory scales gave a positive result.  When the axis was rotated up clockwise, the gyroscope became lighter, and upside-down it became heavier, but repeated exact experience with the aircraft gyroscope did not work out in any way.  Moreover, the experience with the children's gyroscope also gave unstable results.  I had to go back to theory.  Kozyrev suggested that, in contrast to spatial coordinates, time propagates through the universe equally.  This is actually required by the third axiom.  Time can not always keep the same direction, if the interaction will not be transmitted through it instantly.  This strange phrase is still controversial, but in the original, everything is a bit wrong.  "The entire material Universe is only a point on the axis of time, directed from the past to the future."  This is a slightly different matter and leads to a completely different view of the experiments.  It turns out that when you try to measure the flow of time, you deal with the whole Universe at once.  For this reason, unlike many other physical experiments, here we must build an open-loop system, otherwise no measurement of the effect of time on physical quantities will be obtained.  This is not just a strange situation, it means the risk of getting repetitive results.  And this is a fundamental requirement of physics.  No one will believe you if the results of your experiments can not be repeated.  On the other hand, it became clear why it did not go.  As if we measure the air temperature with a wet thermometer without taking into account the influence of the wind.  But there's nothing you can do, such is the nature of the phenomenon under study.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough for us to at least prove a qualitative connection,‚Äù Kozyrev says and continues to experiment. <br><br>  The engineer Nasonov, who worked with Kozyrev, noticed that the shaft vibrates in the children's gyroscope due to play in the bearings.  Vibration is transmitted to the scales and the support, which means that the system ceases to be closed and we get the expected result.  Eureka!  In the aviation gyro spoil bearings, it vibrates - the result is!  The meticulous Kozyrev demands to move the vibration from the gyroscope to the support of the weights and in the same direction of rotation of the gyroscope gets weighting.  If the cause of non-closure in a gyroscope - we get a reduction in weight, and if the reason in the scales - weighting.  <i>dt</i> changes the sign, so the consequence must also change the sign.  As Kozyrev writes, ‚Äúwe look at the rotation from the side of the cause in the direction of the effect‚Äù.  Everything, the theory is qualitatively confirmed. <br><br>  However, very strange results are obtained.  And the theory is what to say.  With fairly obvious assumptions, the consequences are very unusual for science.  Moreover, it occurs to someone that the Earth also rotates like a gyroscope, and this should also have an impact on the result.  They counted, took into account, checked that something is the same.  The result is different, again poorly repeated.  In the winter one, in the summer another.  So you need to look for other options for the experiment.  We try to hang the gyroscope on the pendulum.  There is a deviation in the right direction, but very small, with the 3rd pendulum only 0.05 mm and non-constant.  And here a brilliant idea reappears - if the external environment influences the result so much, so let's manipulate the environment! <br><br>  What are we doing?  To obtain the effect of deflection of the pendulum, Kozyrev simply heats / cools the point of suspension.  The result is consistent with theory.  Opponents object - twisting the thread.  Well, then he attaches an electric motor to the end of a long board, at the other end an elastic band is attached to the nail, the second end of which sits eccentrically on the motor shaft.  Such a source of vibration work with a far-separated cause and effect.  We bring the electric motor to the pendulum - a deviation in one direction, we bring the nail in the other.  We change the direction of rotation of the engine - the deviation also reverses.  And this is in the complete absence of any mechanical connection between the pendulum and, um-m, the board.  Reduce the distance between cause and effect ... The effect disappears.  It would be enough for me, everything seems to be very clear.  But here the fundamentals of modern physics are touched upon, the result must be such that no one can challenge it.  And with this case is just full of seams.  Experiments are repeated in Japan - a brilliant confirmation, in Germany and in America - failure (later it turned out that they did not apply vibration to the gyroscope, but this later ...).  In short, somehow everything is unclear.  Yes, and these vibrations ... Anyone understands that if you put a vibrating thing on the scales, you will normally weigh nothing.  Especially with an accuracy of 10 ^ -6 g. Even somehow trying undignified. <br><br>  Therefore - we continue.  By this time, Kozyrev, observing the instability of the results of experiments, introduced the concept of "density" of time and began attempts to take into account its influence on the experiment.  In addition to the board with stretched rubber, a mechanism was built raising and lowering a certain 10 kg load (a bucket with water apparently).  As a result, several strange results were obtained - the decrease in the influence of these factors with increasing distance did not occur in a quadratic relation (as in all natural forces without exception), but linearly.  I had to think on this topic.  Kozyrev writes that the reason for such strangeness is that the rotation can only be in the plane, i.e.  time sets the plane, not the line, and everything falls into place. <br><br>  A series of experiments begins, for which Soviet science dubbed Kozyrev the "false scientist."  To increase the sensitivity, we make torsion scales (the yoke is suspended on a long thread, the scales are balanced, only the rotation is measured), one heat / cool effect seems to be there, but ambiguous and weak.  We change the conditions: we make unequal torsion scales, with a shoulder ratio of 1:10, different weights and different lengths of the suspension thread, we find that their sensitivity has increased significantly and you can work normally.  We place the scales under a glass flask to avoid the influence of air currents and begin to shaman outside.  We bring different objects and processes to the flask, we are on paper, we burn candles, dissolve sugar in a glass by stirring it in different directions, we just think very hard next to it - the scales turn.  Scales are attracted to any deformation, impact, deviations of air flow, hourglass, light absorption, the presence of an observer (!) And any processes associated with friction.  The arrow of the scales is repelled by the processes emitting time, and is attracted to the processes absorbing time.  As Kozyrev writes: ‚Äútime is drawn in by the cause and compacted by the effect‚Äù.  A kind of "wind of time" turns scales.  This proves the effect of causal processes of any (!) Nature on the gauge.  In addition, the need arose to correctly orient the scales to the cardinal points, in some directions they work more or less normally, in others there is practically no.  A special story came out with the presence of an observer.  I had to remove it into the far part of the laboratory complex (through several rooms), and observe the result of the experiment through a window through binoculars ... Interesting experience that any housewife can do in the kitchen: irreversible deformation of bodies leads to a temporary (up to 10 min.) Change them inert masses, which can be fixed (according to Einstein's equivalence principle) by ordinary weights.  Kozyrev threw heavy balls from a ball-bearing onto a lead plate and then weighed it.  The same experience can be done with a ball on an elastic band.  We weigh the ball, then we chat it on an elastic band, we weigh it again.  Kozyrev himself writes that the simplest experiments are repeated for some reason, the worst of all.  True, the change in weight is also small, such scales will not find in any kitchen. <br><br>  In addition, it turned out that objects quite quickly (in a couple of tens of seconds) remember what the density of time was around and keep this value in the ‚Äúhead‚Äù for about 15 minutes with forgetting along a logarithmic curve.  The scales themselves are also subject to this miracle.  After several hours of work, it is necessary either to change the scales, or to take a break for a day or two.  Later, the experiment can be repeated, otherwise - again the seams.  Whatever it was, the effect of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù was repeatedly confirmed and at the same time more and more understandable became the causes of numerous failures in the past and the correct measurement technique was gradually formed. <br>  Along the way, it turned out that aluminum foil reflects time (how does it sound?) With a factor of 0.5.  Experiments have shown that this reflection occurs according to the same laws as in optics.  Then they remembered that Kozyrev was still an astronomer, and it was happening at Pulkovo and right there they stuck the torsional balance into the focus of the mirror telescope (a purely scientific curiosity, apparently). <br><br>  For the convenience of experiments with a telescope, torsion scales were first replaced with a disk, and then completely with a resistor bridge, since it was found that the change in the density of time perfectly affects the resistance of the conductors.  In addition, the use of the bridge made it possible to compensate to a considerable degree for the influence of the natural ‚Äúflows‚Äù of time that had so hindered earlier and made the measurements much cleaner.  Immediately it turned out that the resistor is not affected by the refraction of the atmosphere and the telescope looks exactly where the star would have been visible if there was no atmosphere.  The predictable result, which however, made the experimenters nervous.  Again, out of pure scientific curiosity, someone sent a telescope to the calculation point, where this star is located at a given time, without taking into account that its light flew a couple of thousand years to the Earth.  And I found that the bridge recorded its presence there.  Well, yes, that's right, time, according to the theory, spreads instantly ... This result is still pretty shocking to the astronomical community, but it is very easy to repeat it and it does not cause doubts, the only question is in explanation.  And the position of the star in the past was recorded when it radiated the light that we see now.  Already three points on one star.  And the sun has two points.  And Jupiter has none at all.  Pure shamanism ... <br><br>  In the courtyard were already 70s.  And in 1983, Kozyrev died at the age of 75. <br><br>  Well, what else to add? <br>  - In life, and especially after death, socialist science organized a real persecution of the scientist, his family and his followers. <br>  - Kozyrev believed that his theory had not yet been sufficiently confirmed, the measurement method was not fully worked out and it was still far from clear.  Absolutely all scientists agree with him, even those who disagree with him) <br>  ‚ÄúBecause of the difficulties with repeatability of results and a small amount of experimental deviations, the theory of‚Äú causality ‚Äùis somehow not particularly recognized, although Kozyrev‚Äôs works in astronomy are very well known and solve many problems.  One of these problems is the insufficient energy intensity of thermonuclear reactions in the depths of the stars in order to explain their so long life.  The second is the absence of visible signs of the ‚Äúthermal death‚Äù of the Universe (this is a problem, yes! Remember the epigraph?). <br>  - It‚Äôs not to say that his work is forgotten, there is the <a href="http://www.chronos.msu.ru/rnews.html">‚ÄúInstitute of Time‚Äù</a> at Moscow State University, he collects seminars fairly regularly, but such phenomenal results as before something is not visible. <br>  - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Brief biography.</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Kozyrev/vsp0.win.htm">Detailed biography.</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.nkozyrev.ru/index.php">Site</a> about Kozyrev and some of his works. <br>  - On September 2, in the old style, he would have turned 104 years old. <br>  - There are no ‚ÄúKozyrev mirrors‚Äù in nature, this term was introduced by esoteric to make your work convincing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150811/</a></p>
