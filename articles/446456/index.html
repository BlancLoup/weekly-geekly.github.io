      So, as promised, it‚Äôs time to start ‚Äúa series of articles about how we executed orders and fought against circumstances.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know how long this cycle will be, but there is a desire to describe the whole process from beginning to end, but there‚Äôs not enough time, because writing articles takes a lot of time, and you have to feed the family =) <br><br>  The first article will be devoted to the study of existing options and their superficial analysis in order to chart the study of options in practice.  For before you assemble a test bench, you need to understand what to experience on it. <br>  So, please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Chapter 1. As It Is </h3><br>  In order: <br><br>  <b>Hyper-V, ESXI</b> as virtualization platforms.  Why both?  Because one in the head office, the other in the branch.  So historically (with) <br><br>  <b>Windows Server 2012 R2 \ 2016</b> and <b>CentOS 7</b> as server OS <br><br>  <b>Windows 7</b> as client OS <br><br>  <b>1c</b> at the implementation stage based on <b>MSSQLServer Standard</b> <br><br>  <b>TEKTON</b> on <b>Firebird 1.5</b> (Do not even ask ... But you still ask, yes? .. Well, this is someone's warm project that our Enterprise bought at the turn of 2005, it seems, for reasons unknown to me. And now we are trying unsuccessfully switch from it to 1c ..) <br><br>  <b>OASIS</b> on the same MSSQLServer Standard as reporting software to the FIU <br><br>  <b>Zabbix</b> on <b>MariaDB</b> <br><br>  <b>Exchange</b> and <b>Zambra OSE</b> .  Why this and that?  Because we have 2 network contour.  One of which is in no way connected with the outside world and the second circuit ... well, IB thinks that it is necessary, and does not allow us to configure routing and do everything correctly, and who are we to argue with IB? .. In a word, it has historically (c) (2) <br><br>  <b>IFS</b> at <b>Oracle</b> , <b>CompanyMedia</b> at <b>IBM Domino</b> .  We have the first for pre-contractual activities, the second - the ‚Äúworking‚Äù workflow ... Why is CompanyMedia on the file database in 2019m?  Do not believe it, I asked them the same question - they did not come up with an answer.  And why is a monster like IFS needed for pre-contractual activities?  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Office</b> .  Here it is necessary to clarify.  In addition to the standard user set, we have from time immemorial (read before I came here) we have a database written in Access.  What is in it and why - I have not the slightest idea, but ‚Äúwe need it, ooooochen, we cannot work without it!‚Äù, And Excel has a taaaaaaaaaaa thing ... We can't figure out how it works ‚Äî it's impossible, and how leave - also unknown.  There a huge number of macros are wound up, which pull data out of the darkness of files and do something with it.  Even the author of this creation does not know how this works.  Rewriting this is akin to database redesign ... In a word, we simply cannot get away from MS Office. <br><br>  <b>Satellite</b> as an internet browser recently <br><br>  <b>OpenFire + Pidgin</b> as a chat <br><br>  <b>Consultant +</b> and <b>TechExpert</b> <br><br>  <b>Veeam Backup &amp; Replication</b> and <b>Veeam Agent for Windows</b> in their free version <br><br>  Well, a bunch of Windows server chips, such as <b>AD, DNS, DHCP, WDS, CS, RDP, Remote App, KMS, WSUS,</b> and further on the little things. <br><br>  All this rose almost from scratch, sweat and blood, suffering and googling.  And now it's time to destroy it all.  There should be offscreen Homeric laughter, and in the eyes of the protagonist, read me, tears should come to light ... <br><br>  But is it all terrible?  Let's watch the options. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 2. How it should be </h3><br>  You can go along the path of "Helicopters of Russia", that is, try to completely reject the <s>enemy</s> Windows-based systems, and switch to 100% "domestic" (quotes are not random) software.  The ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù version assumes fun to tear down all Windows, put any OS you like from the registry of the Ministry of Communications with MoyOffice or LibreOffice rolled onto it, and see which user comes up.  Fun?  Of course.  Productive?  Not at all. <br><br>  To understand further reasoning, I‚Äôll give the contents of the software in <b>the Astra Linux OS SE 1.6 OS</b> , from which it follows that the entire infrastructure, which is now based on Microsoft products, can be replaced with software in the Astra structure.  You can - does not mean you need.  I have not tried it all in a test environment with at least a couple of dozens of nodes, I just deployed a test stand, and even then I looked superficially.  But there are tools. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Software bundled Astra Linux Special Edition 1.6</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Fly-wm </li><li>  PostgreSQL </li><li>  Libreoffice </li><li>  Apache2 </li><li>  Firefox </li><li>  Exim4 </li><li>  Dovecot </li><li>  Thunderbird </li><li>  Gimp </li><li>  alsa </li><li>  VLC </li><li>  Cups </li><li>  Bind9 </li><li>  Iscdhcpserver </li><li>  Samba </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  On the OS website in the description of the release there is a tale that Zabbix is ‚Äã‚Äãpresent as part.  But if you dig into the Wiki, then there is an article about how to install Zabbix ... from which we can conclude that Apache, Postgre, php - everything is installed from the repository.  And we said above that only what is included in the package is legitimate ... And this confusion puts me out of myself !!!! 11 Well, in the sense that it is not clear what can and should be and what should not "it's not gonna go".  It turns out that the packages from the repository are also legitimate.  But is it?  It seems that - yes, but ... <br><br>  As a result, one has to assume that everything that is in the OS repositories can be called domestic software.  Turning off the logic and just doing what everyone else does.  We install, use and report on import substitution.  <s>In the end, we all know why all this was invented ..</s> <br><br>  You can also raise the entire infrastructure and based on the <b>ROSA Linux Enterprise Server</b> .  I haven't tried this either.  (All tests and results will be published in the next article in this series, if everything goes as planned.) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Software included ROSA Enterprise Linux Server</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  means of implementing an IPA domain (equivalent to Microsoft Active Directory) </li><li>  Nginx and Apache </li><li>  MySQL and PostgreSQL </li><li>  Zimbra, Exim, Postfix and Dovecot </li><li>  pacemaker, corosync </li><li>  DRBD </li><li>  Bacula </li><li>  ejabberd </li><li>  CIFS, NFS, Bind, DHCP, NTP, FTP, SSH </li><li>  Zabbix </li><li>  ROSA Chattr Extended Attributes Management Tool </li><li>  information encryption tool ROSA Crypto Tool </li><li>  ROSA Memory Clean </li><li>  means of guaranteed deletion of ROSA Shred files </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  And you can take a free <b>Calculate Linux</b> and build the entire infrastructure on its base.  A list of Calculate Linux packages can be found <a href="https://old.calculate-linux.org/packages">here</a> . <br><br>  It follows from the above that it is possible to raise all the necessary infrastructure, in essence, from scratch.  This will require huge resources, tons of admin nerves, kilotons of coffee and a lot of time to debug.  The threshold of entry will be sooooo hard to overcome.  But you can.  But difficult.  But it will work.  But difficult.  But ... But ... <br><br>  Another option is to leave everything as it is, and hope that there will be no checks, and they will simply forget about us.  But we also need to report to the Ministry for the transition to domestic software for each year.  So, too, is not an option. <br><br>  Therefore, I propose to approach from the side of common sense. <br><br>  There is such a sign: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/yh/1q/gqyh1qpbbubwu5qpt0g3xxhowy4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further, there are, in fact, lengthy arguments, so that anyone is not interested, you can immediately go to the resulting table (Chapter 2.1.).  And for those who love mnogabukaff - you are welcome. <br><br>  So here.  We need to bring indicators to the established limits.  In practice, this means that we must replace the existing OS with products from the register of the Ministry of Communications and bring the number of replaced operating systems to 80%.  And no distinction is made between server and client OSes.  This gives us room for maneuver.  Which one  We can put the OS-based thin clients from the registry, and drive them all into the RDP.  In our case, when the number of employees is about 1,500 people, we get 1,200 "pieces" (actually more, since we have not only user axes, but also server ones, but the article is not about exact calculations), but 300 remains for those the most 20% that can not be changed.  And what, we do not have enough 300 servers for Windows to properly build a familiar architecture?  This should also include specific software that can not work on anything other than Windows, and often also on Windows XP.  But 300 cars.  Will not be enough?  Seriously? <br><br>  Here it is also necessary to note that best practice in this case will be an advanced training of employees to work with new software.  Without this, there is a huge risk of simply bringing the entire production to its knees, and paralyzing the work of the whole Enterprise for an indefinite period.  For if everything is not so bad with the OS, the user often doesn‚Äôt need anything from her except to launch the Office application \ browser \ 1c, search for the necessary file and launch the soliter.  But in the Office \ 1c, they work constantly (for the time being we don‚Äôt take into account the design engineers - there is a footnote about CAD in Chapter 2.1. - production, etc.), all reporting passes through Excel filters, etc.  Well, for those who for one reason or another can not work in free software - welcome to RDP. <br><br>  So, we can safely leave the cluster on <b>Hyper-V</b> , since we have one and we like it, this is 12 nodes in our case, <b>we</b> have to leave <b>ESXI</b> .  Plus, it needs an ‚Äúiron‚Äù domain controller + virtual domain controller.  Total 14. Well, or leave ESXi, having gone from Hyper-V, as you like, the numbers will still be the same.  On the Domain Controllers we will have <b>AD, DNS, DHCP, CS</b> .  With a small number of screw machines <b>WSUS</b> can be neglected.  <b>KMS</b> can also be screwed onto a domain controller.  <b>WDS is</b> no longer needed.  From the Windows services there are still <b>RDP servers</b> .  Well, we still have 286 unused potential ‚Äúpieces‚Äù under Windows left.  The RDP farm will occupy another 8-10 Windows operating systems.  Total 276 units we have left under the specific software for research departments and CAD. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">OS</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It doesn't matter what OS it is - <b><a href="https://astralinux.ru/">Astra</a> , <a href="https://www.rosalinux.ru/">ROSA</a> , <a href="https://www.calculate-linux.org/ru/">Calculate</a> , <a href="https://alter-os.ru/">AlterOS</a> , <a href="https://alter-os.ru/">LOTOS</a> , <a href="https://infotech.group/ru">Halo OS</a></b> , <a href="http://sptlinux.ru/">Alt Linux</a> , <a href="http://cryptosoft.ru/">QP OC</a> .  You need to choose something that will satisfy users.  How to choose - I can not say, this is a very delicate matter.  In fact, all of them are at least similar in appearance (and it is only that which is important for the user because it looks and how convenient it is to use).  I'll just install a couple of each OS and ask the least busy bukh for half an hour to use.  What they say - from that and we will dance, probably. <br>  AlterOS and Halo OS are not on sale.  So I will not consider them, because this ‚Äúnot quite business‚Äù doesn‚Äôt attract me at all. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About OS OS</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The license agreement states: <br><br>  1.4 The License Agreement does not provide an exclusive right to the Software Product, but only the right to use one copy of the Software Product for non-commercial purposes in accordance with the conditions defined in Section 2 of the License Agreement. <br><br>  2.4 The Licensee has the right of non-commercial use of the Software Product on an unlimited number of servers and workstations. <br><br>  Thus, we cannot use it in the Enterprise, even though it is included in the register of the Ministry of Communications.  This is sad for the reason that it is free.  But the developers have something with the site, because for several weeks I haven‚Äôt been able to download the distribution kit, and I haven‚Äôt received an answer to the letters of support.  What?  Why?  I do not know. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Office packages</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The situation is the following - we also need to bring the number of domestic "offices" to 80%, which also amounts to 1,200 "pieces."  These 1200 "pieces" are already part of the Linux-based OS, which we will install to users.  It does not matter, as part of all distributions there is a free office suite.  Most often this is <b><a href="https://ru.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></b> .  But on the RDP servers we can safely put the package from Microsoft, since we do not want users to drop out of work for an indefinite period of time (at least until they have been trained to work with the new office software), because they cannot find it in the new tabular editor your favorite button.  It also has a separate plus - backing up documents of employees who will lie in one place, and the death of the hard drive is no longer terrible. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Exchange</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We'll have to demolish.  Unfortunately, there is no way to bypass this figure of 80%, since the order states ‚Äúthe number of users‚Äù, and not% of the number of mail servers in the Enterprise.  And since we need to replace it with something from the register of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, our choice is not particularly great.  This is either <b><a href="http://www.communigate.com/">CommuniGate Pro</a></b> , or <b><a href="https://myoffice.ru/">MyOffice Mail</a></b> , or <a href="https://www.r7-office.ru/"><b>P7-Office.</b></a>  <a href="https://www.r7-office.ru/"><b>Server</b></a>  And you can put ROSA, which has a <b><a href="https://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a></b> , in both networks, and rejoice, because for my taste Zimbra is much more convenient and pleasant than MyOffice Mail, which is terrible a little more than full, and I did not like CommuniGate Pro either.  Plus, Zimbra can easily grab all mail with Exchange if you need to save your chat history.  Btw, by Zimbra OSE I wrote a couple of articles on Habr ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439440/">deployment and configuration</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439728/">backup and recovery,</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443166/">creating and updating mailing lists based on AD</a> ) But, the taste and color, as they say. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reference systems</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If they were, then most likely it is some kind of <b><a href="http://www.aero.garant.ru/">Guarantor</a> , <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/">Consultant +</a> , <a href="https://cntd.ru/">TechExpert</a></b> and their ilk.  I mean, they are Russian-made.  If not, there is a choice =) <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Antivirus software</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Just 100% should be domestic.  Well, they cannot entrust the defense of the national defense to the bourgeois programs ... The choice is <a href="https://www.kaspersky.ru/"><b>Kaspersky</b></a> , <a href="https://download.drweb.ru/"><b>Dr.Web</b></a> , <a href="https://www.nanoav.ru/"><b>Nano</b></a> . <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Veeam</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Veeam BackUp and Replication</b> .  With him, the situation is strange.  He has a version certified by FSTEC, but there are no products from Veeam in the register of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  On the other hand, in the order of the ministry there is no column "backup software".  So here the situation is twofold.  If we leave Windows-based services, and even more so Hyper-V, Veeam greatly simplifies backing up virtual machines, it is very convenient and unpretentious, and <b>Veeam agent for Windows</b> allows you to back up the trash, it has a very simple setup and user-friendly interface , there is an automatic detection of data duplication and their clipping, etc.  In short, if we leave the hypervisor from Microsoft, you can try to write a piece of paper that Veeam has no analogues, and that we need it sooo well.  Attempt not torture, but what will come of it, I can not say. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1s</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is where the questions begin, as they seem to have a version for Linux.  And it even seems to be working.  But in fact, no one uses it.  Therefore, we will have to allocate one more Windows machine for server 1c.  And even two.  Total 274 left.  DBMS - <b>PostgreSQL</b> , of course.  Despite the fact that it is not domestic, but it is in the register of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  1c can work with it, and the database itself is quite good.  Not easy to set up, but very, very good.  In addition, it easily rises to any Linux distribution, and as part of the same Astra it is generally supplied. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Document flow</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Well, it‚Äôs understandable with <b>IFS</b> , you‚Äôll have to leave 100% of it.  <b>Company Media</b> - questions remain.  ON domestic, there is in the register of the Ministry of Communications, all things.  But.  IBM Domino is licensed and purchased separately, and therefore cannot be used.  On the other hand, <b>Company Media</b> has a version for <b>PostgreSQL</b> .  But <b>IBM Domino</b> was implemented here.  Yes, I have a persistent negative to this ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of the Intertrust company called Company Media, it starts to bomb me at the mere mention of it.  But this is not the case.  So either we are transporting CM to PostgreSQL, or we are looking for another workflow system.  There are <a href="https://reestr.minsvyaz.ru/reestr/%3Fsort_by%3Ddate%26sort%3Dasc%26name%3D%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%26owner_status%3D%26owner_name%3D%26set_filter%3DY">plenty</a> to choose from <a href="https://reestr.minsvyaz.ru/reestr/%3Fsort_by%3Ddate%26sort%3Dasc%26name%3D%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%26owner_status%3D%26owner_name%3D%26set_filter%3DY">in the</a> registry.  But at this stage I will not dwell on this issue, as the company Media spent a lot of money, but its further fate is not yet clear, but I want to believe in common sense and just transfer the system to PostgreSQL.  So just leave a list of software from the registry. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Multimedia</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I do not consider.  Not only are they narrowly applicable, but at Enterprises that fall under the program of import substitution, if they are used, they are only for collageing postcards by February 23 by accountants.  And "essential goods" are present in the OS. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Internet browsers</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Allowed <b><a href="https://browser.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a></b> . <b><a href="https://browser.yandex.ru/">Browser</a> , <a href="http://corp.sputnik.ru/browser">Sputnik</a></b> .  At the same time, Mozilla Firefox is present in almost all the operating systems from the registry.  I think this is just no problem.  And for applications that can only in <b>InternetExplorer,</b> we left a loophole in the form of RDP-servers. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Openfire</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Naturally, we refuse.  Why?  Because we need to implement <b>1S Bitrix24</b> !  In fact, we do not for this reason, but because it is not in the registry, but in general we replace the chat with a portal that has a chat service, so ... well ... that's the most ... you understand.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Yes.  Or you can use <b>ejabberd</b> as a jabber server as part of ROSA Linux.  There's also a chat client, if I'm not mistaken, Mirka.  This is in case you do not have 1x Bitrix24. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Zabbix</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Naturally, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications is not represented in the register.

So if we want to get a ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù Zabbix, then at least one copy of this OS will be required. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mail client</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Introduced <b>Thunderbird</b> bundled almost all operating systems from the registry.  If he is not satisfied, then he will have to buy separately, as part of the same <b>MyOffice</b> , for example, or <b>‚ÄúP7-Office.</b>  <b>Organizer</b> .  To be honest, I no longer found separate mail clients in the registry of the Ministry of Communications.  Yes, and Thunderbird gave me.

Information </h3><br>  As a result, I had such a table with options, on the basis of which conclusions will be drawn and plans will be made: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1x/wt/qq/1xwtqqth2xs2kt2puuexshousqs.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Which is logical - if you still need to switch from a Windows domain to Astra or Rosa, or some other, then it makes sense to transfer client machines to a product of the same manufacturer, so you can reduce the number of errors when trying to make friends with one another. <br><br>  In relation to <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>PostgreSQL PRO,</b> it should be understood that they have <a href="https://postgrespro.ru/docs/postgrespro/11/intro-pgpro-vs-pg">significant differences</a> , including in speed.  PRO version is more productive.  For the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù operation of the same 1c, the free version is most likely not enough. <br><br>  Astra Linux SpecialEdition and ROSA DX "NICKEL" are secure systems that are certified for working with the state secret, secret, etc. <br><br>  As for <b>CAD</b> : In the comments to the previous article, these questions sounded.  ROSA Linux has the following <a href="http://wiki.rosalab.ru/ru/index.php/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B_ROSA_Linux">packages</a> in the repositories: <br><br><ul><li>  Freecad </li><li>  Kicad </li><li>  Librecad </li><li>  Opencascade </li><li>  QCAD </li><li>  QCAD3d </li></ul><br>  Naturally, all this is free software.  But, since CAD-packages are not indicated in the register of the Ministry of Communications, this type of software will most likely fall under the category of ‚Äúindispensable‚Äù, and it can be purchased or used under existing licenses by writing the appropriate paper to the Ministry. <br><br>  It is the same with other highly specialized software, which, unfortunately, is a lot on our Enterprises.  We'll have to write paper and tearfully beg not to ruin, and provide an opportunity to continue to work.  Most likely they will give permission. <br><br><h3>  PS: </h3><br>  I will not be original.  All this "fuss" with import substitution looks extremely strange, if you choose soft expressions.  In fact, our software only produces <b>Yandex</b> , <b>Acronis</b> , <b>Kaspersky</b> , <b>10-Strike</b> (with a stretch), <b>1s</b> , <b>Ascon</b> , <b>Abby</b> , <b>Dr.Web</b> .  Well, a handful of small companies.  But all this is so narrow niche development (with the exception of Yandex, perhaps) that we can say that we almost do not do software.  And everything that is offered to us as part of the import substitution program is simply ‚Äúproven‚Äù software of foreign development.  That is, in fact, we are offered for money (and considerable) the same software that we could download and use for free.  ROSA is made on the basis of Mandriva, Astra - Debian GNU.  Astra can connect the Debian repository and upgrade.  The interesting thing is the result.  All the packages for the same DNS, DHCP, ALD, ROSA Domain, Dovecot and all the rest are nothing more than open source packages, some of which were ‚Äútinted and plastered a little‚Äù, and the others were not touched at all, just ‚Äúchecked‚Äù availability of bookmarks.  What kind of "domestic software" in question is unclear. <br><br>  On the other hand, Linux administrators will be accustomed to working with already familiar software, which will somewhat lower the threshold of entry.  But be that as it may, all controlled industrial enterprises will have to switch to this ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù software.  So ‚Äúsee you in the next article,‚Äù if they do not plant me for this and do not dismiss me =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446456/</a></p>
