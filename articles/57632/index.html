Grieved after numerous posts on copyright and freebies ... <br><br>  How can I use music / movies / programs?  How can they be consumed? <br>  To <i>listen to</i> music, <i>to</i> <i>watch</i> films, <i>to</i> <i>use a</i> program.  And they take money from us for the opportunity to do it ourselves when we want.  But how can we control what we really use?  (except the option "believe the word") None.  DRM-protection options in this aspect are all perceived very negatively.  It is necessary to control by prohibiting copying.  But in essence, by copying a disk, you do not break anything (until you start using the pirated version of the program). <br><br>  But why pay for such an ephemeral thing as listening to music or watching a movie?  When buying food, everything is clear - here it is, food, I eat it.  Buying equipment is also understandable, here is the equipment, so I use it.  To buy such things means to give something equivalent.  Once they could have valued a house with bulls, now with an equivalent amount in money.  In essence, this is barter.

      And for what to pay a musician who you nothing tangible, somehow correlated in value with the bulls, can not give?  After all, we do not pay for the disk (the cost of the pig is a penny), and not even for the actual music! <br><br>  When buying a technique, you exchange the equivalent goods, <b>buying a disc, you thank the musician for the pleasure that his music brought you.</b>  <b>A lot of people take part in creating a modern disk, and the easiest way to thank them is to buy a disk.</b>  After all, there is no way to thank the whole hundred-other person. <br><br>  <b>You do not pay for music, it is free, but your pleasure!</b>  You pay not the movie, but your viewing pleasure, you pay not the program, but the results you get with it. <br><br>  Yes, the joy that music brings to us is immaterial and nothing diminishes from its copying.  But we are polite people, right?  We brought joy, and we refuse to thank the musician.  In fact - this is an elementary bad manners and lack of culture.  And the lack of culture is a denial of the laws of the society in which we live and which has developed over thousands of years. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  If you are listening to a free disk of a small group, watch a freely distributed art-house film, use a small open-source program written by one or two programmers - <b>thank you anyway, the work of the creators was worth it.</b>  Transfer some money to the authors or send a bottle of brandy, any good gift - because you liked this music, the movie, you need this program. <br><br>  <b>Regarding the prices and the "millions" that go to some artists</b> : the Pomors, once in the Russian North, went fishing for a long time and took one non-fish with them - a story-teller musician who told them tales / tales every evening, etc. , for which he received a full share of the fish catch.  That is, he was provided with an income equal to the fishing income ‚Äî the income of the earner, in those communities this is the maximum income.  Although the musician and did not get anything.  Music calmed and gave new strength to fishermen - and such things are expensive. <br><br>  <b>As for ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like the work of a musician, I don‚Äôt want to pay‚Äù</b> : almost always and everywhere (with the exception of court worlds with hysterical kings), musicians worked and worked for prepayment.  Because if you want to hear someone, you usually know who they are.  Today you can listen to the beginning of the tracks (for free! For films there are trailers and reviews, for programs - descriptions and trial versions) and decide whether you like it or not (and once the manager of the festivities just listened for a few minutes to the "demo performance").  <i>Do not like it - do not listen, no one forces you.</i>  But if you listened to the half of the album and then say ‚Äúno, I still don‚Äôt want to pay for it‚Äù - sorry, this is an <i>ordinary insolence.</i>  If you listened so much - it means that something hooked you, do not lie to yourself. <br><br>  There are no free things.  But payment is not money in itself (do not be a slave to money!).  Payment is either barter or an expression of your gratitude.  <b>Be people and thank other people for music, movies and programs.</b>  Do not forget that each disk was brought to you by many hundreds of people who created, printed and distributed it. <br><br>  ... you look, and the world will be a little better. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> if you do not want to pay for the reason that the musician gets a little, then let's stop buying the equipment made in China by analogy.  The Chinese get very little, really.  Much less than musicians.  Who are the supporters of this point of view ready to throw all the equipment out of the house?  :)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57632/</a></p>
