And you can make such a server in different ways. <br><br>  For example, 10 years ago I had an old system unit with a single HDD running linux.  His main task was to keep the SMB.  Later, with the advent of his wife, the requirements for such a server have changed: it should be small (take up little space), not buzz and not consume much electricity.  Therefore, the system had to be changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cca/440/cd0/cca440cd0406474948ba5cc240b5a659.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now my home server is built on the base of an <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/desktop-board-di510mo.html">Intel D510MO motherboard</a> with a soldered processor and simple graphics.  As a case, I used <a href="http://www.coolermaster.ru/product.php%3Fproduct_id%3D6623">CoolerMaster Elite 100</a> .  The body is not bad, but with one nasty problem: its only one!  the fan in the PSU squealed so shrill that when it burned down after a couple of weeks of operation, I gladly replaced it with another: the usual 40x40x10 fan.  Although it is smaller in size (10mm versus 20mm), it stood up perfectly and has been working for two years without overheating.  The case fit two 2.5 HDD, on which I organized RAID1.  By the way, those who like to store movies on HDD may not fit this case, since  You can install one full-size 3.5 disk or two 2.5. <br><br>  The next question is what tasks our server should perform.  Most importantly, if there are windows-based computers on the network, you need to hold SAMBA for ‚Äúshare‚Äù disks.  Next - in our house there is a game console connected to the TV.  The console, it is of course for games, but nevertheless she knows how to show movies using the DLNA protocol.  I have tried many utilities, but now I stopped at a project with an interesting name - PMS or completely - ps3mediaserver.  I consider the main advantage of this development to be the ability to recode unknown formats for PS3.  So the problem with misunderstanding MKV files has disappeared.  By the way, since the topic of watching movies on TV is set, the server can have a torrent rocking chair and at the time when we are sleeping or at work, download movies. <br>  Also, the home server can hold apache + php + mysql.  This bundle will provide for us the work of a huge number of applications that will work at home on the local network and in the case of a static ip or configured dyndns for a dynamic ip will allow access from the global Internet.  You can configure dyndns in different ways in the operating system and on the router.  In my case, the Zyxel PW330-EE router plays the role of a switch, distributes wi-fi around the house, holds a PPTP connection with the provider and holds the zone on dyndns.org. <br><br>  Most of my applications, about which I wrote on Habr√©, just serve for the purpose of working on a home server and performing various useful functions.  For example, an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/138619/">e-mail client</a> allows both from home and being far from home to read and reply to mail.  Multiuser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/138619/">file manager</a> with permissions.  And Ostora.Photo about which I recently wrote a post, almost without describing the functionality of the application. <br><br>  Ostora.Photo is a multi-user web application.  It implements photo album management functions. <br>  Opportunities: <br>  <b>-</b> Setting permissions for both individual users and entire groups of users for files and directories. <br>  <b>-</b> Quotas on disk space. <br>  <b>-</b> From the accidental loss of files in the application there is a "tricky" system for deleting files.  A normal user deleting a file marks it as deleted and no other user sees this file.  But a user with administrator rights in the system can permanently delete the file or restore it. <br>  <b>-</b> You can add text notes (comments) to photos, add tags, select people or objects in pictures and add selected pictures to your favorites.  Tags and selected people can be combined, that is, you can select multiple words to sort.  For example: the tag "Sea" and marked "Ksyusha" and "Pasha" - will show Ksyusha and Pasha together at sea.  You can reset the sorting by clicking the button or the cross of unnecessary words in the sorting. <br>  <b>- The</b> application supports multi-boot. <br>  <b>-</b> Files are located in folders, forming a familiar tree structure. <br>  <b>-</b> Anonymous access.  You can view images without logging into the system.  But an ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù user will not be able to make any changes: add, delete or rename images, add text notes, etc. Such a user will see only those images for which the ‚ÄúFor all‚Äù access rights are set.  By clicking the Login button in the upper right of the menu bar, you can log in with your login. <br><br>  This is by no means an advertisement, all applications are free and available as source codes on <a href="https://github.com/Zazza">github</a> . <br><br>  Having your own web server, you can install any of the existing CMS on which to keep your own website or maintain an advanced notepad for records, accessible from the global network.  For lovers of different social networks there are even full-fledged social network engines: <a href="http://socengine.ru/">SocialEngine</a> and <a href="http://www.phpfox.com/">phpFox</a> . <br><br>  With this topic I want to show how you can organize your personal world on your own (not dedicated) server, and at the same time listen to clever ideas, which applications can you think of for such purposes?  What can be useful to keep at home, and not in the cloud, somewhere in the USA. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147608/</a></p>
