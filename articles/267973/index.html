    <h4>  About building </h4><br>  Technopark has two sites: one is in Kazan, the other is in Naberezhnye Chelny.  The total area is no less than 53,000 m2. <br>  Here we create a whole ecosystem that opens wide access to opportunities: from a developed infrastructure to assistance in promoting IT products in Russia and abroad.  And for any IT company, first of all, we undertake data protection. <br>  In the IT park of Naberezhnye Chelny, the infrastructure differs only in the lack of a data center. <br><br><h4>  Data center </h4><br>  Today we start with the data center, in the future we will talk about other units.  I would like to start, of course, to write about the data center not from the technical side, but from the human side.  We will tell, first of all, about our team and departments.  Let's start with those who are at the forefront of working with customers - technical support.  This our group of terminators who constantly rush around the data center solves all the issues with IT in Technopark and in parallel are engaged in supporting customers of the data center.  And it may seem that they work around the clock - the way it is.  Customers who call for support, first of all communicate with them. <br><br>  The engineering service works with energy supply of the Technopark data center.  In addition, they still monitor the climate, cooling data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aeb/0fe/0e4/aeb0fe0e4b624f2696dfd61cfc92204c.jpg"><br>  <i>Engineers work</i> <br><br>  Technical department.  You will probably think that this is a department dedicated exclusively to gadgets (peeble, mi band, xiaomi yi, motorola x, nexus, helicopters, lasers, a warm tube sound), but in fact our IT gurus are sitting there: virtualization engineers, networkers , Linuxoids, VMwares, IT security servers.  Also tickets with support are escalated here.  Our IT crowd. <br><br>  The commercial and project departments find new projects for the company: the commercial department negotiates, the project department develops, and the technical department implements.  The purchasers of iron are assisted by purchasers, and the financial department considers and confirms prices.  Accounting tasks are clear - document flow.  Not far from them - the department for working with staff.  The security of the object is monitored by serious guys - Security Service. <br><br><h4>  Data Center Infrastructure </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/28c/834/33128c83463f4d789b4356df5924f60a.jpg">  " <br>  <i>Raised floor between racks</i> <br><br>  The data center consists of two machine rooms, two provider rooms, various data center communications, rooms for the elements of power supply systems, cooling, ventilation, communications, and fire fighting.  In total, in two engine rooms, we have 311 rack places.  At the time of this writing, 26 service providers place their hardware and communication nodes in two provider rooms.  It is easy for customers to choose a suitable provider, connect to communication channels and to traffic exchange points. <br><br>  Briefly tell about the principle of the data center.  The cooling system of the data center is designed as follows: in the machine rooms there are precision air conditioners Emerson-Liebert Hiross HPM L-14C, M77UC, which are reserved according to the N + 1 scheme.  Precision air conditioners cool the air, filter, regulate humidity and supply cooled air under the raised floor, then the cooled air goes to the racks.  On the roof are Emerson-Liebert CBS073 chillers.  The implementation scheme is simple, common and reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/101/981/3161019817344be9b1a518b462132200.jpg"><br>  <i>In the photo - one of the precision air conditioners</i> <br><br>  The power supply of the data center comes from two carts from different sides of the building: from the nearest thermal power station and Zainsk TPP.  There are two battery stations with uninterruptible power supplies Emerson Highpulse, two Cummins diesel generators, and various automations.  The stock of fuel in the storage is enough to work for two days.  Maintenance, inspection are carried out according to the rules: diesel engines regularly start, test. <br><br>  For each rack we bring two power lines, and the load is distributed equally, and inside the racks there are distribution units (PDU) with monitoring that allow them to be monitored in real time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/408/8cc/532/4088cc532c46459bb128ec8474e0f16b.jpg"><br>  <i>One of the rooms of the UPS</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d04/9dc/0fe/d049dc0fe0ea4b1d8239384954e336fb.jpg"><br>  <i>Standby diesel generators</i> <br><br>  Gases are used as extinguishing agents, and the automation is set up in such a way that the extinguishing takes place in an automatic mode and allows extinguishing in separate rooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d5/5e5/36c/0d55e536c4c44566a825b3291f8ded55.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo from the room with fire extinguishing cylinders</i> <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fb/640/962/1fb640962b3d43c28d7abc34a196878e.jpg"><br>  <i>The main reception Technopark.</i>  <i>The first circuit of the armed guard</i> <br><br>  There are a lot of specific security requirements for data centers, there are many levels of implementation: two circuits of armed guards, territory, premises, machine rooms, rows, everything is under video surveillance.  Access to the data center requires gaps, and to get into the computer room is also confirmation with a fingerprint.  You can get to the data center on any day and at any time of the day. <br>  In addition to physical security, there are various IT security tools, but that's another story. <br><br>  Certificates that we have: the <a href="http://dc16.ru/licenses-and-certificates/">FSTEC</a> license to protect confidential information, the <a href="http://dc16.ru/licenses-and-certificates/">FSB</a> license to work with cryptography - all this is necessary for working with personal data, and compliance with the requirements of <a href="http://dc16.ru/licenses-and-certificates/">PCI-DSS</a> allows us to place the infrastructure of banks and financial institutions. <br><br><h4>  Services </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/587/70f/0b1/58770f0b1188429f9e73115b58ff56c3.jpg"><br><br>  The main service in data centers is usually colocation (placing your server on our technical hub), we partially fall under this, because we also have <a href="http://dc16.ru/licenses-and-certificates/">TIERIII compliance</a> , fault-tolerant infrastructure, competent staff, many communication channels, but most of all, we like cloud computing.  Cloud technologies and virtualization are what we focus on.  To do this, we have a virtualization cluster running vmware vsphere 5.5 using reliable hardware: IBM Pureflex server blade, Cisco 6509 network core, IBM Storewize v7000 storage system.  In addition to hosting and virtualization, we also have other services: communication channels and telecommunications, connections and cross-connects, rental of software and hardware, and integration. <br><br>  If you have questions about the work of Technopark and Data Center, write in the comments, and if you want to talk more closely, here is the contact mail: info.dc@tatar.ru <br><br>  In the following posts we will talk about other divisions of our Technopark.  We are waiting for your comments and questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267973/</a></p>
