The project is actively developing, and I wanted to use his example to tell about the importance of continuous improvement and work on customer expectations.  The article will have more marketing component than technological, but in my opinion, this is no less interesting. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yakostro/3990013262/" title="rubaha by Yakostro, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/111/e83/b39/111e83b39e8331a54fa71c8ba5052024.jpg" width="300" height="256" alt="rubaha"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      When a customer came to us with such a ‚Äúbold‚Äù idea, I treated it with skepticism.  But we did our best to do our work (website design and interface for the designer of shirts), after which the customer asked: ‚ÄúHow do we promote our offspring?‚Äù.  We got down to business and thus were fully involved in the project and were witnesses and participants in its development. <br><br><h4>  Improving the project. </h4><br><br><h5>  About the main page </h5><br>  Initially, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the project was this: we are doing a shirt designer on the main page - this is the main feature of our site.  Users will play with him and then gradually move on to register and order. <br><br>  Later it turned out that such a service, rich in various features, offers, and, moreover, unusual for a Russian user, cannot exist without a promotional page.  It was decided to create this page.  It was based on ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù product photos and an explanation of all the charms of the service.  For example, the customer did not attach importance to Free Delivery by Russian Post.  But in our opinion, this is a decent help in increasing customer loyalty, so we brought it to the first screen under the description of the service.  The ‚Äúrecently ordered shirts‚Äù have become an interesting and useful feature.  Together with the reviews they make the site alive.  We see that many people order shirts, see what kind of shirts it is, it inspires confidence.  We can also put any of these shirts in the constructor, change (or not) a little and order a similar one.  This is a pretty good deal that boosts sales. <br><br>  The last ordered shirts are not generated (which, in principle, could be implemented for the same purposes), these are real orders. <br><br>  More information about the main page does not make sense to tell.  The main conclusion is that a good promo page significantly increases conversion. <br><br><h4>  The main question "How to make our service better?" </h4><br>  As far as I can tell, this question does not go beyond the creators' heads for a minute and this is the main driving force behind the project. <br>  Service Internet studio is completely new for Russia.  And we are faced with the problem of customer mistrust.  And above all, it was necessary to fight fears.  So, let's begin. <br><br>  <b>Fear:</b> I do not quite understand what kind of fabric it is, but what if it is not as it is on the screen, not as I imagine. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> A free catalog with samples of fabrics was created, which is sent at the request of the client (this delays the purchase moment a little, but as a result we have guaranteed customer satisfaction with the selected cloth. Since he ‚Äúfelt‚Äù it before the purchase, without paying anything) <br><br>  <b>Fear: The</b> size of the shirt does not suit me, I can take them off the wrong way or they will sew wrong. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> Created a test shirt.  This is a shirt of the cheapest fabric at the lowest possible price (390 rubles).  You measure yourself, order this shirt, try it on yourself and make sure that everything is normal or adjust the profile a little.  In my opinion, this is almost the most important feature. <br><br>  <b>Problem:</b> I don‚Äôt really understand how to work with the shirt designer himself. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> A video instruction was created (on the main page), which describes in steps how and what to do. <br><br>  <b>Fear: The</b> order is sent only after 100% prepayment.  What if I was deceived. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> Here, in my opinion, only the image of the company works.  Everything that a company does, how seriously it looks, how responsibly it is to all questions: to the site, to the service, to the consultations of clients.  It all adds up to a single picture and the user no longer has any doubts. <br><br>  <b>Problem:</b> I do not have a measuring tape at home.  I can not take the size. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> On the site, you can print the tape on A4 paper, cut and glue it.  It will not help those who do not have a printer, but we will cover some of the audience. <br><br><h4>  Satisfying user desires </h4><br>  From the first publications and discussions in the open spaces of the Internet, various wishes from users fell down.  Each of them is discussed and a decision is made about the expediency of its implementation.  (For those that read 37Signals 'Getting real', this will seem common, but for some reason, not all projects are so jealous of the wishes of customers) <br><br><h5>  What was done at the request of customers: </h5><br><ul><li>  Payment by plastic cards </li><li>  Increased range of fabrics </li><li>  Gift certificates </li><li>  <a href="http://rubashka-na-zakaz.ru/mens/ru/feedbacks.php">Testimonials</a> (Here, too, an important fact should be noted - all comments are laid out, regardless of whether they are good or bad. This requires a certain courage and, I am one hundred percent sure, positively influences customer confidence in the service.) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  What is planned to be implemented in the near future </h5><br><ul><li>  Payment Yandex.Money, WebMoney, etc. </li><li>  Photo gallery of finished shirts </li><li>  Delivery to the CIS countries and abroad. </li></ul><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Customers themselves form a service for themselves.  It is beneficial to all: customers get what they want, service loyal customers. <br><br><h6>  Some facts left without attention </h6><br><ul><li>  Changing the name and logo <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yakostro/3989244285/" title="LogoWeb_change by Yakostro, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/635/71a/a8f/63571aa8f424689400c4edd89d07c906.jpg" width="500" height="104" alt="LogoWeb_change"></a> </li><li>  The creators of the service have made an affiliate program for webmasters.  It is already working and orders are coming for it.  I also registered to try, and if you were interested in reading this article, and you decide to order a shirt, <a href="http://rubashka-na-zakaz.ru/%3F318bfa96b60dd621f230998964e16fdd0571ac01">you can follow my link</a> (of course, I don‚Äôt hope so much :-) </li><li>  In the <a href="http://rubashka-na-zakaz.ru/mens/ru/feedbacks.php">reviews,</a> you can find a couple of sentimental stories about how the service saved the non-standard size of the suitors from the fate of being brought before the altar topless. </li></ul><br>  I did not mention the changes that relate to the quality of products, since this is not really my competence.  I think it is clear that without the quality of the service itself, all marketing and technical efforts would be in vain. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will say that all these measures, as well as the efficient promotion and uniqueness of the service itself (for Russia) inevitably lead to an increase in its popularity.  There is something to learn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71753/</a></p>
