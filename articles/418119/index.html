In addition, personal data of employees (Level One and others), including scans of driver's licenses and passports, Level One business data (invoices, contracts and bank account details).  But so for warm-up. </p><br><p>  And finally <del>  probably to finish off </del>  the access level (permissions set) installed on the server at the time of opening the "hole" suddenly showed up as <abbr title="means that the server was publicly available for recording">writable</abbr> , i.e.  anyone could potentially change the documents lying there, for example, by changing the bank account number in the accountant‚Äôs instruction for a direct transfer, could enlist a loved one in the staff, could plug in a malicious program, etc.  joy </p><br><h3 id="kak-utaschili-zashli">  how <del>  dragged off </del>  logged in </h3><br><p>  And here (as I have already hinted above) everything is very simple - the server was (or suddenly once became) accessible via <abbr title="common file transfer protocol used for mirrors or for backing up large data sets">rsync</abbr> .  The rsync server was not limited by IP (not at the level of users, keys, etc.), i.e.  All data could be written off by any rsync client connected to the rsync port. </p><br><p>  Once again - rsync stupidly stuck open port out, without any additional verification. </p><br><p> Probably just the wrong setting (the effect of several cooks in the same kitchen, etc.). <br>  I do not know (and UpGuard is silent) what was there specifically - whether ssh is open (which is unlikely), legacy rsh as the transport layer, direct unison or what other socket method, rdiff or csync over HTTP, etc.  There are many options, but - the point is that in any case, the ‚Äúattack vector‚Äù would be nullified by the simplest firewall rule that allows connections to only strictly defined ports from <code>127.0.0.1</code> , <code>[::1]</code> and another pair of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù addresses, aka white list. </p><br><h3 id="chto-imeem">  What we have </h3><br><p>  Automation of production has changed the industry, but it has also created many new areas for risk, where the weakest link (including the human factor, by malicious intent, due to oversight, misconfiguration or stupidity) negates the entire corporate security system, which means that enterprises need to take more serious care of all the links involved in the organization‚Äôs digital ecosystem. </p><br><p>  And on your VPS-ke (and maybe where else, where traffic can be forwarded with a tunnel tomorrow or somehow turned to "outside") close everything out of harm's place with a whitelisting, so that tomorrow some service will suddenly get access outside ( or a new attack vector that appeared) did not drop your safety below the baseboard. </p><br><p>  Well, incite a familiar auditor to your "provider of engineering and other services" ... </p><br><p>  Suddenly there too <del>  rsync ports sticking out </del>  - stigma in the cannon. </p></div>
