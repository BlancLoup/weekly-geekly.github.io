Now I will tell you a story, about one idea that I really want to realize, but I don‚Äôt have enough of my own forces. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88d/303/686/88d303686d44d60c8131f2504372a870.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The guys from our studio love computers that have an apple on the back of the case.  And we love the story of this wonderful apple company.  And so, one, moderately hot day, we decided to make a website where we would collect all the photos and information about all the computers (or all the products in general - have not yet decided) of this apple company.  With beautiful pictures, rich descriptions, easy navigation and other amenities.  But as soon as we began to calculate how much time it would take to write articles only (I don‚Äôt want to use paste only if the article is very successful), we were a little horrified. <a name="habracut"></a>  Therefore, we decided to appeal to all Apple-community in RuNet with the appeal "A lol, we are looking for talents!".  Simply put, we invite all-all-all to take part in the search for information to fill the site: photos, articles, translations, screenshots, interesting facts.  The code name of the project is displayed on the top-secret screenshot (taken in the literal sense of the word, ‚Äúon my knees in 20 minutes).  I'll tell you a little about what we have, what is required and what we can offer. <br><habracut><br>  <b>What we have:</b> <br>  - The idea and a clear understanding of how everything should be.  At least on a single site.  Simple navigation, convenient system of "organizing" museum exhibits, and more. <br>  - Programmer (exhausted, 1pc), which appends the basis for the project.  Accordingly, we already have a basis. <br>  - Inspiration.  We all like this project, and in the absence of orders, we approached it with great enthusiasm. <br>  - Here is such a sketch: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fdd/6ce/043/fdd6ce043f32dadedf6d886136ae7abf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What do we need:</b> <br>  We need you.  All those who have the desire and opportunity to devote themselves to writing one or two articles, in a light, not fanatical style - the description of each exhibit.  We have selected so far 40 computers that were released in 1976 before that day.  Therefore 40 descriptions are required.  The sources are full (all models are present in the English-language Wikipedia).  Nothing supernatural is needed - a couple of lines of description, a couple of lines about the principles of operation and a couple of lines about the history of creation and interesting facts.  With the desire and motivation for it, the work is very simple.  We also need people who can find photos and, if possible, screenshots of the exhibits.  We will find work for everyone.

      <b>What can we offer for it:</b> <br>  We have not yet reached agreement on the issue of monetization of the project (we did not agree to ‚Äúbe‚Äù or ‚Äúnot to be‚Äù), but if we run banner ads, we will offer everyone who helped place a place in the rotation for a certain period of time (advertise anything - blozhek, Facebook page, saytik on people, etc.) But, I repeat, this option is still in question.  But we can certainly promise you a place on the honor roll - a page where we will collect all the workers, with photos.  We are doing this project on our own enthusiasm, and unfortunately, apart from these two options, we cannot offer anything (although if we have ideas, we will listen in the comments). <br><br>  If you are interested in this project, and you have a desire to take part in its creation, let us know about it - we will be happy to share with you the work :) Write to me@alta1r.ru.  Write about your capabilities and exactly what you want to help us.  Our humble studio will be very grateful to you. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66687/</a></p>
