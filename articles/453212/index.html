  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Consumer Reports: The latest version of Tesla autopilot is far from perfect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/8bd/18d/39d8bd18df3dd74a33a21e094ac1a667.jpg"><br><br>  Tesla Company regularly updates the firmware of its electric vehicles, and also tries to improve the Autopilot.  Recently, autopilot test results were published by members of Consumer Reports.  The tests were conducted on an electric vehicle Tesla Model 3s. <br><br>  As part of the test, the team <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/consumer-reports-latest-autopilot-far-less-competent-than-a-human/">sent several drivers to Connecticut</a> (USA) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/consumer-reports-latest-autopilot-far-less-competent-than-a-human/">highways</a> in order to check how well or badly Autopilot is doing its job.  One of the features that has been tested is a new feature for automatically changing lanes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it turned out, Autopilot is much less competent in this matter than a person.  Of course, the system cannot be compared with the driver, since the instruction to the electric vehicle says that "the Autopilot is not a complete replacement for the driver, the latter should not remove hands from the steering wheel while driving." 
      <br>

      However, Consumer Reports decided to test the new feature.  One of the problems is that the autopilot asks the driver to confirm the need to change lanes.  Rather, he requested, because within a few days the developers added the ability to change lanes without confirmation. <br><br>  But, unfortunately, there are still problems.  The main problem is that Autopilot, as far as can be judged, is not able to evaluate the actions of other drivers.  But when changing lanes, especially at high speed, it is extremely necessary.  Testers said that the electric car did not recognize the actions of other drivers, plus to all, the Tesla Model 3s did not signal a turnaround that is required to warn other road users. <br><br>  But the worst thing is not even this, but the fact that the car cut the other cars, and at the same time it slowed down to create a distance between itself and the other car.  "This may be a big surprise for the car that you cut," <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/autonomous-driving/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-automatic-lane-change-requires-significant-driver-intervention/">said</a> one of the test participants. <br><br>  Testers found that the Model 3s rear cameras have a limited range, they cannot see what is far behind the electric vehicle.  Accordingly, the autopilot is not able to adequately assess the speed of the cars going behind, if there is a large distance between them and the electric car.  Electric vehicles are cut by vehicles that move very fast, moving very close by how many meters in a couple of seconds. <br><br>  Plus, the autopilot sometimes violates specific traffic rules that are relevant to Connecticut.  ‚ÄúWe appreciated the actions of the electric car with representatives of the traffic police and they confirmed this fact.  Violation is punishable, so you can get a fine for it, ‚Äùsaid representatives of Consumer Reports. <br><br>  In their opinion, driving a car that can independently change its lane is tiresome.  Representatives of Consumer Reports said that this is similar to how to first put a teenager behind the wheel and control his driving on the road. <br><br>  The testimonies of representatives of Consumer Reports are important because they allow us to assess how close the technology is to complete autonomy ‚Äî what Tesla is seeking.  On the other hand, the company is making progress, since previously the autopilot only followed the lane and acted in accordance with its surroundings.  If an obstacle appeared in front, the autopilot braked or turned. <br><br>  Tesla has repeatedly stated that it plans to introduce new autopilot functions gradually, so that over time, the autopilot will replace the person behind the wheel.  But if the introduction of new products will be just as problematic as in the case of the lane change function, the effectiveness of the company's plan can be questioned. <br><br>  True, Tesla is constantly improving its autopilot, correcting errors found.  Perhaps over time, electric cars will learn to skillfully change the lane on intercity routes, and this problem will no longer exist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453212/</a></p>
