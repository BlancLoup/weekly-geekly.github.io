      And then you think: in vain, of course, the authors of the articles do not take into account the recommendations of seo-experts regarding how much the text fits into the Title. <br><br>  But seriously, ‚Äústrange headphones‚Äù is our favorite topic: then we have bone conduction in all forms, then headphones without wires, where the main thing is not music, but bluetooth, or even none - headphones that do not lose anything and than not synchronized.  Smart earplugs that need to be charged.  That's the world before it came. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wh/ii/k1/whiik11r1tza0utvdk0vo9hq_fm.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Generally, to be honest, we liked this thing.  On Habr√© there was already a mined review on this device, and indeed many things imported by the ‚ÄúDadzhet‚Äù really seem strange to someone.  The price tag is also striking for many - it costs QuietOn and really not so little: <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/shumopodaviteli-quieton.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dquieton%26utm_campaign%3Dquieton">about 13 thousand rubles</a> ! <br><br>  For those who objected that you can do a penny earplugs - in fact, no.  Compare, look, and earplugs do not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/w5/bv/rnw5bv2jvdoshtawv4blljz-nzu.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, and here it is necessary to praise the Dadget after all: they somehow manage to always sell something cheaper than the manufacturer.  So it was with their CO2 tracker, which cost the supplier $ 100, and in Russia - about 4,500 rubles, and now: on the official site of QuietOn costs 179 Euros (* 74 rubles), and in Russia it is 12,990 thousand rubles. <br><br>  <b>What is QuietOn</b> <br><br>  QuietOn - intelligent electronic ear plugs that are designed to reduce ambient noise at certain frequencies, making work, hobbies and recreation more comfortable.  <b>These headphones can be addressed:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1. For those who have problems falling asleep, they are acutely responsive to surrounding sounds.  For example, the sounds of snoring. </li><li>  2. For those who cannot concentrate enough on working in a noisy open office. </li><li>  3. Representatives of the construction professions. </li><li>  4. Those who fly frequently. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/ia/k6/jciak6k0hqa7lsyifrx6b25d-ay.gif"><br><br>  <b>Who they do not fit:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1. In fact, in bed they will not be very comfortable. </li><li>  2. Those who are used to working with music </li></ul><br>  We'll have to admit that these are headphones for those who love silence - such a paradox.  Moreover, not absolute silence.  Experience of use indicates that they are blocking, of course, not all. <br><br><blockquote>  The effect of noise reduction is achieved using the technology of inverting sound waves in the low-frequency range.  As a result, you hardly hear the annoying noise and hear the interlocutor's voice well or public information announcements.  QuietOn is also used in noisy industries, in open-space offices, in homes near noisy highways, at night next to a snoring person. </blockquote><br>  It was curious to test them in the office: indeed, part of the noise, the shuffling of the legs, the pieces of paper falling from the table, the sound of the coffee machine ‚Äî much that merged into a single hum, declined, could no longer be heard.  In this case, the votes of colleagues remained somehow distinguishable.  At the same time, the sense of space was somewhat distorted.  You seem to hear the voice, but, plunging into work, you do not immediately understand where it comes from.  For full communication, of course, it is better to remove them from the ears. <br><br>  Street noise also behaves interestingly: harsh signals are still somewhere present, but all sorts of "side" noises, steps, rolled carriages are visually distinguishable, but not audible.  In all these cases, you do not seem to be completely turned off from reality, you can react to the car, which is by and large safe enough. <br><br>  An interesting test was carried out with such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3_/ws/zd/3_wszdea2w0bdk9u3ofysr2zpzi.jpeg"><br><br>  The device is designed for those who fall asleep poorly.  It mimics the soothing sounds of nature.  We chose the sound of rain at medium volume, next to the laptop. <br><br>  <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s1qUtSdXwwVl">9 seconds recording on iphone 7</a> <br><br><ul><li>  In ordinary earplugs without music - the sound is heard remotely, but distinct </li><li>  In the earplugs - the sound is heard </li><li>  In QuietOn - no sound is heard </li></ul><br>  Ear plugs, of course, win in price, but lose in universality.  They either block everything or do not block anything: a lot depends on the characteristics of the structure of the ear.  A little less ‚Äúsealing‚Äù, and the sound completely penetrates inside.  In general, personal experience with earplugs is bad. <br><br>  It turned out that they can reduce the surrounding noise, but at the same time it still remains with you, still merging into a single hum from the sounds of the printer, walking, the hum of voices, etc., everything is the same, but quieter.  QuietOn <i>eliminates</i> some of the sounds. <br><br>  <b>How QuietOn Gags work</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Innovative noise suppressors allow you to create a personal, quiet space for sleeping or working.  Unlike conventional earplugs, they not only block the ear canal, but also invert sound waves, which reduces the noise level by 40 dB! </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/6s/o8/cr6so8p4cls6cempd3fdzpkbo9m.jpeg"><br><br>  They are arranged quite simply: there is a microphone that picks up the sound and a processor that determines whether to ‚Äúdampen‚Äù it or not.  If the sound needs to be removed, the headphones give out the antiphase of the incoming sound, plus a minus = zero.  Approximately the way sound leakage compensation works in bone headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/vs/b7/u6vsb7fulnh2uft4gz34hjpa0f8.png"><br><br>  And it works.  At first, this seems a bit unusual, but as a result you get used to such noise cancellation quite quickly, and the surrounding sound space becomes quite natural. <br><br>  Plus to the active noise suppressors, the cushions play the role of passive noise suppressors.  The set includes three interchangeable nozzles: two versions of silicone and one foam one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/y8/ng/qgy8ngzdjtvdoq1hkc5uccr4etg.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, the kit was scolded not quite rightly.  Perhaps, from a device costing under 13 thousand, I wanted something more, but in principle - everything is in place: interchangeable nozzles, cable, box-charging.  Boxing is made simple, it's true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/0z/-h/uc0z-h1cg_nz6jq_on5-ypngu2a.jpeg"><br><br>  When you close it with headphones, we see the gap.  This is a little tense from an aesthetic point of view, but this case performs its functions.  From the back side charging connector: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/6q/w7/sj6qw78ufz79u3wulhl2gsptx3u.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside is a place for QuietOn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/4m/vf/bf4mvfzdt62uh6oli6kfrczduco.jpeg"><br><br>  Charging electrodes are located on the cover: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/9c/li/kr9clinujsz_fyvdyxsi5yki65s.jpeg"><br><br>  Accordingly, the upper part of the headphones, external, open all the time while wearing - this is the place to connect the charging, which may not be the most thoughtful decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/d4/sh/rzd4shzb7fz5ksp88noylr71wmg.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  We write this post, when someone is drilling something again behind the wall in our office, but this sound is indistinguishable at the moment, because it is QuietOn in our ears.  In short - then their promises to fulfill these gags. <br><br>  Sleeping in a horizontal position in them will not be very comfortable, and indeed, headphones for sleeping is also our favorite, but perhaps a separate topic.  But to take a nap in the plane - it is quite possible, as in the train, in the train. <br><br>  During street walks, most people prefer headphones with music, but there are also usage models for QuietOn: I chose to read a book in nature, the noise of high / skate, the wind noise will be less distinguishable. <br><br>  Most applicable, they still seem like an office accessory for those who can not work with music.  To concentrate is a normal decision.  The only thing that is alarming is, of course, the price - 12 990. Headphones without sound with the cost of the first AirPods - this is very decent, of course. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">15% discount for those who are interested.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/shumopodaviteli-quieton.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dquieton%26utm_campaign%3Dquieton">You</a> can buy <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/shumopodaviteli-quieton.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dquieton%26utm_campaign%3Dquieton">QuietOn</a> on our website.  With a 15% discount on the coupon, they will cost a little more than 11 thousand - <b>QUIETON15</b> - until the end of April. <br></div></div><br>  The device is definitely specific and very niche.  It‚Äôs hard to say how much you need to love silence in order to use additional ‚Äúsmart ear plugs‚Äù.  To be honest to the end - we give the owner‚Äôs feedback from Habr from the previous review: <br><br>  <i>I will write an honest review as a person who went to them for four months.</i>  <i>I live in central London.</i>  <i>From the noise you get tired wildly.</i>  <i>Car, people, music.</i>  <i>The average noise level with open windows is 65-70 decibels, with 50 closed. The earplugs do their job just fine, no complaints to this.</i>  <i>Trim noise to a comfortable 35-40.</i>  <i>In the subway, even the grinding of wheels is not annoying.</i>  <i>They are comfortable walking, sleeping, chatting and living in general.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>On this pros generally end.</i>  <i>Of the minuses:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  The sheath can burn in hell.  It does not close normally, randomly opens.  The cable can easily open it with its light weight.  Insulating tape and a gift to you. </li><li>  Assembly and design as if they were made in the 2000s.  Although the headphones themselves are well assembled, but the connecting seam can be sharp and not pleasant to the touch. </li><li>  Do not count on the manufacturer‚Äôs technical support.  Have it, twitter, nobody will answer you </li><li>  There is no protection against water.  Dropped in a puddle go for new ones.  And fuck you dry them.  If the water is inside, the earplug is over </li></ul><br>  In general, the general feeling: this is a very specific product for people who are really hard with noise.  But for that kind of money (US $ 200 in London) I would rather take the excellent noise-suppressive headphones of any other company. <br><br>  I think the niche of noise-suppressing earplugs still has room to move and I do not recommend buying these earplugs. <br><br>  We will add only a couple of comments: in general, it is nice that for the most part our problematic issues coincided.  Ear plugs work, but carelessness in the performance and price tag - do not bribe.  The only thing that is not quite true for Russian users is that technical support works better for us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446422/</a></p>
