History of sad experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Closed another project, I want to share my experience!  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is the creation of a studio specializing in the development of designer QR codes.  Under the cut: the creation from idea to implementation, budgets, implementation and conclusions, as well as work from the portfolio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f6/304/979/2f6304979bc93cf1a1dfbafd49f69108.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  QR codes, as such, became interested after the release of the Google service - Sesame QR (at that time I did not know that the Google project would soon be closed).  With the availability of free resources and an interesting domain, an idea emerged about a possible business.  The idea has evolved after reading one of the many articles on the modification of the design of QR codes, while maintaining their readability.

I consulted with the staff designer: implementation is possible, the cost price is low. <br><br>  <b>Budget:</b> <br><br>  Creating a website for advertising and selling the product: 500 euros.  - minimal design and development. <br>  Creation of 10 codes for a portfolio: 1000 euros - 100 euros per code: on average, it takes from 3 to 5 hours of designer time to create a code. <br>  Online advertising: laid 500 euros for the primary feedback from the market. <br>  Own resources: 55 hours.  20h on writing and concept development.  20h for correspondence with potential partners, 15h for meetings. <br><br>  Total: 2,000 euros (+ domain and host) and 55 hours of time. <br><br>  Substantial resources, however, and the exhaust from this project could be quite promising: a niche studio in a rich and developing market.  On average, it was planned to request from 300 to 900 euros for the implementation of the QR code, depending on the complexity and elaboration of the concept <br><br>  <b>Implementation:</b> <br><br>  The site and portfolio were implemented within 1.5 months.  At the same time, the product concept was written and approved.  An example for the portfolio was taken by the existing brands-firms operating in Estonia.  On the launch of the site, they activated advertising: 10 days, 50 euro each, and letters were sent to prospective partners: printing houses, portfolio companies, advertising agencies. <br><br>  From the good news: almost all the companies from the portfolio responded, 8 meetings were held. <br><br>  Their bad news: all companies were large enough and had their own design resources.  The advertising campaign in Google brought about 10 contacts, none of them moved to existing customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bf/062/f80/4bf062f80cec4a1020902b74cbd8238d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  This product is possible and is interesting and promising, but its sale to the target audience is difficult due to its narrow focus - most companies saw its use only during advertising campaigns or promotions, or had the opportunity to sell it on their own.  It was decided to close the project due to the lack of prospects.  Of the clients, they did not receive anyone other than <a href="http://www.veneviisa.ee/">Vene viisa</a> and <a href="http://www.sushikoju.ee/">Sushi</a> . <br><br>  I would appreciate feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296984/</a></p>
