This technology has many advantages.  For example, applications built on it do not need to be installed on devices.  A user simply needs to install one application, say, a social network in which he can communicate, view the news feed and play mobile games written in all the same HTML5.

      Most of the development teams of such games face the key problem of developing their products - marketing, since the competition on gaming platforms that support HTML5 is quite high.  Classmates try to support game developers, allowing them to promote applications on their gaming platform for free.  Since the beginning of 2018, mobile game developers on social networks have earned more than 100 million rubles, and over the last year the number of game launches on Odnoklassniki mobile platform has doubled to 350 million per day. <br><br><h3>  Nominations </h3><br>  You can take part in the championship in two categories: Pro and New Star. <br><br>  Pro nomination is designed for experienced developers and studios.  They can port their own games from other platforms to Odnoklassniki.  The three best games will get free traffic to a certain number of game installations on the social network: <br><br><ol><li>  the winner will receive 1 million installations; </li><li>  second place - 500,000 installations; </li><li>  third place - 250,000 installations. </li></ol><br>  In the category of New Star will participate newcomers to game development and teams that have not yet published their games on social networks.  Three winners will receive cash prizes: <br><br><ol><li>  300 000 rubles for the first place; </li><li>  200 000 rubles - for the second; </li><li>  100 000 rubles - for the third. </li></ol><br>  In addition, the winners will be able to consult the team of the investment division of Mail.Ru Games Ventures on the further development of the game project, and the authors of the best games will have a unique opportunity to present their project and attract investments from Mail.Ru Games Ventures. <br><br><h3>  The mechanics of the competition and the condition of participation </h3><br>  You can participate in the competition, both individually and in teams.  Mobile HTML5 games that were not previously published on the Odnoklassniki gaming platform are allowed to participate. <br><br>  To participate in the championship, you need to register on the <a href="https://okgamescup.ru/">OK Instant Games Cup</a> portal, add your game and provide key information on it.  Add a link to the downloaded game in the application on the tournament website before the deadline for receiving applications. <br><br>  We will award the authors of the top 10 games of the championship as a result of a jury vote, representatives of the gaming industry and venture investors Mail.Ru Games Ventures in the office of Mail.Ru Group. <br><br><h3>  schedule </h3><br><ol><li>  From September 3 to October 21 - accepting applications on the competition website; </li><li>  October 23 - announcement of winners and prize-winners; </li><li>  October 26 - rewarding at the Mail.Ru Group office. </li></ol><br><h3>  Useful materials </h3><br>  If you are just starting to create a game or are preparing it for publication on the Odnoklassniki gaming platform, then these links will definitely be useful to you: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://apiok.ru/dev/examples/html">Sample HTML application</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://apiok.ru/dev/app/">What is the application, its parameters and download methods?</a> </li></ol><br>  In addition, we recommend to watch the video posted on the competition website. <br><br><h3>  Community </h3><br>  Any questions?
