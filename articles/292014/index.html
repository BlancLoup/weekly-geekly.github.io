      I stopped and asked if everything was fine when one of the men said: ‚ÄúThis is not fair.  You have this beautiful house and a beautiful car, and we are here for a salary a little more than the minimum. ‚Äù <br><br>  I approached this man, and we talked about creating wealth for more than an hour.  I told him that life was not always so good, and that at some point I had debts of fifty thousand dollars, and I had no idea how to get out of it.  The man shook my hand and thanked me for sharing my knowledge with him. <br><br>  This morning I was going to get into my car again.  The man behind the wheel of a truck driving down the street stopped at my house and shouted: ‚ÄúMr. Ziebold, I followed your advice and started my own business.  Five people work for me, and the business is growing rapidly.  My family and I feel that kind of freedom that we could not even have dreamed of before. ‚Äù <br><br>  He continued: ‚ÄúPlease share your wisdom with others!‚Äù <br><br>  Extremely touched by the fact that a hundred men followed my advice and changed their lives for the better, I in turn follow his advice and share with you the key points of what I told him six months ago. <br><br>  1. In a market economy, <b>anyone can earn as much as he wants</b> . <br><br>  2. <b>Your past, educational background or IQ does not matter</b> when it comes to making money. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  3. <b>The fastest way to make money is to solve a problem</b> .  The larger the scale of the problem to be solved, the more you earn money. <br><br>  4. <b>Do not listen to negative people who say that life should be a struggle</b> , and that you need to settle down and be grateful for what you have. <br><br>  5. <b>Expect to earn more money</b> .  To do this, think big.  One hundred thousand dollars, five hundred thousand dollars, and maybe a million? <br><br>  6. <b>Drop the mindset of fear and poverty, and start looking at money as a source of good things</b> : freedom, opportunity, and abundance. <br><br>  7. <b>Being rich is not a privilege, it is your right</b> .  If you create large-scale benefits for others, you have the right to be as rich as you want. <br><br>  8. <b>Do not wait until the ship comes for you</b> .  You will not find, will not save and will not make rich external force.  If you want to become rich, build your own ship.  No one else will help you. <br><br>  9. <b>Stop worrying about running out of money and start thinking about how to earn more</b> .  Permanent worry about money is the wrong way to live.  Better dream about them. <br><br>  10. <b>Stop telling yourself that wealth is out of your control</b> .  The truth is that making money is work on yourself. <br><br>  Just like a man who worked in my house six months ago, upset by the state of his finances and embittered by the rich, you have the opportunity to radically change your financial situation.  Perhaps you have lived in debt for years, perhaps dreamed of having more - all this is possible - if you make a decision and tune in to it. <br><br>  Steve Siebold is the author of How Rich People Think, a man who has become a millionaire himself.  He surveyed more than 1,200 richest people in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292014/</a></p>
