    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About bad infinity and definitions </h4><br>  <i>The guinea pig.</i>  <i>Firstly, not sea, and secondly, not a pig ...</i> <br><br>  Remember in school geometry lessons?  How many points in the segment?  Infinitely.  And how many segments in a square?  Also endless.  How many points in a square then?  What, infinity again?  This is already some kind of bad infinity, second-order infinity ... thank God in the real world, to draw a tolerable segment there is no need to infinitely draw points at all - a qualitative leap pretty quickly happens - and the set of points subjectively turns into quite a tolerable line. <br><br>  But in order to draw a square, we will have to make a qualitative leap again - after all, how many do not stuff points into a segment, it will not become a square.  Each new dimension requires its own qualitative transition. <br><br>  Confusion, as always, begins with wrong definitions - a 3D printer is not a printer (it doesn‚Äôt make any ‚Äúprints‚Äù or images), and in general it is not 3D.  If you simplify the scheme of the printer - then it is most of all reminiscent of the "betono grouser", with which help build modern homes.  Elozit his back and forth, squeezing sausages stiffening mass. <br><br><h4>  About complexity and utility </h4><br>  <i>Dad, and who will fence someone - whale elephant or elephant whale?</i> <br><br>  There and here are two whole dimensions that require high-quality transitions - the ability to move quite discretely along two axes.  In this sense, 3D is no better than the usual Laserjeta.  But unlike a banal printer, it can move in another dimension - up and down.  This truth does not mean at all that the printer can print an arbitrary point in space (evil gravity does not allow).  So far, each element of the printed design must be securely fastened to the footboard, so that the third dimension is more experimental and without working out the resulting product with a file nothing good comes out.  If you do not believe - try to print a baby rattle and tell how you did it. <br><br>  It would seem that a 3D printer should logically be an order of magnitude more complicated than a color photo printer.  But nothing like that - a regular color printer has at least three more dimensions of the color space.  And it gives him the necessary versatility, allowing you to print almost any image.  The path from the first black and white printer to half-color took a modest 30 years, and this despite the fact that the theory of printing and color theory is well developed.  A 3D printer as a printing device is much easier than a good color photo printer.  And the only reason why it did not appear much earlier is its economic inexpediency. <br><br><h4>  About dimension </h4><br>  <i>What do you want to be smart or beautiful?</i> <br><br>  What is the way to go through the printer to take over the world?  So it really became possible to print the necessary things.  Let's distribute the dimensions that exist in the world of real things.  I understand that the list is not accurate, but even offhand: <br><br><ul><li>  Hardness (soft - hard) </li><li>  Density (light - heavy) </li><li>  Plasticity (plastic - elastic) </li><li>  Electrical conductivity (dielectric - conductor) </li><li>  Hue (red - purple) </li><li>  Saturation (colorless - color) </li><li>  Brightness (more precisely reflectivity) (black - bright) </li><li>  Heat conductivity (I can't even find the words) </li><li>  Chemical activity (inert - active) </li><li>  ... </li></ul><br><br>  And if you, for example, have decided to print out food, then add more edibility, humidity, acidity, salinity, bitterness, fleshiness ....  And we did not touch the scent ... <br><br><h4>  About life </h4><br>  <i>The philistines always debase the most beautiful ideas.</i> <br><br>  Imagine - Saturday morning.  The kids call you to play table tennis with them.  You quickly change into a tracksuit, grab the net and rackets - but the trouble is, the dog chews up all the balls.  Run to the store?  Nonsense, because you have a 3D printer!  All you need is to print a couple of balls.  The simplest lightweight elastic white is almost an ideal sphere, this is not a hard, hard ‚Äúhow many edr‚Äù with a cool logo ... (oh, yes, this is a golf ball) <br><br>  Five minutes of searching on the Internet and you have already downloaded a great model.  Just a couple of minutes the printer growls, processing the order - and about the miracle of technology!  You have a crooked monster in your hands who jumps bad and weighs like a sinker ... <br><br>  Thank God, the children of retrogrades have ordered everything in the online store and the delivery drone is already carefully loading the package in the center of the lawn ... <br><br><h4>  About progress </h4><br>  <i>At a time when spaceships ...</i> <br><br>  The fact is that your printer must have a high resolution in each dimension, so high that the quantity turns into quality.  I have no idea how this problem will be solved - the only thing that comes to my mind is the creation of a material with given chemical and physical properties at the required point in space (a common thing for Demiurg-2200 series printers is like a two megawatt thermonuclear power source and electron-tunneling manipulator "Yahva Inside" on board) <br><br>  I am an optimist - and I believe that someday it will be so.  But for now, we are left to admire the technical progress, looking at how the sausages of molten plastic fall on the substrate with jeweler's precision. <br><br>  PS <br>  Well, where is the artificial intelligence?  And all the same dimension ... The current mind is 7 billion individuals, 500 million years of evolution, billions of neurons.  And each of them has thousands of arbitrary links (three-dimensional dimension of the bulk brain, instead of a one-dimensional code of zeros and ones).  And over all this wealth, signals of many types run differently, processed and interpreted in different chemical environments (oh, these pranksters are mu-opiates, endorphins and oxytocins ...) So, do not expect a real reason in the near future.  But who knows him, where there is the subjective limit of the transition from quantity to quality ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238343/</a></p>
