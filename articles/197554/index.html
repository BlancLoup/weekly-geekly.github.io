Rarely, when a carefully planned party can be compared with a sudden visit of friends, and a dish prepared exactly according to the recipe, with the improvisation of the master.  This phenomenon also takes place in our team: we didn‚Äôt think about ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù, when Media Monitor was implemented for a couple of weeks, which, as sometimes happens in the development of niche B2B products, turned out to be surprisingly in demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8d/ce5/9cd/d8dce59cda81e78ea2c47f329ee0c5b5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  MeMo (Media Monitor) turned out to be so useful for ‚Äúvictims of the information society‚Äù that several colleagues from the team now use it for ‚Äúpersonal self-serving‚Äù informational purposes, and all information workers who saw it, media professionals and (often forced) consumers of large information streams are urged to give borrowed

In particular, on the law of transfer of quantity to quality: the information revolution, the explosive growth of generated content inevitably had to lead to a change in the management paradigm of (personal, corporate) information flows. <br>  15 years ago, ‚ÄúInternet users‚Äù lacked the ‚ÄúAy!‚Äù And ‚ÄúYellow Pages of the Internet‚Äù catalog, and now Google / Yandex help, with the result ‚Äú10 million documents were found‚Äù, is not always help. <br><br>  Realizing the demand for information workers of the product, originally perceived by us as "incidental", we began to look for the causes of the cumulative positive effect of the addition of several technologies. <br>  To what conclusion so far (everything changes in dynamics, maybe something else will appear tomorrow) we came from the point of view of the needs of the ‚Äúinformation consumer‚Äù: <br><br>  1. New information is needed right now; <br>  2. Sources must be trusted (authoritative); <br>  3. There should be a lot of sources (hundreds, thousands); <br>  4. There should be few materials (only the most relevant / relevant); <br>  5. Have their own corporate information flows; <br>  6. Multilingual information (different countries); <br>  7. Personal selection of sources (we are all human, "the taste and color ..."); <br>  8. Automatic analysis of materials on thematic "shelves"; <br>  9. Easily customizable storyline / situational / event toolkit (the ability to create your own info shelf in a couple of minutes, for example, to read materials on Formula 1 in Monaco - create the necessary settings once and read as the event goes on). <br><br>  Agree - nothing extraordinary, everything is clear for a long time.  In fact, we are talking about a personal ‚Äústall with the press‚Äù (by the way, there are ‚Äúdinosaurs‚Äù in our team who implemented personal newspaper projects in the last millennium). <br><br>  So, if we did everything initially as planned, we would set the task approximately as follows - at the entrance: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ There is a lot of information in the world; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requires a small set of filtering options; <br>  ‚Ä¢ A limited set of subject headings (the law of sustainability of any information corporate structure); <br>  ‚Ä¢ You need to be able to organize an infinite set of scenes, including new ones (such as the Chelyabinsk meteorite); <br>  ‚Ä¢ And be sure to take into account ... the human factor in the perception of information flows. <br><br>  In reality, everything was completely wrong, and rather it was like cooking pizza for a suddenly organized party: throwing everything on the dough in the fridge: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The test (from the word ‚Äúdough‚Äù, not ‚Äútest‚Äù) is our favorite Platform, which we have already written about in our blog; <br>  ‚Ä¢ To trust products we take only major media outlets, agencies and websites of government agencies; <br>  ‚Ä¢ We will chop the foreigners with the language definition module; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add corporate homemade cheese; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Peperchim express and expert accounts of social media; <br>  ‚Ä¢ We put on a fast fire distributed data collection system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ We decompose on thematic plates by auto-classification; <br>  ‚Ä¢ And the choice of butter and grated cheese will be left to the discretion of the consumer. <br><br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> everyone is happy - information hunger is overwhelmed by rich modern technological OBD solutions. <br><br>  Could it have been possible to make an ‚Äúinformation pizza‚Äù using existing technological possibilities then, say, a year or two ago?  - Theoretically, ‚Äúyes‚Äù, practically - it would not be the kind of product that would fit in 2013, when information flows grew 1.5 times (more - more), and informational ‚Äúwars‚Äù now last only a few minutes (remember, for example , The 3-minute ‚Äúwound of Obama‚Äù that brought down the stock markets, or the 4-minute military coup in Qatar). <br><br>  Several ingredients from our grocery cooler are not included in the recipe for MeMo (at least for now), but we hope that they will surely get to Recipe 2014 - since both high-speed automatic determination of tonality, and NER, and geolocation and trends are already successfully applied in various projects. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> We love our friends and partners and are happy to pay tribute to them: Pavel Ch., Who has been successfully working in major informational publishing houses and agencies for many years, can be considered the inspirer of MeMo. <br>  Of course, we already had a backlog for samples of subscriptions of sources for Personal Media (Info) -Center, we expanded the number of defined languages ‚Äã‚Äãto 30, our AK (Auto Text Classifier) ‚Äã‚Äãalready separated Sport from Show Business, but it was Pavel who incorporated his open mind a lot of different components, clearly outlined the need for their colleagues in a particular product.  Then there was the matter of technology (and technology, and linguistics, and Hayload), and this is our strong point. <br><br>  Come up with new recipes so that it is not only nutritious and useful, but also nice :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197554/</a></p>
