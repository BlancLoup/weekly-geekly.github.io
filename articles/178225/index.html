What versions of UC Browser are available for the Android platform?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> The lightweight mobile browser UCWEB and the more functional UC Mobile on the WebKit engine were initially released, but then these projects were merged and the product was renamed UC Browser.  In spite of this, at the moment there are three different browsers that, besides the interface language and a variety of additional functions, differ primarily in the browser engine: <br>  1. UC Browser mini on the U2 engine (classic compression engine, compression can be disabled only for wap / wml) - the heir to the classic UCWEB.  There are only three types of page adaptation - screen compression, compression with scaling, scaling without compression. <br>  2. UC Browser on the U3 engine (modern engine, supports work with both compressed and uncompressed html pages) - the result of combining UCWEB and UC Mobile; <br>  3. UC Browser HD (for tablets) on the engine of the system (stock) browser Android, traffic compression does not occur. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a>

    <a name="2"></a>  <b>Q. What is the difference between these versions?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> It is worth noting that the versions can be divided into official and unofficial. <br>  Official: <br>  1. Chinese - in the version there are a lot of things, all sorts of goodies in the form of a Chinese market (for example, in it you can download initially paid programs for free).  New features are first received by this version, but the obvious disadvantage is the Chinese interface language; <br>  2. Russian - a version based on the Chinese, but rather severely curtailed in functional terms; <br>  3. The mini version is an even shorter browser version.  Nothing extra.  Uses a minimum of memory with minimal functionality.  The main difference between the mini version is its uhtm page format; <br>  4. HD version - for tablets. <br>  Informal: <br>  1. Chinese - the functionality is almost the same as that of the official Chinese version, but it is translated into Russian and corrected by our craftsmen.  Minus - some places in the interface remain Chinese (if they are sent by the server) or require root-user intervention (replacing the home page, search engines, etc.). <br>  Starting from version 9.0, the official Russian version will have the same functionality as the Chinese one. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="3"></a>  <b>Q. How to view browser saved pages?</b> <br>  <b>A. You</b> just need to open the saved html-file with the browser's built-in file manager.  If you open a program through the file manager and the program is not assigned to this file type by default, the system will ask you to open this file.  Pages saved in the mini version should be opened only in the browser. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="4"></a>  <b>Q. Flash does not work on the latest versions.</b>  <b>What to do?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Try the following: there is an Adobe icon in the phone menu, click on it, click on UC Browser, if there is a puzzle instead of the settings menu - it means that UC Browser does not see your flash player.  It is noted that for normal operation Adobe flash should be non-system, or there should be an update without integration into ROM, if the player is installed in the system. <br>  Plus, it may be the performance of the phones, because flash is very hard, especially youtube videos.  For this, it is better to use special applications. <br>  All of the above applies to translated Chinese versions.  On the official Russian versions of flash, it works acceptably starting from version 9.0.1.275, on earlier ones it does not. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="5"></a>  <b>Q. Why do home pages of different versions differ from each other?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Home pages for each version are sent by the server individually, depending on the language and technical parameters of your device.  The homepage, error pages and some other service pages are encrypted, so in the translated Chinese versions, the ‚ÄúRussian homepage‚Äù is a page that was removed from the Russian (English) version and inserted into the Chinese one, which can eventually fly off.  How to deal with this, consider below. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="6"></a>  <b>Q. The home page flies off the translated versions.</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> To prevent the homepage from flying, we follow the path /data/data/com.UCMobile/UCMobile/usdata4 [or 5, depending on the version] and for the files: <br>  lp_favor, lp_navi, lp_navi_css, nlp_navi_us_popularsites, nlp_navi_us_quicklinks, nlp_navi_us_topsites remove the write permission (using any file manager with root). <br>  The search files sl_start_search, sl_start_search2 are first replaced, then we put the read-only attributes.  Ad advertisement files (of type sl_ad_10) - delete everything and put a ban on writing to the usdata4 folder [5]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/55a/02d/41955a02d1e46ecf4854c5cd1711bb29.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is necessary to take into account the fact that everything changes from version to version and the files can be different. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="7"></a>  <b>Q. Search tools disappeared, how to get them back?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> This can happen when the design of the home page changes and at that moment you decide to use the search.  On the data / data / com.UCMobile / UCMobile / usdata4 [5] path, we change the folder name, for example, to data / data / com.UCMobile / UCMobile / usdata41 <br>  Go to the browser and update the home page through the tab "Help".  Homepage will be empty.  After that, close the browser, go back to the data / data / com.UCMobile / UCMobile / usdata4 [5] path and copy the files from this folder: <br>  sl_start_search <br>  sl_start_search2 in the data / data / com.UCMobile / UCMobile / usdata41 folder. <br>  Folder data / data / com.UCMobile / UCMobile / usdata4 [5] delete, on files <br>  sl_start_search2 and sl_start_search remove write permission.  Rename the folder again. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="8"></a>  <b>Q. Can I make sure that UC Browser does not close when minimized to the background?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> The Android operating system itself determines when and which programs to close, the more RAM, the more programs remain in it.  The browser does not have any specific settings for working in the background, everything is determined solely by the operating system.  Plus, UC Browser remembers its last state, open pages and even the position on the page itself. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="9"></a>  <b>Q. Spoilers that open, then no, why is this happening?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> To allow spoilers to open without reloading the page, it is enough to turn off page compression in the browser settings.  When compression is enabled, the spoiler content is not loaded and becomes available only after your request, which causes the content to load along with the page reload. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="10"></a>  <b>Q. How can I put another theme on the official Russian version?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Everything is simple here: download the theme, then open the built-in file manager (Menu - Downloads - Fileman) - tap on the downloaded theme.  Themes intended for versions below 8.8 are not compatible with themes for newer versions. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="11"></a>  <b>Q. Why are some of my websites without icons (logos) in navigation?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Icons are displayed only if they are in the UC Mobile database.  The base itself is quite small, so the icons of most sites will not be displayed. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="12"></a>  <b>Q. Sites do not correctly determine my time zone.</b>  <b>How to fix?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Quite often sites put the time zone automatically, according to your IP (browser servers are located all over the world, including Russia, China, America, Canada and many others).  Sometimes the browser may not work through your national server, hence the wrong definition.  To solve the problem, it is enough to remove the automatic setting of the time zone in the settings of your profile. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="13"></a>  <b>Q. When the page compression mode is enabled, it will not let me on some sites.</b>  <b>Why so?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> There are several options: <br>  1. The site administrator banned the IP of the compression servers of the UC Browser; <br>  2. Some sites impose restrictions: on the use of a proxy, on a location, on a User-agent, because when you turn off compression, sites see your real location, and in compression mode there will be a proxy server location; <br>  3. Also, the provider, the operator can limit the visit and block sites, and nothing can be done about it. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="14"></a>  <b>Q. Can I import bookmarks from the FireFox browser?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Yes, you can. <br>  1. On Firefox install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmarks">Gmarks</a> plugin <br>  2. In the main Firefox menu, select: Gmarks - Arrange bookmarks - File - Import. <br>  3. Bookmarks are imported into Google Bookmarks (since you are using the Android OS, it is assumed that you have a google account). <br>  4. Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.amlegate.gbookmark">GBookmark</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.androappsdev.gomarks">GoMarks for Google Bookmarks</a> on your device to sync Google Bookmarks bookmarks and stock browser, synchronize them. <br>  5. In UC Browser: Bookmarks - Manage - Import - Import system bookmarks. <br><br>  In a similar way, you can import bookmarks from other browsers if they allow you to save them in html-format or synchronize with Google Bookmarks. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="15"></a>  <b>Q. Can I import bookmarks from Opera mini?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> You can use bookmarks from any Opera browser without synchronizing them.  For this: <br>  1. In Opera settings, turn on the Opera Link bookmark synchronization service; <br>  2. Synchronize with the service; <br>  3. In UC Browser, go to <a href="https://link.opera.com/">link.opera.com</a> , log in, and see our bookmarks there; <br>  4. Save the bookmark with this page in the UC Browser.  Now all bookmarks with Opera are always at hand, up to date. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="16"></a>  <b>Q. How can I search for text on a page in UC Browser?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Menu - Functions - Search <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="17"></a>  <b>Q. I can not respond to the forums, the answer form does not appear.</b>  <b>How to fix?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Either disable compression, or switch to the mobile version of the site, if one is available.  On full versions of sites, when compression is enabled, many scripts do not work (are cut by the compressing server). <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="18"></a>  <b>Q. In Chinese versions, there is an application similar to Google play.</b>  <b>What is it?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> This is a Chinese application manager - a very convenient thing, because there everything is free of charge, that is, for nothing, including applications that are paid for on Google Play.  Of course, it‚Äôs not very convenient to search there, because you need to know the Chinese name of the application, but many have English names.  Upgrading applications also works. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="19"></a>  <b>Q. Is it possible to get rid of advertising?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Certainly possible.  If there is root, it is enough to replace the hosts file, which has enough variants on the Internet.  Advertising will be blocked not only in the browser, but also in other applications. <br>  Applications do the same: <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/">AdAway</a> <br>  <a href="http://adfree.bigtincan.com/">Adfree android</a> <br>  The latest versions of the browser already have a built-in ad blocker. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="20"></a>  <b>Q. What is Udisk?</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> This is a special service from UC Mobile Ltd. that allows you to save and transfer bookmarks to other browser versions, download files to an online disk and upload them from this disk to forums, bypassing your device, and, accordingly, not spending any traffic at all.  More information about Udisk can be found in my article in <a href="http://dimonvideo.ru/articles/4695">Russian</a> and <a href="http://forum.ucweb.com/forum.php%3Fmod%3Dviewthread%26tid%3D12546%26fromuid%3D10804">English</a> .  Since then, much has changed, the service has become English- and Russian-speaking, registration has been simplified, but the principles of its operation remain the same.  At the moment, the ability to view and listen to the content downloaded on Udisk is being introduced into various versions of the browser. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br><a name="21"></a>  <b>Q. How to download torrent files?</b>  <b>After downloading, they do not open.</b> <br>  <b>A.</b> Try downloading torrent files through a western proxy server so that the retracker.local parameter is not added to them. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ucbrowser/blog/178225/"><sup>to contents</sup></a> <br><br>  That's all for the moment.  It is clear that there are much more questions, so do not hesitate to ask them, we will try to answer them and complete this FAQ. <br><br><h2>  Good luck to everyone and with the upcoming holidays! </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178225/</a></p>
