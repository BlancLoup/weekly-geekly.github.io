  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Only mountains can be better than mountains</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Earth, there are many places where almost no man has gone before.  The weather conditions there are not the most favorable: scorching sun, bitter cold, snow, sand, salt water, 100% humidity, extremely low or high pressure.  In such places, even the most seasoned and experienced travelers feel uncomfortable, and the road is completely ordered by the capricious technology. <br><br>  But man is a curious creature, pulling him to discover the most hidden corners of our planet.  And in long, and sometimes very difficult travels, you cannot do without reliable, enduring and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices.  Our story today is about them. <br><br>  American Melissa Arno conceived to conquer Everest.  Of course, this was not her first ascent, and the experience of planning such ‚Äúadventures‚Äù was considerable, so the mountaineer approached the preparation with great responsibility.  On her Facebook page, Melissa admits that the climb itself is perhaps the easiest part of the journey ‚Äî it takes the most time and effort to think through all the details.  And in this case it is important to be able to use the achievements of technical progress.

Firstly, any extreme adventure is a mass of emotions and impressions that need to be somehow preserved and structured.  Paper and pen at a height of hundreds of meters, where the wind penetrating to the bone blows and the temperature drops far beyond the mark "0" is not the best option.  As Melissa notes, sometimes you have to spend the night on the edge of a cliff in a tiny tent and a narrow sleeping bag, and in such conditions you need to have something more reliable than paper on hand. <br><br>  Of course, a computer is not only a notebook for travel notes, it is also a connection with the rest of the world, which people who dare to make an extreme journey especially need.  Modern technologies allow you to access the Internet even in the most remote corners of the planet, and using a mobile computer, mountain climbers can communicate with expedition agents, family and friends - in the end, why not write to the blog or social media page network, do not upload photos of unprecedented beauty, forcing others to envy themselves a little? <br><br>  A computer for a traveler is also the broadest cartographic base, without which there is much more chance to endanger oneself.  Previously, climbers had to carry around a pile of paper cards that got dirty, torn and fell into disrepair.  In addition, using a laptop is easy to keep track of costs, because even everyday little things - for example, a dry ration - ultimately translate into significant spending.  Melissa is involved in calculations and planning, usually during long flights. <br><br>  Of course, a computer for extreme travel must be reliable and secure.  Looking at the photos on Melissa‚Äôs Instagram, you can roughly imagine how cold it is on the mountain tops, what narrow paths sometimes have to be torn, and how strong the climbing equipment should be in order not to become unusable in such conditions.  But there is still rain and snow - something that any technology certainly does not like. <br><br>  Melissa takes a Dell Rugged XFR laptop with Everest.  She admits that this device has long been her reliable assistant and travel companion.  It is durable, not sensitive to low and high tempera, not afraid of water, dirt and dust.  Melissa admits that she doesn‚Äôt take care of him too much, because you‚Äôre the last thing to think about accuracy when climbing the mountain peaks.  But in the worst situations, the laptop can only get dirty, but it is not difficult to fight dirt - just wipe it with a damp cloth or napkin. <br><br>  Dell Rugged XFR is not glamorous.  Its body is made of special material PR-72 and has a thickness of 57 mm, and the computer weighs at least 4 kilograms in the basic configuration.  But under extreme operating conditions, this is not a disadvantage: the main thing is that the device withstand temperatures atypical for computer equipment and be protected from shaking, water and dust.  All the details of the Dell Rugged XFR body fit perfectly, so as not to miss a single grain of sand inside. <br><br>  The laptop is tested for compliance with industry standards and has a degree of protection against water and dust IP65.  The device can withstand a fall from a height of about two meters, and the QuadCool thermoregulation system copes with cooling at high temperatures overboard (and the device will not be too noisy). <br><br>  Characteristics of the laptop is fully consistent with modern requirements.  14-inch anti-glare display, dual-core Intel¬Æ Core ‚Ñ¢ i7 processor (in the top version), up to 16 GB of RAM, integrated Intel¬Æ HD Graphics or a discrete graphics card NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 720M with two GB of video memory, and SSD drive up to 512 GB.  And, of course, the device supports work in mobile networks, has a connection with GPS satellites and is equipped with a 9-cell high-capacity battery (97 Wh). <br><br>  A mountaineer admits that she sometimes uses her laptop for other than its intended purpose: before going to bed, she dumps some things on him and uses them as a pillow.  Why not?  And in moments of fatigue and despair, when something goes wrong, she draws strength from this strong device: if she withstands cold, mud and bad weather, then she has to stand too.  But already later, on the ‚Äúbig earth‚Äù, planning the next trip, Melissa gladly reviews the photos uploaded to the laptop immediately after the shooting.  They inspire new exploits, make you move forward and do more. <br><br>  For travel Melissa can be monitored in her <a href="http://www.melissaarnot.com/bio/">personal blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361833/</a></p>
