Fame brought him a line of network splitters PowerCube, but to date, the company's range includes audio gadgets, leather goods, and lamps.  The latest project was a fun pen, the fundraising of which is currently continuing on Kickstarter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/9z/vs/rt9zvsrfademqbhybdstzwpztog.jpeg"><br><br>  We decided to tell more about these guys. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company was founded in 2011 by two Dutch engineers who suddenly decided that we were illogical to use the space around us.  By the time the first ‚Äúcube‚Äù was drawn, people already had several gadgets in use: a laptop, a tablet, a smartphone, a smart watch, etc., and the layout of apartments and offices did not assume the required number of outlets.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i-/o0/zf/i-o0zf7drctqnd8aiph5qntm7dq.jpeg"><br><br>  Thank God that humanity has turned out to be ready for this, and we have already begun to master network filters for a long time! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/yl/u7/ygylu7eb43pdk4obqbrevsiizb0.jpeg"><br><br>  But it turned out that this is at least not very beautiful.  And it certainly does not draw on RedDot, which is why the first sketches of the famous cubes appeared, which laid the foundation for the Allocacoc brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/sa/tp/sysatpoqm9kgsmb7v-erde_4uly.png"><br><br>  To date, network accessories have grown in a whole direction: charging cables, car adapters, PowerBank and some others: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/n1/u1/etn1u17-mmevuftnt9ivdwpgud8.png"><br><br>  However, cubes (and parallelepipeds) still quantitatively dominate within this ruler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/qg/q8/smqgq8fqenzi3tch2wyfuc3fnzu.jpeg"><br><br>  The main advantages of this method of connecting something in that the sockets are located on the sides, which allows bulky adapters not to overlap adjacent connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/bp/ya/pobpyavyixg0fe5kiwiebusnt_u.gif"><br><br>  It is also in some cases the absence of cables or convenient management of them without complicated add-ons, a well thought-out system for fixing cubes, the ability to choose a splitter only with sockets or + USB sockets, etc., if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5d/qy/s2/5dqys2nmf6sxmcqymtmeortbsdm.jpeg"><br><br>  All sockets are ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù.  As specified on the official website, currently the geography of Allocacoc is 83 countries, so all products are multiplying with different connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/j3/-z/vbj3-zg_w_p_03-mk8n2hxm6p7s.png"><br><br>  In Russia, part of the range has also long been represented: <br><br>  <b>1. PowerCube Original</b> <br><br>  The most demanded <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/trojnik-powercube-original-s-2xusb-portami.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dorig">dice with two USB</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/uy/ws/rbuywskyf1_n6z-vafeh-kchpc4.jpeg"><br><br>  Acts as a normal splitter.  Both ports provide 2.1A, which allows you to charge gadgets a little faster.  It looks quite aesthetic in the wall. <br><br>  <b>2. Powercube Extended</b> <br><br>  A similar network adapter, <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/allocacoc-powercube-extended-1402gy.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dextended">but with a 1.5 m extension</a> .  The extender makes it a bit more versatile.  One of the parties is also given under 2 USB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/6c/qb/8p6cqbujoeoctalwbwnorcljo44.jpeg"><br><br>  A similar device is also sold <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/allocacoc-powercube-extended-1407.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dextended3m">with a 3-meter cable</a> . <br><br>  <b>3. Powercube Remote</b> <br><br>  Cube <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/allocacoc-powercube-remote.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Ddu">with a remote control button</a> within the apartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/co/ln/dscoln9a1mmgufvg1ga8v3tcsmy.png"><br><br>  One of the sides of this model is also equipped with a fixed switch, so now, in order to de-energize the cube, there is no need to pull it out of the socket.  By the way, the Wi-fi cube is now announced in the company's assortment! <br><br>  <b>4. Powercube ReWirable</b> <br><br>  Travel option splitter, which <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/allocacoc-powercube-rewirable.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Drewirable">comes complete with local adapters</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/pm/sa/wmpmsacozww-z7wlfknfh3hb7m4.jpeg"><br><br>  There is a "format" with USB <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/1801-derw3p.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Drewirable5">and without</a> . <br><br>  <b>5. Powercube Extended with sockets</b> <br><br>  And, perhaps, the simplest cube is a <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/1307-deexpc.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dextended">model with sockets only</a> .  There are 5 of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/k-/au/prk-aux87icyqmm0ppflbuawxrs.jpeg"><br><br>  The form turned out to be so recognizable that the company tried to replicate it on other gadgets, some of which we already introduced to the readers of our blog: one of them is a <a href="https://habr.com/company/medgadgets/blog/402611/">USB PowerBank splitter</a> , the other is a <a href="https://habr.com/company/medgadgets/blog/402905/">Bluetooth speaker</a> , however of such popularity and recognition , Dont Have. <br><br>  <b>Bulb lamp</b> <br><br>  Surprisingly, the company decided not to dwell on the form or the content.  And the range began to expand prohibitively, but the main idea - saving space around - somehow remained the leading. <br><br>  A rather <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/heng-balance-lamp-allocacoc-white.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dlamp">unusual lamp</a> fits into this concept: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/fm/rn/sefmrnotvw2qpnmkfvmjrhaafma.gif"><br><br>  The chip of this designer gadget is in the way of switching on and off.  The lamp is equipped with two magnetic balls that act as a switch: in order for the lamp to catch fire, it is necessary to connect the balls and vice versa. <br><br>  There are currently several lighting fixtures in the company's assortment: a flashlight and several fixtures, one of which, by the way, is made in the classic form for Allocacoc.  It is called LightCube and comes with both an extension cord and a base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/s5/yb/oes5yb4rwx85plzfj8_jaobiboy.gif"><br><br>  The device is something like a portable lamp and supports gesture control. <br><br>  A separate direction of the company's work in recent years is <a href="http://www.allocacoc.com/Home/Home/Product/category/category_id/25/">LifeStyle</a> , and here dozens of gadgets and accessories from hygiene to urban transport are collected.  Functional design, which is developed for each device, is designed to make life easier and more convenient. <br><br>  For example, the ‚Äúseasonal toothbrush‚Äù is designed in such a way as to remind parents that it is necessary to change the bristles at least once a season. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/dt/hp/qddthpczfbye-oca-wnerewojfy.jpeg"><br><br>  This should remind pens, stylized under the theme of the seasons. <br><br>  The company also offers a range of accessories for storage, folders for papers, supports for laptops and office peripherals.  From urban accessories can be distinguished compact bags and wallets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jn/1l/hk/jn1lhki5fcn_eaiexrgrky3yrzi.gif"><br><br>  For example, a transforming bag for a city, which, depending on the requirements at a particular moment, may be a small backpack, a folder for papers, etc. Plus, this model is positioned as a ‚Äúanti-theft model‚Äù: there is a function to hide the zipper .  Also, this bag can simply be turned upside down to make it difficult for pickpockets to access zippers. <br><br>  The ‚Äúcascading‚Äù wallet DAX will provide quick and clear access to credit cards: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/4e/6t/sy4e6tzyr45ptg7uhpbjwoobrpy.gif"><br><br>  Expandable wallet model allows you to store multiple cards simultaneously and provides convenient access to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/hp/7i/pihp7iladw6x6sk-qoc8vvmo20u.jpeg"><br><br>  Plus, as noted on the site, the card compartment is equipped with special protection so that attackers cannot access the data over the wireless network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4b/mb/cj/4bmbcjkdqr43ebyt0kpmx6k7opo.jpeg"><br><br>  Of the projects on urban transport, the company has now introduced two models of bicycles and a compact folding eScooter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nh/gp/ak/nhgpaklzlckqtwojkle8_z-zt58.gif"><br><br>  Given that the design looks impressive and reliable, the model weighs only about 11 kg.  At the same time, it is convenient in a couple of movements that develops without complicated mechanisms.  An additional convenience is the saddle. <br><br>  Most projects are ‚Äútested‚Äù before running on crowdfunding.  This is one of the latest developments of the company - FidgetPen, the collection of funds for which <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2134640516/fidgetpen-magnet-the-playful-pen-for-stress-relief">continues on Kickstarter</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/hn/ni/wvhnnikx5k-mrikovabkw3atgeo.gif"><br><br>  The fidget handle, like the cube and spiner in its time, is designed to improve concentration and focus.  For this cap funny magnets to the body.  The idea is that many of us, when they are trying to solve some problem, twist the handle, gnaw a tip, etc. <br><br>  Here it is proposed to throw out energy in a more amusing way: to catch a magnetic cap. <br><br>  The fijet handle is quite functional.  For example, there is a version for those who like to flip a writing subject.  It is also based on the ‚Äúmagnetic principle.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m2/h1/55/m2h155whvy3tckyaiv5n-hzxijo.gif"><br><br>  Also, such a ring can simply twist to focus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l3/dz/s0/l3dzs0khmlyb2itlc2y-kynibjq.gif"><br><br>  And finally, you can twist the cap from the handle around the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7x/0m/vl/7x0mvliqdvwz8h9t6amlfp1xces.gif"><br><br>  The magnetic case is also explained from the point of view of functionality, for example, it is convenient to mount such a handle on metal objects, and it will not be lost, and one of the ways to always have an accessory on hand is to attach it to a laptop! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/w_/63/hzw_63ilo4strgnza1c870nzfy8.gif"><br><br>  From additional bonuses: the pen writes in erased ink, and the eraser for this is integrated into the body of the device. <br><br>  <b>And what is the result</b> <br><br>  I must admit that Allocacoc makes pretty funny and very useful gadgets that look beautiful, but do not lose their functionality. <br><br>  For seven years, the brand has tried itself in electrical and electronics, and now it begins to seem that this is the future Xiaomi, which will have a hand in everything that is possible, and there are still very, very many unused niches among the developers of cubes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCubic gadgets‚Äù are still the most popular, but recent projects more likely indicate that Allocacoc is gradually ceasing to exploit this form.  The brand is represented in Russia, and if you are interested in dice, then we can offer a 20% discount <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/allocacoc.html%3Fstock%3D1%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dallocacoc%26utm_campaign%3Dallocacoc">on any</a> of the models: <b>HBRCUBE</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420007/</a></p>
