  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows implementation in Mac OS X. Choice of the inhabitant.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been using Mac OS X for two years now as the main system.  It so happened that there was no unique program for the Windows program in the Mac software legion.  Having tried various solutions for launching Windows XP in Mac OS X, I would like to share my experience with the public. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The following emulators / virtual machines will be discussed:</b> <b><br></b> <ul><li>  Apple BootCamp; </li><li>  CodeWeavers Crossover; </li><li>  Sun VirtualBox; </li><li>  VMWare Fusion; </li><li>  Parallels Desktop. </li></ul><br>  Everywhere one version of Windows XP was tested (for speed castrated by kind people). <br><br>  In my daily work, I use <a href="http://xara.com/">Xara Xtreme Pro</a> (graphic vector editor).  To expand the functionality of this program, I have to keep <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> (automatic pushing of buttons, clicking on a mouse, etc.).  In this bundle has its own nuances (you need the ability to reassign any keyboard shortcuts, both Windows and Makovsky). <br><br>  <b>Requirements for the virtualizer (solutions will be evaluated by these criteria):</b> <b><br></b> <ol><li>  Startup and operation speed; </li><li>  Bumplessness; </li><li>  Comfortable work immediately in Windows and Macosi (cooperation); </li><li>  The ability to reassign any hotkeys. </li></ol>

Therefore, the solution is suitable only for games or special software, which requires a lot of resources and is not suitable for running under virtual machines (for example, 1C or SolidWorks). <br>  <b>Hotkeys</b> : no problem, because Windows is working in exclusive mode. <br><br><h4><img src="http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/1529/crossoverhl1.png"><br>  CodeWeavers Crossover </h4><br>  <b>Speed</b> : good speed and run. <br>  <b>Bezglyuchnost</b> : a very buggy program, even though my editor starts up in it, but it crashes and bugs all the time (with many other programs, something like this was observed, either they are buggy, or they are not started at all).  The only thing for which the crossover is very useful is to play Half-Life and its incarnations (OrangeBox).  When playing Half no failures were not.  The version used is Crossover Games.  It is possible that besides Halfa will fit for other games. <br>  <b>Cooperation</b> : no problem.  Progs work in windowed mode, along with poppy software. <br>  <b>Hotkeys</b> : it wasn‚Äôt even checked due to the impossibility of normal daily work. <br><br><h4><img src="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/5389/virtualboxfg4.png"><br>  Sun VirtualBox </h4><br>  <b>Speed</b> : Windows under virtual box loads surprisingly fast (about five seconds).  Applications work smartly.  By processor load, the system is comparable to VMWare. <br>  <b>Bezglyuchnost</b> : in the latest version there was stability when working with software, the old glitches went somewhere :) <br>  <b>Cooperation</b> : there is a mode and a separate sandbox and display integration (Windows windows mixed with Macs). <br>  <b>Hotkeys</b> : AutoHotkey gave a few errors to those buttons that worked in other virtual machines without problems, and refused to be bumped.  Also, it was not possible to reassign the standard virtual box buttons through the system settings (with any other mac program, this is done once or twice). <br><br>  After buying Innotek'a SUN'om, virtual box business went uphill.  In the future, this is a good program. <br><br><h4><img src="http://img76.imageshack.us/img76/5302/fusionha8.png"><br>  VMWare Fusion </h4><br>  <b>Speed</b> : loaded comparable to native mode.  It works fast. <br>  <b>Bezglyuchnost</b> : In childhood, the fusion had glitches with the network, but they were cured long ago.  Vmvar works extremely stably, like a Swiss army hammer :) <br>  <b>Cooperation</b> : there is a mode and a separate sandbox and cooperation with the Mac interface (Unity). <br>  <b>Hotkeys</b> : there is an annoying glitch.  In Unity mode, the AutoHotkey program I need does not work.  That is, I can only work in one common window.  Who does not need AutoHotkey, this is not a hindrance, you can use Unity. <br><br>  VMWare is our hope and support.  The program, besides my Macbook Pro, is also successfully used on Macbook and Macbook Air (the licensed Consultant + lives on the air below it without any problems).  I recommend to use. <br><br><h4><img src="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/9022/paralleljj5.png"><br>  Parallels Desktop </h4><br>  <b>Speed</b> : loads and works very quickly. <br>  <b>Bezglyuchnost</b> : it was found that Parallels Desktop slows down on the MacBook Air, but I think this is a temporary matter and will soon be demolished (and maybe already treated). <br>  <b>Cooperation</b> : oh, it's a song.  The system works both in its own window and in cooperation with Machew (Coherence).  And it does it well.  By the way, there is an option - to place the Windows tray in the Makovsky menu bar (in Coherence mode).  This is important because AutuHotkey is sitting in the tray. <br>  <b>Hot Keys</b> : This is another song.  AutoHotkey work!  Straight against the backdrop of Makovsky prog work any shortcut keys avtohotok.  True, the Makov hot keys block them, but this is treated by reassigning the standard keys for parallel in the system settings of the macos.  For example, I use Command-Q and Command-W in Windows. <br><br><h4>  Two competitors </h4><br>  When I first moved to Makos, the parallel was the third version.  It was a brake bug, which could slow down all two cores and hang the system into the crust.  I scolded the parallel and did not advise anyone to contact her.  However, Parallels Desktop v.4 was released in the fall and this is a completely different product.  All my Wishlist were implemented.  I didn‚Äôt even have to install the system from scratch, I imported a container from VMWare.  So the competition between VMWare and Parallels is only on the hands of users. <br><br>  Parallels makes VMWare several times.  If VMWare eats 15-25% of the processor in idle, then Parallels eats 2-3%.  This allows, in addition to Windows, to simultaneously run Ubuntu Server and FreeBSD for experiments. <br><br><h4>  Organization of software and work files </h4><br>  All the software I need is assembled (mostly in the portable version) and stored in a makosi in a specific directory, and is connected to the virtual network via an internal network ball, as a separate volume.  This solution makes it easy to change virtual containers and use one set of software on different virtual machines and emulators.  A zipped container with installed Windows weighs only 190 megabytes (thanks to a castrated distribution of Windows XP). <br><br>  All working documents are also stored on the network ball in MacOS, and in recent versions of VMWare and Parallels, the Desktop and Documents directories can be made transparent to the virtual machine.  That is, we have a single desktop and documents in MacOS and Windows. <br><br><h4>  List of tested win32 software </h4><br>  Far; <br>  Portable 3ds Max 2008; <br>  Portable Corel Draw X4; <br>  Portable IE7; <br>  Portable MS Office 2003; <br>  Portable Photoshop CS3; <br>  Portable SketchUp 6; <br>  Total Commander; <br>  Xara Xtreme Pro. <br><br>  Virtual machines (VirtualBox, Parallels, VMWare) coped with it with a bang. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  <b>For games</b> : Apple BootCamp or Crossover Games (selectively). <br>  <b>For heavy screw software</b> : Apple BootCamp. <br>  <b>For everyday stable operation</b> : VMWare Fusion. <br>  <b>For comfortable and fast work with the most advanced features</b> : Parallels Desktop (today is my choice). <br><br>  The latest version of VirtualBox, straightforwardly pleased.  This system has every chance of becoming a leader, because it is free.  I recommend to try. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Please do not consider this article as an advertisement for a product.  I am a simple user and I am interested only in fast, reliable software, I am not going to advertise trash.  Good software always praises itself. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : VirtualBox rehabilitated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48990/</a></p>
