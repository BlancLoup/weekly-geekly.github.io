Some of them were published this year, but most saw the light earlier.  We would like to express our gratitude to Bill Gates, whose legendary reading list inspired us to create our own list of recommended books. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  ‚ÄúPower Plant: Inventing a Battery to Save the World - An Inside Look‚Äù <br>  (The Powerhouse: Save the World) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThis book will introduce you to cutting-edge battery research.  The dramatic improvements that we have seen in this area over the past decade have led to the emergence of new markets: from electric vehicles to the Internet of things.  Constant development of batteries is one of the most important forces in the world of technology. ‚Äù  - Jared Friedman

    <h4>  ‚ÄúSuperprediction: The Art and Science of Foresight‚Äù <br>  (Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúWhether you like it or not, the prediction of the future is partly our job.  Philip Tetlock (Philip Tetlock) was engaged in the analysis of the accuracy of predictions for two decades.  From his research, which studies what exactly helps people make accurate predictions of the future, one can learn practical lessons that can be useful to us. ‚Äù  - Jared Friedman. <br><br><h4>  "The Road to Character" (The Road to Character) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúI purchased this book after reading David Brooke‚Äôs other work called The Moral Bucket List (which could be translated as‚Äú List of those moral qualities that you should get before you play box ‚Äù- comment. Translator) in the New York Times .  In order for life to be filled with meaning, you need to make an effort.  And I would like to live such a life - to be selfless, honest and modest.  I noticed that the founders of the companies, which are an example for me, possess these qualities, and I optimized my search in order to add these features to our community. ‚Äù  - Kevin Hale <br><br><h4>  "The Lost Art of Finding the Way" (The Lost Art of Finding Our Way) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThanks to GPS, the part of my brain that is responsible for spatial awareness is completely atrophied.  I read this book in order to develop it again, and it ended with the fact that I did not tire of being amazed at the amazing ingenuity of humanity.  Now I am much better prepared for the zombie apocalypse. ‚Äù  - Kevin Hale. <br><br><h4>  "Extraction: The World History of the Struggle for Oil, Money, and Power" (The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power) </h4><br><h4>  Quest: Energy, Security, and the Changing Modern World (The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World) </h4><br>  "These two books will introduce you to the entire history of the oil industry - from the first minute to today."  - Michael Seibel. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúIlon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the search for a fantastic future‚Äù (Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúIt will inspire you to think about solving global problems to change the world for the better.‚Äù  - Michael Seibel. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúNonviolent Communication: The Language of Life (third edition): Fateful Tools for Healthy Relationships‚Äù <br>  (Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life, 3rd Edition: Life-Changing Tools for Healthy Relationships) </h4><br>  "The ability to effectively interact with each other is critical for successful relationships with co-founders, customers, employees, and other people."  - Paul Buchheit <br><br><h4>  Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThis free e-book, which can be read online, can be a great starting point for understanding depth learning.  Initially, I was recommended by OpenAI Technical Director Greg Brockman. ‚Äù  - Matt Krisiloff <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúSong Production: Inside the Hit Factory‚Äù (The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe book gives you the opportunity to look into the world of the music industry and how hits are created.  From it you will learn a lot of interesting things about how the level of professionalism in the world of music has increased over the past 30 years.  Smart and enterprising readers will be able to apply these lessons in other industries. ‚Äù  - Justin Kan <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúCome on, Jeeves!‚Äù (Carry On, Jeeves) </h4><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThank you, Jeeves!‚Äù (Thank You, Jeeves) </h4><br><h4>  "Pranks of the aristocrats" (The Inimitable Jeeves) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth starting these acquaintances with the works of Pelam Grenville Woodhouse (PG Wodehouse).  Now I rarely read (especially business books!), But I can recommend these works as the best books for rest and relaxation.  It seems to me that for ‚Äústarters‚Äù it is important to be able to relax and not always think about work. ‚Äù  - Jessica Livingston (Jessica Livingston) <br><br><h4>  "Tiny beautiful things: advice about love and life" <br>  (Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúCheryl Strayed (Cheryl Strayed) led a column called Dear Sugar, and this collection of her essay became a reference for finding inner strength with the help of kindness.  She skillfully connects the problems of her readers with the painful events of her own life, and as a result the book will hook you to the human vulnerability, kindness and frankness described in it.  Last fall I was in love with this book. ‚Äù  - Amy Buchler (Amy Buechler) <br><br><h4>  The Martian (The Martian: A Novel) </h4><br><h4>  "Seven EVs" (Seveneves: A Novel) </h4><br>  "These two books, and precisely in this sequence ... I hope that humanity will be able, thanks to science, to find a way out of any situation and popularize the concept of cosmic cannibalism."  - Luke Iseman <br><br><h4>  "Supermen: the story of Seymour Cray and the technical wizards who created the supercomputer" </h4><h4>  (The Crayon and the Wizards Behind the Supercomputer </h4><br>  ‚ÄúHistory of Silicon Valley of the Midwest with the same types and exciting image of Kray.  However, there could be more technical details. ‚Äù  - Daniel Gackle <br><br><h4>  "Elements of computing systems: the architecture of a modern computer from the very beginning" </h4><h4>  (The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe book is also known by the much better title Nand to Tetris.  If you are a programmer who does not yet know the deep levels of computer hardware and software, but really wants to know more about them, then this book can change your life.  Videos from Coursera are good too. ‚Äù  - Daniel Gackle. <br><br><h4>  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humanity (Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThis book was one of several that changed my criteria for assessing humanity.  Like the book by Richard Dawkins entitled ‚ÄúThe Gene of Egoism‚Äù, this work made me overestimate the main features of human society, ethics and history. ‚Äù  - Jeff Ralston (Geoff Ralston) <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúToo big to fail: the story of how Wall Street and Washington fought to save the financial system and themselves‚Äù </h4><br><h4>  (Too Big to Fail to Save the Financial System - and Themselves) </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a great book.  A stunning illustration of how combined systems work, and how they can fail enormously, even when everyone thinks they are strong.  This is very important for risk analysis. ‚Äù  - Aaron Harris </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297588/</a></p>
