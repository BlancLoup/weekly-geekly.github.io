The fashionable word ‚Äúfintech‚Äù and the whole placer of altcoins appeared.  The next trend is smart contracts, servicing transactions with different types of property.  But in pursuit of money, we forgot about true values ‚Äã‚Äã- justice, law and order, security.  But the blockchain allows you to make a breakthrough in these areas!  Read under the cut how you can make the world a better place with the help of real <b>cryptopolicy</b> , and get acquainted with a new project in this area. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Four pillars of the rule of law </h4><br>  Any law enforcement system that ensures civil safety and compliance with laws, rests on: <br><br>  1) openness and transparency; <br>  2) interaction with society; <br>  3) competitive system in court; <br>  4) compliance with the rules of the participants of the system. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      Let's see how you can strengthen these pillars with the blockchain. <br><br><h4>  Openness and transparency </h4><br>  It was for this purpose that the technology was created - so that all information about the actions of users was kept by each participant.  The level of trust between the participants of the system does not matter in principle, because all the moves are recorded. <br><br>  Now imagine the police documenting every action ‚Äî a search, a detention, a piece of evidence.  And imagine that all these actions form blocks of the chain. <br><br><h4>  Interaction with society </h4><br>  The most important feature of law enforcement agencies is full and organic interaction with citizens.  Otherwise, the state becomes totalitarian, where law enforcement officers serve only the ruling elite.  If a person commits a minor offense (for example, goes drunk on the street, but does not touch others), you do not need to delay it.  And vice versa - citizens should themselves report about the offense.  Only in such a society can the law enforcement system be considered fair. <br><br>  In the case of blockchain technology, not only policemen, but also all members of society must form separate blocks.  The statement of the offense is a new record, the reaction of the police is another record.  The length of the chain is not limited by anything, there is room for work. <br><br><h4>  Competitive system in court </h4><br>  The defender and the accused must compete, each presenting evidence, testimony and other evidence from his side.  Only full equality of the parties in the process can guarantee a fair verdict. <br><br>  See how perfect the blockchain is for building an ideal equal judicial system: <br><br>  1. All blocks have the same status.  If added to the chain, it means that the block conforms to the internal rules of the system. <br><br>  2. Block cannot be changed.  No one can juggle the evidence. <br><br>  3. The block cannot be removed from the chain.  But it is through bribing witnesses, <br>  subsequently abandoning their testimony, organized crime has always been able to go dry out of the water. <br><br><h4>  Compliance with the rules of the participants of the system </h4><br>  Most members of society must abide by the laws.  A crime is going beyond, a failure, a rare event.  Even criminal communities have their own rules, and most members strictly follow them.  Otherwise, society needs to revise its laws or reorganize. <br><br>  Here not the blockchain technology itself will help us, but its derivative instrument - smart contracts.  Cold mathematical formula that starts those or other processes.  The complete victory of the objective over the subjective.  If the rights of one participant and the obligations of another are guaranteed by a smart contract, the system will work without failures. <br><br><h4>  The first project that managed to put into practice the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcryptopolicy </h4><br>  The principles outlined above have been implemented in <a href="https://stopthefakes.io/">StopTheFakes.io</a> .  True, they have not yet thought to create a virtual police force, but have taken up the fight against counterfeiting and piracy on the Internet.  But what they have already managed to create is amazing. <br><br><h4>  How it works </h4><br>  The project allows copyright holders to attract any number of consumers to search for counterfeit goods and stolen content.  With the help of internal cryptocurrency, STFcoins, applicants can pay for the services of performers working under conditions of complete anonymity. <br><br>  The right holder buys the required number of tokens and deposits them into his account in the system.  Then he forms an application, a detailed description of what needs to be sought and documented.  Applications are available to performers on certain parameters, for example, by geographic location or confirmed skill level.  Any Internet user who has the ability to search for sites with pirated content or outlets that offer counterfeit goods to customers can become an artist. <br><br>  The work of the artist is completely anonymous.  A person takes a convenient, for themselves, application and goes on a search.  The results he documents - shoots video or takes photos. <br>  The collected information enters the system and is recorded in the blockchain.  Remove or modify evidence of the offense is not possible. <br><br>  Executive remuneration is guaranteed by a smart contract.  As soon as the right holder has submitted an application, the tokens on his account are frozen.  If the required information arrives, these funds are immediately transferred to the contractor who provided it.  The system takes a part of this amount as a commission for services. <br><br>  The right holders were able to quickly and cheaply detect all the facts of the violation of their intellectual property rights.  Law-abiding consumers can now receive a reward in cryptocurrency for their honesty. <br><br><h4>  Elimination of offenses </h4><br>  In developed legal systems, the fight against piracy on the Internet is almost completely automated.  For example, the United States has the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  It allows copyright holders to send applications to search engines and providers, with the requirement to block the stolen content.  The biggest problem for copyright holders in the United States was precisely the search for facts of wrongdoing.  With the help of StopTheFakes, you can greatly facilitate this task.  Moreover, the service takes over the functions of automating the elimination of violations. <br><br>  The offending site will immediately receive a letter demanding the removal of content posted illegally.  If this does not work, blocking documents will be prepared, in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA.  Search engines, hosting providers, domain registrars, unlike pirates, operate in the legal zone and are governed by laws and their norms. <br><br>  Offline, traditionally, lags behind digital technology.  But the ground-based point of sale, unlike the website on the Internet, cannot change the address so simply and quickly.  Most offenders will go to the settlement agreement and refuse to sell counterfeit goods if the right holder turns to them with a motivated claim.  And the service will provide them not only with information, but also provide legal support. <br><br><h4>  Prototype of digital law enforcement </h4><br>  The existing functionality of the system does not interfere with the use of not only to combat counterfeiting, but also to confront other types of crimes.  For example, the police can form applications for the search for criminals.  Or use the system to report street crimes, from traffic offenses to petty theft and extortion. <br><br>  The system provides the main thing - reliable fixing and saving photos and videos.  It gives a good feedback channel in the form of payment of remuneration for the information provided.  If now state budgets allocate huge funds for the maintenance of a large staff of investigators and operatives, then why not work directly with the public in the near future? <br><br>  Now we can change the world with the help of high technology.  And we need to reform not only the financial system, but also other important public institutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341400/</a></p>
