  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vivaldi 1.8 - Immersion in history</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/e6e/6f7/af6e6e6f7b13b0e1f6acd81cb57a07fb.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Hello!  Spring is in the middle of the yard, and we are in the midst of work.  One does not interfere with the other, quite the contrary.  And as in the spring the first flowers begin to break through from under the snow, so a new stable version of the Vivaldi browser, now number 1.8, is born from the bowels of our friendly team.  Well, in the browser itself, new functions are sprouting abundantly.  In today's version of the browser added the following functions: <br><br><ul><li>  The new system works with the history of views </li><li>  Create notes by dragging the selected text </li><li>  Auto Update System Management (Windows) </li><li>  Search by image from the context menu </li></ul><br>  Here we will talk about these updates and many other improvements in detail with pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>This fascinating story</b> <br><br>  History is a very interesting subject.  She hides so many secrets and mysteries in the depths of centuries.  The browser history, or, more precisely, the history of web page views by the user, does not reach such a scale, but this does not make it any less interesting.  After all, each of us probably once wondered: but I wonder which site I go to most often?  What is my browsing activity by the hour?  What is going on in the history of my views and is it possible to erase from the history all the entrances to a particular site?  In general, there can be a lot of questions.  And we think that many of them will be answered by a new, improved system for viewing and managing the history of the Vivaldi browser: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/11e/12c/3f611e12cc3391f990c9800546d2d875.png" alt="image"></div><br>  In fact, it is no longer just viewing the history, but its preparation and in-depth analysis at the same time.  Browsing by day, week, month, by periods selected in the calendar, analyzing site entries and identifying the most popular ones - in general, the information here is enough for long hours of study.  Even when viewing history in just one day: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e5/eb1/4f7/6e5eb14f768909d0ff58a59c43839d1e.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Naturally, in addition to viewing the story, you can also edit it.  Try the right-click context menu on any link - there are a lot of interesting things.  For example, you can filter all entries only from this domain, and then, for example, remove them all in one fell swoop.  Pretty comfortable.  And in such a story you can quickly find a needle in a haystack.  In the video below - an example of such a search: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLrvoBMa8PM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In general, we hope that you will like this new tool and will help not only to better understand how you work online, but also to change the way you work with websites.  For example, I realized that I should rest more and sit less on the network.  However, I think this already guessed ... <br><br>  <b>Found - drag to yourself!</b> <br><br>  Moreover, in the literal sense.  This is now very easy to do: select any text on the page, and then simply drag the selection to the notes panel.  Now this information is stored in your browser: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b68/441/2ae/b684412aef1df5477960870339fc0c0b.png" alt="image"></div><br>  However, this function is still damp and does not always work as we would like, but with this we will cope with the next versions. <br><br>  <b>Managed AutoUpdate</b> <br><br>  We have always been and remain supporters of the fact that the user controls the browser, and not vice versa.  And here, as they say, there can be no exceptions.  Even for such a seemingly user-friendly function, like auto-updating the browser to a newer version.  As a result, this set of browser update management tools was obtained (only on the Windows version): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/5e1/f41/3705e1f41ea2f3a9f138bd0b8121812d.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Something like that...</b> <br><br>  Search for a picture today has become quite a popular feature.  So popular that we were repeatedly asked to add such an option to the context menu of the picture.  Well, here it turns out so far this function: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b3/278/aa8/7b3278aa8b882e15cd0101deb3bc7b70.png" alt="image"></div><br>  And on this screenshot, an experienced Vivaldi user should notice something unusual.  Check yourself - how well you know your browser.  Well, how?  Guess?  Yes, that's right: the context menu of the picture ‚Äústarted talking‚Äù on the great and powerful.  And after this menu mastered the Russian language and context menu links.  In general, we have done a great job together with our volunteer assistants from among testers and translators, and now many Chromium lines have been translated into other languages.  I will say right away - not everything, but the work continues.  And here is another screenshot, when looking at that many users in the shower should play a small orchestra with trumpets and drums, and a male tear (well, or female) tear down the cheek: wait!  HUGOCHYA ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbb/ce7/171/cbbce71710b365f20e73f04e4d4c3f78.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Visual amenities</b> <br><br>  A few more changes happened in the browser interface in the usability area.  So, for example, now when typing in the address bar it will be highlighted in bold in the tooltips: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8c/cc6/1b8/b8ccc61b849bca3cad21e27ae71900cf.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Digging in the settings</b> <br><br>  Here we have everything in its turn: new settings options are added, existing ones are expanded, and so on.  For example, in the previous version of the browser, we added the ability to turn off the sound on the tabs.  And in today's we offer even more options for working with sound: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00e/393/0d4/00e3930d463be484a0139cbe09d41094.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Even in the settings, it became possible to specify the Express panel as the home page.  This option was asked by users for a long time, and now it's time to add it: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ede/cd8/937/edecd89378bc9398ee62c115d71c102d.png" alt="image"></div><br>  And this set of settings appeared in response to the removal and management of plugins from the Chromium code.  We decided to add similar functionality directly to the browser settings - well, and expanded it a bit: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/702/5f4/874/7025f4874bae67f56727254055abee67.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Well, for now, for now.  In this review, of course, not all new items and changes are listed.  As always, a <a href="https://update.vivaldi.com/update/1.8/relnotes/1.8.770.50.html">list of all changes and corrections</a> will tell you more interesting details.  If you did not find the problem that was disturbing you in the list of corrected ones, do not hesitate to tell us about it through the appropriate <a href="https://vivaldi.com/bugreport/">form of sending error messages</a> . <br><br>  You can download the browser from the official site: <a href="https://vivaldi.com/download/%3Fpk_campaign%3Dru-blogpost-download-link">vivaldi.com</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And now you can select part of the link, as in the old Opera :) <br><br>  And this is not all improvement ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325106/</a></p>
