Typical problems and their solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It must be said that I, as an author, are primarily interested in practice (benefit in practical application).  Accordingly, I strive to describe only those things that I personally encounter.  Now I am engaged in the development of an online store of points, and decided to share my experience in product placement on Yandex.Market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/644/544/bea/644544beaae8a743f77ca47578067e40.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The article is intended for <b>managers</b> , <b>web developers</b> and <b>owners of online stores</b> planning to place products on Yandex.Market.  The material contains information about typical problems, the specifics of sorting products by Yandex.Market categories and the latest troubles.  It is curious that the availability and technical correctness of the Price List (in a special format YML) does not guarantee at all that the entire list of goods presented in it will be shown to users during the search.  <i>The owner of an online store may not realize for a long time that the nth part of its product offers is hidden from potential buyers</i> .  This material will help to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat pitfalls can be expected on the way of placing goods in Yandex.Market, and how to cope with it.  The article features some prices for the placement of goods in Yandex.Market and discusses options for cooperation (technical support services or a personal manager).  The article contains small code fragments for debugging a YML file. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Part 1. Register an online store, check the price list and eliminate errors </h4><br>  To be placed on the Yandex.Market system, you need to prepare in advance the Price List in YML format (vs XML), for broadcasting the goods presented in your online store.  The specification of such a YML file can be found on the Yandex pages, in the Market section.  If the online store is based on a CMS that is not adapted for the needs of product placement on Yandex.Market (as a rule, this is the case), you need to write the script for generating the YML file manually.  An example of practical and step-by-step development of such a file is an article from my blog, a <a href="http://codda.ru/blogs/2011/07/yml-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5/">YML file for broadcasting products on Yandex.Market (script for osCommerce 2.3)</a> .  In this article I will periodically refer to this script when writing code. <br><br>  After we have a ready-made YML file script on our site, we need to fill in a number of fields - the so-called.  "Placement options".  The link to register a new store is here: <a href="">partner.market.yandex.ru/pre/index.xml</a> (not to be confused with Yandex.Webmaster Products and prices).  The placement options include: price list (link to the YML file from your site; you can download the YML file from your computer, but you will need to update it every 15 days);  delivery information (regions, cost);  legal information (legal info should be placed on your website - you will have to specify the page address), a valid phone number for accepting orders (Yandex employees will call back to this number with an attempt to order some of your goods from you) and others. After that we send Price list to check. <br><br><h5>  Possible errors in the YML file </h5><br>  Even if the script itself is written correctly, there may be a number of errors associated, for example, with the address of the product image, or with product duplicates.  There was a case when they called me (apparently, guided by the materials of my blog and using the contact phone number presented) with a request to suggest what might be wrong with the images, since  This error was indicated in Yandex.Market technical support. <br><br>  The error with displaying images is most often due to the fact that invalid characters (for example, a space) can be used in the names of images uploaded to the site.  In order to convert such names to URLs that are digestible for Yandex, it is sufficient to use the corresponding php-function rawurlencode.  We are looking for a code snippet in which the URL of the directory image is displayed.  In my script for OsCommerce 2.3, this is the next segment: <br><br> <code>$src_file = $csite."catalog/images/".$tovar['picture']; <br> $ppy = "".$src_file."";</code> <br> <br>  We add the function url-coding rawurlencode.  Thus, the code for displaying images from the directory will look something like this: <br><br> <code>$src_file = $csite."catalog/images/".rawurlencode(($tovar['picture']); <br> $ppy = "".$src_file."";</code> <br> <br>  What to do with doubles?  Errors with duplicate products are much less critical.  They appear due to the fact that you use the same name / same main picture in the representation of 2 (or more) products.  So, if you have the same model, but different colors, it is enough to assign a color (blue, black) and so on to its name, and also replace the main image of such a product with the corresponding photo. <br><br><h4>  Part 2. Yandex.Market prices and options for cooperation.  What does a personal manager </h4><br>  Payments on Yandex.Market are made by clicks.  Prices per click - 1.5 rubles ($ 0.05) for books and 3 rubles.  (0.1 cu) for all other goods.  However, to work with Yandex.Market you need to make a preliminary payment.  Here Yandex.Market offers 2 options for cooperation: <br><br><ul><li>  Option 1. Standard.  Contribution 300 rub.  Contributed funds remain in your account and go exclusively to pay for clicks.  Service - those.  support (answers questions for a few days). </li><li>  Option 2. With the "attachment" of a personal manager.  Contribution 9000 rub.  Contributed funds, as well as in the 1st version, remain in your account and go exclusively to pay for clicks.  Service - personal manager (answers questions within a few hours by mail, or, as necessary, by phone in real time, which is very convenient).  All problems are detected and solved quickly enough. </li></ul><br>  Thus, we can say that when servicing a personal manager, you do not lose anything (the entire amount of the contribution goes only to clicks), but you get good advantages for starting, and it is at this stage that the main issues and troubles arise.  It should be noted that working with a personal manager is possible for a longer period than the first month, however, at the same time, your monthly consumption should exceed 21 thousand rubles, which is specifically "catching up" (eg, overstated rates for clicks) on my mind does not make sense. <br><br>  Being people rather scrupulous (if not to say meticulous), - both I and the site owner (Customer), - we long and thoroughly asked about where those 9 thousand would go, and, finally, were convinced of the rationality of working with a personal manager. , having calculated that this amount is quite justified, even if you just take offhand spending 100 clicks per day (300 rubles per day = 9000 per month).  Taking this opportunity, I would like to share in advance the general impression of the Yandex.Market team (which remained very positive), and to praise our personal manager, Natalia Malakhov, for professionalism and attention. <br><br><h4>  Part 3. I meant hedgehog, not an elephant.  What threatens the wrong category definition on Yandex.Market, and how to get to the right </h4><br>  So, you have passed the Price List check, you have everything in order with photos of the goods, paid a fee, and your online store turned out to be in the ‚Äúon‚Äù status.  You even have a review of ‚ÄúPublished offers‚Äù.  You would be ready to relax, if you had not managed to make a couple of key requests on Yandex.Market in the hope of seeing your products.  However, for most requests they are completely absent, while for others they are presented in scanty amounts.  In addition, for some reason, all your eye glasses, which gives the search, are in sunglasses (which in itself is wrong).  Further - more surprising.  When communicating with the manager, it turns out that most of your products fell into categories such as "Sandals", "Men's Shoes", "Panties" and others. According to a reasonable assumption of the manager, these particular products are <u>not available</u> in the search for key queries.  Such inconsistencies are quite typical.  For example, Natalya told the story of how baskets fell into the ‚ÄúPools‚Äù category, on the grounds that they are round. <br><br>  Let's figure out what's going on. <br><br>  As our personal manager told, Yandex.Market automatically sorts products by categories according to a number of signs.  Moreover, the search in Yandex.Market is carried out on the same grounds, and not solely by the name of the product.  The names of our products had something like the following: ‚ÄúBuy Emporio Armani 9730 ATG men's glasses.‚Äù  The use of the word ‚Äúbuy‚Äù in the title is unacceptable for Market, and Natalya was surprised at how we underwent quality control in general (SCC).  The bottom line is that the name should be urgently shipped.  Rewriting them on the site manually would be an epic task (talking about hundreds of positions).  It is much easier to fix them in the YML file itself by replacing stable combinations (here we have it - ‚ÄúBuy men's glasses ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuy women's glasses ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuy children's glasses ...‚Äù, etc.) .  In addition, we must appear when searching for frames, so we will need to add the word "frames".  We are looking for a piece of code responsible for displaying the name of the product.  In my script these are the following lines: <br><br> <code>$tovar['name'] = htmlspecialchars($tovar['name']); <br> <br> ... <br> $tovar[name]</code> <br> <br>  Replace stable combinations using the phr-function str_replace: <br><br> <code>$tovar['name'] = htmlspecialchars($tovar['name']); <br> $tovar['name'] = str_replace('  ', '  ()'), $tovar['name']); <br> $tovar['name'] = str_replace('  ', '  ()', $tovar['name']); <br> $tovar['name'] = str_replace('  ', '  ()', $tovar['name']); <br> $tovar['name'] = str_replace(' ', '', $tovar['name']); <br> $tovar['name'] = str_replace('  ', ' ', $tovar['name']); <br> ... <br> $tovar[name]</code> <br> <br>  As a result, all the names of the type ‚ÄúBuy Emporio Armani 9730 ATG men's glasses‚Äù are replaced with the view: ‚ÄúMen's glasses (rim) Emporio Armai 9730 ATG‚Äù.  Subsequently, our products were successfully categorized by Yandex.Market into the necessary categories: Optics - Glasses - Frames.  When searching for key queries, everything is fine too. <br><br>  Recommendations at last.  In order to get into the right category on Yandex.Market, as well as successfully appear in the Yandex.Market search results for key queries, check the names of your products in advance with the already published proposals of competitors participating in the issue for the necessary queries.  In our case, these were suggestions of the type ‚ÄúEyeglass [brand] [model] ...‚Äù.  It is not necessary to completely copy such names, it is enough to observe the typicality of combinations. <br><br><blockquote>  From the author.  All commenters thank you in advance for their feedback.  To all silent minuschimus: verbal criticism is much more useful and constructive than mute understatement of the post.  Please leave your corrections so that you can work on the topic more thoroughly. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159937/</a></p>
