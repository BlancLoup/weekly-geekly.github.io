  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thank you, Employee!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once again I want to talk about simple and seemingly annoying things: about employees, quality of work, about recruiting. <br><br>  <b>All decide frames.</b>  I did not invent it, but I completely agree with it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I will say right away that I am not a management guru or a great HR.  Behind shoulders, experience in creating a startup (from an idea to attracting an investor and creating a full-fledged company).  In the structure of the company I directly lead the development (production) of projects (currently 3 units).  The number of people in the backbone is not a lot and each performs several, sometimes completely different tasks.  I am both a producer, and hr, and an art director.  :)) It sounds funny, but it happened.  Almost all employees at the remote site (programmers), works on art creation (graphics, design, layout, etc.) are outsourced.  There are only a few key employees in the office (although one of the key people still works at the remote location) ... And most importantly, this mechanism works.  Every day more and more confident and confident.

      I thought a lot and puzzled over how to look for suitable people.  They worked differently: on pure enthusiasm at the beginning (shares), and working with small monthly payments with the condition of full settlement at the end, and hourly wages as written a few days earlier here on Habr√©, and the usual rate with bonuses.  Regardless of the conditions, someone worked well, someone just as, and someone eventually went into the backbone.  And I felt (precisely because I knew about it) one single simple thing - there are people who want to accomplish the task in the best way, and there are those who are always looking for reasons.  For the former, of course, the motivation of their work is very important - salary, team, task to be performed, working conditions, and so on.  For the second ... for them nothing is important - it is impossible to stimulate them.  They still keep looking for reasons.  Only kicks can be customized, but only if such a worker? <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúThere are no irreplaceable people</b> ,‚Äù says the saying.  Only it is very difficult to part with good workers.  Although, of course, I understand that everyone needs and everyone wants to grow. <br><br>  And sometimes it seems to me that the most difficult task in any project, in any company is the search for the right employees. <br><br>  The topic is rhetorical and you can think of nothing here or advise.  But ... <b>I just want to say a huge thank you to those people who are primarily worried about the result and work well!</b>  <b>Bow.</b> <br><br>  And in the end I want to quote a single ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù person to me.  Ramacharaka: <br>  ‚ÄúKarma is a Sanskrit word and means‚Äú action. ‚Äù  It applies to the law of spiritual causes and effects of which we have already spoken.  For this you need to stop acting selfishly.  Karma yoga teaches that a person must work for the sake of labor in the first place, and not for the sake of material reward.
