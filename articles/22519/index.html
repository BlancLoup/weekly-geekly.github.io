  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will the business model Y Combinator work in Russia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of this week, I met with the founder of <a href="http://www.buka.ru/">Buka Entertainment,</a> Igor Ustinov, who is now ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù of ‚ÄúBuka‚Äù, which is being sold to a strategic investor, and together with his partners in ‚ÄúBuke‚Äù, forms the business-angel fund ‚ÄúAzium‚Äù, which will specialize in seed- and pre-seed-financing of Internet projects (as a result of our communication, I wrote this <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/articles/2008/03/6/1077">article</a> on my IdeaBlog.ru). <br>  Everyone probably knows the business model of the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> incubator - it finances promising teams with good ideas from Internet startups, while allocating $ 5 thousand for the project plus $ 5 thousand for each of the team members (the average number of founders is 3, i.e. on average, $ 20,000 is allocated to one project), receiving up to 10% of startup shares for this.  At the same time, the funded teams are invited to work on their project in the Y Combinator office, and the allocated money should provide the ‚Äúdaily bread‚Äù to the founders of the startup for the few months they spend on developing and launching their project.  So - Igor Ustinov plans to work almost the same as Y Combinator. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, Ustinov plans to select formed teams with promising ideas and, as the first stage of financing, allocate them up to $ 20 thousand to develop a project prototype, business plan and detailed financial model of a startup, getting for it, like Y Combinator, 10% of its shares.  Some projects will receive further funding from Ustinov (an average of $ 200 thousand per project) - already for an additional share of the shares, but this is not about that (those who are interested in the details can refer to the <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/articles/2008/03/6/1077">article</a> already mentioned on IdeaBlog.ru). <br>  <strong>In this regard, I have a question for the esteemed Habrasoobshchestvo: what do you think, will the Y Combinator business model, taken with minor changes to be armed with Ustinov, work in our conditions?</strong>  <strong>I have the following considerations on this:</strong> <br><ol><li>  As for the Moscow development teams, as a result of communication with many of them, I had a persistent feeling that for them $ 20,000 was "not money."  True, Ustinov wants to be sent projects to him and start-ups from the regions, but this problem, in my opinion, still exists. </li><li>  BY Combinator start-ups work on the project in the incubator office, ‚Äúunder the supervision of‚Äù the incubator's employees, and with their help <strong>they themselves</strong> work on the business plan and marketing of their startup.  In addition, Americans traditionally have people interested in business methods from school and, even if they receive a programmer‚Äôs specialty, they still have much more developed business skills than our programmers ‚Äî this is also facilitated by the environment and the old ones traditions.  It seems to me that when working remotely, the team - apart from the Azium employees - our startups will rather concentrate on software development, rather than thinking through business processes, and will prefer to hire someone to work on the business plan and marketing plan.  Needless to say, the document compiled is unlikely to reflect a real plan for the development and promotion of a startup, and even the paper on which it will be printed will not cost? </li><li>  Due to the fact that the skills of entrepreneurship among our developers are still not very well developed, then for the successful development of the project, it will still be necessary to attract people to the startup, who will, in fact, ‚Äúdo business‚Äù.  The $ 20,000 allocated for good specialists is not enough, but will developers want to give such people a rather big share (after all, developers will own 90 percent or more of the shares)? </li></ol><br>  I do not in any way want to hurt those developers who possess sufficient entrepreneurial skills, and view their Internet project as a real business - it must be admitted that such teams in the market are an overwhelming minority.  And in order for an incubator project that uses the Y Combinator business model to be successful, a stream of competent teams with well-developed ideas is necessary.  But in Russia, this is still the current shortage. </div>
