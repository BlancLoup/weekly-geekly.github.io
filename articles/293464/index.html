  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales of 3D printers have declined due to lower consumer interest.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The second quarter became unprofitable for <a href="http://www.3dsystems.com/">3D Systems</a> , a manufacturer of 3D printers.  Financial results were worse than forecasted: the quarter ended with a net loss of $ 13.7 million.  Total revenue of 3D Systems has increased, but the ‚Äúorganic sales‚Äù indicator, which takes into account currency adjustments and excludes acquisitions, has decreased by 5%.  In the same period last year, the company made a profit of $ 2.1 million.  These results are explained by the fact that many consumers are waiting for the release of new models of 3D printers and do not buy devices that are being sold now. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The quarterly loss to <a href="http://www.stratasys.com/ru">Stratasys</a> rival 3D Systems was $ 22.9 million.  In the same quarter of last year, it did not exceed $ 173 thousand.  Sales of printers and consumables for them decreased by 13%. <br><br>  In 2014, 3D Systems and Stratasys accounted for more than a third of all sales in the 3D printer segment.  Over the past three years, annual sales growth in the industry exceeded 30%.  Therefore, market participants willingly bought up the assets of companies.  However, at such rates of production of models, manufacturers could not fully solve the problems with the quality and reliability of products.

      Now on the market there are many models of 3D-printers worth $ 5 thousand.  Sales of household models account for less than 10% of total sales of Stratasys.  ‚ÄúWe still do not see growth in the consumer segment of this market.  These devices are difficult to use, and very often home-bought printers simply gather dust without benefit, ‚Äùsaid Terry Wolers, an analyst with the 3D printer market. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe period when early enthusiasts bought 3D printers out of a desire to join the innovation was over.  Now the main buyers should be representatives of the mainstream, but they do not want to invest in a printer that is 20 times lower than in future models in performance.  And they prefer to wait, ‚Äùsays Brian Drab, an analyst at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blair_%2526_Company">William Blair &amp; Co.</a>  ‚ÄúThe industry is going through a slowdown phase, users are digesting their recent investment in 3D printing,‚Äù said David Reis, CEO of Stratasys. <br><br>  So far, 3D printers have occupied only a small niche - they are used to produce mainly engineering models or small batches of complex parts, dental instruments, and so on.  They still do not provide a complete replacement for metal-cutting machines and equipment for injecting plastics. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are dissatisfied with our current results.  So far we have not been able to fully establish the metal printing of large formats.  But we are moving quickly in the right direction, ‚Äùsaid company director Avi Reichental. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293464/</a></p>
