  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start selling iPhone 3G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this publication, I want to present my personal impressions of the event that Apple arranged in the first half of July. <br><br>  The queue for a new iPhone in New York appeared on July 4, Independence Day.  People slept on the street in sleeping bags. <br><img src="http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/8350/dsc02269oo5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Reporters and ordinary people constantly approached the waiters.  The most frequent question was about what all those who spent so many days on Fifth Avenue are waiting for.  Some onlookers were very surprised when it came to "cell phone". <br><img src="http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/4498/dsc02266dg3.jpg"><br><br>  On the evening of July 10th, I honestly set the alarm for six in the morning local time, since from Brooklyn, where I live, it takes about an hour by subway to Fifth Avenue.  And just the same honestly did not hear the alarm.  Came to Manhattan by one o'clock.  Coming out of the subway, I could make sure that I did not confuse the day.  There was a huge line near the AT &amp; T office. <br><img src="http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/7694/dsc02438un6.jpg">

      But the line that was in the New York Apple store struck me a lot more. <br><img src="http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/3046/dsc02479za2.jpg"><br><br>  I tried to go inside through the fence, but my path was interrupted by a man in glasses, who asked where I was going.  I replied that I just wanted to see what was going on inside.  He replied that everyone wants to look and asked to go beyond the fence and wait until the group is launched, those ‚Äúwho are not behind the iPhone.‚Äù <br><img src="http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/605/dsc02445yf2.jpg"><br><br>  Five minutes later, we were promised that we would not buy an iPhone, and asked to follow the released consultant.  Inside there were two more lines in two different directions. <br><img src="http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/775/dsc02475rw7.jpg"><br><br>  Consultants ran throughout the premises and helped buyers activate the iPhone. <br><img src="http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/8812/dsc02460pc8.jpg"><br><br>  In the meantime, I decided to look at the firmware version 2.0 on the iPod Tache.  I went to the App store, tried to install Twitterific - it is free.  To do this, I entered the username and password of my iTunes account.  Having played enough with him, I wanted to log out.  I couldn‚Äôt do this - even after restarting the App store I used my account.  Then I called the consultant.  That, having rummaged in settings, found nothing and called me to two more.  The three of them poked their fingers at iPod for a long time, but they could not do anything either.  I asked if it would be an easy way to change my password.  One of them agreed, led me to the MacBooks, quickly opened Google, entered the ‚Äúitunes change password‚Äù, went out to some internal Apple page and I safely changed my password. <br><br>  After all this, I went to watch the main hero of the occasion, who turned out to be significantly thinner than his predecessor. <br><img src="http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/922/dsc02462es4.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/4194/dsc02463cb2.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the Apple store, my attention was attracted by a car with stickers offering to sell its old iPhone for the price it was worth.  To my question, why do you need old iPhones, the driver obviously was gossip and answered that he cares about the environment.  Allegedly, he parses them and sells them in parts (but we all know why they are with him). <br><img src="http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/5527/dsc02491fs7.jpg"><br><br>  PS <br>  To buy a new iPhone in the US, you must present a US credit card, social security number, ID document, and contract number with AT &amp; T. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28958/</a></p>
