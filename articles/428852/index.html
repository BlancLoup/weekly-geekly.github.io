On the one hand, it all means that everyone will find topics for themselves and will be able to get answers to their questions.  On the other hand, it is very difficult to choose.

      One of the route options for the conference is to go on <b>all the most popular reports</b> .  Moreover, while working on the schedule, we interviewed future students and made a rating of expectations.  The leaders of the voting will speak in the Main Hall (Congress Hall), which, according to a good tradition, we <b>broadcast for free</b> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dHSCBCyrcP4">Broadcast first day HighLoad ++</a> </h2><br><h2>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hkcOmILykas">Broadcast of the second day HighLoad ++</a> </h2><br>  The broadcast will go to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/profyclub/">HighLoad Channel</a> on youtube, so as not to forget and not to miss, you can subscribe to the channel, blog or <a href="http://eepurl.com/VYVaf">newsletter</a> - but rather all at once, we have everything useful :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now let's learn what, strictly speaking, is now in a trend, and what everyone wants to hear about or whom. <br><br><h2>  November 8 <br></h2><br><h3>  10:00 -
