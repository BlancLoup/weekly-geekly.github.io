  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian bloggers throw diaries and go to social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yandex has published another study, The Blogosphere of the Russian Internet ( <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/yandex_on_blogosphere_spring_2008.pdf">PDF</a> ), based on the latest statistics of its services.  In this study, a sad fact was noted: for the first time since the measurements since autumn 2006, the share of active bloggers has decreased. <br><br>  If in November 2007 about one third of the authors wrote in their diaries at least once every three months, now there is only one fifth.  On such hosting as Damochka.ru and Rambler Planet (more than 150 thousand diaries each), the share of active blogs was only 3% and 8%, respectively.  In fact, now they are two large cemeteries.  The situation in Livejournal and on other hosts is not much better. <br><br>  The negative is manifested even in Novosibirsk, where according to statistics the most active bloggers of Russia live.

Even in LiveJournal‚Äôs most lively blog hosting, this figure is only 12%. <br><br>  In addition, in some large blog hosting sites, despite the growth in the total number of diaries, the absolute number of active bloggers has decreased (for example, in the fall of 2007 there were about 170 thousand active blogs on LiveInternet, and now there are about 160 thousand, on LiveJournal there were more than 240 thousand active blogs, now - less than 230 thousand).  It can be assumed that many bloggers now prefer to write and communicate not in blogs, but in social networks. <br><br>  Despite the extinction of the audience, blog hosting sites continue to multiply.  A total of ‚ÄúBlog Search Yandex‚Äù now knows 82 blog hosting sites ‚Äî almost two and a half times more than last year.  The diagram shows the number of hosting sites containing at least 200 blogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7df/eb4/bac/7dfeb4bacb2f556c07089a91c57ef212.jpg" width="450" height="278" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  However, more than 75% of all Russian-language diaries are still only on four hosting sites. <br><br>  The activity of bloggers by the time of day coincides with the activeness of users of Habrahabr.  It increases by the end of the working day, and then goes to the second (maximum) peak around 22.00. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0c9/a9f/56a/0c9a9f56a64cc925f5c19ebb1824135f.jpg" width="450" height="285" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The average blogger is still a girl of 22 years old, lives in Moscow.  Her blog has been around for a year and nine months, and she updates it every five days.  She has 19 friends, and 10 people comment on the entries in her diary. <br><br>  Since the registration of her average diary, the girl blogger has written 38 posts in it, each of which received 2 comments.  In addition, she wrote 98 comments - in their own or other people's posts. <br><br>  The average male blogger wrote 37 posts, and they turned out to be somewhat more popular than women - for each post there are 3 comments received.  He himself left 133 comments.  On average, men comment on significantly more than women. <br><br>  Activity bloggers grow with age.  Most of the entries - an average of about 130 - contain blogs from 45 to 54 years old.  The same authors lead in the number of written and received comments. <br><br>  The most numerous age group - from 18 to 24 years old - obviously creates the most posts (about 40%).  Commented more often by older people.  Given that bloggers between the ages of 25 and 34 are two times less, 40% of the comments on blogs are left by them. <br><br>  The activity of bloggers on average becomes significantly higher one and a half years after the creation of the diary.  The number of entries increases dramatically, and the number of comments written and received increases even more.  On average, during the first year and a half, bloggers comment in two times less than in the next year and a half, and receive comments in three times less.  This is not surprising - over time, there are regular readers and commentators, as well as new social connections.  Thus, it takes about a year and a half to adapt in the blogosphere.  The peak of blog activity comes 2.5-3 years after registering an account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/aaf/7e8/52c/aaf7e852c0e55ae605a180699db0b0cc.jpg" width="450" height="354" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The largest number of posts falls on the diary of a resident of Novosibirsk.  And in terms of the number of comments for one diary, Novosibirsk is second only to Moscow and St. Petersburg. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288138/</a></p>
