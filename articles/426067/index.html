    <h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Europe window</font> </h3><br>  It is no secret that talented people, unfortunately, leave our country every year.  Someone is going abroad in search of a better life, someone wants to change their life and try something new.  One way or another, the problem of ‚Äúbrain flow‚Äù exists.  Especially the topic is relevant for representatives of international professions: programmers, engineers, doctors.  Here, for example, a list of those <a href="http://work-place.net/%3Fp%3D3370">who are waiting in Canada</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_m/-_/rh/_m-_rhbzpirutkiku06oi1xq2a4.png"><br><br>  We did not sit back and wait for the issue of ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù to materialize in our company, so we decided to act proactively by inviting employees to relocate to one of the European countries. <br><br>  On the one hand, the company at that time had more than ten offices around the world, and on the other hand, they were all at a considerable distance from the main R &amp; D center in Moscow.  So the idea arose to transfer part of the development team to Tallinn. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">But why Estonia?</font> </h3><br>  We considered various options for relocation.  Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, they are all beautiful, but have a number of features.  In favor of Estonia, almost half of the country speaks Russian, and you can get to Moscow by any night train.  In addition, there is a very advanced e-government model, which greatly simplifies all organizational aspects.  In addition, the country is working to attract investors, start-ups and other promising projects.  Not by chance Microsoft, Skype, other companies also settled here. <br><br>  By the way, what should be the e-government can actually be read on Habr√©, for example, <a href="https://habr.com/post/395579/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/6l/gq/cl6lgqx7tjpmj_ds74a1b0wvgbu.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Resolved!</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Let's go!</font> </h3><br>  So, we decided to transport the team.  But we had to do it in the mode of ‚Äúscalded cat‚Äù.  Find an office, housing for employees and their families, issue all necessary documents, for everything about all two months.  On the other side: retained staff, high satisfaction, additional motivation and integrity of all work processes. <br><br>  It was easier for us, because initially we work in a technological market, and for IT companies in Estonia there is a favorable investment climate.  There are national business support institutions, such as the Enterprise Development Assistance Foundation ( <a href="https://www.eas.ee/eas/%3Flang%3Dru">EAS</a> ), which provides comprehensive support.  See what our smart office in Tallinn looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y5/68/dl/y568dl6j2bdsbjhvej3dhfyykqi.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Not so bad as hell baby</font> </h3><br>  In fact, everything related to the organizational aspects of the relocation turned out to be quite realizable, especially considering the involvement of local specialists.  We analyzed the market and found a company specializing in personnel relocation to Estonia.  The <a href="http://www.movemytalent.com/">Movemytalent</a> team <a href="http://www.movemytalent.com/">has</a> greatly simplified our lives.  Therefore, if fate suddenly determines you to relocate employees to Estonia, feel free to look in their direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/jw/el/d6jwel52ktqrcrdomvtyqfzs2oa.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">About the cost of living, salaries and compensation</font> </h3><br>  In fact, another question related to relocation is salary.  Just convert the Moscow salary from rubles to euros will not be enough.  To develop a correct approach to compensation, it is worth focusing on two factors: salary data on the local market (Salary surveys) and cost-of-living indicators (COLA). <br><br>  As a barometer, I can recommend to look <a href="https://www.expatistan.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/">here</a> .  In addition, it is necessary to take into account differences in the income tax rate, as well as the tax on special benefits.  Paradoxically, in order to organize a corporate holiday in Tallinn, it is necessary to include additional taxes in the cost of its holding.  But this is local specificity and you get used to working with it very quickly. <br><br>  Another discovery is medicine.  Local residents safely use the state CHI program.  Employers rarely provide LCA as a benefit.  There are few commercial insurance companies on the market.  For example, the employee insurance tender did not take place because of the almost complete absence of LCA providers in the local market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/dp/xb/rvdpxbnhoz1yjrkcu916tzltvt4.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Migration aspects</font> </h3><br>  Everything turned out to be much easier than we thought!  Here you will find only three main stages: <br><br><ol><li>  Registration of short-term work in the Police Department; </li><li>  Obtaining a long-term visa ‚Üí entry ‚Üí employment; </li><li>  Obtaining a residence permit </li></ol><br>  At all stages there is a convenient remote process of signing and submitting documents to government bodies. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Instead of an epilogue</font> </h3><br>  We transported about forty employees along with their family members.  These were key developers with high motivation to relocate.  For various reasons, the first few "settlers" returned to their homeland.  For some, it was difficult to live far from family, relatives and friends, someone thought that the quality of life in Europe and Russia is not much different.  As for our tasks, on the whole the company managed to achieve them: the squad did not lose their fighters, and the NPS remained at the level of a ‚Äúhealthy person‚Äù.  Have you ever relocated a team?  Share your experiences in the comments.  Thank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/ny/9l/lony9ll1-a0uuzhvcghhixiauiw.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426067/</a></p>
