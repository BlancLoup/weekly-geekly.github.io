Therefore, I post my idea here, which I sent to this contest.  My idea helped me with OSM Eugene Usvitsky (SSU), for which he thanks a lot. <br><br><h4>  <b>Map of the city in the payment terminals.</b> </h4>

      <b>Prerequisites:</b> <br><br>  Suppose you come to a city unfamiliar to you.  You are at the station / bus terminal / at the airport and vaguely imagine where to go next.  There are of course taxis whose driver with a 99% chance will deceive you;  there is a transport, though it‚Äôs hard to imagine what you can get at, you have to ask people (and probably more than once), and still not all of them will know where;  You can call and find out who you came to, but what if he is outside the zone or has a battery on the mobile? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Another case.  You are standing at a bus stop in your native and such familiar city and call for work, asking to drive to a place and call the address.  The address is not familiar to you.  You start asking people at the bus stop, but not the fact that someone knows where to go, what to do? <br><br>  <b>Solution option:</b> <br><br>  There are a lot of cases like those described above, and all of them are somehow connected with the cards and the place of access to them.  This is the problem and it all rests.  The original idea came along with the now popular payment terminals (a kind of touch-screen kiosk) and a parallel developing project OSM (OpenStreetMap).  Let's take a closer look at the components and then the idea itself. <br><br>  <b>Touch kiosk (payment terminals):</b> <br><br>  Touch-screen kiosk is a hardware-software complex assembled on the basis of a personal computer and equipped with a touch monitor that simplifies human-computer interaction.  Touch kiosk (self-service kiosk) is designed to provide the user with a variety of information without the involvement of staff. <br><br>  Payment terminal is a hardware-software complex that ensures the receipt of payments from individuals in the self-service mode.  The payment terminal is characterized by a high degree of autonomy of its work.  Work can be monitored over the Internet.  Basically, the payment terminal is designed to <br><br><ul><li>  receiving payments for mobile communication services, utilities, Internet providers, to repay bank loans; </li><li>  replenishment of personal accounts in payment systems, bank card accounts. </li></ul><br><br>  The principle of operation is as follows: <br><br>  Using the on-screen menu of the terminal, the user selects the service that he would like to pay, indicates the necessary details (phone number, personal account number, etc.).  Following the instructions displayed on the screen, enters the required amount into the bill acceptor and presses the "Pay" button.  The terminal independently recognizes the authenticity of cash and their denomination. <br><br>  Using a GPRS modem or other means of communication, the terminal sends the entered payment data to the server of the payment system providing payment processing.  Having processed the data, the server of the payment system sends them to the gateway of the server of the organization to which the payment is intended.  After that, the amount entered into the terminal is credited to the user‚Äôs account and the terminal prints and issues a check to the user.  This sequence may be slightly different, but it is not so important for us. <br><br>  <b>OSM (OpenStreetMap):</b> <br><br>  OpenStreetMap (OSM; literally ‚Äúopen road maps‚Äù) is a free project for the joint development of publicly available maps and schemes of cities, streets, roads using manual or automatic data entry, as well as receiving data from portable GPS receivers.  The project was founded in the UK in July 2004 by Steve Coast.  In April 2006, OSM began registration as a fund.  ‚ÄúThe OpenStreetMap Foundation is an international non-profit organization created to support the development and dissemination of geospatial data, as well as to enable anyone to use geospatial data.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Idea:</b> <br><br>  So, we briefly met with the two components of the idea: a viewer and a map.  The very idea is already beginning to appear.  And what if you put this card in the payment terminal?  After all, the payment terminal does not fully use its resources!  The last phrase is a fact.  Here is the technical information about the standard configuration of the OSMP-2: <br><br> <code>IBM PC   <br> <br> 1.  Intel Celeron 310 (2130MHz, 533 MHz FSB) 256Kb BOX w/cooler (Socket 478) <br> 2.   ECS P4M800-M (VIA P4M800) SVGA, Sound, LAN, 3 PCI, 2 DDR 3200, mATX (Retail) <br> 3.   DDR SDRAM 256Mb PC-3200 Hynix-1 Original <br> 4.  ST-Lab I-152 PCI 2 port fast serial + 1 port EPP combo (Retail) <br> 5.    1.0 (  2.0      ) <br> 6.   InWin 300W ATX (P4) <br> 7.  GlacialTech GT1225EBDL-1/ 120√ó120x25  ,   <br> 8.  HDD Western Digital 40Gb WD400BB 7200rpm 2Mb <br> 9.   - 1.8 . <br> 10. RAM-512 Mb DDR <br> <br>   <br> <br> 1.    TFT 17‚Ä≥ LG L1750S  ACER AL1716 As <br> 2.    <br> 3.    <br> 4.    17  <br> 5.   </code> <br> <br>  The system itself consists of a program that allows you to view the site, located on the hard disk of the terminal.  Agree that such a smart typewriter, with Windows Embedded installed on it (embedded version), can do more than show the site and send requests. <br><br>  So, it is proposed to make a payment kiosk from the payment terminal by definition, i.e.  carry some information, in this case this information is a map of the city and region in which the terminal is located. <br><br>  <b>Implementation:</b> <br><br>  <i>Server</i> : <br><br>  Starting the server where the maps will be stored.  The card itself will be used as a help system, i.e.  It can be used to put addresses of houses, companies, information about companies, advertising (if the building belongs to a company, you can write the name on it along with the logo) and take a monthly fee from these companies. <br><br>  <i>Terminal</i> : <br><br>  A beta version of the card will be installed on the terminal and then updated.  The card function itself will be built into the site, in no way interfering with the work of the payment system. <br><br><h6>  <i>Promo picture.</i> </h6><br><br><img src="http://goncharov.net76.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/untitled-1-300x225.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Update:</i> <br><br>  The update takes place on the server with the map and: <br><br>  Option 1 (traffic savings): <br><br>  Rendering maps on the terminal, i.e.  updates will come in a binary form, and a map will be ‚Äúcreated‚Äù at the terminal itself.  In this case, there will be a saving of Internet traffic, but we still don‚Äôt know if this option will work out, because the system requirements are somewhat lower, and we didn‚Äôt test it. <br><br>  Option 2 (traffic costs): <br><br>  Rendering maps on the server and sending updated images to the terminal.  Updates will come in the form of pictures that replace the old ones.  This option is more wasteful in terms of Internet traffic compared to the previous one, although if the unlimited tariff, then it is more profitable in terms of implementation.  Also this option is suitable for terminals with modest technical capabilities. <br><br>  Benefit: <br><br>  Slightly above, I mentioned that the map can be used as a reference system due to the fact that a benefit emerges: <br><ul><li>  Subscription fee from companies / companies / enterprises that want to place information about themselves on the map: phone numbers, addresses, full name, etc. </li><li>  The system works for the whole of Russia, and the server with the card is one, so you can take a bit of people in this, and they will be able to process a large number of requests. </li></ul><br>  Also, due to the fact that the OSM project is quite widely developed, most of the work has already been done, which will save a large number of man-hours. <br><br>  Due to the fact that this idea is planned to be implemented on payment terminals, there is another benefit - the growth of cash transactions, and this should interest the company through which this terminal makes money transfers.  Of course, I do not work in statistics and do not make forecasts, but my opinion is that if someone looks at the card, in most cases he will spend some kind of monetary operation: pay the bill, throw money on the phone, etc. <br><br>  <b>Problems:</b> <br><br>  No matter how well everything worked out in words, some problems are inherent in this idea: <br><br><ul><li>  Each machine belongs to an agent and without his knowledge and consent the card cannot be installed on his terminal; </li><li>  The licensing agreement between the agent and the company through which monetary transactions pass, i.e.  you can change their website or not; </li><li>  Technical problems, such as launching a card on a terminal and its integration into a terminal system.  This is a problem because  there seems to be no such analogs yet; </li></ul><br><br>  Although all these problems are quite easily solved, you can not close your eyes to them. <br><br>  Additions: <br><br>  There are also ideas to implement the following with the map: <br><br><ul><li>  Routes of all vehicles </li><li>  Having specified the place of departure and destination, the machine will print on a check or show on the screen which transport to take, where to go, what to transfer to, how and how much to go through, etc. </li><li>  Search by various parameters (street, company name, etc.) or by several parameters at once (street, number and type of vehicle, etc.). </li><li>  The telephone directory of the city, if at one time it will be relevant in Russia. </li><li>  An opportunity to pick up the GLONASS system to the map in order to monitor the transport online. </li></ul><br><br>  <u>The idea in the process of a startup</u> , the truth is still in place.
