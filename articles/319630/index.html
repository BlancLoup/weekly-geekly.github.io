      Representative of the company, Deputy General Director Alexey Alekseenko, <a href="http://club.cnews.ru/blogs/entry/vas_eksperts_na_piringovom_forume_mskix_2016">participated</a> in the round table "Exploit Russian", where not only Russian network solutions producers, but their direct consumers gathered.  Customers and vendors tried to identify the main problems and opportunities for the development of Russian products. <br><br><h2>  Explained skepticism </h2><br>  As the presenter Vladimir Rubanov (Rosplatform) noted, users are very wary of Russian vendors, if not skeptical.  And there are many reasons for this. <br><br>  One of them is given by Sergey Mitin, Director of IT Infrastructure Development IVI: when you work with large foreign vendors who have already won the Russian market, you can be sure that their work is fully debugged and the equipment and software do not fail. <br><br>  Experience with domestic manufacturers suggests that lower prices may mean possible malfunctions.  Especially when it comes to new market participants. <br><br>  Therefore, if the budget allows, customers prefer to use the services of Western vendors, which we described in detail in our blog. <br><br>  In more detail you can listen to it and look in records from the forum: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCjZwBVJ9yI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Competition and customer focus </h2><br>  The experience of VAS Experts has shown that Western decisions are not always more popular.  For example, in about 2011-2012, our company started developing a system for monitoring and analyzing traffic, but we were far from the only ones. <br><br>  In the wake of the ‚Äúsoftware DPI‚Äù general trend, many other players, including Cisco, who in 2014 released their productive and quite expensive SCE 10K solution to control traffic (this product description can be found <a href="http://broabandtrafficmanagement.blogspot.ru/2014/09/cisco-expands-sce-line-with-60gbps-and.html">here</a> ), took up the same process. <br><br>  It did not last long on the market, although a similar domestic product from VAS Experts not only still exists and develops, but is also actively used by customers.  Of course, the real reasons why Cisco has curtailed production are not known to anyone, but this example perfectly illustrates the fact that the success of a product does not always depend on the place of its development. <br><br>  And today there are many successful domestic <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D179">evidence of</a> this in the field of DPI.  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D203">Here</a> we gave a comparative analysis of Russian and foreign decisions. <br><br>  In our work, we fully focus on the client - our <a href="http://vasexperts.ru/product-skat.php">product</a> must meet the needs of our users, have broad functionality and be reliable.  And while on the Russian market it has no analogues in the field of DPI, which can detect up to 80 gigabit of traffic per unit up to 6000 protocols at a time on the fly. <br><br>  During the discussion, another advantage of domestic vendors was revealed - their availability.  And this is expressed not only in the operational response of technical support to the elimination of the problems that have arisen, but also in the willingness to meet customers and meet their needs at the production stage of the product.  You can read about how to choose the right Russian DPI system <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D542">here</a> . <br><br>  Among the shortcomings of Russian manufacturers are the lack of substantial experience in doing business and working with large investments.  Plus a lack of budget for marketing and promotion. <br><br>  In this situation, we used the following approach: when we first started working, we offered all our customers an entry-license for almost a year free use of our product.  Today, we always offer customers to test our product for free before the final purchase decision.  At the same time, those companies that are forced to switch to Russian equipment and software, such as, for example, Rostelecom, note that they are quite satisfied with the quality. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  To restructure the market takes time.  Today there are enough problems, for example, vendors are not engaged in additional expensive research and development, because in order to survive, they are forced to make only such products for which there is a great demand right now. <br><br>  Another problem that concerns the audience is the implementation of good initiatives in practice.  Today there is no Russian equipment, all the elements of which would be produced in Russia.  And the ‚ÄúRussianness‚Äù of the product is measured not only by this (we wrote about the assignment of the status of TORP in the <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D321">article</a> about the roadmap).  Therefore, a natural question arises whether, over time, domestic production will fully appear. <br><br>  Additional materials from our <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/">blog</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D432">5 steps to become an ISP</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D472">Internet resources rating - traffic analysis using DPI</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D482">DPI for satellite Internet assistance - experience on ANADYR.NET communication network</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D595">Alerting the public in case of emergencies - a solution for telecom operators</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D584">Filtering Internet content for schools.</a>  <a href="http://blog.vasexperts.ru/%3Fp%3D584">Using Whitelists (ACL)</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  And a small survey on the topic: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319630/</a></p>
