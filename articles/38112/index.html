  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comment - a unit of meaning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post, I will touch upon three issues: <br><ol><li>  The importance of comments for the post. </li><li>  The problem of submitting comments and my version of its solution. </li><li>  Suppression of complex / interesting technical posts with IT news, humor, and idle talk. </li></ol><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have already voiced that I do not really like to read posts, so I begin to get acquainted with any of them with comments, if I am interested in the discussion, I get acquainted with the topic that spawned it in order to participate competently.  Thus, comments for me are more valuable than posts.  The information that is conveyed to me in 99% of cases is secondary, that is, there are other resources (books or blogs of professionals / special resources / own logic) that can give a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe problem.  But the opinions and assessment of other people, often in the above sources are not available.  And I am very glad that Habr has collected such a party, whose opinion is interesting, and the discussions are both fun and practical. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But, as it always has been, there is and will be, in a get-together, there are not only interested, but also interested ones.  The difference of the second from the first is that the second Habr is interesting, but they do not have the ability to generate the content that the first would like to see.  From here and taken "stupid" comments and posts.  This desire, too, to express themselves on the resource, and earn points, but to do it in affordable ways.  For example, I cannot write how to make a robot, but I can write / review a review about a Japanese robot dog. <br><br>  No matter how opposed they are, more accessible topics will always be more popular and discussed than the profile ones.  They just have a larger coverage area.  Yes, and often profile posts do not provoke discussion, as their audience is not always inclined to this, and, as a rule, apart from ‚Äúthank you, useful information! / I will use‚Äù, there‚Äôs nothing to say. <br><br>  Proceeding from the fact that all salt (for me) is habr in comments, those topics that provoke discussions and disputes are most beneficial.  I myself am learning to write such texts.  (Frankly, Habr is the first place on the Internet, where I write about what I want and do with pleasure.) <br><br>  I would also like to refer to a specific circle of comment authors.  Remember that a comment is not just your personal appeal to the author of the post, but a public statement that will be read by many people.  He must be properly understood and come to the place.  For me, honestly a mystery, what is the need to write "+1".  Do you just want to express consent and admiration?  There are private messages, in the public discussion it is of little concern, if there is nothing to supplement. <br><br>  And finally, with comments there is another problem - the problem of their presentation.  I understand the compulsiveness of the tree structure perfectly, but it is often very difficult to find the source comment if several discussions have sprung from it.  My suggestion is (without pretending to originality, habr is the first resource for me, where I communicate tightly): <br><br><img src="http://tbms.ru/habr/comments/comment.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the figure, an arrow is placed next to a comment that is far away from the original one; when you hover or click on it, the text of the original comment appears.  In the guidance scenario, clicking on the arrow will transfer the reader to the original comment, in the scenario of clicking in the pop-up pop-up there will be a ‚Äúgo to comment‚Äù button. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38112/</a></p>
