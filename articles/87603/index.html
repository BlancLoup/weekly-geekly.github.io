As it is sickly for the next revolution ... But, as always, we were just vaguely explained how it is necessary to prepare it. <br>  I will try to correct this misunderstanding and retell in Russian about those charms that can already be obtained using the Opera Unit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In fact, not much has been found from the collection of applications on the official website of the opera.

      the most useful is the mega button allowing to turn any page opened in the opera into an opera widget <br><br>  <b>widgetise</b> by lucideer-dev <br>  <a href="http://unite.opera.com/application/652/">http://unite.opera.com/application/652/</a> <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/v-talik/view/315871/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/056/532/26f0565325125787bbc5a98c229ae04e.jpg" width="314" height="159" title="opera unite" alt="opera unite"></a> <br><br>  Or, by analogy with Google Chrome, create application shortcuts for individual web pages. <br><br>  I‚Äôm just warning you that at the moment it‚Äôs not possible to stir up work with Google-services in a similar way, the developer of this unit writes about it. <br><br>  But for example, to make a label, let's say, for Frenfid, it was even possible. <br><br>  By and large - pages containing automatically updated content are the ideal fuel for similar unit gadgets. <br><br>  For one and the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopera widgets work. <br><br>  By the way, <a href="http://pro.mail.ru/">pro.mail.ru</a> looks very good in the <a href="http://pro.mail.ru/">harness</a> from this unit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/43b/c79/60643bc79284667320f085d4c87c46c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A ready-made solution for relatives with no rights to use the Internet.  He taught to run this program here ... And to click on these links in the text and complete order. <br><br>  If someone throws useful links to the pages of sites suitable for the role of individual applications - I will be extremely grateful. <br><br><h4>  Yunayt prog for work. </h4><br><br>  Perhaps the most useful bundle is called <br>  Document courier and document sync. <br><br>  <b>Document Courier</b> by mjgrainge <br>  <a href="http://unite.opera.com/application/331/">http://unite.opera.com/application/331/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de1/2cf/476/de12cf4760575330ece6a8ced235bff1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first is intended for sharing forms on the network for uploading files to your computer. <br><br>  In reality, this may be useful to certain remote workers, for whom the customer does not want to upload files through the file exchangers.  In this case, he pours traffic straight to the PC. <br><br>  By default, the limit in the courier document is on a file of 350 meters, but no one bothers to put any restriction convenient for you. <br>  And of course, access to downloads on your computer can be limited with a password. <br><br>  <b>Document Sync</b> by mjgrainge <br>  <a href="http://unite.opera.com/application/472/">http://unite.opera.com/application/472/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c3/4a2/4f9/4c34a24f9ba08e35656d9dbb051db9d2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And if you run a Document Sync unit application on the second computer and specify the folder the contents of which should be sent ... As well as register the link to the courier document of the computer to which the backup itself should be sent ... We have a very interesting backup storage system. <br><br><h6>  For followers of the next level: </h6><br><br>  Unit to install custom java scripts. <br><br>  <b>UJS Manager</b> by diz <br>  <a href="http://unite.opera.com/application/401/">http://unite.opera.com/application/401/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89a/565/07d/89a56507d65e15fe07268ee87b28bf5d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In theory, this means that by clicking on a link with a ready-made ujs, he himself connects you to the script directory and will perform his immediate function, for example, to cut all pop-up advertising banners ... <br>  That's just until in Opera 10.50 does not plow ... Only Opera 10.10 <br><br>  I don‚Äôt mention a standard set of units for sharing photos, music or just a folder with all its contents ... Why didn‚Äôt I think of it ... <br><br>  Although for photos there is an idea: <br><br>  Say with relatives in another city there are a lot of cool pictures, but they don‚Äôt know how to throw everything in a crowd at the post office ... <br><br>  We send such people instructions on how to activate this unit in the opera and how to point to the folder with photos ... <br>  After successful settings, we get access to photos of relatives without constant requests to send this or that from the holidays ... The main thing is that the opera be included. <br><br>  This moment is all that I managed to use in everyday life ... if you have your own preferences in the work of UNT applications, please describe them in the comments, I will allow myself to discuss the very idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOPERA UNIT <br><br><h5>  Opera lacks aura of aggressiveness </h5><br><br>  in theory, to make an association with the Scandinavian roots, an analogy with the Vikings Dracars as small, fast, predatory ships ... <br><br>  In addition to speed in advancing the opera, there must be some means of active defense against web attacks, something like network armaments ... <br>  Perhaps with the help of an operatic unit ... Redirecting incoming connections to the attacker's computer or ... <br>  Something like this‚Ä¶ <br><br>  if the Opera web browser is positioned as ‚Äúarmed and very dangerous‚Äù, popularity among the most active adolescent parties will be ensured. <br><br>  In principle, if we consider the functions already existing in the opera, there is a full body for teenagers.  but at the same time the kid shakes firefox ... Paradox?  Or the power of PR? <br>  (according to common reason - the power of PR, since adolescents are most susceptible to external suggestion) <br><br><h5>  Perhaps the opera lacks elitism? </h5><br><br>  Or let's go on the other side: <br>  Everything in the network revolves around bread and circuses whose concepts perfectly fit themes of sex, violence, free toys and other media content ... <br><br>  The opera has a built-in torrent client, but not many people use it as we would like ... And why?  The opera had a widget for searching by torrent trackers, but it was not integrated with the torrent rocking chair and the rss reader built into the opera. <br><br>  A lot of useful chips, but all are not united by one whole interface (a common idea through which you can manage all these bastards). <br><br><h4>  Idea for opera unit </h4><br><br>  Write analog olarkovsky chat (olark.com) for your site. <br>  The unit application generates the code that we insert into your site and visitors will have access to a window for direct feedback with the site owner who has the opera unit running. <br><br>  Paid authorization system for selected unit folders <br>  For the organization of a private shop <br><br>  <i>Another interesting option is the pre-installed Opera browser in instant-it OSes, instead of FF as it is done now.</i>  <i>As in the form of a fast means of accessing the network, all the more so with the amount of synchronization means as in Opera it would be the most functional solution.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It was in the version for the Internet that was quick, the opera would have shown unobtrusively that, in the opinion of many, it is now a very good Internet processor, and the main thing is convenient.</i> <br><br>  Torrent server? <br>  To manage the distribution of a certain file? <br>  I picked up the server - uploaded the file, a lot of people downloaded ... the unit application controls the tracker ... And if the computer is turned off the tracker drops? <br><br>  Unit chat based on jabber. <br>  Why exactly, and not the one that is already in the opera unit? <br>  The answer is banal. <br>  You start a unit-application, and your friends or partners in their google lists, online and other queues see your contact online and are immediately ready to drop you, ‚Äúpreds‚Äù and other orders. <br>  Theoretically, the history of such messages can be stored right there in the opera or somewhere centralized (to taste). <br>  There is no need to invent a bike with another jabber client, in a wrapper from an opera unit, but you need to somehow organize the authorization of your copy of the unit application in an operating network of jabber accounts ... <br><br>  Those.  Consciously not giving the opportunity to log in to such a unit-applications through third-party accounts such as those of the same Guglatov and Yandex. <br><br>  But according to the mind, a part of the functionality for storing history was simply cool to link to contacts in the operative address book <br><br>  Another trend. <br><br>  Search <br><br>  If you think about what search on the network for Google on private desktops for figs knows by whom Does the search for accessible sections of computers on the network seem to be not yet mastered? <br><br>  If you write a certain unit-application that allows you not only to share certain amounts of data on your computer, but also to issue its index into a single network of units?  But again, on bittorent algorithms, the more I share for searching in my own ‚Äî the more foreign units-machines are available by their own requests. <br>  True, I can say that I am the current that reinvented the torrent network? <br><br>  But if you go further? <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa unit of computers with direct connection with each other ... Search for music on computers of people with similar interests ... <br><br>  Or perhaps something more interesting is that a mixture of results through user searches on specific sites is returned via a search unit application. <br><br>  Let's say the issue is from a closed community, as one of the participants in this community has shared its search engine base via an opera-unit (user searches on specific sites). <br><br>  The conclusion is what is called the next trend on the web, the future fashion for questions and answers. <br><br>  He entered the query into the search engine unit and received a cunning issue from a dozen sites and secret communities. <br><br><h4>  Analogies to explain the essence of this scribbling </h4><br><br>  In the beginning there was a direct connection through soap (communication), then public chats, irks and other ICQ appeared - This communication <br><br>  Next came the search for the increased amount of information <br><br>  New branch of communication in the form of blogs, and then microblogging <br><br>  Now the next round of search is brewing - by answering clear questions.  Or even live answers ... <br><br>  But the implementation of answers from real people to questions and can become the ridge of the Opera. <br><br>  Imagine for a moment that we have a unit that pulls user questions from a certain base and invites us to answer them.  In chat mode ... <br>  Or beat as a quiz with a fixed response time ... <br><br>  What would a similar system work - the user should spend some time on the tincture (specify gender and age, preferences) but even the 5th time it is a pity for the vast majority to spend on registration, the only thing that causes it to do is the desire to get what you want. <br><br>  And here you can offer to simply allow the unit to read the search history of the user and his bookmarks on the basis of these data the system itself would build a database of users that need to search for answers to questions from the user or alternatively, who can send questions to receive live answers. <br><br>  By and large, all signs of such undertakings are already in the opera unit, it‚Äôs enough to see exactly which new applications appear, but for most it‚Äôs not obvious ... There is no general concept as clear and simple as an ax ... <br><br>  <b>There is no motto - together we are strong!</b> <br>  In the end - where is the combat unit application creating on a voluntary basis a white botnet? <br><br>  I gathered supporters in the amount of from 100 to a thousand under my banners and led them to the drakar (opera units) to storm ... And here it is already ... In the ocean of the Internet, the most valuable piece is cleared information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87603/</a></p>
