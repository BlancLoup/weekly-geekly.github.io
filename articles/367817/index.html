Of course, with a bit of risk.  And for certain, someone wanted to see from the inside how everything works and whether it is true that hundreds of graphs and figures run before the eyes of a novice investor, sleeping for days and nights. <br><br>  Most recently, BCS launched the first in Russia simple and convenient service for trading in the beta test mode - the <a href="https://my.broker.ru/%3Frefid%3D6580%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcurrency_article">application ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù</a> .  Especially for Geektimes, we asked the former private investor to test the system from the point of view of his experience, share his impressions and at the same time tell us a little about his way to the stock market.  Give him the word. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dc/c7a/e5c/0dcc7ae5c1394a97877ee7adfd8d1d04.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúHi, Giktayms!

      My life has ceased to be the same back in 2005.  Then I, a finance student with an average grade of 5.0, used the full right to choose and voluntarily entered my name on the ‚ÄúFinancial Management‚Äù specialization list, without even knowing why classmates were jerking taxes and banking.  Everything cleared up in September: our small group of brave people were guaranteed two years of financial mathematics, the stock market, exchange business, in-depth economic analysis and statistics, probability theory, and other <s>distortions of</s> disciplines that you can‚Äôt miss without consequences.  All this time one thought was comforting: I would become a broker, then conquer Wall Street and take my place just between Jordan Belfort and Bernard Madoff. <br><br>  So, introductory.  Broker, I did not, Wall Street to conquer did not even try.  But the stock market and the knowledge about it continued to lure - I tried to independently make money on exchange rates, and then I dreamed of succeeding in transactions with Gazprom shares.  Dreams Come True.  But somehow completely.  As a result, the work finally distracted me from the stock exchange affairs, but the suggestion of the BCS to try <a href="https://my.broker.ru/%3Frefid%3D6580%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcurrency_article">‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù</a> and tell about it touched a little. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù gives the opportunity to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments;  exchange currency on the exchange at the exchange rate (how to do it, already described in the BCS blog) in a simple and convenient way. <br><br>  I will tell you at once who I would recommend this application to. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Anyone who wants to "trade in the stock market" at low speeds.</i>  You can consider various tools and strategies, build a portfolio and instruct the broker to purchase certain stocks, bonds and other assets for you.  The threshold of entry is very low - only 50 000 rubles.  You can choose a strategy without losses, with minimal risk and try to earn much more than it allows, for example, the rate on a bank deposit. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Students of financial universities and anyone who wants to learn more about the stock market.</i>  A lot of information is available in My Broker, it is all well structured and rich in details.  After several hours of unhurried research ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù, you are guaranteed to have an understanding of what assets there are, what can influence them, what is a portfolio and the structure of an investment portfolio. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Definitely, those who are already working / trading (here who calls them) on the exchange or are ready to send part of their personal savings to the formation of an investment portfolio.</i>  You will be surprised by the simplicity and accessibility of the interface, a set of information, a list of proposed tools.  I had to deal with the personal accounts of other services - this one is, indeed, more modern and more convenient for a private investor. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Those who are still dreaming or already planning to become a professional stock market participant (for example, a broker).</i>  Working with ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù even in test mode without balance, you can see how the strategy is formed, the portfolio diversifies, depending on the client's needs.  In addition, it is good luck to see your work on the part of the future client. </li></ul><br>  Of the obvious advantages, I would especially note the modern and very intuitive interface, the presence of an application for the iPhone (just below I will explain why this is cool), the information content and high speed of updating data.  In general, the application works without a single hang, even with a weak connection.  While there is no application for Android, but it will appear soon.  The web version is perfectly adapted for mobile devices, and on an 8-inch tablet everything was fine for me, but at 4.5 and 5 inches there was already ‚Äúnot the same feelings.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#32127a">Let's try to trick the system</font> </h2><br>  Depending on experience, amount, currency and investment period, <a href="https://my.broker.ru/%3Frefid%3D6580%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcurrency_article">My Broker</a> forms a personal offer.  Although I had investment experience, for a start I lied a little and chose, as it seems to me, the starting set of conditions: there is no investment experience, the amount is 50,000 - 300,000, in rubles, the income is moderate.  In general, ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù offers options for the ratio of profitability and risk: <br><br><ol><li>  minimum risk: up to 25% return on capital, up to 0% possible reduction (loss) </li><li>  weighted strategy: up to 35% return on capital, up to 5% possible reduction </li><li>  maximum income: up to 65% return on capital, up to 15% possible reduction. </li></ol><br>  I deliberately refused the low level of risk, because I wanted to get the offer more interesting.  Well, the desire for high returns to newcomers should be avoided, because it is associated with risks that need to be prepared.  Stress at the beginning of work with the stock market or the stock exchange is not the best assistant, you should gradually delve into working with financial instruments.  In addition, experience in financial transactions comes with a series of errors - starting with small experiments, you greatly reduce the price of this experience.  For example, my first experience cost me 30,000 rubles in 2008, two then-wages.  And only further caution and balanced decisions helped me win back the losses and even earn extra money. <br><br>  Let us return to the recommendations that I received in the My Broker panel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/79d/5f5/44d79d5f56a6436e89bcb1f326fb1d5c.png"><br><br>  I am not indifferent to the financial markets, so even a quick glance at the proposed case makes it clear that the portfolio was formed exactly at the request and offered stable assets.  Especially for Geektimes we will check how good the companies potentially falling into my portfolio are - let's look at the quotes in dynamics and inquire about the status of the proposed issuers. <br><br>  <b>Issuer number 1.</b>  <b>Sberbank.</b> <br>  A strong bank that manages to grow even in a crisis.  Compare quotes for two dates: <br><br>  10.27.2014 - the closing price is 76.23 rubles. <br>  01/25/2016 - the closing price is 90.52 p. <br><br>  Given the changes in the course and inflation, the situation looks stable.  And this is despite the fact that Sberbank is sensitive to fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate and its assets are volatile.  News on Sberbank is also positive, so the asset is usable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2f/5f3/58c/f2f5f358c3564c5d83b04e9df29eed54.png"><br><br>  <b>Issuer number 2.</b>  <b>Magnet.</b> <br>  This issuer is interested in many investors - a strong and rather tenacious representative of Russian retail, showing a steady growth in profits.  Compare quotes for two dates: <br><br>  10.27.2014 - the closing price is 11 900 rubles. <br>  01/25/2016 - closing price 10 952 p. <br><br>  Magnet has played almost a year of falling and shows good values ‚Äã‚Äãof quotations.  At the end of 2015, revenue growth was 24.3% (the retailer itself predicted a growth of 26%), in 2015, much fewer new stores were opened, which in itself is not an alarming signal - Magnit already has an extensive network.  Evaluating this issuer, one can even reason purely philistine: in a country there is a crisis, people are beginning to save and the Magnit chain of stores, with its adequate (and in large stores and low) prices, remains in demand.  So the asset is promising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c3/5a6/36e/0c35a636e9af461ab2e116b054d76001.png"><br><br>  <b>Issuer number 3.</b>  <b>MMC Norilsk Nickel.</b> <br>  Oil comes and goes, but we always need nickel.  But seriously, nickel mining will always be in demand: it is used everywhere, from medicine (dentistry, prosthetics) to scientific research, mechanical engineering and coinage (many coins in the world are made using nickel).  Compare quotes for two dates: <br><br>  10.27.2014 - the closing price is 8033 p. <br>  01/25/2016 - the closing price is 8944 rubles. <br><br>  And one glance at the chart is enough to make sure that this asset is profitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fb/e31/ae2/5fbe31ae2316486cbe91ad064464d83f.png"><br><br>  So, we have received recommendations on investing and we can choose which issuers are interesting for us or add our assets.  Why do you need multiple assets in your portfolio?  This is diversification - if one of the assets does not work, the portfolio will work for the rest.  This approach reduces the risk.  On the other hand, this does not mean that you need to form a portfolio of the maximum set of assets - small shares will not bring the desired income. <br><br>  By the way, all the basic information about the issuer or asset can be obtained by clicking on its name on the desktop - a detailed card will open: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e2/175/70a/6e217570ab4d42bc8eb5c55b3e5101d7.png"><br><br>  And yet, let's try to play with the system and choose different strategies.  If you look at strategies, you can get an offer to make a structural product in the asset portfolio: bonds, profitable barrels, investment notes, as well as interesting products based, for example, on changing indices of an unstable, but very economically and politically interesting Turkey. <br><br>  And what will happen if we choose, let's say, all of our initial conditions, but different ratios of risk and return?  ‚ÄúMy broker‚Äù issues the same set: Sberbank, Magnit, MMC Norilsk Nickel.  Close the beta notification and see the switch between the table structure and the pie chart view.  We see that in fact the proposed strategies differ in the shares of the proposed assets.  So, the most risky, but also the most profitable portfolio contains only two assets in equal shares. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/880/c31/a87/880c31a877f245eeae5e186c85d9cc09.png"><br><br>  And this is a weighted strategy chosen at the beginning with a moderate yield: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/117/547/add/117547add8e444af970a6c0711942a3e.png"><br><br>  Let's see the rest of the proposed investment ideas: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/ecf/118/986ecf118c23414eb6e1dc71893c088c.png"><br><br>  Here we have ideas for buying shares of foreign companies with an indication of the growth potential, the term of the investment, the opening date.  For each recommendation, you can open a detailed card, familiarize yourself with the price, trading volume, dynamics and find out why the company is attractive.  In the future it will be possible to find out the news of the issuer, which is important - even a small event in the company can significantly affect the quotes.  What to say about serious milestones that sometimes radically change the principles of the issuer or have a significant impact on it (the death of management, the departure of top managers, the release of new products, etc.). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#32127a">Gallop on "My Broker"</font> </h2><br>  In addition to investment strategies, <a href="https://my.broker.ru/%3Frefid%3D6580%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcurrency_article">‚ÄúMy Broker‚Äù</a> includes several useful sections that help to track the dynamics of the non-stop asset portfolio returns, not departing from a computer monitor.  Such a tool is very important for an investor of any level - information about the state of the portfolio must be reliable, relevant and comprehensive. <br><br>  All the status of your assets can be tracked in the ‚ÄúMy portfolio‚Äù section.  It displays the account, funds, profits, profitability, portfolio composition, asset allocation, yield chart.  Withdrawals are also made in this section.  That is, you always control your cash and the value of your investment portfolio in real time, broken down by asset type and individual instruments.  You will be able to keep track of how much profit certain securities have brought to date. <br><br>  In the Quotes section, you can follow the latest financial market news: selected assets, exchange rates, global indices, futures, see the leaders of growth and decline, the situation on blue chips, monitor commodity markets (including precious metals).  All information on structural products is collected in a separate section. <br><br>  My Broker aggregates news related to financial markets, various types of risks and issuers.  As soon as you begin to consciously work with assets in the stock market, you realize that sometimes the most insignificant event can affect the exchange rate, stocks, and other securities.  Therefore, a good broker and a competent private investor are always aware of the latest economic and political news.  The most advanced follow the news related to specific issuers: for example, the owners of Hasbro shares are interested in the results of Star Wars rental. <br><br>  If you are not at the monitor all the time, then iTunes has already published the beta version of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/moj-broker/id1033882791%3Fmt%3D8">My Broker</a> for iPhone, which has: <br><br><ul><li>  charts and quotes of Russian and foreign stocks and bonds, commodities, currencies and world indices; </li><li>  news and analysis of the situation on the markets and forecasts of experts; </li><li>  technical analysis every day; </li><li>  investment ideas and transaction advice; </li><li>  Financial Advisor advice; </li><li>  history of account transactions. </li></ul><br>  This is how it looks and works in life: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/313/8da/c2b/3138dac2b74c40878a61aab8e1f1371c.gif"><br><br>  Repeat the experiment with the formation of the portfolio, but in the mobile version: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/a3c/d84/db7a3cd848fe4a31acd8d285c728a548.gif"><br><br>  We get the same set of assets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d6/e0b/11e/2d6e0b11e6c34e7fb14e2df30790f811.png"><br><br>  You can add the securities you are interested in to your own tracking list and receive news and recommendations only on these tools.  In general, twist your iPhone in your hands and watch how your papers work for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5b/e33/f4e/e5be33f4e45e4a1da2aff93c5a8b1e15.png"><br><br>  For those who need even more screenshots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44e/da5/161/44eda5161fb14685a1249d8f574a6281.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#32127a">A few words about security in all senses</font> </h2><br>  Since working with finance places high demands on security, BCS developers have taken care of this as well: <br><br><ul><li>  All your information is protected by reliable encryption algorithms and is transmitted only via secure channels; </li><li>  to log in, use the username and password from the BCS-Online personal account; </li><li>  confirmation of the purchase and sale of securities is made only with two-factor authorization via SMS for additional protection of the account. </li></ul><br>  And finally, a few tips from me for your peace of mind. <br><br><ul><li>  The main advice is to diversify your portfolio by adding structural tools or combinations of assets.  This reduces the risk and allows you to stay in the black even with the most inconvenient scenario. <br><br></li><li>  No rash steps - be guided by common sense, market situation, do not try to fish in muddy water.  If in doubt, it is better to contact a financial advisor. <br><br></li><li>  Do not deposit into the account all the money that you have.  Investing has a period and, if absolutely necessary, you will not have time to withdraw funds from your account.  Personal finance also needs to be diversified. <br><br></li><li>  No euphoria.  This is perhaps the most terrible threat: the first profitable transaction turns the head and now you are ready to invest everything that is.  Wait, analyze, watch the score, relate to the events of the external environment, comprehend the basics of technical analysis.  This will allow you to develop progressively, but effectively. <br><br></li><li>  If you want to try yourself in the stock market - be sure to try.  And such applications as My Broker will help you to be in the wake of your investments, monitor them and feel a little bit like Belfort, and most importantly, a rational and thoughtful investor. ‚Äù </li></ul><br>  It remains for us from BCS to add that all <a href="https://my.broker.ru/%3Frefid%3D6580%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcurrency_article">services are available</a> in beta testing mode and are really useful both for serious work and for training.
