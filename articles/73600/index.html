  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Vaio VGN-AW2XRY-Q. Sight ‚Ññ2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> When in this topic (the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/laptop/71847/">online store BeCompact offers a test drive</a> ) they offered three laptops to the test, I immediately realized that I wanted to touch Sony.  After all, Sony's laptops always meant something special: design, performance, "chips" ... and, of course, price! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/045/19e/b63/04519eb636ecd64e855a3d27b6cdea93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The price in this case was rather big - almost 100 thousand rubles (92999, to be exact), and the characteristics kindled a desire to drive the coolest toys. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Those who want to know what tempted me so much can see the list of parameters <a href="http://www.becompact.ru/notebook/sony/aw/Sony-Vaio-VGN-AW2XRY-Q">here</a> , <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/vn-aw-series/vgn-aw3xry-q">here</a> and in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73232/">review of Boomburuma</a> . <br>  The distribution of elephants was carried out by the ‚ÄúBicompact‚Äù store (I‚Äôll probably write a separate topic about his visit, because it‚Äôs worth it), and they didn‚Äôt offer money for this review, obviously hoping that technomania would take precedence over the desire to make money.  In addition, they were allowed to write anything, with the condition of referring to the store ( <a href="http://www.becompact.ru/">www.becompact.ru</a> ), conducting the review.  Well - I like this policy. <br>  However, when I came to take Sonya, it turned out that Bumburum had already taken her for a test.  ‚ÄúWell, okay,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúit will be even easier: after all, Bumburum is famous for its ability to test laptops, and now I can focus on the consumer qualities of the laptop.‚Äù

      Having unpacked my laptop at home, I was at first puzzled by the scarcity of equipment: a laptop, a battery for it, a charger, an adapter for a TV tuner, and a remote control.  Bumburum hoped in his topic that this was a test sample, but judging by the booklet inside and the fact that the laptop came from the storefront, he was from the party intended for sale. <br><br>  A little later, I looked at it from the other side: a person who buys such a beech will most likely provide him with all the necessary peripherals (from a rag to a mouse and a docking station) and will select it for himself.  So here Sonya did the right thing - there is no need to litter the boxes with unnecessary things. <br><br>  The appearance of the laptop Bumburum <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73232/">conveyed</a> above all praise, although he was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73232/">shy that he could not take pictures</a> .  )) I‚Äôll confine myself only to the general view of the laptop from the seller‚Äôs website, since  My camera ordered to live a long time for a couple of days before the review. <br><br>  Now, actually, about the device. <br>  Sitting at the laptop is convenient when it is on the table.  Keeping it on your lap is a little fun - heavy (all 4 kilos) and warming, but it is understandable - this is a desktop replacement! <br>  Tactile sensations from working at the keyboard personally lead me to ecstasy.  And let Sonya rip off the concept from Yabloko, but they took only good things! <br>  Regarding the layout I will say this - you can get used to everything.  It‚Äôs also very pleasant to get used to - you want to work with such a keyboard without stopping. <br><br>  Immediately after turning on, the splendor of a bright and contrasting screen with LED backlighting is striking - the colors are really rich and bright.  But there is one thing: the vertical viewing angle, in my opinion, is too small, and with a slight tilt of the monitor back and forth you can feel the difference in the picture.  With a horizontal view is better.  Only here to watch the movie two out of four spectators in a row will not be quite comfortable - the brightness of the picture is noticeably reduced.  Separately, I want to note that in the dark it is pleasant to look at the screen, but it is tiring (for me personally).  Illumination is not visible, and this is a big plus. <br><br>  While watching a movie, I was a little puzzled by the sound: for a long time I could not understand where quite good bass is coming from in the laptop ?!  And they come from the built-in subwoofer (inside system 2.1).  Of course, not a home theater, but the voice-over room is enough. <br><br>  Computers and laptops, as is known, are taken for work, but all sooner or later all games appear!  )) <br>  In order to test the gaming power of this laptop, I decided to give it to my brother Vladimir - a great lover of computer games.  Well, who else but he will tell me what this book is capable of under the game load? <br>  His report didn‚Äôt surprise me much - it would be stupid to wait for something phenomenal from NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ 9600M GT 512Mb!  Rev Faction Guerrilla at the maximum settings shows a slideshow.  You can play it more or less normally by reducing the screen resolution to 1280 by 720 and setting the level of graphic parameters between medium and high. <br>  It was the same with NFS Undercover - the maximum settings will show you a not very fast presentation)).  Leaving the maximum resolution (1920 to 1080) will have to set the average graphics settings. <br><br>  But this in no way goes to the laptop in the minus! <br><br>  How so?  100 pieces and play normally can not be, and you say "this is not a minus"? <br>  Yes - this is not a minus.  Because the laptop is designed entirely for the other. <br>  <b>Editing graphics and video!</b>  This is what the VAIO VGN-AW2XRY / Q was created for. <br>  Two SSD drives of 64 GB together with 4 GB of RAM will allow you to effortlessly work in Photoshop, and the screen will not distort the color rendition.  Sony put the Adobe Lightroom program in the package, so that you can immediately appreciate the beauty of working with graphics.  Bumburum highlighted in his review the speed of the raid array of these two SSDs (up to 180 MB per second per reading and up to 100 MB per second per write). <br>  Well, a 500 GB hard drive is used for storing heaps of raw materials. <br>  Another reason for the presence of SSD inside this beech is the pre-installed Vista Ultimate (according to the established tradition, Vista manages to slow down on any system). <br><br>  On the sides of Sonya, you can find ports Compact Flash, SD and FireWire.  All this is used in digital photo and video equipment (of course, not only in it, but have you seen a lot of business outlets with CF and FireWire?). <br>  In general, the purpose of the laptop is more than clear, and it justifies this purpose one hundred percent.  He also has an HDMI port, which I simply had nothing to check for (I wasn‚Äôt given the corporate ‚Äúplasma‚Äù for the weekend). <br><br>  A 4800 MAh battery will give us no more than an hour of battery life if the lights are suddenly turned off in the apartment, and the pictures have not yet been sent to the editorial board.  There is no question of any autonomous life with this laptop, and it cannot go - it is simply not done for this. <br><br>  Bumburum complained that carrying a laptop is uncomfortable: heavy and big.  But it seems to me that he does not need to be dragged, and it will not be much to bring a lot from the owner to the car (on a trip to the country house). <br>  On the <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/vn-aw-series/vgn-aw3xry-q">official website of Sony,</a> this laptop is already sold for 150,000 rubles.  So, 100,000 is not the biggest price for such a device. <br><br>  Anticipating the questions ‚ÄúWhy is it so expensive?‚Äù I will give an estimate ‚Äúby eye‚Äù for the components: <br><br>  18 "LCD monitor with LED backlight - no less than 15,000 rubles (master card on the card); <br>  two SSDs of 64 GB each - in the amount of about 16,000 rubles; <br>  motherboard with a bunch of ports - we put 5000 rubles; <br>  Hard - 2500 rubles; <br>  case, touchpad, keyboard - 15,000 rubles; <br>  Blur combo - about 15,000 rubles; <br>  any patents, assembly, staff salary, etc.  bring the cost to our 93,000 rubles. <br><br>  Well, and do not forget: the thrill of owning a VAIO is priceless!  )) <br><br>  In short, the VAIO VGN-AW2XRY / Q is clearly a niche solution, designed primarily for those who work with graphics and video.  In this regard, it is clear why in the laptop there is no mouse \ cover \ rags \ here this wonderful curse - creative people will connect their instrument to it, and will not use the complete delivery.  So why increase the value of an already expensive beech? <br><br>  Sony itself is positioning the laptop as a multimedia and gaming, but this is most likely marketing: a TV tuner, a 2.1 sound, a remote in the set - all this will be rather a pleasant bonus. <br><br>  PS Everything written above is just my opinion, which consists of two days off using this laptop.  It does not claim to be complete or objective. <br>  Feelings from working with this laptop other people may be different! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73600/</a></p>
