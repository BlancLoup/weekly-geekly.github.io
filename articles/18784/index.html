      In general, I recently decided to pay attention to the paid services of Skype. <br>  The text turned out to be similar to an advertisement, but this is probably how it should be :) <br><br>  <strong>Skype is not only free calls between computers:</strong> <br>  About Skype, from the beginning of its appearance, talked a lot.  But, each time the topic began the same way: ‚ÄúSkype - free calls between computers!‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkype - communicate with the whole world for free (via computer)‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalls from Skype to Skype for free.‚Äù  Then, somewhere at the end of the enumeration of all the merits, some other mythical "paid features" were mentioned.  Without any details.  It seems like ‚Äúnot paying for us‚Äù, but in vain! <br>  Do you have many (or not so) friends in all cities of Russia or the CIS, or, what is it that there is little things, literally all over the world?  I would like to talk with them and discuss a lot, but prices are ruthless for traditional operators?  So Skype should be your main assistant in the desire to contact them at least every day, as if they lived in your city.  Across Russia calls to mobile phones cost 0,071 dollars!  Yes, this is not a mistake, 7 cents (about 1.7 rubles at the rate of 24 / per dollar)!  Throughout Russia, regardless of where and where you dial the number.  On HOME phones in Moscow and St. Petersburg (from Moscow to St. Petersburg, and from St. Petersburg to Moscow too), and in general, only 2 cents (not yet tested, but to other cities as much)!  I, sitting at a computer in Moscow, can call the city friends in St. Petersburg at a bargain price (about 48 kopecks per minute). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/kajournal/view/36682/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/13/kajournal.1/0_8f4a_12980125_L.jpg" width="257" height="500"></a> <br><br>  Now, tell me, how much does it cost, if you recruit from home to home?  What kind of MGTS and other champions are there?  Exactly!  Same thing with a mobile phone.  Calling from computer to mobile all over Russia is cheaper than from mobile to mobile for me in Moscow.  From Skype called on mobile in Nizhny Novgorod.  Excellent call quality.  And it is at prices cheaper than local. <br>  Gaining Lithuania.  Cost per local mobile 0.191.  What is translated into rubles, about 4.5 wood.  Even in this case, less than the roaming of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù of Russian operators in Russia (Russian operators in Roaming in Russia are about 9 rubles per minute)!  And, all the more so, than a call to Lithuania at the price of 50 rubles per minute (!) From this ‚Äúbig three‚Äù! <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/kajournal/view/36681/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/14/kajournal.1/0_8f49_1fd0719e_L.jpg" width="300" height="129"></a> <br><br>  All prices can be found here <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en/prices/callrates/%3Fcurrency%3DUSD">www.skype.com/intl/en/prices/callrates/?currency=USD#listing-R</a> <br>  Be careful, the default is a Skype account in Euro.  Here in dollars.  Switches the list currency at the top of the page, the currency of calculations in your Scap account. <br><br>  <strong>Conferences:</strong> <br>  But that's not all!  Skype has a conference feature. <br>  ‚ÄúTeleconference is an event in which group communication is carried out between geographically distributed participants using teleconferencing technology.‚Äù <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/kajournal/view/36680/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/14/kajournal.1/0_8f48_7c5bd90a_L.jpg" width="500" height="451"></a> <br><br>  Participate in conferences can any subscribers: Skype, city or mobile.  In any combination and up to 25 people at a time.  For example, it is easy to connect two Skype, and then one of them will attach a mobile phone from anywhere in the world to the conversation.  Well, or urban.  Or two mobile, one city and ten skype.  Or maybe 10 urban, 15 mobile and 8 skype? <br><br>  <strong>Payment:</strong> <br>  Now that is and how to pay.  We need to pay SkypeOut. <br>  ‚ÄúSkypeOut is the ability to call public network numbers in Skype.  In order to take advantage of this offer, you need to replenish your account. " <br><br>  This can be done on the official website of the program: <a href="https://secure.skype.com/store/member/login.html">secure.skype.com/store/member/login.html</a> <br><br>  Or directly through the interface in the Skype program itself. <br><br>  Payment by credit card from Russia has some limitations.  Unfortunately, Skype accepts only cards issued by reputable Russian banks known in the West.  They didn‚Äôt accept me (: Try it, if the second time (well, maybe what‚Äôs wrong with the first one) won‚Äôt work out, it means they won't accept credit cards. <br><br>  But there is a way out.  I ‚Äúattached‚Äù my credit card to the PayPal payment system account <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">www.paypal.com</a> - A way for those who are able to understand the English (Spanish, French) service. <br><br>  For everyone else, I can advise "native" Yandex.Money <a href="">money.yandex.ru/shop.xml?scid=1214 making</a> payments for Skype. <br><br>  With the settings of your Skype account, you can choose in which currency you prefer to see your account dollars, euros, something else (By default, in euros, I made for myself in dollars. There are other options). <br><br>  <strong>SMS:</strong> <br>  All the advantages can be attributed to the ability to write SMS.  They cost 0.066 cents.  As the sender's number, your login will be listed (the one that is used to log in with Skype, not the Skype username).  Therefore, I advise you to think during registration - it is much more convenient when people immediately, without further explanation from someone SMS, will understand who wrote to them.  For example, the login ‚Äúvanya.ivanov‚Äù will be displayed on the mobile screen as ‚Äúvanya ivanov‚Äù (without any extra characters).  Differences from free sms in the common Agent.mail.ru is a message about the delivery status, and a more serious approach to business (I have some SMS from the Agent delivered in 2 hours after sending, although no ‚Äúbarriers‚Äù, like ‚Äúthe subscriber is not a subscriber "Was not), and there are no restrictions on the frequency of sending.  But for the money :) <br><br>  <strong>System requirements:</strong> <br>  For calls, the Internet speed is more than 128kbps. <br>  Headset or a simple microphone for a computer (costs from 50 rubles in Moscow). <br><br>  <strong>Related Links:</strong> <br>  Skype site: <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/ru/">www.skype.com/intl/ru</a> <br>  Price for calls to the world from anywhere in the world in dollars, the mark on the letter R: <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en/prices/callrates/%3Fcurrency%3DUSD">www.skype.com/intl/en/prices/callrates/?currency=USD#listing-R</a> <br>  Skype FAQ in Russian - <a href="http://www.skypeclub.ru/skype_faq.htm">www.skypeclub.ru/skype_faq.htm</a> <br>  The official Skype forum, the Russian section - <a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D155">forum.skype.com/index.php?showforum=155</a> <br>  Yandex.Money Skype payment - <a href="">money.yandex.ru/shop.xml?scid=1214</a> <br><br>  <strong>PS:</strong> <br>  I will end up with the fact that in Skype there are free calls all over the world from Skype to Skype, not just calls, but also conferences;  video calls for webcam owners;  Well, chat, as in the usual ICQ, with the ability to combine more than two users (that is, group chat). <br><br>  <strong>PPS:</strong> <br>  there is also SkypeIN, but for Russia it was not made. <br>  " <em><strong>SkypeIn</strong></em> - a new additional service for users of the program Skype, which opens up completely new opportunities! <br><br>  SkypeIn is an alternative to SkypeOut - the subscriber of this service rents a phone number to which people can call the Skype subscriber from any phone. <br><br>  For example, if you have friends in Chicago, you can choose a SkypeIn-number with the code of this city, and they will be able to call you on Skype as a local phone, no matter where you are! <br><br>  Of course, people from other countries who call your SkypeIn-US number will pay for an international call to the United States. <br><br>  <em>There are only 2 types of calls in the Skype communication system: ‚Äúlocal‚Äù - PC-to-PC;</em>  <em>and international: PC-telephone and telephone-RS</em> <br><br>  This service allows you to maintain contact with your friends who do not use the Internet, or simply to save their expenses on telephone calls. <br><br>  Now it is possible to get up to 10 SkypeIn-numbers for one Skype-account, and you can choose them in different countries.  At the same time, the subscription is paid for each registered number. <br><br>  Currently available rooms in the following countries: <br>  <strong>Australia, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, China (Hong Kong), Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.</strong>  " <br><br>  <a href="http://kajournal.com/2008/01/15/alle-vsya-rossiya-eto-skype/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18784/</a></p>
