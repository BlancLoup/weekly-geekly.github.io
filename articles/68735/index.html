Friday, all the same;) <br>  I invite all those who are not indifferent to the empires of evil, Google, apples and other joys of masters, to discuss the topic. <br>  After all, why do they love holivarit?  Because they have nothing to do! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, everyone should go about their business.  Trite, right?  But more about that later. <br><br>  Let's roughly imagine the average inhabitant of Habr ... <br>  This is of such indeterminate age a person, rather young than old, lives mostly in the capital of our vast country, namely Moscow, and he is more than 50% male ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/people/">see</a> if you do not believe). <br>  Why is this comrade so remarkable?  Yes, nothing in general.  Simply, he is one of us, so he attracts us and pushes us away.  He has his own interests and opinions.  He likes to read DIY or DIY, IT biographies, about programming, about business, and about new gadgets.  Well, while reading, he puts the kamenty, expresses his opinion, usually the only true one, trying to rationalize other non-profitable comrades.  And so they love to argue, do not agree. <br>  And now, as promised, for all the trolls and holivarschikov (not to deceive the same!) A portion of joy.  What are we arguing about?  The last thing I remember, I will list ... <br><br><h3>  How Windows Hates Linux </h3>  And how does your b-gothic OEM - lawlessness.  Well what can I say?  The enemies of humanity are straight, these melkomyagkie.  They impose their ugly windows on people when there is such a wonderful Linux (by the way, which one?) - this is a crime against humanity, and they even take money!  Scoundrels!

    <h3>  Apple Pro </h3>  What to talk about them?  They have a bitten apple too ... They don‚Äôt respect their users, devoted sectarians, they sell the paid updates!  Pretend to know that we all need ... Cheating.  Novikov told me that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/67242/">archiving with encryption through the ass works for them</a> , so sectarians attacked him, cursed him ... But what would you get from them?  They're not on their own, this is their cunning Rogue deceived.  And deceived me.  Previously, just Leopard was, said the new Snow will.  I downloaded, set, there is no snow.  ; ( <br><br><h3>  About Google </h3>  They are, of course, notorious villains.  Here it can not be said.  They photographed all the land with their companions, they read our mail, you can't hide from them anywhere.  But on the other hand, many new things were invented, the office is virtual, some waves and Android.  Not everything is clear ... <br>  Even the design of the main patented.  ya.ru with only two buttons ... Vsezh, villains. <br><br><h3>  Pro linux </h3>  Well, these are beautiful.  And the penguins are not offended, and for the benefit of the people a free OS is created.  As you look at it, it‚Äôs so clear at once that the Windows are living out their last days.  And the seventh, too, do not interrupt.  And in general, nothing more progressive than Linuha has yet been invented.  On Windows, viruses and slows down everything, on a poppy - only those show off, with their guevy interface.  Everyone can poke a mouse, but the truest gurus in the console work, again, the Xs have fallen ... There is no firewood, so who bothers to write?  Sit down and write yourself drivers, since the new VAIO bought it!  Got on fire! <br><br><h3>  About habr </h3>  No longer a cake!  How many times to repeat something?  That was earlier and the grass was greener ... And users are smarter and younger girls ... <br><br>  They laughed and that's enough.  And so our average habrazhitel lives ... <br>  There is not enough money for a poppy, Windows is constantly falling, you need to add linux ... Also, you should pay for the programs ?!  Eka Nevidal ... We'll sit down for half a year, we'll write ours, for the console!  And hence the eyes are red, stress and other life bonuses in front of the monitor. <br><br>  I once wrote about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosx/54241/">prog, which helps to clean the screw on the poppy</a> .  A simple and understandable thing, if in a nutshell.  But knowledgeable people in kamentah immediately told me that it was shit, and I had to write something in the console. <br>  But the problem is not this, it is only a symptom.  And the essence of the problem is that these people need something to take time.  After all, when the system is up and running, they have nothing more to do.  And this only means that they simply do not know what to do. <br>  You know how much that others can not?  Make a simple and understandable thing that other people can use.  Believe me, if this is useful to someone, thanks are provided to you.  Including material. <br><br>  And what to do?  What business?  Where to get it?  Here we come to the main thing. <br><br><h1>  How to find "your business"? </h1>  Yes, very simple.  Ask yourself and answer honestly a few questions: <br>  <strong>What do you like to do?</strong> <br>  Here I mean just some kind of activity to which you can devote a free day or evening only because you like it.  For example, draw, program, make cakes, collect Linux, drink beer, read / write and so on ... <br>  <strong>How useful is it for society?</strong> <br>  This question is exactly what is changing in the world from what you are doing.  Does it make anyone better or worse, are there people who like what you do, how many are there?  What do you find most useful for the community that you love to do?  If you like to take pictures, drink beer and sing, which of these is most valuable to the public according to the reviews? <br>  <strong>Why don't you do this?</strong> <br>  Why don't you give it enough time?  What is stopping you, instead of drinking beer and conducting a regular holivar, for example, offering all your friends to take a picture of them and process the pictures well? <br>  <strong>Do you want to do something useful for the people around you?</strong> <br>  This question, I hope, is so clear.  If instead of writing an article you dispatch someone else's, think about it and try to answer all the questions again.  And so on until you find at least one talent that will be appreciated by those whose opinion you care about. <br>  <strong>Do you care about people at all and you never turn off hate mode?</strong> <br>  Sit at home, take a walk, think about the eternal.  If you don‚Äôt think of anything, kill yourself against the wall.  So you cleanse this worthless world of such a beautiful self.  Let them cry and bite your elbows. <br><br><h3>  About alcohol in general and beer in particular </h3>  It so happened that the majority of those to whom I appeal, do not deny myself (What is this? I have the right!) In a bottle or two in the evening, after work, or during the day, or remember poorly when the last time was sober.  The main motives are to relax after a hard day's work (and why was it necessary to strain?), Just love a drink, or it allows you to communicate with your fellow people, so to speak, it makes you communicate. <br>  Or just want to disconnect and forget about all the hardships?  So it is because your picture of the world is not too coincides with reality! <br>  Try to accept the world as it is.  Think about why.  Perhaps the conclusions will be disappointing, but this is not the world so bad, it is your expectations do not correspond to reality. <br>  Try not to drink at all for a couple of months.  Do not drink anything.  This is not difficult, and as a result you will perceive the world more adequately and there will be more time to think ... New thoughts, new desires, new interests will appear, and most likely you will not want to drink again. <br><br><h3>  About work </h3>  Many go to work that they don‚Äôt like.  Or just do something just to make money.  Most likely this is the vast majority.  I do not call you to quit right away. <br>  Try to start doing ‚Äúyour own business‚Äù, which you found if you thought about it and answered the questions that were higher.  Do it in your free time, and you definitely have it, if you have thrown out of your life some destructive activities that take time and alcohol. <br>  Sooner or later, it will bear fruit, and you can safely quit or change the scope of activities for the one that will bring you joy and money, and not just money. <br><br><h3>  About money </h3>  Money is evil.  But not in the sense in which everyone understands this phrase.  It is evil, as a system of exchange of values.  She is too expensive.  In the sense that it is wrong in terms of energy conservation.  With each act of converting commodity-money-commodity-money, their number decreases.  And in theory, it should not.  Some go to taxes, some to interest on loans, and some are simply absorbed by inflation.  It does not change.  The very nature of money is like that. <br>  To deal with this inexpressibly easy.  Try to use less and less.  How?  Give up on them.  Do something for free.  And the more the better.  You can do something, do it.  If you are asked for something - do not immediately poke into the price.  Just do it.  This way you can satisfy someone‚Äôs need, bring joy to someone, or solve a problem.  And most importantly, while you can do what you like to do. <br><br><h3>  About taxes </h3> Taxes - a parasite on the body of a business that feeds on its blood - money.  All this is covered with good goals and wrapped in the cover of care for the vulnerable segments of the population.  Who are these people?  Why should we care about them?  Why are there so many of them?  And, most importantly, how much better for them is that we give them a sufficiently large part of the values ‚Äã‚Äãwe have created? <br><br>  Someone will remember in kamentah about pensioners.  It is those who are alone.  Why do not their own children care about them?  Do not want?  So it was not necessary to be assholes, while there was an opportunity to not be them.  Can not?  So why didn‚Äôt they teach children how to provide themselves so that they would be enough to help their parents?  No children?  So all the more, it only shows that no one in life wanted to live with them and have children, or worse, they did not want to. <br>  Most of them live in their own apartments (I mean Moscow), and may well take it.  Wishing to take off - the sea!  If one lonely pensioner moves to a neighbor, just as lonely, then the amount they get for two from renting a free apartment will be much more than the amount of their pensions.  They do not want to think about it?  Hate the rest of the people?  Straight road to them in the crematorium and guaranteed oblivion. <br><br><h3>  About the state </h3>  The state, in my opinion, is only a system that allows most people to live, while remaining full of assholes.  It is she who sets taxes and supports assholes.  What for?  So it consists of them.  From the very bottom to the very top.  Want to be a sponsor for them - pay all taxes and declare all your income!  And most importantly, always use money. <br><br><h3>  What to do? </h3>  Start with yourself.  Do not drink on these, and maybe not only this weekend.  Think about how you live, what you want, what you strive for.  Make a few good deeds, set your friend's Windows, draw a postcard to a friend for his birthday, photograph someone, if you have something, but write a song!  If only the joy brought, and you and others!  Have a great weekend! <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68735/</a></p>
