We have reviewed <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/ekspertno-analiticheskii-otchet-o-sovremennom-sostoyanii-mirovogo-rinka-robototehniki">many reports</a> for 2015.  The reports that we have chosen for you cover a wide range of segments, as well as the industry as a whole. <br><br>  These reports are costly, but often represent value only to venture capitalists, companies and their technical and marketing research departments, as well as academia.  Many reports overlap, and their forecasts often differ.  But the conclusion is the same: they all <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/rinok-promishlennoi-avtomatizacii-i-robototehniki-virastet-do-1477-milliardov-v-2019-godu">predict positive growth</a> for most segments of the robotics industry.

In the context of these subsystems of the agricultural industry, the following companies are considered in the report: DeLaval, Lely, Yamaha, BouMatic Robotics, Fullwood Automation and several others. <br><br><br>  <strong><em><a href="http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/global-and-china-industrial-robot-speed-reducer-industry-report-2013-2016-market-report.html">Gearbox market for industrial robotics</a> ,</em></strong> <br><br>  <strong><em>June 27, 2014, reissued in August 2015, 58 pages, Research in China.</em></strong> <br>  This is an important category.  One third of the robot components are represented in this market, which was captured by Japanese manufacturers Nabtesco, Harmonic Drive and Sumitomo.  China is taking a step toward producing these necessary components domestically, and therefore is interested in its new producers. Shaanxi Qinchuan Machinery Development Co., Ltd., Nantong Zhenkang Machinery Co., Ltd.  and Shuaike Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd.  The report provides a forecast of a doubling of Chinese production by 2016. <br><br><h3><br>  PRIMARY RESOURCE </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d9/4ab/24d/8d94ab24d7588b5ff453f1a7dd6551f2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And finally, the main resource and backbone for most of these research reports is the annual ‚ÄúWorld Report on Industrial and Service Robotics‚Äù, compiled by the International Federation of Robotics.  This is the official summing up of all associations of robotics around the world.  Reports for 2015 covering the activities for 2014 are available now. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369011/</a></p>
