  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the book by Tom DeMarco: ‚ÄúDeadline. A novel about project management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The project management handbook in the genre wrapper of a spy detective story came into my hands not by chance: Earlier, I was introduced to the works of H. Reinwater <a href="http://inostudio.com/ru/article/kak-pasti-kotov.html">‚ÄúHow to feed cats‚Äù</a> about managing a team of programmers.  Getting to the taste of writing reviews, I decided to share my opinion on the work of DeMarco. <br><br>  Oddly enough, this book should be considered primarily from the point of view of philosophy.  The main criteria here, of course, are form and content.  The shape is not ideal: the style is lame in both legs.  From the strained deliberate conversations sometimes want to cry.  The content, in turn, is extremely exciting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDeadline‚Äù is a kind of parody of the adventures of James Bond.  In other words, this is such a story about a ‚Äúhitcher‚Äù, only told not in the scenery of another planet, but in the world of information technologies of a planet similar to ours.  In general, a book illustrating the dreams of a project manager.  After reading it will be difficult to take on any other book on project management - it will inevitably seem boring.

      It is important to note here that DeMarco‚Äôs books are really well written.  They are easy to read, and after reading them, I immediately want to be snapped up for quotes.  In Deadline, among other things, there is still a lot of irony and subtle humor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Free, at first glance, the plot is actually worked out in detail.  The book in a game manner summarizes many years of research experience.  In the course of the narrative, DeMarko generously shares the found patterns, reveals numerous secrets, and does not detract from the soul about upcoming difficulties.  The author emphasizes that software development is always research.  I tried, analyzed, made conclusions.  No other way. <br><br>  Few people can explain complex things in simple language, but the author differs from others like him.  Thanks to the naive charm of the book, DeMarko manages to make the reader fall in love with the profession.  Watch your hands.  Here is the scheme, here is the diagram, and here you cannot live without developing software. <br><br>  <b>Who and why to read?</b> <br><br>  This book should be read to those who are already naughty from the work of a project manager.  Especially those from whom the work made the cynic.  Such people, when they take up a regular management textbook, think: ‚ÄúWell, again, this bubble is about resources and risks.‚Äù  About the "Deadline" can not be said.  He is funny, that's true. <br><br>  <b>Quote</b> <br><br>  "Basics of common sense: <br>  1. The project should have two deadlines - planned and desired. <br>  2. These terms should be different. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294090/</a></p>
