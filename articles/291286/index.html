      Freelance service for linguists and their clients <a href="http://2polyglot.com/ur/1781">2Polyglot</a> was also announced among the contestants.  The project was presented by its founder and director, director of SVAM-Systems, Andrei Prudko.  Six minutes stood out for the entire presentation of the startup: 3 minutes directly for the project description and 3 minutes for questions from experts and guests.  Of course, in such a short time it is impossible to convey to the public absolutely all the nuances and peculiarities of the project.  During the speech, Andrew tried to reveal the essence of the exchange as much as possible, to identify the nuances of its functioning and the details of its use. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTecsWKDiAs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1WtGhE3xI0estpokJwDTs9awKUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The winner was chosen, on the one hand, by the expert committee, and, on the other hand, by the audience.  According to the results of voting of these two groups, a summary rating was compiled, in which the linguistic exchange ‚ÄúPolyglot‚Äù took the 3rd place (1st among IT projects).  The winner was a ceramic energy-saving double-action eco panel with a healing effect.  The developers of the winning project will present it in the final annual IBE, as a result of which they can receive investment proposals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cc/cfb/ae5/5cccfbae57b640d5af229dd7fd40220f.jpg"><br><br>  Most experts became interested in ‚ÄúPolyglot‚Äù, so they received interesting ideas about the future directions of the project and constructive criticism, forcing us to look for ways to solve pressing problems of a startup.  Guided by the feedback and advice received, the developers of Polyglot will improve the exchange for linguists so that its use becomes more comfortable and interesting. <br><br>  We can say that "the first pancake did not come out lumpy."  Participation in the IBE confirmed the expediency and need for further development of a startup.  The Polyglot team is on the right track, which will ultimately lead it to success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291286/</a></p>
