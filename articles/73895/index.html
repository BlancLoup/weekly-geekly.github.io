      Before, I never betrayed much attention to such a technique and, accordingly, I was not interested in it at all - I didn‚Äôt have time to watch TV (and now I don‚Äôt have much), and student life didn‚Äôt contribute at all to the development in this direction, much less to shopping.  In addition to the hardware component, there was no normal Internet to download any movies in quality, and in LAN there was continuous chaos ... in general, the meaning of words like hdtv, hdmi, fullhd and other mkv I learned, perhaps, the last) With the end of uni a bit more free - it's time to deservedly enjoy life (sleep, eat off, rest) and I decided to start catching up.  And the hobby for glands began to demand more or less this or that device in the form of a ‚Äútest stand‚Äù - the same Popcorn had to be tested on an old TV with 4: 3 sides, which is quite frivolous.  Having a little undermined gold coins, I decided. <br><br>  Next - some tips that may be useful to those who decide on a black deed) You can absolutely not listen to the choice of components, and proceed only from their needs and capabilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/368/aa5/f0f/368aa5f0f92a9e2f8203dd8f7db70dd8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the key points in such a system is a device for displaying images.  Options, as far as I know, are not so many of the available - the projector and TV.  With the first, to be honest, I came across quite a bit and really have nothing to say.  Let me just say that the projector is preferable if you just have an extremely large room, in most other cases, IMHO, it does not ‚Äúdiscourage‚Äù itself.  Televisions are more familiar - everyone has them, someone has not even one or two.  So we will build on them. <br><br>  So, the first thing to do when creating a cinema (we will call all this ugliness like this) is to decide on the tasks that will be performed on it.  Naturally, the main task will be watching movies, but you can, for example, play on a large diagonal, or listen to music.  Accordingly, in the first step you need to think about where this very TV will be.  There are two options again - to put somewhere or to hang on the wall (hmm, I haven‚Äôt yet seen televisions hanging in the middle of the room).  And if there are not so many nuances with ‚Äúput‚Äù, then there are some pitfalls with ‚Äúhang‚Äù, about which a bit later. <br>  If you are going to watch only movies, then both options are equally suitable, but if you are going to play, you need to plan the placement in advance so that the computer can be easily connected to the TV (respectively, there should be additional space for the computer and sufficient wire length for connection), and just comfortable to stay with him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13f/bdd/1d0/13fbdd1d0c396e6e3c12f3c16ced0b49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next point is the screen size.  Here we must proceed from its material possibilities and from the size of the room.  If bills allow you to buy any diagonal, but the room is small at the same time - you can ‚Äúbe greedy‚Äù and get as a result not the most pleasant feelings when viewing a large image from close range.  When I was studying at the institute, we were given some kind of correlation on lighting to calculate the maximum ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù screen for a human eye (where distance, angle of view of the eye and other nuances were taken into account), but I didn‚Äôt find these records.  In general, the main thing in this is not to overdo it.  As an option - you can come to the hardware store and look for a while at a particular screen from different distances. <br>  Returning to the tasks, you need to decide what will be used as a signal source.  It will be just a TV antenna, a Blu-ray player, or a server from the closet ‚Äî everyone decides for himself, but this cannot be overlooked. <br><br>  So, having estimated all this on paper, I began to act.  At my disposal was a part of a room 3.7 meters long (from wall to wall), on one side of which there is a sofa.  Opposite him stands a self-made two-story bed (the pride of childhood, which cannot be thrown out yet, because a lot of everything is stored on it), under which it was decided to make a cozy nest. <br>  Actually, I was limited in space by this particular bed - at my disposal 2 meters in width.  Since I didn‚Äôt want to see anything else under it, I tried to occupy all the space as much as possible. <br><br>  As a TV, I looked at the <b>BBK <a href="http://bbk.ru/products/lcd_tv/LT4710HD/"><b>LT4710HD</b></a></b> - the TV with the largest diagonal (119 cm) of the Bobics.  Despite the fact that many look at this company with a charity, I have often recommended myself well and I treat it quite calmly) The device is about 120 cm long - there is enough space for everything else.  Initially I looked at one more model from them - the <b><a href="http://bbk.ru/products/lcd_tv/LT4222HDL/">LT4222HDL</a></b> with LED-backlit and two USB ports (where you can insert a USB flash drive and watch everything directly from it is very convenient).  But it is smaller (42 ") and much more expensive.  As a result, sizes have received greater priority for a number of reasons.  There were other applicants, almost from all companies - <b>Panasonic</b> , <b><a href="http://www.cinema.philips.com/%3Fls%3Dru_ru%26origin%3D1_ru_ru_cinema_yandex">Philips</a></b> (check out the video), <b>SONY</b> , <b>LG</b> and <b>SAMSUNG</b> - perhaps these are the largest representatives of this category.  But the prices for a similar diagonal there differ significantly (It seems that it was decided and began to wool the Internet. A little later I ordered delivery, which resulted in a little less than 40k. Advice - don‚Äôt refuse delivery if it costs within the bounds of decency) %, and in the car such boxes, too, is far from each fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31a/9ad/2bb/31a9ad2bb1e94c3d9261bdcb1e7cfb41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I met the first pitfall when I started ‚Äútrying on‚Äù the future TV on the wall - it‚Äôs still great if the child has an extra two square meters to crawl into the cramped room.  However, the weight of the TV set I chose was neither more nor less than 49kg.  Throwing a net for suitable fasteners, I was a little upset - a rare piece of iron could withstand such a load (here I looked around once more with models with a smaller diagonal - they are much lighter, and some of them had a bracket).  And if something and withstand, the price did not please.  By the way, the <b><a href="http://ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/language/ru-RU/default.aspx%3FFID%3D28,27">Ergotron</a></b> website can be a pleasant reference for the reader - one of the leading companies in the field of technology mounts (but prices are a little away from the competition).  Well, or a more visual site - <b><a href="http://www.3dnw.ru/">3DNW</a></b> .  Almost all devices (TVs, monitors, tablets like Wacom Cintiq) have the ability to mount according to the <b>VESA</b> standard.  But in the case of telephones and monitors - pay attention that the stand is removable and does not interfere with the installation) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/cfa/021/694/cfa021694113818d4c250b1fa0ab14f2.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, I scored with a mount (if such a plate crashes, it will be great in general) and went the other way - setting it on the table.  At first I turned to my wife (she is tied to me in furniture) with a request to make a table-curbstone to order.  However, even here the weight of the TV played a cruel joke (well, yes, I didn‚Äôt even think about it ... and all the big diagonals weigh in an adult way) - the tabletop of the length I need (120cm) should be thick and strong, and this is either an array or glued Chipboards with additional supports.  When I found out the prices for an array, even at dealer prices, the desire immediately fell.  The second option turned out to be more affordable, but it took time to manufacture - cutting and gluing sheets, edge stickers, etc. <br>  The problem was solved by itself when I arrived at IKEA) Yes, yes, the one that many people also do not like.  There I caught the eye of a wonderful <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/products/00105323">table</a> (just about how I painted, only lower) at a more than affordable price.  Just a thick tabletop (two glued sheets of chipboard 25mm each, with an edge), metal supports that I needed, dimensions and colors that I needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/373/997/1e0/3739971e01259851e260ffbe9f808413.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The final choice fell on him after reading the documentation - the possibility of existence at the required load.  So he took without hesitation.  Additionally, I bought sticky ‚Äúpaws‚Äù for sharp corners for a child, because they were worth a penny. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00a/e97/c05/00ae97c05fe588722be548388506de44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, it remains to determine the acoustics.  I had a good 5.1 <b>Microlab H500 system</b> , but it didn‚Äôt fit me to the system being created because of the subwoofer (in the form of a sufficiently large cube).  I just had nowhere to put it, because  I limited myself to the height of the purchased table.  The search for a decent system with a subwoofer, which would fit in size, was not particularly crowned with success. <br>  As a result, I ventured and took an interesting bundle from <b>TopDevice</b> (I heard a lot about this company and for the first time I decided to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to their numerous products at HIT 2008 in St. Petersburg, where they had a huge stand), namely the <b><a href="http://www.topdevice.ru/catalogue/zoom.jsp%3Fid%3D160">TDE 500</a></b> .  I would like to dwell on it in more detail, for it is quite new and very rare of its kind.  Of the two colors available, I chose a dark one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9a/a8c/3ef/f9aa8c3efc9857691f4c6b6cfc947547.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing that attracted me to this particular set is that it is 5.0, i.e.  without a separate subwoofer.  The manufacturer promised bass from two columns-towers, and I must admit, I did not deceive) The second is the active system, i.e.  There will be no expense item called "amplifier".  The system consists of two ‚Äútowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãof meter height (one of which is the main one) and three columns (center and rear). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2b/48d/e4c/f2b48de4c5eeaaa002b31bf31617a8ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The total output power is <b>210</b> W (subwoofers in the front speakers are 30Wx2, the center is 20W, the front is 45Wx2, the rear is 20Wx2.), Which is enough for my space and neighbors.  The tambourines are loud and very high quality, the bass are also very popular (they are especially noticeable when listening to music, for example, such ‚Äúmeat‚Äù as the Black Sun Empire or, The Qemists or Pendulum). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f2/f11/32d/9f2f1132d97cfc3ff3359be1d513caf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Yandex, they write that the material is wood, but it seems to be pasted over chipboard.  Nevertheless (at least for my ears) - it did not suffer at all because of this, there are absolutely no complaints about him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87c/60f/258/87c60f258956182f0702c59cff8f0367.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When watching movies, the columns also show themselves well - I‚Äôve already watched (which I didn‚Äôt have time to do in the movies) the last ice age in excellent quality, as well as reviewed all three pirates of the Caribbean - it turns out these are masterpieces) <br><br>  Find a couple of hours of time with a child is quite difficult.  Mock me, but I had to watch a movie a couple of times ... through headphones) while I was sleeping a little.  So the long wire (3 meters) with minijacks and the Y-shaped splitter turned out to be a useful bonus for them - to connect two headphones.  Everything, as in the song "Romance" of the group Caste) <br><br>  <i>I have a very simple adapter,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So that in one jack two headphones instead of one.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Very useful for a laptop, if not enough sound.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Imagine: Me and my girlfriend.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On a summer night on the sea, comets fly across the sky,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We have a bottle of delicate something.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Noise waves, a laptop on his lap -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The volume is full, and you can hear it barely.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So I'll turn on the two headphones in the adapter,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And we will see the movie amicably through them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And without this little thing about the laptop - as there was never,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And without a laptop - the last century, romance is not enough.</i> <br><br>  Included was a simple remote control, stands for the towers, as well as all the necessary cables and wires (with a good margin).  On the front side of one of the towers are functional elements - an infrared receiver, buttons for volume control, mode and sound source, as well as two 6.3mm sockets for microphones.  It is possible to connect karaoke - many people like to indulge in this sinful affair) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/6f9/14a/a296f914a736cb217218a7f98339e345.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Individual attention deserves the appearance - in this case, he played no small role in the selection.  The positive price also had a positive effect - about <b>7,000</b> rubles. <br><br>  Running a little ahead - after buying the acoustics, I had to re-drive into Ikea to buy a hinged <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/products/00151310">shelf</a> , which perfectly harmonized with the table (I would even say they are from the same series).  After installing it was the front column and something else. <br><br>  I will not tell a lot about TV (everything is detailed on the website) - I will only say that he draws a picture more than worthy (for its price).  It uses a new on-screen menu - very convenient.  More precisely, it is more correct to say that it has become convenient with the joystick that is present on the remote control - with it you can get into any settings with a couple of clicks.  I also liked the console - it was made of plastic, soft-touch and aluminum;  backlit around the joystick when the buttons are pressed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f5/e4f/0cf/3f5e4f0cf0a9ac4b1d2af125b05f6608.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  TV from the eyes at about three meters away - when you watch your eyes do not get tired.  From the usual antenna, the self-search of the TV found about 40 channels, but sometimes I just hate cable TV for the nonsense that they are doing there. <br>  As an additional signal source, I chose Popcorn (from the same BBK, hahah), a review of which I already did (already in two parts - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66460/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66655/">2</a> ).  I connected it via a bundled HDMI cable, and to popcorn, a double terabyte external Verbatim (the review was the same) - I put it all on the shelf.  I think this volume is enough for me for a long time.  On verbatime, while FAT32 and no "serious" films, so while there are only all sorts of good old cartoons for the baby, movies in portions of 700 MB and other digitization. <br><br>  I almost forgot - to all this was added a simple UPS <b><a href="">APC BK500-RS</a></b> , which did not affect the resulting appearance.  I have already managed to make sure that it works, so I am calm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fce/f7c/bf2/fcef7cbf28216950db3ffd59cfd43001.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Result </h2><br>  As a result, I received a universal (omnivorous) and highly functional system, where you can: <br><br>  - Watch cable TV <br>  - Watch movies from external drives <br>  - Listen to music from external drives and devices, and watch photos from them <br>  - Climb online popcorn services (games, podcasts, radio, YouTube, etc.) <br>  - Easy to interact with computer data (over the network) <br>  - Play <br><br>  Those.  Guests came for example - they included pre-selected photos for a slideshow on a large ‚Äúphoto frame‚Äù or simply beautiful pictures from an Internet.  See a wedding or a movie?  No need to dig in the disks - clicked the remote control and that's it.  Download the new House series?  Without getting up from the couch ... <br>  Consumption ... yes, perhaps it will decently burn here, if you add up ... but, I think, anything less than the same SLI of two modern video cards) There's no way out of this item of expenditure. <br><br>  I am very pleased with the quality of pictures and sound.  At least, it is comparable to what it was before - just heaven and earth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/355/0e7/848/3550e7848119b9e2c13799226fc27ea7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Estimate </h2><br>  - LCD TV BBK LT4710HD - <b>38000</b> <br>  - PopcornTV NP101S HD Player with 500GB Disc - <b>8000</b> <br>  - Acoustic system TopDevice TDE500 - <b>7500</b> <br>  - Verbatim 2Tb external storage - <b>9000</b> <br>  - APC BK500-RS uninterruptible power supply unit - <b>2500</b> <br>  - Table + shelf - <b>3500</b> <br><br>  Total slightly less than 70,000 for a completely new system, although by and large, except for the external drive and media player - all 50. You can and still save by taking a smaller diagonal and using the old speakers, but then more I would like something new) Well, if you build a game yourself, you can achieve much more functionality. <br><br>  For comparison, Philips alone with MB Light with the same diagonal would be about twice as expensive as the entire set.  But what to argue, he is really cool;) In the future, in addition to popcorn, I plan to move my media center under the table (I‚Äôm still working for him; there was a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/51228/">review</a> ) so that you can fully climb an Internet using a more familiar operating system;) <br><br>  In general, the first "sexual experience" was not easy and even a little tired. From it I made the following conclusions: <br><br>  <b>1</b> .  The most important thing is not to hurry, so that later it will not be too late to bite your elbows. <br>  <b>2</b>  In advance, you need to think over everything - tasks, device models, delivery, installation, wiring, security - everything is all. <br>  <b>3</b>  When you have decided - before you go shopping, study all the information on the device, all the documentation and parameters, forums and reviews, and also go over competitors once again. <br>  <b>4</b>  So that the process does not take a long time, it is desirable that the required amount has already been accumulated. <br>  <b>5</b>  Whatever you pick up there - do not forget about the uninterruptible power supply. <br>  <b>6</b>  Ikea is not always bad and sometimes helps;) and often allows you to save time well. <br><br>  Perhaps someone would need such advice.  When there are two equally popular models and it is difficult to choose, you need to write out their main drawbacks and decide which ones you can live with, and which ones you don‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want.  So it's easier to decide than weighing many advantages) <br><br>  Actually, I didn‚Äôt do something from these points - stepped on a rake.  Nevertheless, the system has gathered a wonderful (absolutely no regrets) and, most importantly, relatively inexpensive.  And I hope that my detailed ZheZhashny roadmap will come in handy for someone with a difficult choice - nevertheless, now a huge choice of equipment has become so affordable that almost any working person can afford it. <br><br>  It should also not be forgotten that all this is just entertainment) and they are unlikely to help in achieving life goals.  Listen, watch, download, play - baldeyte, but do not forget about the "pebble principle") <br><br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">Twitter</a> .
