Surely many of you are aware that Mobile World Congress 2017 is currently taking place in Barcelona - a huge exhibition dedicated to engineering and technology.  Recently, as part of this event, we made some interesting announcements, which we want to tell about today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/47a/8f0/ddf47a8f03224ad7976517817cd224d4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At MWC 2017, we presented two Moto smartphones, three Lenovo laptops, a hybrid Windows tablet, and a large family of Android tablets Tab 4. The latter consists of four models in various versions.  But first things first. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Smartphones Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus</font> </h2><br>  Moto has two new products - smartphones G5 and G5 Plus.  We will talk mainly about the first model, since  it is already known for sure that Plus will not be brought to Russia.  But G5 will come to us very soon - at the end of March or at the beginning of April.

      What is this gadget?  This is a mid-range smartphone with Android 7.0 out of the box.  According to Moto tradition, there are no third-party shells here, which for many users is a big plus, and sometimes even the decisive factor when choosing a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/ea7/0e7/ef8ea70e7d234f1486c4db96d901da7d.jpg"><br><br>  The body shape is rounded, and the display diagonal is 5 inches, so that working with the gadget with one hand is very convenient.  The resolution is Full HD, based on the IPS matrix.  The picture is bright, the color rendition is good - the screen is really cool.  Directly below it is a fingerprint scanner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/561/c3a/8ff/561c3a8ffa674dc8bbd9274aa7950cfa.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the smartphone is an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor with an integrated graphics accelerator Adreno 505 and 2, or 3 GB (depending on version) of RAM.  In the AnTuTu benchmark, such a configuration should gain about 40-42 thousand points. <br><br>  On the back of the beautiful round camera in the style of Moto Z and Moto Z Play.  But since the modules are not attached here, the lens does not protrude from the housing.  Matrix resolution - 13 MP, optical aperture - F / 2.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1b/461/47e/b1b46147e9c54bba814e2cea77bfa886.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover of the smartphone can be removed, which by today's standards - a rarity.  Accordingly, the battery with a capacity of 2800 mAh is also removable.  There is, by the way, support for fast charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ad/5d5/99a/1ad5d599a556440f9c14d38e6e81b3e7.jpg"><br><br>  The built-in memory in the device is either 16 or 32 GB - it all depends on the version you choose.  In this case, you can simultaneously use two SIM, and microSD.  For each of the three cards in the sliding tray has a separate slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/97c/16a/44d97c16a3784c8ba3b15a9979e38610.jpg"><br><br>  Already, we can call the approximate Russian price for the Moto G5: it is 12,990 rubles.  But Moto G5 Plus is a more powerful version of the G5 with a 5.2-inch screen.  Inside the smartphone Snapdragon 625, 32/64 GB of internal and 3/4 GB of RAM.  The camera resolution is slightly smaller (12 MP), but the aperture ratio of the optics is higher - F / 1.7.  The price of the issue in Europe is about 280 euros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/9c3/ac3/d639c3ac339448729dc3a4fe84edc100.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo Tab 4 8, Tab 4 10 Tablets and their Pro versions</font> </h2><br>  Lenovo has a lot of stuff in the shelf of Android tablets.  At MWC 2017, we showed a whole family called Tab 4. The Tab 4 8 and Tab 4 10 models are inexpensive devices for family use at home or on the road.  The interface is designed so that for each family member you can quickly and easily set up a separate profile with your own files and programs, and then quickly switch between them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dc/423/c66/7dc423c66e9d40309bdb4e4a6c81cc0a.jpg"><br><br>  As you probably already guessed, the diagonal of the screens is indicated in the names of the models, the resolution in both cases is 1280x800 pixels, based on the IPS matrix.  In gadgets, 16 GB of internal memory, 2 GB of RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processors. The battery capacity of an 8-inch tablet is 4850 mAh, 10-inch battery capacity is 7000 mAh.  Taking into account the obvious entertainment orientation, it was at the right time that the front stereo speakers were powerful by tablet standards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df2/9f5/127/df29f51275fd4809a6e58e70891a0137.jpg"><br><br>  Both gadgets can be purchased in the version of Kid's Pack - with a bright sticker for the back panel and a thick silicone frame that reliably protects the tablets from damage during shocks and falls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/a99/07c/9c7a9907ce6d42648891c0cb80d197e9.jpg"><br><br>  We also made a Pro-version of these devices.  Tab 4 8 Pro and Tab 4 10 Pro have higher resolution (1920x1200 pixels), a more powerful processor (Snapdragon 625), more RAM (4 GB) and built-in (64 GB) memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/bff/f44/7afbfff448724777a1d2d869b08b6935.jpg"><br><br>  Tab Pro 8 8 Pro and Tab 4 10 Pro is the perfect version of the Productivity Pack, which includes a convenient stand with a keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/311/06b/380/31106b3804db4d4fbb06735d957eb5b1.jpg"><br><br>  All four gadgets will be sold in Russia, although we are not yet sure about the ‚Äúpacks‚Äù.  Prices will be in the range of 9990 rubles (Tab 4 8) to 21 990 rubles (Tab 4 10 Pro).  Sales will begin in the summer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Notebook Lenovo Yoga 520</font> </h2><br>  The parade of new products continues laptop Lenovo Yoga 520. This is a very neat and fairly light (1.74 kg) metal laptop with a sound system created with the direct participation of the company Harman.  The resolution of the 14-inch screen is 1920x1080 pixels. <br><br>  Inside the computer is an Intel Core i7 processor of the newest, seventh generation, up to 16 GB of RAM and HDD with a capacity of 1 TB or SSD with a capacity of up to 512 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f0/e5e/eb9/3f0e5eeb91814cf7b4bb4e23cc6ece27.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo Yoga 720 Laptops</font> </h2><br>  Lenovo Yoga 720 notebooks at once two: one is 15-inch, and the second is 13-inch.  The second option is a very light and compact machine that you can carry around with you as a portable work computer.  The gadget weighs only 1.3 kg with a thickness of 14.3 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/156/036/378/1560363785a14a478a03e9d288624fea.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the Yoga 720 13 and 15 Intel Core i7 processors, up to 16 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB on the hard disk.  In the 13-inch laptop integrated graphics Intel HD Graphics 620, and the 15-inch Yoga 720 "charged" more seriously.  There are not only powerful JBL speakers with Dolby Audio Premium support, but also GTX 1050 discrete graphics. The model is 20.9 mm thick, and the weight is also modest - 1.8 kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a50/718/f39/a50718f39bcf40d3b2e13c7d3b9f7057.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Hybrid tablet Lenovo Miix 320</font> </h2><br>  A separate interesting point of our program at MWC 2017 is the Miix 320 hybrid tablet. Its estimated price outside Russia is only $ 200. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e4/707/474/7e47074749de440480f57d7db06944ef.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget has a 10.1-inch screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels and a battery capable of up to 10 hours of battery life.  The device is running Windows, inside the case is the Intel Atom X5 processor, as well as 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory.  Miix 320 weighs only slightly more than one kilogram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/ffd/8c8/d02ffd8c88614de4a91bf6068d0877d9.jpg"><br><br>  We also really want to bring laptops and Miix 320 to Russia, but with them, unlike Moto G5 and Tab 4 tablets, there is no clarity yet.  Therefore, the details of the prices and terms at the moment are not ready to report, but we will keep you informed. <br><br>  That's all for now.  As soon as the novelties reach Moscow we will try to please you with their detailed reviews.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401961/</a></p>
