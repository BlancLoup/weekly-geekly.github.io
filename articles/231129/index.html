This model made a positive impression on me and showed itself well from an operational point of view.  It became interesting what new things can offer, how to surprise and what THL has achieved in this period in the public sector. <br>  It turned out that they have something to please.  In this review, I want to talk about the budget smartphone THL T11, built on a new 8-core processor MTK6592 Octa Core with a frequency of 1.7GHz.  It is known for certain that the progenitor of this model was the sensational flagship THL T100s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b5/6d5/873/1b56d5873142427d9b3ea6cd2da810c7.jpg"><br><br>  In size and dimensions, the models do not differ, with the exception of some small design elements (metal frames).  THL T11 is a younger and cheaper model, the screen resolution in it is reduced from 1920x1080 to 1280x720 pixels, with the same screen diagonal (5 "). Also, the main 13 megapixel camera is replaced with 8 megapixel. The review contains detailed photos, camera shooting examples, tests and my impressions of exploitation. <a name="habracut"></a>

The new company logo is now written not in capital letters as before ‚ÄúTHL‚Äù, but in capital letters ‚Äúthl‚Äù.  The box is made of thick cardboard, which well protects the phone and accessories from any external influences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f5/262/13f/7f526213f1dd4c03ade02503453e4999.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the smartphone, the kit includes: a charger with a plug for our sockets, a USB cable, a wired headset, protective film and documentation in English. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5a/766/6a6/c5a7666a6cd841d3bfffed9b07a82a6a.jpg"><br><br>  Accurate battery charger from 220V, the output charge current is 1 A, charges stably and without overheating.  Full charge time is 2.5-3 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4b/ce9/a68/c4bce9a68f094056ae607abc236ceed3.jpg"><br><br>  USB data cable of good quality, microUSB connector is tight.  Wired headset budget, for high-quality listening to music is not suitable.  With normal headphones, the phone produces excellent sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/f7b/53c/2b0f7b53c7004b0ab50cd88e1be65d24.jpg"><br><br>  On the battery, the manufacturer indicates the capacity of 2750 mAh, the battery weight is slightly more than 42 grams (which indirectly hints at a real capacity of at least 2500 mAh).  The phone with the battery weighs exactly 142 g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db2/aa4/0f0/db2aa40f08314665b014361533acfa7a.jpg"><br><br>  A shipping protective film is glued on the screen (easily removed) and under it is another better factory one.  Since the phone has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 glass, I don‚Äôt see the need for a protective film.  However, the manufacturer completed the phone with an additional protective film (you can stick it if you wish).  The kit also has an English manual and two NFC tags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/120/9d0/41f1209d0bc846b8ad39288691073967.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS</font> </h2><br>  The phone comes in white and black color.  The back cover is made of plastic with a matte surface (does not slip in the hands, fingerprints are almost imperceptible).  The lid closes tightly and in order to open it for the first time I needed a plastic card.  On the top, where the microUSB and 3.5mm audio connectors are located, as well as the bottom, where the microphone and the slot for removing the back cover of the phone are located - plastic with a grooved surface.  I did not find backlash and squeaks, even with very strong pressure on the screen and the case.  Monolithic glass is made flush with the other elements. <br><br>  THL T11 has an original corporate design with pronounced angular shapes and ergonomic rounding of the side faces.  The black color of the case merges with the black color of the screen.  The overall look and design creates a pleasant impression of the phone at the level of world brands.  The dimensions of the device are: 144.3 x 70.4 x 8.4mm with a weight of 142 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/306/49f/99e30649f2bb40c8b31e745a9b1218b6.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel features a 5-inch capacitive touchscreen, a slot for the earpiece, a front-facing camera, three ‚Äúmenu‚Äù, ‚Äúhome‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù touch buttons, a microphone slot, and proximity and lighting sensors.  To the right of the speaker grille, there is an event indicator, which lights red when the battery is charging.  Touch keys have a bluish backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/994/a22/f91994a2262d404295c79b36151de847.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29d/447/68f/29d44768f32140da8440c4eb12bb2c88.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13e/452/e8c/13e452e8c40c4ea299ff256c46157557.jpg"><br><br>  On the back panel there is a camera lens, an LED flash, an external speaker slot (the sound is loud enough) and the manufacturer's logo and an optional noise canceling microphone.  The camera does not protrude above the body and almost merges with it.  The surface of the cover is rough and does not slip in the hands.  The body is pleasant to the touch and almost does not get dirty fingerprints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01b/f1f/11a/01bf1f11a2e0472bb4a575534f5d37b1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b1/587/86b/9b158786b8d94a4f80417cb5a15c36a8.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side is a lock button.  To unlock, you do not need to reach with your second hand - everything is clearly under your thumb (for right-handed people). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ba/3f5/1fd/4ba3f51fd804411ebb9e1d44f29f1e9e.jpg"><br><br>  On the left is the volume rocker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47b/9bb/bae/47b9bbbae396442394feeee0bae8b783.jpg"><br><br>  The upper end is occupied by a 3.5 mm headphone jack and microUSB connector.  THL T11 supports work with Flash-drives via USB-interface (OTG). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/6cd/ac2/d7c6cdac262a48159384205a98afece7.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom there is a recess for removing the back panel and the microphone hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/c88/019/64dc88019a0347fbb7f52f987b260f48.jpg"><br><br>  The phone has a classic design with the correct forms.  If you look at it in profile, you can see how its back case is gently bent.  The phone fits well in the hand, like a flush and does not slip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/20c/ebe/31f20cebe6a54f66a8b69cc19415abb6.jpg"><br><br>  THL T11 has a comfortable size and shape (rounded edges, bevel at the top and bottom), it is very convenient to use it with one hand.  All keys have a pleasant tight turn and are easily searched blindly.  You can easily reach with your fingers almost anywhere on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/639/40a/06e63940a50a4962a1f0f6a2013e62ab.jpg"><br><br>  After removing the back cover (it is tight), we see the battery, slots for SIM-cards (mini and micro) and microSD cards.  There is an NFC antenna on the inside of the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0c/9df/0bd/d0c9df0bd8574cb48720f9b126e18dfe.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e68/c05/b5c/e68c05b5cdc64619838789891a7bd379.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISASSEMBLY</font> </h2><br>  To see the inside of the device, I disassembled it, unscrewing a total of 15 screws.  It should be noted that one of the screws has a warranty label (it can be removed without damaging it with an ordinary needle). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cd/d47/ce7/7cdd47ce70d64dbea543398979c86760.jpg"><br><br>  After unscrewing all the screws, I divided the case into two halves with a plastic card.  After removing part of the body, I got access to the entrails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a2/2f1/bea/8a22f1bea53b42c980c672527b103ed1.jpg"><br><br>  Very competent layout of parts, with the naked eye, you can see that the main goal of the developers is to maximize the free space for the battery, without increasing the thickness of the case. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The THL T11 features a 5-inch capacitive touchscreen display with a high contrast IPS matrix.  It has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels with a density of 294 PPI.  The display is made by technology GFF (analogue of OGS) - a technology that combines the display and the sensor / glass into one, which will reduce the thickness of the device, make the image clearer and increase sensitivity. <br>  The display gives a very bright and rich picture with excellent color reproduction.  The screen viewing angles are close to 180 ¬∞.  Supports multi-touch up to 10 touches.  Sensitivity is good, problems with touch-screen did not reveal.  The screen is protected by third generation Corning Gorilla Glass tempered glass.  At maximum illumination, the screen remains readable under the bright rays of the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a90/f50/4c0/a90f504c091f4f8f98e6bfcfa8d1d789.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9d/914/e2c/c9d914e2c95e4bbe950ae9c2891af0e2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e8/1e9/88d/1e81e988dcd84577a95dfbf3416123f1.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">IRON</font> </h2><br>  The MT6592 Octa Core has a 4-core Mali-450MP4 video accelerator with a frequency of up to 700 MHz, which is about 2 times more powerful than the Mali-400MP2 installed in MT6582.  MT6592 Octa Core is made in a modern 28nm process, integrated 8 core Cortex-A7 with a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  Second-level L2 cache is increased to 1Mb, LDDR2 533MHz / DDR3 666MHz and 13 megapixel cameras are supported.  Video recording can be made in 1080P 30fp formats, 1080P 30fps H.264 decoding, as well as in 2 new HEVC / H.265 and VP9 formats.  In addition, the device has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded using microSD memory cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ff/c71/d5c/1ffc71d5cd87f163f90aba28d4d5eb44.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f0/3c5/f39/8f03c5f398970c8cc8cfc0ffd1e2e76f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, the device turned out really impressive among fellow Chinese and top-end smartphones from global brands.

No problems with voice communication or data transfer is not found.  The smartphone holds a great signal.  Remarkable by the presence of the full range of WCDMA 850/1900 / 2100MHz, in many Chinese phones 1900 is missing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/353/39b/05035339b0bd4b7e96c81f47b7ff08c0.jpg"><br><br>  The phone has a Wi-Fi module of the standard 802.11 a / b / g / n, I did not find any glitches and dumps.

The microphone is sensitive both on the street and in the room, the speaker is loud, perfectly audible to the interlocutor and me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5a/915/bf2/f5a915bf299246479f74e70fc7a9f978.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">INTERFACE and software</font> </h2><br>  THL T11 runs on the Android operating system version 4.2.2 with full support for the Russian language.  The interface flies, applications open almost instantly, turning pages without brakes. <br><br>  Immediately updated the firmware (04/01/14) to the most recent (06/23/14), a small instruction with links to all the necessary software: <br>  <b>Download:</b> <br>  1) <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/OyzssR12aFVWq">SP Flash Tool</a> <br>  2) <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/O60_7IUkaFVWj">MT6592 USB VCOM drivers</a> <br>  3) Latest <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/QgGoioamWWkc6">firmware</a> for your phone <br>  <b>Install:</b> <br>  1) Unpack the archives of the SP Flash Tool, MT6592 USB VCOM and the archive with the firmware <br>  2) Turn off the smartphone.  The cable is not connected to the computer. <br>  3) Press the reset button <br>  4) Connect the phone to the computer with a cable.  The operating system will find a new device - specify the system folder with the driver MT6592 USB VCOM (for its version of the OS) <br>  5) Disconnect the cable from the computer <br>  6) Run the program SP Flash Tool <br>  7) Click on the Download_Agent button and select the file MTK_AllInOne_DA.bin (it is in the program folder) <br>  8) Click on the Scatter-loading button and select the MT6592_Android_scatter.txt file (it is in the folder with the firmware). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/644/d59/f8a/644d59f8ae3d0d5d3f851a5faa8829fd.jpg"><br>  9) Click the Download button. <br>  10) Connect the phone to the computer with a cable.  The program should see it and start the firmware. <br>  11) The confirmation of the successful completion of the firmware process will be a green circle with the words "OK".  After the end of the firmware turn off the phone. <br>  12) Done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/8ad/438/ae68ad43840e435394c7a142710efbe1.jpg"><br><br>  The appearance of the system is classic and strict in a beautiful black and blue gamut (OTA - wireless update is present) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/126/5e8/c7e/1265e8c7e23042ef8d15701d385c717e.jpg"><br><br>  The firmware contains the main Google services, including the Play Store and other standard Android stock applications (audio and video players, calculators, watches, etc.).  Also added: a file manager, notes and a flashlight, and a few more applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/166/e6e/360/166e6e360bd34f6b806edf35710bf534.jpg"><br><br>  One of the innovations is the presence of the NFC module and firmware for working with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b8/dfe/e31/1b8dfee31db744ed8b9ef0089ce9354e.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to note the presence of "Smart Wake", this feature allows you to control the phone with the help of touches and gestures on the off screen.  Examples of gestures: swipe up - unlock the smartphone;  draw ‚Äúc‚Äù - dialer;  Swipe down - launch the camera, draw ‚Äúe‚Äù - launch the browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42d/cf1/503/42dcf1503dce4b9d8496e5f4e106502e.jpg"><br><br>  USB host function (connecting a mouse, keyboard, external drives, etc.), compass, multi-touch for 10 touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/317/089/d37/317089d371f9450d837ace909aec37b2.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the phone interface is clean, i.e.  not overwhelmed with excess software and devoid of the shell from the manufacturer.  For a change, some add-ons have been added, such as the Float App, as well as those related to sound enhancement (BesAudEnh and BesLoudness).  ClearMotion allows you to make the image on the TV more smooth and clear.  You can also calibrate the accelerometer, proximity sensor, etc. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  Both cameras are pleased with the quality of the pictures.  The rear camera has a real resolution of 8 megapixels and is capable of taking pictures with a resolution of up to 4096x3072 pixels, which are programmatically interpolated in 13 megapixels.  Autofocus and bright flash are present.  HDR support allows you to take pictures with an extended light range.  Autofocus responds quickly to changes in the situation in the frame and allows you to shoot close objects (you can also specify the focus area manually). <br>  The resolution of the front camera is 5 MP, software interpolated to 12 MP.  The camera works well, the pictures are very good, there is also autofocus. <br>  Since the blue protective film was attached to the rear camera at the factory, the camera can be wrong with white balance and picture clarity, so it must be removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/a36/d97/e59a36d97bb64a46a6e4248c4e58b55c.jpg"><br><br>  Example of shooting the main camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c55/2f3/40d/c552f340d9084aed8fe26a9c8ae4a7a0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/e0c/cc8/95ce0ccc80ee4bb79dd9fc76482a634a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/335/d06/bb1335d064bd4c8ab953e7ad0aec6b94.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c4/280/c2e/6c4280c2edf2415a9a6a617547859484.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/6ac/409/bc86ac4093fe42dabffef2cdeac91371.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/657/0e2/8ea/6570e28ead5542a384f2fb33255bff00.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d37/86d/91c/d3786d91ca51478189737124dc42b4bc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/ebf/6e6/74bebf6e6ee943e39049c7ab8ef36013.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/cSALD9anaNgJz">Source photos</a> <br><br>  Example of shooting with the front camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56a/f50/458/56af5045811646b6b4479a7cb0c183d0.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/mPyRXyTlaNgiN">Original photo</a> <br><br>  The rear camera of the phone is capable of recording video with a resolution of 720p and 1080p, shot several small clips <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_tIPKCiuo4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhha6s5Du8YIrPwan2McVQD6UNIk2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/Y3pYSKXeaNhbs">Source video</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQo2uwSVesw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhKzNlXehxQhxa5RIlrZnXMx_F8zw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/U4oFjE4DaNiaL">Source video</a> <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ACCUMULATOR, AUTONOMOUS TIME</font> </h2><br>  The battery capacity indicated by the manufacturer is 2750 mAh, the time of full charge from the native charger (1 A) takes 2.5 - 3 hours, while the battery charges up to 4.3V.  In the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXAjJOe90bLg">720p_100fps video playback mode</a> with maximum brightness, the smartphone lasted 6 hours.  In standby mode, the phone keeps very well, with Wi-Fi, GPS and mobile network turned on, the phone lost 15% of the charge in 3 days: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/f92/a88/b02f92a88ce54debbc75d598be795053.jpg"><br><br>  I had a full charge for two days (tests, internet, video, games and music).  If you actively use games and videos, then you need to count on one light day (9-12 hours, depending on the intensity of the game). <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  For the price of 7900r, THL T11 deserves the highest praise.  A new 8-core processor and 2GB of RAM is enough for all tasks, including modern heavy 3D games.  The Chinese smartphone market has really reached a new level of quality.  Manufacturers no longer copy the design of successful third-party solutions, but produce devices with an original design of their own, while at the same time successfully adding popular functions (NFC, OTA, Smart Wake). <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå BENEFITS</font> <font color="000000">AND MINUSES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Power-efficient eight-core processor MT6592 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Own design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality assembly of all components <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Safety glass Gorilla Glass 3 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality speaker and microphone <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Large memory and microSD slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Good cameras at 8 and 5 MP <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Compass, NFC, OTG, OTA, Smart Wake. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Good battery capacity (honest 2500 mAh) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Budget headset <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No LTE support <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Not the best quality video shooting <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SHOPPING</font> </h2><br>  The device can be purchased at the <a href="http://www.dx.com/ru/p/thl-t11-otca-core-android-4-2-2-wcdma-bar-phone-w-5-0-ips-wi-fi-gps-and-nfc-otg-function-331627">DX.com</a> store. <br><br>  Do not forget to follow us on <a href="http://vk.com/boxoverview">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="http://twitter.com/box_overview">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108620202455758035379">Google+</a> !
