We are speaking from a start <a href="http://brief.ly/">briefly</a> from London.  From our Ukrainian friends we learned about the mighty Habrahabr community, and decided to present our revolutionary product to you. <br><br>  I would like to hear how he will behave in your hands, what is your opinion, what did you like, what did not?  What would you do differently, and what can you be proud of? <br><br><h3>  Intermezzo </h3><br>  How many Internet address reduction services are not truly known to anyone.  Exactly more than a thousand.  Each serious company has its own short domain.  Twitter spawned a whole industry.  They differ only in additional functionality.  However, they all take one URL and make another URL from it.

    <h3>  Prehistory </h3><br>  We decided to do something new, it would seem trite obvious.  And why not take a lot of links, put everything in the tabs, and send it as one page? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/97e/c04/a3b97ec04d2268a42fe2cfeeddc4e7bf.png" alt="Vitaly portnikov"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  A year ago, our programmers developed the name.ly/frames frame theme, which allows you to load a lot of resources into tabs, like in the built-in Internet browser.  For example, all the sites of the famous Ukrainian and Russian political scientist Vitaly Portnikov open right here: <a href="http://sincere.ly/yours/portnikov/">sincere.ly/portnikov</a> - and they also reflect on <a href="http://portnikov.com/sites/">portnikov.com/sites</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c3/c8f/5e2/5c3c8f5e2aa74f461577fae11ef475e6.png" alt="Vitaly portnikov"><br><br>  The disadvantage of <a href="http://name.ly/">name.ly</a> was the complexity and duration of the creation of the site.  It was necessary to register, select a frame template and enter each link separately.  It took about five minutes. <br><br><h2>  Brief.ly </h2><br>  We experimented a lot and came to the conclusion that everything ingenious should be done in a matter of seconds.  So, based on name.ly, service brief.ly was born - for instant creation of compilations of many sites. <br><br><h3>  Compilation of sites </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65a/25a/8a2/65a25a8a218a678d3136e7c2e25f991f.png" alt="brief.ly bundle"><br><br>  Brief.ly works as follows: in the text box, you can submit a list of links and, with a space, a signature for each of them.  You can simply copy and paste links without signatures, brief.ly itself, based on domain names, will offer labels and allow them to be edited before creating the compilation itself.  In the additional options you can download the original page titles, it really takes a little time, up to five seconds per link, depending on the speed of a particular resource. <br><br>  Since all sites are loaded at the same time, in order not <s>to</s> overload people and their Internet, we have optimally limited the number of tabs to 36. You can work around this by compiling already compiled links, thus creating nested sub-pages. <br><br><h3>  Brief links </h3><br>  As a result of the compilation, a page with all the links is created.  If the link is one, then everything works as in the classic shortcut.  If there are more links, then the corresponding content is loaded in separate tabs. <br><br>  In addition to this page on brief.ly, the user can select a link from the list of attractive domains, and if you don‚Äôt like the short code, you can generate new random codes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a3/db3/6ff/6a3db36ff5918c5712ce184094ed868b.png" alt="brief.ly share"><br><br>  Brief.ly allows people to express themselves.  The parent platform name.ly was created back in 2008.  Now it is a set of domains that are read in English as phrases.  "Briefly" - means "briefly", "namely" - "namely", "sincerely" - "with respect", "many at" - "many in", "links 2 me" - "references to me", " that is me ‚Äù-‚Äú it's me ‚Äù,‚Äú of course ‚Äù-‚Äú of course ‚Äù,‚Äú what else ‚Äù-‚Äú what else? ‚Äù,‚Äú where else ‚Äù-‚Äú where else? ‚Äù,‚Äú who else ‚Äù-‚Äú who else?  In stock, more than 200 domains of a similar nature.  It is not known for sure whether this is a joke or a truth, but a series of advertisements Nespresso with George Clooney inspired us in due time: <a href="http://nespresso.what-el.se/%3F">Nespresso.What-El.se?</a> <br><br>  Phrases do not end there.  Name.ly has two more short domains: an asterisk and an arrow.  For example, the coffee advertising site works on the following links: <a href="http://xn--7ci.ws/~3NXL">http: //‚úØ.ws/~3NXL</a> or <a href="http://xn--4gi.ws/~3NXL">http: //‚û∏.ws/~3NXL</a> . <br><br><h3>  Control </h3><br>  You can manage and view the statistics of the created compilations even after you have created them without registration, provided that you enter the mail and password in the third stage ‚ÄúManage‚Äù.  To do this, use either an existing login or simply enter new details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad2/95f/5a6/ad295f5a626892a84c003e00da545b36.png" alt="brief.ly manage.png"><br><br>  To quickly get into the admin panel, you just need to add @ after the slash of the main URL. <br><br><h3>  Statistics </h3><br>  Detailed visitor statistics are available only to page administrators.  By default, only the creator has access to this data.  If desired, they can be made public.  You can also add a Google Analytics code.  To quickly view the statistics, you just need to add + after the main user's slash. <br><br>  Here are some screenshots from the results page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03f/006/309/03f006309f638b3df968e048ce7b84cc.png" alt="name.ly stats map"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/268/482/731/268482731ca29ec85b8542c2febe4975.png" alt="name.ly stats page requests"><br><br><h3>  API </h3><br>  To create tabs you don‚Äôt even need to go to the brief.ly site itself, you can use the API and insert the necessary sites into frames via a URL request, or Java-Script.  More information can be found at <a href="http://brief.ly/api/">brief.ly/api</a> . <br><br>  If your services have a need for our functionality, please contact us, we will be happy to cooperate with other sites.  Brief.ly/API allows you to create customized templates, change colors, headers, avatars. <br><br><h3>  Redirection and editing </h3><br>  What else must be noted is the ability to redirect links.  Let's say you made a newsletter, and then you wanted to redirect the link - please - at any time and in any place. <br><br><h3>  iPad and home pages </h3><br>  Application brief.ly our users invent themselves, and each time new.  A month ago, they wrote a thank-you message on Facebook that finally using the brief.ly browser on the iPad was able to have tabs, because for some reason Apple missed it. <br><br>  Those who use many browsers in many places use brief.ly to create their own unified home page.  Changed in one place - and the changes immediately occurred everywhere. <br><br><h3>  Nuances </h3><br>  Everything is great, but there are a few "but."  Not all sites support inserts through frames.  Among the popular Russian resources such restrictions impose Yandex and VKontakte.  Twitter and Last.fm pages pop up from the frames.  Brief.ly has already learned how to "fight."  Twitter profiles and Facebook fan pages are converted via their own widgets.  Others are simply not inserted into frames, but are served by direct links. <br><br>  Among the popular sites there are a dozen of such pop-up frames and the service constantly catches them.  Although, 99% of the Internet works fine in frames and the service is quite usable for sending your favorite videos or articles. <br><br>  On <a href="http://brief.ly/">brief.ly,</a> so far, only the English interface, but it is simple as a soup.  We promise improvements, and even more interesting applications.  But this is perhaps a topic for another article. <br><br><h2>  Feedback </h2><br>  We are waiting for your discussion in the comments.  Do not forget to post your creative ideas.  The prize-winner will receive his <a href="http://brief.ly/habr/polo-prise/">personal polo shirt</a> from London with a personal signature. <br><br>  PS All links to this article can be opened in frames with one link <a href="http://brief.ly/habr/">brief.ly/habr/</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120140/</a></p>
