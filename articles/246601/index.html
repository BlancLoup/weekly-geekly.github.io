  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 tips to reduce returns to the online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Converting visitors to your online store into users does not always mean profit.  Internet retailers lose a lot of money and reputation on product returns.  We analyzed the causes and compiled a list of methods for working on returns. <br><br>  <b>1. Optimize the product description</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b6/92d/742/4b692d7420b14e8595c1e8d71c0b09ff.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First and foremost, avoid using descriptions from the manufacturer.  You must describe the product so well that customers can almost feel it through the screen.  Tell us clearly about the shape, size, material, etc.  If you have a model that carries a product - make sure that the description contains his / her height, weight and other parameters so that customers can understand how suitable the product is for them. <br><br>  <b>2. Enhance product photos</b> <br>  A visual display of a product says a lot, but you shouldn‚Äôt confuse your customers.  Make sure the photos are not edited too much or do not accurately represent your product.  Offer the client the opportunity to enlarge the photo, rotate it 360¬∫, etc.

      <b>3. Use reviews and product reviews.</b> <br>  Customer reviews are incredibly valuable for anyone buying online.  Reviews give an honest opinion about the product, and customers can answer questions that you have not answered.  Make sure that the reviews are clearly visible on your site and remember that it depends on you to outweigh the positive reviews. <br><br>  <b>4. Offer an affordable and timely customer service.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b7/f2d/099/5b7f2d099c6746de8c96b91be612b306.jpg"><br>  Potential customers want to ask a lot of questions before making a final decision on the purchase of goods.  And they should be able to contact you immediately during the entire purchase process.  Therefore, it is necessary at each stage to offer different ways of contact - it can be a chat, a phone number, an e-mail address or a video call.  This approach will help the customer to get maximum information about the product, delivery, payment and more accurately select the desired product, which, in turn, will prevent a refund. <br><br>  <b>5. Collect reviews and comments from customers returning goods</b> <br>  Feedback from customers who returned the product is very important to receive and comprehend.  They help to understand the reason for the return and work with her.  It is important to follow frequently asked questions and customer comments in order to find out if there are any general product questions.  Keep track of customer questions, highlight the most popular, and give the answers right in the product description - so you can give the most complete information about the product and avoid some of the returns.  Such information can be obtained from a special form to return or adding comments directly on the product page, the second option will allow you to receive positive feedback from satisfied customers, which will significantly affect future sales. <br><br>  <b>6. Check the product and equipment before it reaches the customer.</b> <br>  Prevention is better, simpler and cheaper than treatment - we all know about it.  Now our task is to organize the implementation of this principle in our online stores.  According to research by Western retailers, up to 41% of returns occur because the consumer received the goods with a defect, and 24% of all deliveries do not contain the goods that the customer ordered.  Why not check the contents of the box for the client and to the client, so as not to waste time, effort and money on returns and apologies? <br><br>  <b>7. Deliver on time and with tracking.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbb/8ae/473/dbb8ae47307a4345a29bd25d2f840b8b.jpg"><br>  Every aspect of user satisfaction can play a key role in relation to your business.  If the client waits for his order for too long and does not have the ability to track the parcel, at the time of receipt he may simply be disappointed: ‚ÄúI was waiting for this or something?‚Äù.  Punctual delivery and control of the order status will help you to avoid part of the returns, the reason for which is not in the quality of the goods. <br><br>  <b>8. Packaging is very important.</b> <br>  If you get a lot of returns with damaged goods, or with things in non-commodity form (chip on dishes, rumpled clothes, bent box), you should review the packaging in which you deliver your products.  Neat, safe and convenient packaging - shows the customer that you care about him, and not just sell. <br><br>  <b>9. Checkout process</b> <br>  Analyze the process of placing orders that are returned.  Perhaps your order form is too tiring or, on the contrary, not detailed enough and the person does not have time to find out all the details of interest before the time of purchase?  The short order form allows people to make purchases quickly and without difficulty, and the long one allows you to make sure that the right product is ordered and to receive detailed information about payment methods and conditions, speed and method of delivery.  You should track returns to find the best solution for your business. <br><br>  <b>10. Tracking and returns system</b> <br>  It is necessary to work with returns and their reasons systematically, and not sporadically.  Returns are as much a part of a business as work with conversion, logistics and suppliers.  Therefore, it is impossible to solve all problems with unsuitable and returned goods by one reactionary action.  But it is important to create a user-friendly and helpful tracking system for returning goods.  Sometimes products that are often returned are generally worth withdrawing from sales, and sometimes the problem is only in a poor-quality photo, you can find out the real reasons only if you regularly and carefully observe the whole picture - from the checkout process to its return to the warehouse. <br><br>  The modern consumer wants to receive a maximum of personal and fast support from sellers.  Therefore, it is important to make the use of your service as simple and understandable as possible, and, if necessary, to create a separate working group from the ‚Äúsales‚Äù and service groups to decide return issues.  If we systematically and promptly respond to customer comments, the problem of returned goods will become less and less acute and, in the end, will go to the minimum figures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246601/</a></p>
