Last week was remembered primarily by the onset of spring.  Nature marked this event with another snowfall, which personally pleased me immensely.  Now I go to the park every night with skis under my arm.  I like to walk with skis in the park.  And I can not ride.  Actually, like all of our national team in skiing.  You know, there is such an anecdote: ‚ÄúThere are two Olympic teams in Belarus - one year old, and the second one is even worse‚Äù.  And what did I include the blues?  Let's about something pleasant, about "our all" - blogs. <br><br>  In connection with the past and upcoming holidays, I came up with a plan of action for you.  After all, we have mostly male audience?  There were people who conducted a study dangerous for their own health - <a href="http://jolita.livejournal.com/306501.html">what is the best vodka in the world</a> ?  Have you already drooling saliva?  Wow reflexes!  I won't torture you anymore - jolita even prepared pictures for us to fantasize (gush?) Was more pleasant.  Dear, I immediately warn you that the editors of KV are against alcoholism in all its manifestations.  We are for a healthy lifestyle outside alcohol fumes!  All on the skis! <br><br>  If you do not know the measure in the use of intoxicating drinks, you can lose yourself.  For example, one of my comrades after abundant libations regularly woke up near the entrance to the favorite polytechnic institute.  If we consider that he lives in Borovlyany, then this constancy needed to be studied thoroughly.  dalf_ezh invites us to read the <a href="http://dalf-ezh.livejournal.com/21591.html">legendary typos</a> .  After all, in any book you can find a typo, and then sometimes come across such as if the proofreader previously participated in determining the most delicious vodka.  For example: "the successes achieved in 19 years under the guidance of the party of Lenin-Stalin".

      Tell me, frivolous and inexperienced youth, why do people marry?  And some even get married!  What is the high meaning of the action called "record of the act of civil status"?  Maybe after that some special chakras open up?  Here someone plamja introduces us with the help of a photo with <a href="http://plamja.livejournal.com/317842.html">incidents</a> that occurred during weddings.  Perhaps I am too categorical, but after seeing what I see, the hunt disappears completely.  But to go to someone else's wedding is always a pleasure. <br><br>  In one of the past reviews, I gave a link to a note that caused a heated discussion on the forum of your favorite intergalactic newspaper.  Fathers of daughters were especially indignant - they say, I propose to teach their children to any dirty tricks.  Just some new Makarenko.  So, Comrade Contractor published a wonderful picture-poster entitled " <a href="http://podrjadchik.livejournal.com/548475.html">Where is Your Daughter Today?</a> ".  It is proposed to choose from two options.  I myself recommend printing and hanging in all school institutions of our blue-eyed homeland.  Also, by the way, you can organize the movement "Pope for daughters!" <br><br>  I will continue the topic of education.  Attention, in order to avoid accusations of a pernicious influence on the younger generation, I recommend to anyone who has not reached the age of 30 not to read this paragraph.  Even I will not read it myself.  All the rest can learn that the beautiful girl viola4u gives a <a href="http://viola4u.livejournal.com/125065.html">free lesson at home striptease</a> with pictures and explanatory text.  You will not find any candid photos by reference, only explanatory, but, nevertheless, still beautiful images.  In my opinion, striptease is a beautiful and complex art that any woman should own. <br><br>  Citizen Natalya Vorontsova-Yuriev in a huge gall text <a href="http://vorontsova-nvu.livejournal.com/73675.html">debunks all the myths</a> about Leo Tolstoy‚Äôs novel Anna Karenina.  And for some reason most of all goes to Nabokov.  Although it is more correct to say what goes to critics, literary critics and textbooks on the Russian literary man.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis article is that ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù is a novel about a woman manipulator.  And, after reading the note, I am even inclined to agree with this.  I recommend reading to all people tortured by Tolstoy, as well as teachers of Russian literature. <br><br>  In the beginning there were ‚ÄúWangers‚Äù, then ‚ÄúSamogonki‚Äù, even later ‚ÄúPerimeter‚Äù.  Fans of computer games immediately learned the development of the Kaliningrad studio KD Lab.  Their distinctive feature has always been an unusual fascinating world, in which, for example, it was necessary to carry out the sticky tabutka on Glorx.  I stumbled upon a lively journal of the main of all this confusion - Crank.  Now I want to recommend to read his thoughts about the movie " <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_krank_/180997.html">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> ."  More precisely - the thought of shaping the future of mankind with such children's films.  Yes, and the entire diary Crank recommended for compulsory study. <br><br>  How, you have not written on our tender forum, that the "Blog Reviews" are the evil of the world?  Correct immediately!  Our sect is more numerous.  Khaletsky is a product of the evil of the world wide web, a underexposed journalist and simply illiterate viewworm.  But the Sociopath from the backseat represents <a href="http://zepp.livejournal.com/943045.html">an example of regional journalism for</a> me and your attention, having read it and you start to treat Khaletskaya a little softer.  Although, of course, plagiarism should be prosecuted and punished by excommunication, at a minimum. <br><br>  And Lena asks us all a <a href="http://v-ea.livejournal.com/107677.html">question</a> on gender relations.  The question, of course, is quite typical and this can happen with anyone, but, in my opinion, you should not find out on the Internet who is to blame for this situation, but decide everything inside the family unit.  And then living on the advice - not the best way, especially on the advice of complete strangers. <br><br>  As Bulgakov said through the mouth of his Woland, ‚Äúpeople are mortal.  And the saddest thing is that they are suddenly mortal. ‚Äù  Here and in a live journal are <a href="http://nedorazvmenie.ljgate.com/385553.html">diaries of those</a> who have long left this world.  I‚Äôd better quote: "Someone crashed in a car accident, someone killed the disease, one girl was raped and killed ... Angels and cats on a juicer ... Last posts - someone skated; someone hung a picture of a tropical island and wrote that dreams of being there; someone was glad that they would finally see their loved one tomorrow, shared their happiness, that an almost faded tree came to life ... In the last posts, friends shouted to them, they called, went to ICQ, picked up the phone, that they could not find them ... they are already dead ... " <br><br>  Flamenca talks about a mentally deranged Dutch woman, whom she kindly calls <a href="http://flamenca.livejournal.com/61053.html">Duszhechka</a> .  Straight Prosper Merimee.  Again, a quote for the seed: "She was my neighbor. At first I just found her eccentric - by my arrival, the whole staircase was hung with pieces of paper with sickle and hammer and matryoshka painted on them, as well as posters with polar bears and Michal Sergeich." <br><br>  And still remember, in some long-time "Review ..." I gave a link to photos of people who had fun with Lego?  Again we remember this Danish designer.  This time - <a href="http://aveleen.livejournal.com/1063163.html">Lego-figures of heroes</a> from famous movies and cartoons.  I wonder when Lego will release the figures of all the journalists "KV"?  Our readers will use them as a voodoo doll. <br><br>  Hockey can already be considered our national fun, a gift that came up with his Canadians.  But sometimes hockey turns into <a href="http://lucky-lr.livejournal.com/912539.html">a Lynch court</a> . <br><br>  I have a cat that constantly shits in different places.  What did I just do!  However, just today I came across a remarkable article " <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/tavia_/216982.html">On the punishments of animals</a> ."  I do not know if the facts gleaned from this article will help me, but it is worth taking note of them anyway.  Yes, and participate in the discussion, too. <br><br>  Well, the last number in our program today is <a href="http://cinefile.livejournal.com/412315.html">Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman</a> .  It will be interesting not only to fans and fans.  Photos of a star couple in different years of their family life.  From the very beginning and, as they say, to the end.  With the comments of the author of the blog and visitors. <br><br>  Your personal aggregator <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/169011.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/169011.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006100605.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ10, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288530/</a></p>
