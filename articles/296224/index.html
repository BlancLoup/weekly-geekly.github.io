They use these platforms to <b>get up-</b> to <b>-date information about current events</b> . <br><br>  In this article, you can learn about how the user perception of Facebook and Twitter is changing, and how brands can react to this. <br><br>  <b># 1: More and more people prefer to get news from Facebook and Twitter.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in July 2015 showed that more and more users are accessing Twitter and Facebook if they want to get the latest news.  Of the more than 2,000 respondents, 63% rely on both services to find out the latest national and political summaries, which is significantly more than the same figures in 2013. <br><br>  Twitter, which was originally more news-oriented, didn‚Äôt go so far: an increase from 52% to 63% in two years.  The number of people using Facebook to get news has risen from 47% in 2013 to 63% in 2015, or by 16%.  While the ability to maintain contact with friends and acquaintances initially lures people on Facebook, it‚Äôs all the abundance of news that you can get from there (news about sports, science, technology, business and entertainment) keeps them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5e/91e/070/d5e91e070b554d53ab9d3034f99b44df.png"><br><br>  As shown in the graph below, the number of Facebook users almost did not change from 2013 to 2014. Despite the inevitable slowdown, today 71% of Internet users have a Facebook page and 70% of them check it daily.  And forty-five percent visit it more than once a day.  Interacting with friends, brands, organizations, and news services, Facebook (and Twitter) users formed their own, tailored media.  And, apparently, they like their creation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/522/b98/26e/522b9826ee0f4abd81de281329a284f6.png"><br><br>  While Twitter's audience increased by an impressive 28% from 2013‚Äì2014, the platform‚Äôs inability to achieve the same ubiquity as Facebook has disappointed many.  Twitter remains a popular niche platform for a real-time discussion of events, television programs and sporting events, but poorly suited for advertisements. <br><br>  <b>Basic idea</b> : As Facebook and Twitter mature, the growth rate of their audience gradually levels out.  Younger users have switched from Facebook to Instagram, but older people are finally beginning to be interested in the network.  Brands should adjust their advertising policy in order to follow current trends and continue to interest users. <br><br>  <b># 2: Twitter is the most appropriate platform for posting hot news.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  An illustration from the Pew Research Center at the beginning of this paragraph reveals another interesting fact: Although the majority of Twitter users tweet only one or several times a week (which is significantly less than the amount of communication between Facebook users), but if there is a national crisis in the world that concerns sports a contest, an oversight of any politician, or scandals with celebrities, people come running on Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/eee/ea7/1f2eeeea71f14b73bd67a41177148d81.jpg"><br><br>  The number of people who say that they follow the hot news on Twitter (59%) is almost two times more than the number on Facebook (31%).  Twitter is the best platform for breaking news and commentary. <br><br>  On Twitter, sports fans and news fans also actively communicate and share opinions. <br><br>  Users not only read the headlines, they also interact with each other.  As the chart above shows, more than half of all users write at least one tweet on the topic of news per week.  And although most of the pages that Twitter users subscribe to belong to family members and relatives, most of their news feeds are taken up by articles from news services and journalists. <br><br>  In the image below you can see that even though news services make up only 14% of all subscriptions of users, 33% of all tweets come from them.  The most popular news topics are sports (35% of Twitter users subscribed to news resources receive sports news), business / science / technology (14% receive news on these topics), as well as civil and political (12%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/071/3dc/6250713dca03496eaffa1bfaf0e2f3c2.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth considering that in this study there was a very small final sample, which provided its data on Twitter.  From the original 3.212 respondents, only a group of 176 users remained who provided their pages with open data for analysis and the authors of the study state that they understand that the sample is too small. <br><br>  <b>Basic idea</b> : Marketers should decide whether they should promote their product or service among Twitter-based sports fans and news fans.  The fickle nature of hot news only makes promotion more difficult, but constant monitoring of trends on Twitter and even Google Trends will certainly help. <br><br>  <b># 3: Facebook is the # 1 source for Generation Y</b> <br><br>  Researchers from eMarketer in their study ‚ÄúFacebook helps young people follow the news‚Äù found that 57% of Generation Y in the US visit Facebook at least once a day to get the latest news and information, and 30% go to it several times a day.  Believe it or not, 14% of Generation Y representatives who participated in the study admitted that they use Facebook ‚Äúalmost constantly.‚Äù <br><br>  Except in the cases of ‚Äúhot news‚Äù (where Twitter dominates), there are not so many regular visitors coming to know the news on any other social platform.  Also, 60% ‚Äúlike‚Äù, 34% comment and 42% share news posts on Facebook. <br><br>  <b>Main idea</b> : If before the target audience for the brands were adults, now their children have replaced them.  The generation of Y (age category from 18 to 34 years) exceeds the number of their parents by almost 20 million (90+ million against 72+ million). <br><br>  Since representatives of this age category receive news from Facebook, this platform will remain relevant for a long time.  Brands that interact with representatives of Generation Y on Facebook can safely continue to develop in this direction. <br><br>  <b># 4: Reporters rely on Facebook and Twitter for clarity.</b> <br><br>  Journalists have long understood the promise of reaching the target audience through social media.  Today, many of them use social networks for more than five years.  A survey by Cision 200 journalists in 2015 found that 75% of them use Facebook and 80% use Twitter to advertise and promote products. <br><br>  Building relationships with potential sources, local companies and politicians is also of considerable importance to them.  While news publications print only selected stories, journalists usually publish all of their articles on their personal pages. <br><br>  <b>The basic idea</b> : Journalists will likely continue to post their articles on personal pages on Facebook and Twitter.  They have a strong intrinsic motivation to maintain such pages.  A whole army of journalists constantly publishes news creating content for people with a wide variety of hobbies and interests.  Facebook and Twitter will continue to be a rich source of diverse information in the future. <br>  Companies using Twitter or Facebook to communicate with journalists are in a better position to publish news of their field. <br><br>  <b># 5: Facebook and Twitter teams are working on new news projects.</b> <br><br>  Although innovations like Periscope on Twitter and Instant Articles on Facebook scare many users, there is a sequence in this madness.  For most insiders, Periscope and Instant Articles are the very tools that will lure the attention of users from TV screens to smartphones and tablets, and preferably to their own channels.  The developers of both platforms work tirelessly to make the process of news consumption easier and more interesting. <br><br>  In February of this year, Twitter acquired Periscope before it even started.  The application that allows you to watch and share live video from your mobile phone is a real gift for journalists, entertainment industry workers and many others.  But Twitter‚Äôs news projects don't end there. <br><br>  After a few months, representatives of the platform declare the creation of Project Lightning - an editable tape of messages, tweets and videos dedicated to any event that is currently happening.  To make it work well, Twitter will hire former journalists and editors of news companies to create fresh content. <br><br>  Twitter will create similar tapes on world-wide emergencies and scandals.  If a similar event occurred in a difficult-to-reach region, Twitter will combine the best videos, tweets, and photos from all that fall on their server.  Most likely this content will come from local residents who publish it from their smartphones. <br><br>  <b>The main idea</b> : With the help of such new tools, people from all over the world will be able to capture the events and share them on Facebook and Twitter.  Brands should be familiar with these tools if they want to remain a sought-after source of industry information. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-and-twitter-user-behavior-changes-new-research/">A source</a> <br><br>  ========================= <br><br>  Why is there no Twitter block with popular tweets in MediaTrends?  Technologically, the creation of such a block is the simplest thing, and such a block is in the platform: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b47/e0d/b8c/b47e0db8c792443db4dc5d7821c20cab.gif"><br><br>  A distinctive feature of the Russian-speaking Twitter is the massive use of bots.  But on this issue - automatic Anti-bot system and its application in the industry - we will talk in a separate article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296224/</a></p>
