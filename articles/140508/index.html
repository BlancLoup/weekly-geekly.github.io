      Well, then, in fact, the second part, in which a brief description of everything that happened.  Call it conditionally ... <br><br><h4>  Nagging </h4>  It all started with the fact that Toshiba Tempro began to show pop-up tips, about the fact that a new BIOS is available for my laptop and I need to be updated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the official website of Toshiba took the update, which they recommended.  Followed all the instructions that they described there.  When updating issued an error "Verify Error".  Repeated attempt did not give result.  Decided to postpone this issue. <br><br>  The next time you restarted, the computer did not sound like it.  Symptoms - black screen, the hard drive indicator is constantly flashing and the cooler periodically starts to work, like breathing. <br><br>  I took a laptop in summer in Moscow, but now I live in Switzerland, just before I left, I took a new laptop for study.  In fairness it should be said that he was completely satisfied with me and worked like a clock.  At Toshiba international guarantee, in fact, it was one of the arguments in favor of the purchase. <br><br>  How the problem appeared - contacted the service center in Switzerland.  He described the whole problem, what he did, what happened.  When I began to look for similar problems - it turned out that there are hundreds of people with absolutely the same problem. <br>  Here are a few branches for example: <br>  <a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/Drivers-and-Utilities/Satellite-L755-S5216-BIOS-2-0-Update-leads-to-quot-VERIFY-ERROR/td-p/203226">Forums.toshiba.com/t5/Drivers-and-Utilities/Satellite-L755-S5216-BIOS-2-0-Update-leads-to-quot-VERIFY-ERROR/td-p/203226</a> <br>  <a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/Computer-Troubleshooting/Laptop-L755-dead-after-bios-install-attempt/td-p/205326">forums.toshiba.com/t5/Computer-Troubleshooting/Laptop-L755-dead-after-bios-install-attempt/td-p/205326</a> <br>  <a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/System-Recovery-and-Recovery/BIOS-L755-Beware-of-Toshiba-Fix/td-p/270171">forums.toshiba.com/t5/System-Recovery-and-Recovery/BIOS-L755-Beware-of-Toshiba-Fix/td-p/270171</a> <br><br>  And many wrote that they sent to Toshiba - they repaired under warranty. <br>  Here: <a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D45500">www.theeldergeek.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=45500</a> <br>  writes: <br>  ‚ÄúGuarantee-case ... 0 ‚Ç¨ costs, no data removed, everything allright =)‚Äû <br><br>  Threw all this info.  I also wrote that my warranty was valid and asked if my case was a warranty case.  To which they replied literally ‚Äúsend us a laptop, you have a guarantee until August 2012‚Äù. <br><br>  Without a second thought, I sent them a laptop, but after a couple of days, as they received it, they sent an invoice, where they say that my case is not guaranteed and they give a choice of two ways of development of events: <br>  - I pay 1350 CHF (this is about 1500 US dollars) and they fix it, it is indicated that it is necessary to replace the motherboard.  The new laptop is twice as cheap. <br>  - I refuse to repair, they send me a broken laptop back, but at the same time I have to pay 100 francs for their diagnostics. <br><br>  As a result, after the debate in the e-mail, the guys are behaving quite arrogantly, saying that they answered the guarantee to me - this is just general information, it doesn‚Äôt mean that I will receive repairs under warranty. <br><br>  Now I am waiting for official replies from Toshiba itself.  Still hoping that common sense in this company will take power.  But there is not much hope. <br><br>  I began to look at the reviews in more detail, Toshiba is famous for complete pofigism towards customers. <br>  There is a user on ebay, who is profiled to repair motherboards and bios errors on Toshiba laptops.  Since 2009, he has about 6,500 customers with 99.9% positive feedback.  It is worth thinking. <br><br>  I wrote him about my problem.  He replied that it looks like the bios chip is covered, but it is not necessary to change the motherboard, while of course.  Chip said it costs about 40 bucks.  It is a pity that he only works in the United States.  So would be the way out. <br><br>  In general, who else is thinking about choosing a laptop or other technology - draw conclusions and learn from the mistakes of others. <br>  Perhaps the Toshiba technology itself is not as bad as it was already said, there were no complaints, but if something happens, do not count on support. <br><br>  As an example of how this could be, I want to give the company Barnes &amp; Noble.  I have a book from them Nook.  So, I bought it relatively early in the launch.  And the first installments revealed a further defect - a button cracked on the side. <br><br>  So, despite the fact that I had a guarantee for it, I called in support, they said that we were going to a meeting - send us the cracked one, replace it with a new Nuk. <br><br>  The truth is not sent, because I thought that and so it will come down in the end, and sending to the states would be worth half the cost of the reading room at the time.  But the fact of customer focus pleased. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140508/</a></p>
