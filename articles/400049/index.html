  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HyperX Alloy FPS - Red, blue, brown - choose yourself any</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  As you know, you should never argue with someone who prints faster than you.  Yes, and play with those who are more agile fingers over the keyboard is not the most successful pastime.  Training, training and more training!  Well, high-quality sports equipment - for those who love themselves more than an opponent, HyperX gives the opportunity not only to use an excellent keyboard, but also to choose the type of switches for themselves. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/283846/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a39/9fb/026/a399fb02674a447199a965d64f964ace.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The updates use Cherry MX Red or Brown mechanical switches, the MX Blue version has already been <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278984/">in the hands of experts</a> .  This will allow each user to choose the keyboard with the most appropriate parameters for it - the force of pressing and the key stroke length before triggering.  In addition, the HyperX ALLOY FPS keyboard is full-sized, but takes up minimal space on the table and does not limit the freedom to move the mouse, which is very important for the FPS genre. <br><br>  <b><font color="#0057a0">Cherry MX blue</font></b> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bf/dfa/794/2bfdfa794176a8c163243854e5adc939.gif" align="right"><br><br>  The first option - switches, designed primarily for printing.  When you press, you first feel the increase in resistance, then - a sharp failure and actuation of the key.  The switches are loud, tactilely very clear and bright, but not the most comfortable for dynamic games such as shooters or any arcades.

      The fact is that the spring takes time to raise the transparent ‚Äúcap‚Äù and connect it to the pusher for re-work, and this delay between repeated presses of a single key, as well as the inability to make many quick burns ‚Äúon the verge of triggering‚Äù can let you down .  In principle, blue switches are also suitable for casual players, especially if you take into account the fact that when typing, they just give an incredible feeling and make you just fall in love with the typing process itself.  For more active players who are not ready to part with the pleasant sensations of printing, there is a second option. <br><br clear="all">  <b><font color="#604a35">Cherry MX Brown</font></b> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/031/567/f1b/031567f1bec4990b750c00212d865f57.gif" align="right"><br><br>  The "brown" line of microswitches is a compromise between speed and sensation.  Until recently, it was almost impossible to find a keyboard on them: manufacturers usually put on either the ‚Äúblue‚Äù series, or the ‚Äúblack‚Äù or ‚Äúred‚Äù series.  The moving element that ‚Äúfalls‚Äù down at the ‚Äúblue‚Äù ruler here is integral with the pusher.  Pay attention to the shape of the tongue that bends the spring: it has the same hump as the Cherry MX Blue, that is, the tactile click and the feeling of increasing resistance until the trigger point passes, but there is no audio clicker and return delay. <br><br>  The best option for those who love to drive and shooter, and pokodit (write a post) just a pleasant feeling of printing.  Well, for TRU-zadrotov (or lovers to sit at a computer at night) there is a third option. <br><br clear="all">  <b><font color="#be3b3b">Cherry MX red</font></b> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65f/31e/a1a/65f31ea1a2f86fa55d9413c154416837.gif" align="right"><br><br>  Red microswitches have a linear tongue.  They are the lightest in the Cherry MX line, they have no tactile click at the trigger point.  Pressing almost silent, not much different from high-quality keyboards in laptops, tactile - very soft and smooth.  In addition, softer springs are used in the ‚Äúred‚Äù line (the version with classic springs is called Cherry MX Black, but Alloy with such switches is not available). <br><br>  The red series is quite a rare guest in keyboards, and began to gain popularity just a year ago, when players tried out a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù line of switches and evaluated the decrease in finger fatigue in long gaming sessions.  Usually, keyboards are assembled with a ‚Äúblack‚Äù series, which has a higher resistance to pressing. <br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd1/91d/e4f/bd191de4f927431b88eaff8e986f1457.jpg"><br><br>  Red LED backlighting can work in six modes, including custom.  In addition, the keyboard supports a special game mode, in which the Windows button is turned off to avoid accidental clicks, as well as the anti-ghosting and N-Key rollover (NKRO) functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e9/ae5/f61/3e9ae5f613ca4c468a2262dedcd74047.jpg"><br>  To make it even more convenient for players, there is a USB port in the back of HyperX ALLOY FPS for charging various devices, and the keyboard is supplied with interchangeable red WASD / 1234 keys, a removable cable in a fabric braid and a soft case to protect the device during transportation. <br><br>  Gaming mechanical keyboard ALLOY FPS is already available in HyperX distributors and online stores.  The recommended retail price of the novelty is 8,990 rubles.  All keyboards are protected by a two-year limited warranty and legendary HyperX service quality.  But on New Year's Eve, various wonders happen and we offer a discount of 1,500 rubles for <a href="https://goo.gl/uP5agS">HyperX Alloy gaming mechanical keyboards</a> in the DNS!  The promotion applies to models with switches Cherry MX Blue / Red / Brown is valid until December 25.  Hurry up, there are not many good keyboards. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400049/</a></p>
