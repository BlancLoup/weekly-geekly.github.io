Let you not be deceived by its apparent simplicity.  This, at first glance, boring black leather glove without fingers, which looks like any other from a sports store, with the help of micro-vibrations can speed up the process of learning, for example, melodies for the piano! <a name="habracut"></a>

      “I have a glove that can teach you how to play the piano,” <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/">Chad Starner</a> tells me when I called him to talk about the future of wearable computing devices.  At the moment, he is a professor at the Georgia State Technical Institute, as well as the technical director of Google Glass.  His acquaintance with the sphere of wearable gadgets began in the years of student life at MIT in the nineties. <br>  “While we were talking with you, you could have already learned“ Oh, Grace ”(Amazing Grace),” he adds at the end of our conversation. <br>  "True?  - I do not believe him - while we talk? <br>  “Of course,” he says, and invites me to Atlanta so that I can see for myself. <br><br>  And now <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~cseim6/Pubs.html">Caitlin Sejm</a> , a graduate student, puts a miracle glove on my hand.  In each of the five holes for the fingers is a flat vibration motor.  All five lie on the phalanxes of my fingers and are connected to the micro controller on the back of my hand.  The Sejm has programmed it so that it starts the motors on my fingers in a sequence that repeats the one with which my fingers should strike the piano keys. <br><br>  But she still does not tell me what kind of melody I will study.  “You just feel a little vibration,” she says, including electronics.  Right after that, Starner leads me to look around in his lab.  He works on a myriad of different projects: a translator program for Google Glass, a magnetic implant for a language to give silent commands to a computer, a smart vest that will help divers to “communicate” with dolphins, “smart” toys for police dogs so that trainers can better understand that they are trying to show them and many more amazing gadgets. <br><br>  Once a minute, in the continuation of the next two hours, the motors in my glove come to life and I try to make out the sequence: <i>vzhzhzh ... middle finger ... vzhzhzh ... unnamed ... vzhzhzh ... vzhzhzh ... oh ... vzhzhzh ... uh ... vzhzhzh ... vzhzhzh ...</i>  "Impossible," I write down in my notebook. <br><br>  Finally, Starner leads me to the piano.  He plays the first part of the melody - 15 notes that the glove should have taught me.  I recognize the melody - this is “Ode to Joy,” Beethoven.  I take off the glove. <br><br>  “Start from here,” says Starner, tapping the first key with his finger.  I put my fingers on the keys ... <i>Middle finger ... middle ... unnamed ...</i> "I don't know," I say, confused. <br><br>  “Don't you think about it,” says Starner. <br><br>  And I start again: <i>Middle ... middle ... nameless ... little finger ... little finger ... nameless ... middle ... index ...</i> "Go crazy!" - I say, continuing, nevertheless, to play.  I finish the first part, the second and start playing the third. <br><br>  “Wait!  - Starner interrupts me, - have you ever played this tune? " <br><br>  “Never,” I reply.  And it's true, never took piano lessons.  Confused, he examines the glove and discovers that it was programmed to “vibrate” all four parts - 61 notes, instead of 15, as he thought.  He explains that usually students teach one part at a time. <br><br>  I come to the piano again.  The first few attempts are still difficult.  I have to learn the melody, no matter what, but after a few minutes I can play the melody perfectly.  The feeling that I have come across one of my undiscovered talents does not leave me, and from this I feel pleasant excitement. <br><br>  “You just know what you should do, don't you?” The Seimas notes.  She recently learned how to play Ode Joy wearing a glove while preparing an application for a new research grant.  “It's like looking at someone else’s hand,” she laughs at me. <br><br>  Starner and his colleagues believe that the multiple vibrations that a glove creates stimulate muscle memory, which, in turn, reduces the time it takes to rehearse.  They also examined the effect of the glove on people with spinal injuries and found that it can help them partially regain the sensitivity of the hands.  Now Starner’s laboratory is trying to find a glove also in teaching the alphabet of the blind - this would show that this technology can help to study not just the sequence, but also the language. <br><br>  “We ourselves do not know the limits of this technology,” says Starner.  “Can we use these vibrations to teach people how to dance?”  Or, for example, to teach baseball players better to throw the ball? " <br><br>  He also recalls the scene from the Matrix, where Neo and Trinity sit in a helicopter and, if Neo asks if Trinity is able to fly, she replies: “Not yet ...” And after a second, her eyelids tremble while knowledge is pumped into her head . <br><br>  “Well, you can't do this,” I say. <br><br>  Starner replies to me with a grin: "Not yet ...." <br><br>  Ps.  Hi Habr!  This is my first translation.  It’s just that the article seemed very interesting and thought that, perhaps, someone else would consider it as such.  I would be glad to constructive criticism in the messages or in the comments.  All successfully spend the rest of Friday. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224737/</a></p>
