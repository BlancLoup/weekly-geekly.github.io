  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About habr, politics, history and thinking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new post, again born in battles in Habr√©, where we in a dispute with Novikov unexpectedly moved away from the topic of ‚Äúcattle and patriots‚Äù on the topic of democracy and the selling intelligentsia and the situation in the country as a whole :) <br><br>  Somehow he always believed that a technical and engineering mindset, which is assumed to be among the visitors of Habr, a priori cannot uncritically perceive information.  But in the hot of verbal battles, it turned out that it was not.  People give "facts" that can not really argue.  Or there was a jump from the topic, such as Novodvorskaya is not a human rights activist, it is impossible to judge all human rights defenders by it, in response to my, it seems to me, fair observation that human rights activists put on our rights, they are interested in working out Western grants or internal political dividends. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Specifically, our rights are protected only by lawyers and only for money.  Either the police on the application - and this is in fact the case.  In the police - the same people.  How on habr, for example.  And there are normal, there are freaks. <br><br>  Here gaytsov mentioned, such as extorting bitches money.  For what is broken.  Oh, scoundrels, I violated the rules, and they freeze the money - so pay the fine on the receipt, and not on the leg, come on, if you are so smart. <br>  In addition, I‚Äôm probably very lucky, but they caught me on a violation (insignificant) only once, and then, in response to their proposal ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do,‚Äù my answer was ‚Äúto mentally spank and endure harsh public censure‚Äù, to which they laughed merrily and wished a happy journey.  Probably I should have been not joking, but I‚Äôd figure out, send them to hell - then they would show their bestial appearance - but no, they didn‚Äôt grow together.

      Farther. <br><br>  For some reason, a certain part of habrovchan has the opinion that in the west, in America everything is white and fluffy, and we have chaos and a scribe full. <br><br>  Here today is an interesting translation from the American forum, and, surprisingly, practically the same words about our government and officials, like the defender of human rights defenders Novikov about ours yesterday.  You can take a look at the full version here <a href="http://www.inosmi.ru/stories/07/03/16/3506/242202.html">www.inosmi.ru/stories/07/03/16/3506/242202.html</a> , and I will give a few excerpts: <br><blockquote>  Here you are - the judge of the Supreme Court and concurrently the ‚Äúbushist‚Äù appointee Antonin Scalia, or Clarence Tom (Clarence Tom), or Dick Cheney, or Karl Rove (Scooter Libby ( "Scooter" Libby) - yes, the name of them, the villains-bushists, LEGION.  They can even throw anyone under the bus if the neocon program and right-wing fanaticism demands it.  America is becoming like the MIRROR REFLECTION of some repressive regimes.  Lord, send victory to Barack Obama: we simply cannot allow our country to become fascist or Soviet! </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The right to commit a crime has become another privilege of a US official.  No one will be punished if the victim of the crime itself does not make a fuss.  If the victim appeals to the public, she is necessarily severely punished.  The fact of appealing to the public is considered opposition to the regime.  And who set such rules of the game?  Who never punishes his friends?  Bush. <br><br>  Death teams roam the insolvent Florida state, shooting people.  People are shot in the presence of witnesses - in public places, on market squares, at bus stops, and then they put automatic weapons on the corpses, take pictures and pass them off for the 'dead democrats'. <br><br>  And who gave the order to compile these lists?  Who could have thought that to fight the spread of northern freedom throughout the South Democrats need to be cut clean, like chickens, for convictions, not for the crimes they committed?  Such an order would have been impossible to give without the knowledge of Bush. <br><br>  In the South, people read that Bush regained the power of Washington and strengthened the ruling oligarchy.  This is the image of Russia trying to spread Ketchum.  He insists: perhaps there is neither law nor freedom in Bush America, but then there is crime in America. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  In Washington, the police shot and killed a 14-year-old boy, who kind of stole a motor scooter and, as it were, fired a pistol, which was never found.  By the way, at the crime scene, they also did not find either cartridges or bullets - not counting the one that naturally the boy had in his head </blockquote><br><blockquote>  We elect our leaders, but as Dick Cheney put it, ‚Äúand what of it?‚Äù  As soon as our elected officials move to Washington, they turn into the lackeys of corporations, safely forgetting those lofty, inspiring words with which they persuaded simpletons to vote for themselves. </blockquote><br><br>  Interesting, isn't it?  :) <br><br>  What conclusion can be made from this? <br><br>  Probably, in any country, the state apparatus is to some extent corrupt, because careerists make their way there, as a rule, the saints go to the monastery or where else.  And probably in any country you can find a bunch of facts of lawlessness of the security forces. <br>  But!  - to make sure that the state doesn‚Äôt go too far is the will and right of the people. <br><br>  Do not give bribes - contact the police, help to take red-handed.  Do not pay bribes to traffic cops, pay a fine.  Do not pass by a person lying on the asphalt - call the ambulance at last or to the police. <br><br>  When I said that we have a state of law, they laughed merrily in response.  And what is it not legal, what the fuck, you still do not have enough laws?  Everything is there, only if everyone is seeking fulfillment of their rights?  There is no state in which, instead of you, your rights will be protected. <br><br>  Remember - the people and society are you.  And your daily deed and choice falls into the overall image of society.  And do not blame the mirror, if face is crooked. <br><br>  Love your country, protect your country, make it better.  You by car gave way to pedestrians with a smile - you made a wonderful mood to half of the pedestrians, someone, in response, nodding and smiling at you, passing by.  There is a car at a turn, nobody misses - skip.  Do not die. <br><br>  And do not believe, never believe anyone‚Äôs word :) You have an Internet at hand, you can find any facts, opinions, figures, get acquainted with everyone - yes, yes :) With everyone.  For it is impossible to form your opinion, having familiarized yourself with one point of view - this is how you will compose yourself the point of view of the one with whose point of view you have become acquainted with, and not your suffering :) <br><br>  Just love to live :) And live with taste, with pleasure, savoring every moment of your life - no matter how hard it is around.  Happiness is a state of mind, not a collection of surrounding circumstances. <br><br>  Well, if you think that your country is shit, ask yourself - and who are you then?  Worm?  Tapeworm? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27974/</a></p>
