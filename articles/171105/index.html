  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VK.Ratsiya: voice messages VKontakte</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Millions of people daily communicate with their friends and relatives on the VKontakte network, using either the website or various mobile applications.  In both cases, text messages remain the same way to exchange information.  Although it is not always convenient.  For example, if you are driving and do not want to be distracted from the road, or when you often communicate with friends from different countries and cities (or even from the same city, but with different work schedules or studies), it is difficult for you to get together on Skype to discuss urgent issues. affairs  That is why we created a free VK.Ration app for iOS and Android, which allows you to instantly exchange voice messages with VK friends, without being distracted from other matters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can chat in private conversations, create group chats and (this is a truly unique feature) use the walkie-talkie in existing VKontakte communities.  In addition, the history of messages will be saved on the community wall and each participant can listen to messages in any browser in real time! <br><br>  Imagine the situation: you left for work and forgot that you closed the cat on the balcony.  While the cat freezes, your wife takes a shower.  In a familiar situation, you would have called, but she would not hear the bell.  Probably, it is better to write a text message or a VKontakte message, but for this you need to look at the road with one eye, and at the phone with the other, and also hit the keys.  As a result, you will spend at least half a minute to convey a few words.  VK.Ration will allow you to leave a voice message for a couple of seconds, which will be instantly delivered via Push and your wife will see it in the same way as an SMS or an incoming VKontakte message.  Special mention deserves the fact that the mobile traffic VK.Rtsii consumes very moderately: a voice message in 5 seconds will ‚Äúcost‚Äù you about 10Kb. <br><br><img src="http://vkracia.ru/assets/images/image_cat.png" alt="image">

      Or, for example, you and your friends decided to go to Lviv.  Part of your company wants first of all to take a walk along the ancient streets of the city, see the magnificent architecture, climb the City Hall and visit the High Castle.  The rest want to look into the famous Lviv coffee shops and pastry shops.  Some certainly want to visit the famous restaurants with national flavor.  In such a situation, it is very important to keep in touch with each other and share impressions, but in the basement room of a coffee shop your phone may be out of reach, and then you will not be able to call or send SMS.  Fortunately, in many cafes and restaurants there is wi-fi, so with VK.Ratsii you will always be in touch, even without connecting to the operator‚Äôs network.  Moreover, a voice message, as opposed to a VKontakte or SMS message, is much more convenient to send on the move, climbing the Castle Hill. <br><br>  Unlike other walkie-talkie applications (Voxer, Zello), with VK.Ration there is no need to register in _eshe_ one service to communicate and persuade your friends to do the same, because almost everyone has a VK account, at least just to listen to music.  Therefore, all that is required is to install the free application on the phone and log in with your existing VK account. <br>  VK.Ratsiya fully integrated with VKontakte: your list of friends, groups and meetings is immediately available in the application. <br><br>  It is important to note that VK.Ratsiya works in live mode.  Those.  as soon as you press the voice message recording button, all the chat participants can hear you.  This allows you to communicate without delay in the transmission and reception of the message. <br><br>  The application is free and available for download in Google Play and iTunes App Store. <br>  The application has a website <a href="http://vkracia.ru/">vkracia.ru</a> and VKontakte page <a href="http://vk.com/vk.racia">vk.com/vk.racia</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171105/</a></p>
