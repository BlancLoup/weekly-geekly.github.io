  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphones and business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am a developer for IOS and in the process of developing mobile applications I had a definite opinion on the place of smartphones in the business and what changes they bring to it. <br>  With this post I‚Äôm hoping to open a small discussion, I‚Äôm interested in the B2B market and I‚Äôm very interested in whether there is any new niche that a small team or a loner can get into.  For example, squeezing into the market of non-cash payments may seem like a crazy undertaking, however - in October, <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> spent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/square-now-seeing-10-billion-in-annual-payments/">$ 2 billion in</a> payments in October. <br><br>  A small discussion began in the comments and I periodically edit the post, bringing in a brief summary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many large corporations are already giving out to their employees working smartphones and tablets.  And their computing power is such that they can do everything the same thing that could be done on personal computers about 4 years ago, of course I mean ordinary office machines, not home gaming systems, and workstations of graphics processing specialists. <br>  All that needs to be done to turn a modern smartphone from the mid-price range (iphone, samsung galaxy, ...) into a workstation of a typical office employee is to connect a wireless keyboard with a touchpad and an external monitor to it. <br>  And here the most interesting begins - in order to turn this workstation into a full-fledged workplace, you only need to run software on them that meets the needs of a particular business. <br>  The smaller the business, the faster the transition occurs; now many small businesses can satisfy their software needs using cloud applications.  In a small company, bookkeeping is usually outsourced, or it is done in one of the online systems ( <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">Elba</a> , <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">My Business</a> ), documents can already be handled in <a href="http://docs.google.com/">google docs</a> or in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office365/">office 365</a> , payments can be made using a smartphone and a piece of hardware costing $ 100 which reads data from a map ( <a href="http://www.mobile-terminal.ru/">Termite</a> or <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> ).  A <a href="http://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a> or <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">Megaplan</a> perfectly cover the needs of small businesses in the management of projects. <br><br>  The larger the business, the stronger it is tied to existing products, but even then there is a tendency to move the software to the cloud, for example office 365 and exchange online, you can use even today, in general already now Microsoft Office 365 includes Exchange, Sharepoint, Lync, Microsoft Office 2010. <br>  The larger the business, the greater the need for confidentiality, managing groups of people, controlling access to documents, etc.  But there is RIM, which quite recently was practically the standard in large corporations, and it achieved this precisely due to the careful and careful handling of someone else's information.  It is quite possible that she will remember this again, since they still have a reputation and connections. <br>  The larger the monster, the harder it is for it to deploy its sails in the wind, and it is possible that many companies will work tomorrow not in Microsoft Office, but in a cloudy alternative from startups who smelled the wind of change.  Yes, yes, startups like Google, Paypal, Facebook - they all came to an already occupied niche. <br>  When I write that small companies have a chance to find their niche, it is worth considering that a small company is a very conditional category, for solving one problem, a small one can be considered a company of 5 people, and for another of 100 people.

      This is not the next "Vendekapets" - this is the evolutionary development of the market. <br><br>  PS: <br>  A simple example from my life - materials from customers come in a variety of formats, only Microsoft‚Äôs 10 piece formats. And instead of buying Microsoft Office, I simply open documents online, since they are usually attached to a letter and I don‚Äôt even download anything need to. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161909/</a></p>
