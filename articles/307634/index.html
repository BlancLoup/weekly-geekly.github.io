This gadget first appeared in 2007 and defined the vector of development of the entire mobile market for several years to come.  Before him, many devices managed to compete for the title of the ‚Äúmain‚Äù phone.  Today we remember the best-selling "non-iPhones" of all times and peoples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2016, the smartphone helps to solve most of the daily tasks, but the devices that ‚Äúcould‚Äù only make and exchange SMS have not yet disappeared from memory.  We witnessed several bursts of mass interest in various gadgets: the first available cellular phones, clamshells, communicators, telephone players, digital telephones, and finally smart phones. <br><h4>  Nokia </h4><br>  <b>Best-selling model</b> : 1100 <br>  <b>Year of release</b> : 2003 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 250 million <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82b/18c/b93/82b18cb9355f422880fd3dd84cd9a576.jpg">

      The Finnish company Nokia a few months before Apple announced the sale of the billionth phone.  They became the Nokia 1100, sold in Nigeria.  Total phones of this model sold more than 250 million. <br>  The Nokia 1100, which appeared in 2003, seemed to be a step backwards compared to the competitors' phones: it was only able to make and send SMS messages, and also had an alarm clock, a flashlight and a standard set of simple games.  It had a monochrome screen (although the first phone with a Siemens S10 color screen appeared back in 1997) and there was no camera, which by this time was already on several models (Sharp J-SH04 in 2000, Nokia 7650 in 2002). ).  Nevertheless, due to its simplicity and super-reliability, the phone has become the absolute sales leader.  The price, which initially was less than 100 euros, also played its role.  Reliable phone was due to the durable keyboard, completely eliminating the ingress of moisture or dust, and tightly assembled rubberized case. <br>  Three years before the leader, in 2000, Nokia introduced the eternal Nokia 3310, which, in spite of everything, did not become the most popular (126 million copies sold), but gained cult-like status due to its high strength.  Model 1100 has survived 3310, which was discontinued in 2005, and was produced until 2009. <br><br><h4>  Motorola </h4><br>  <b>Best-selling model</b> : RAZR V3 <br>  <b>Year of release</b> : 2004 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 130 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d2/3b4/370/5d23b437042e4233b65b3f50ccd47d5c.jpg"><br><br>  While Nokia was conquering emerging markets with simple models like bricks, Motorola launched a high-tech phone, which later became the most successful for the company.  For 12 quarters in a row from 2004 to 2008, it remained the most popular in the world, altogether over 130 million copies were sold.  The price of 449 dollars was higher than that of most competing models, but the phone was distinguished by an unusual design.  He had an ultrathin profile, while the keyboard, made of a metal plate, was equipped with an electroluminescent backlight. <br><br>  Not the most outstanding technical characteristics, features of the interface of the operating system, not a very successful camera - all this did not matter to users.  Motorola was the first company to prove that the design could sell the phone, despite various shortcomings. <br><br><h4>  Samsung </h4><br>  <b>Best selling model</b> : E1100 <br>  <b>Year of manufacture</b> : 2009 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 150 million <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/866/d2a/225/866d2a2252bd4747af53408fad79d0e7.jpg"><br><br>  The main success in terms of sales for Samsung was the E1100, introduced in 2009.  The phone won customers about $ 40 and a battery capable of holding a charge for 13 days.  As a result, 150 million copies of this model were sold. <br><br>  Samsung Galaxy can repeat success.  In the race of smartphones, the company is constantly increasing its characteristics: the display becomes larger, the resolution and pixel density are higher.  The frequency of the processor grows, the screen starts to bend, but every year the wow-effect of the new gadget decreases.  In today's realities, the public takes restrainedly even innovative solutions.  So far, the number of sold Galaxy has reached only 80 million. <br><br><h4>  Siemens </h4><br>  <b>The most sold model</b> : A50 <br>  <b>Year of release</b> : 2002 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 15 million <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d3/a4e/b49/3d3a4eb49ba549408ee14bde8726f46e.jpg"><br><br>  The production of Siemens mobile phones ceased in 2005, but it is not difficult to find people for whom these phones have forever remained the best in their class.  Back in 1996, the production of the Siemens S10, the world's first phone with a color display (four colors were displayed: red, blue, green and white) and a voice recorder began.  In the same year, the first phone appeared with enhanced protection from external influences Siemens S10 Active. <br><br>  One of the most successful phones was the Siemens A50, an inexpensive entry-level device with a minimum of functions.  It sold 15 million phones.  The entire series of A did not differ in broad functionality - it was a series of reliable devices equipped with the most necessary (calls and SMS).  A monochrome screen was installed in the phone, and among the pre-installed applications there was even a place for several games.  However, in our country, the most popular models were Siemens C65 / CX65. <br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson </h4><br>  <b>Best-selling model</b> : K750i <br>  <b>Year of release</b> : 2005 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 15 million <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/622/3e0/4d3/6223e04d3b714211be2adbf20c5e25c6.jpg"><br><br>  Many models of Ericsson did not become super popular, although in many respects they were very good.  The relatively low price and the availability of various functions (for example, one of the first Bluetooth applications) for many users made these phones their favorite. <br>  According to many expert estimates, the K750i was the best Sony Ericsson phone ever.  It has been installed 2-megapixel camera with autofocus - this is one of the first decisions on the market, warmly received by users.  Also, the phone was equipped with an MP3 player and a memory card slot.  For a long time, the company set the standard among the built-in cameras and the quality of the resulting images. <br>  K750i has become one of the first phones targeted at music lovers.  Although he had an excellent camera, he was still more popular as a player.  Around the same years, it became fashionable to listen to music through the external speakers of the phone - regardless of their quality. <br>  It sold 15 million copies of this phone. <br><br><h4>  HTC </h4><br>  <b>Top selling model</b> : Thunderbolt <br>  <b>Year of release</b> : 2011 <br>  <b>Number of copies sold</b> : 16 million <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/280/aad/cb5/280aadcb52e8402e95aad6b210137271.jpg"><br><br>  The best-selling HTC phone, the Thunderbolt, sold 16 million copies of this model.  It was a powerful (for 2011) Android 2.2 smartphone with a 4.3-inch touchscreen display.  The novelty appeared as a support for the 4G network launched in the USA, however it became popular around the world. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  In 2016, brands that are not found in our list fall into the ratings of best-selling smartphones: Google Nexus, Oneplus, ASUS, Xiaomi, Huawei.  With increasing competition (and the successful entry of Chinese companies to the market), gadgets are getting better and more affordable.  With such a variety it is difficult to predict who will get to the top in ten years, and we can only guess which brand will sell its billionth smartphone next. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307634/</a></p>
