  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Indicators of remote monitoring of their own health</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear users, by chance I stumbled upon an article a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/259590/">doctor in the cloud</a> and found there are no longer new, but very promising ideas with regard to monitoring indicators of their own health.  After a careful study of the article itself and all the comments, it becomes clear that users are well aware of all the technical components of the issue (still, this is the GT), but often they don‚Äôt understand what kind of monitoring is being discussed, that is, they don‚Äôt understand the medical side of the issue. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Proverb</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <s>Everyone knows how to heal and how to teach.</s> <br></div></div><br>  <b>The purpose of this post is</b> to highlight several of the most frequently used, most useful, and, most importantly, the most accessible monitoring indicators, which can later be used to create a doctor-in-the-cloud system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I would like to outline that no sensible doctor will advise you without an examination and the maximum amount of data that he can collect.  Your finger hurts, or suddenly the pain of a piercing character in your heart, you are choking at night, or your urine has suddenly become blood-red - no one will confine herself to advice on the phone or, in the future, cloud service.  The doctor really needs to personally see the patient, send him to the maximum number of tests so as not to be mistaken with the diagnosis and prescribe the correct treatment.  Therefore, cloud services, from my point of view, are useful only for warning the patient about the need to go to the doctor. <br><br><h4>  Monitoring </h4><br><h5>  Pulse Oximetry </h5><br>  Pulse Oximeter is a device that measures the level of saturation of capillary blood.  In simple terms, it measures the saturation of capillary blood with oxygen.  The greater the oxygen saturation, the better.  Normally, the saturation value is high and varies within small limits.  Norm of Sp02: 95 - 100. With 100% saturation, 4 molecules of oxygen are attached to each hemoglobin molecule.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãlower than 95 are considered hypoxic states, that is, states in which the body suffers a lack of oxygen.

      There are two types of pulse oximetry: transmission and reflected.  In transmission pulse oximetry, the light beam is transmitted through the tissues of the body after passing through the tissue, the light flux is analyzed by the sensor.  With reflected pulse oximetry, reflected light is analyzed.  The advantage of reflected pulse oximetry is that it is permissible to mount the sensor to any part of the body, and with transmission only to certain places (earlobe, finger, nose wing).  In practice, gearboxes are more often used: they are cheaper and have less error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/eb7/6d1/8d1eb76d182043e0b1b6b39c74b71598.jpg"><br>  <i>This is a transmission pulse oximeter.</i>  <i>Yes, there are special sensors even for the iPhone.</i> <br><br>  <i>Estimated cost of a household system</i> : $ 30-50.  The sensor itself is cheaper, monitoring on the screen of the smartphone or the fitness gadget itself in the form of a bracelet (Apple watch, Microsoft Band, Google Fit, etc.), so the price of $ 10 will be adequate. <br>  <i>What is useful</i> : allows you to evaluate the functional state of the body, to suspect respiratory and heart failure <br><br><h5>  Arterial pressure </h5><br>  Blood pressure is the pressure that blood exerts on the vessel wall.  There are two ways to measure blood pressure: invasive and non-invasive.  Invasive is not suitable by definition (a cannula or a catheter in the vessel lumen is needed), the standard, well-known Korotkoff non-invasive method, with a cuff and a phonendoscope, remains.  The principle of action is as follows: the cuff is inflated, blocking the blood flow in the vessel, then gradually deflates.  The first blow heard in the phonendoscope corresponds to the opening of the pressure vessel exceeding the pressure in the cuff.  This is systolic pressure.  The last audible tone will correspond to diastolic pressure.  In modern automatic sphygmomanometers, the phonendoscope is replaced with a Doppler (or oscillographic) sensor, but the essence of the process remains the same. <br><br>  Just want to add that any automatic device requires calibration.  It was necessary to meet more than once with a situation when the patient's personal device was mistaken at 10‚Äì20 mm Hg, which in certain situations can be critical. <br><br>  Normal blood pressure: &lt;130 / &lt;85 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/78d/7d9/73a78d7d9d1045cf93d59b452af7198e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Estimated cost of the entire device</i> : $ 30 <br>  <i>What is useful</i> : allows you to determine hypertensive / hypotonic crises, arterial hypertension, to monitor the effectiveness of drugs. <br><br><h5>  Electrocardiogram </h5><br>  Surely the combination of letters ECG excites in memory not the most pleasant image of the couch and a large number of colored wires.  At the moment there are several options for placement of electrodes on the chest.  In addition to the standard (3 on the limbs, 1 ground, 6 breast), in the intensive care unit placement of electrodes across the Sky is popular. <br><br>  In order to remove the ECG in the sky, three electrodes are superimposed on the chest of the subject: <br><ul><li>  the first (red) is established in the second intercostal space to the right of the sternum; </li><li>  the second (yellow) - in the fifth intercostal space on the back axillary line to the left; </li><li>  the third (green) - the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line on the left. </li></ul><br>  The difference of potentials between these points turns into an electrocardiogram, which allows the doctor to evaluate the smallest deviations in the work of the heart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/533/576/6d7/5335766d73a14c58ac9f6894a7c03742.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The estimated cost of the entire device</i> : the most simple electrocardiographs cost $ 150.  But in the case of a ‚Äúdoctor in the cloud‚Äù, all the functionality is not needed, the simplest modes are enough, which will significantly reduce the cost (sorry, I haven‚Äôt found anything like this on the network, only standard cardiographs). <br>  <i>What is useful</i> : Diagnosis of most heart diseases (arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, ischemic heart disease, angina, heart attack).  There are a number of diseases (almost all heart defects) that do not have specific manifestations on the ECG.  But even such diseases can be suspected and send the patient to a full examination. <br><br><h5>  Summing up </h5><br>  And if all of the above is performed in full and presented graphically, we will get a standard monitor of the intensive care unit (well, almost). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/cc6/b17/baacc6b17cd74213baab6efe022d3cff.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  In general, I see the "doctor in the cloud" system as a kind of bracelet gadget, preferably with a monitor, to which you can attach all of the above sensors.  In turn, this gadget will send information to the doctor, with whom there must be feedback (from dietitian advice to emergency medical care).  And of course, this ‚Äúcloud‚Äù must be protected first and foremost in order to keep medical secrecy. <br><br>  Concerning the price of the question: according to the most dashing calculations, for $ 200 it will be possible to purchase a full set of medical sensors.  <s>The future is not as close as it seems</s> <br><br>  Thanks for reading! <br><br>  I am pleased to answer all questions on the medical side, talk about the topic of medicine and the future.  Especially valuable will be the attention of the author of the first article, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ukod/" class="user_link">ukod</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367907/</a></p>
