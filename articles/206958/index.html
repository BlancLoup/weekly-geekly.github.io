  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When does a sales manager become a programmer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having worked in the banking sector for 3 years, then 7 years in trade, I did not know the answer to this question. <br><br>  After the personal crisis of 2009, when the staff was disbanded with me, and my wife was transferred to another city, they were more precisely faced with a choice - either a reduction or a transfer, we didn‚Äôt have much choice. <br><br>  I had time to reconsider my views on employers and look for other sources of income.  I have always loved the IT field - in my childhood I read magazines on iron in tons, and as a teenager I was engaged in assembling computers, overclocking, and any other crap inherent in this age. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I found an idea for myself and became obsessed with its realization - an online food store. <br>  Called many web-studios in the district, in search of developers.  Of course, having heard the first sums for the implementation of the full package of the store, with the exchange with 1C, with feedback, with a personal account, I was in the heat of passion for a long time.  Prices did not suit me, and there were no such opportunities.

      There was only one way out - do it yourself.  At that time, I knew one web programmer who worked in a good studio in my city of Che.  He then revealed many cards to me and reveals and helps to this day, for which he thanks a lot. <br><br>  The name was invented, I will keep silence, so as not to be considered advertising.  The logo was developed by personal forces, the initial knowledge of Corel was not let down.  Further, the question was in the choice of CMS, the result of the choice is also not announced, for the same reason. <br><br>  In general, the development of my first project took about one year, given the fact that I did not have a specialized education and in general any understanding of the programming language.  For me, the word tag was new, and the html code was a chaotic character set. <br>  For the year, a lot of tea was drunk, a lot of text was read and a huge amount of video was viewed on the tube.  The result was, the sacrifice was my personal time.  A template was purchased for some other engine.  The template has been reworked, modified and stretched on the selected CMS.  Here it is - ready. <br><br>  A year later, we returned to our hometown because of the departure on the decree of my wife.  Online shop I have been modifying.  This all began to die - my work on the project, faded desire to implement it to the end.  It also served as a pretext for leaving the business of the Moscow Onovamnad online store, which was rapidly developing before that.  The reasons are a small margin, high logistics costs, short shelf life for many foods, traffic jams. <br><br>  The question was - "what's next?"  Then I went to freelance to look for orders for the development of sites, logos.  I have improved in the development of logos and the development of template sites / stores.  At first these were minor css edits, site design changes, cheap wages, dumping.  At that time I had basic knowledge of html + css, good knowledge of xslt, knowledge in logo design.  Then began the period of sale of ready-made templates and gradually programming began to crowd out the work and time spent on logos. <br><br>  I realized that it took me more time to search for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa logo than to implement it at times.  It was ineffective.  And I liked programming, making sites more.  I gave up the graphic part of my development, gave it to the outsider to other freelancers.  And it was right, but I had even less personal time.  So was the second year. <br><br>  Then I started working on quality and portfolio, there were already regular customers, I could choose with whom to work, and with whom not.  For the first two years, faced with freelancing fraud, in the total amount was thrown at 100,000 rubles.  I treated this with a 50% prepayment, which I still don‚Äôt regret.  In September 2012, at one of the freelance exchanges that was known to everyone, the management turned the growth of attendance and resource awareness into a slow drop to this day.  With it, and my income, and orders.  Since June 2013, revenues from the freelance exchange are zero.  Perhaps this is my tightening pricing policy for the development of sites has played such a role.  I do not judge - the fact is a fact. <br><br>  Now I am on the verge of forming a studio in my city; goals and priorities for implementation are set.  My second child was born - a son.  And with him were born and new priorities. <br><br>  There is an expression - ‚ÄúIf you want to become a professional in your field, spend ten thousand hours on it.‚Äù  I can say for sure that this does not apply to programming, for these 10,000 hours have passed.  All my efforts and effort, I am sure, will pay off. <br>  There are two ways to increase the profitability of any business - this is either more work, which is unlikely at 150% load, or scale. <br><br>  It's time to become a manager again, but the manager of your projects, your implementations, the manager of your life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206958/</a></p>
