These modest sea workers creak softly on their keyboards, in half-open cubicles with one or two Windows and powerful professional oars in the interface.  Their contribution to our projects is invaluable, and yet, we always think about how to make it even more significant. <br><br>  After all, what happens is that free boatmen on weekends sometimes have time to hit the Libyan coast, click on the lions there, bring skins to the next bazaar and have very good investments for them.  So it would be good for ours to fan the fire of enthusiasm.

      Our team of gallery owners is very friendly.  Separate them can only dismissal.  It is about such songs that they sing: they are bound by the same goal, bound by one ... And so they would help them to wave straight across the sea in two days, and there our warriors would shoot the lions.  Usually, a detour along the coast takes two weeks, but after all, boatmen are able to do their best and drive straight.  It would seem that our difference? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c5/052/5a0/5c50525a022417e94c42999c822c5667.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the weekend, we decided that we would not force them to work - it‚Äôs just humanly pitiful when on Monday the best workers at times give the ends of oars to newcomers, when according to the plan they have to move around the neighboring cities, sell olives and buy manufactory, and quietly retire, throwing back the sandals.  Also, they are not very talkative in our country, therefore, the hanging cycles are performed for them, and in order to write a review here in the chat - you will not get ready.  In fact, they have no status.  When our glorious managers hold advice on the bridge, galalers work. <br><br>  Therefore, do not see that we are all about ourselves and about ourselves - we have such a job - to talk about ourselves and inspire the group, make a team of them.  In which we will be leading. <br><br>  As always, the prize is supposed to be a shock work - rest on a deserted shore, with the opportunity to take refuge at the rocks and sit at the well, replenish the supplies of spent water, so that later with new forces you can earn a pottage.  If such attacks are often not done, once a month they happily obey the call to go on a new campaign. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/0d9/a7b/3c40d9a7b5c6034a9298d7b7a6013cce.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>(copy; artist A. Baikin)</i> <br><br><h3>  Why does this work? </h3><br>  1. Because we feed our gallery owners.  Many teams did not reach the shore, because in the middle of the day they forgot to feed their labor.  We have lunch - on schedule. <br><br>  2. Because we drag the weak.  And with the help of others we are gradually striving to be thrown overboard on an equal footing. <br><br>  3. Because we do not forget to praise our boss, who built this ship and hired us to go back and forth and increase its wealth. <br><br>  4. Because we do not drive workers all the time, but give them a break every 5 minutes in half an hour. <br><br>  5. Yes, and on the shore, they can rest, and not wear, say, a tent and a fur tree behind us. <br><br><h3>  Why are we in the future waiting for success? </h3><br>  Of course, not everyone can work with us.  Not everyone has proven so resilient.  But we try to pick up a team that will not let us down in the storms and work on our future every day.  Be observant on your bridge, and success will haunt you in every port, wherever you go.  Do not lose the coldness of the spirit, looking through the side of the block - do not forget that you are here and not there, and therefore the system you have built works and every professional works in his own place.  And ... well, in the labor markets do not get our eyes on you, because you can not pass the selection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334690/</a></p>
