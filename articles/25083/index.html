  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Game blogs: bows for developers, the world - for users.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read the discussion about gaming blogs on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/game_blogger/39735.html">habrahabr.ru/blog/game_blogger/39735.html#comments</a> , and thought ... <br><br>  To deny the fact that gaming blogs in RuNet are not developed as a class is stupid.  With this statement even difficult to argue.  Of course, if you try very hard, you can dig a couple of portals dedicated to the creation of games.  But ... if 99% of gaming studios have their own websites, how many of them support their blogs? <br>  But if such a thing, even with a big stretch, can be forgiven by game developers, then on the market of browser-based online games such behavior can be viewed as tremendous folly and short-sightedness. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The developers are limited at best by the official forum and chat, being in the holy conviction that this is more than enough.  Here and there appear here and there almost clones with the standard game mechanics and at least a standard set of accompanying functionality that do not differ from each other. <br>  On the one hand, developers and game designers can understand.  It is much more interesting, and more useful (from the developers' point of view) to write a new formula for calculating damage when hitting a sword from around the corner in half turn and folded in half.  Well, or fix it suddenly and incomprehensibly from where got out the bug.  Moreover, I confess honestly, I sometimes sin myself like this: periodically putting my paws on the development of the official project forum, and quite clearly recognizing its necessity, sometimes I can‚Äôt get rid of the subconscious feeling of suffering with bows.  But on the other hand, one should not underestimate the importance of information services for the user. <br>  In the end, there are three reasons why users come into the game. <br>  1. Self-actualization. <br>  2. To measure the belly. <br>  3. Communicate. <br><br>  About 1 and 2 let's talk some other time.  And today about communication.

      If from any, even the most successful online toys, to throw out the information component, then the probability that the project will survive, will tend to zero.  Because, no matter how we, the developers, would boast about, excellent game mechanics, graphics and other gadgets, one thing was and will be important to the players - COMMUNICATION.  And, if for us it is just an information service, a project, a game, and at least a blue hedgehog, then for users it is the WORLD in which they live.  And users are interested in talking about this world.  And, preferably, with the same passion-players. <br>  In fact, any multiplayer online game is already a social network.  With its features and chips and ... trimmed functionality.  The result is a mutant of itself, quite funny: interest is maintained at the expense of the playing moment, but the basic functionality inherent in the majority of social networks is cut. <br>  So why not spend a week or two and not create this very basic functionality?  Why not give users the ability to create content themselves?  Experts predict the popularity of social networks to last until 2012.  Then - the decline in popularity, but ... far from complete extinction.  And who would refuse, from a favorite drug - a circle of like-minded people.  According to statistics, 80% of users who are disappointed in the game may continue to play due to the established circle of contacts.  Keeps not a toy, people keep.  And the creation of blogs will allow even more to form a social circle.  And a small advertising nuance - everyone knows about search queries;) And people even in thematic services tend to write about different things that have nothing to do with the topic.  Therefore, a variety of search queries can lead to the toy itself;) <br>  Perhaps in a couple of years, the existence of multiplayer online games will not be possible without accompanying information services, in particular, thematic blogs, normal mail and forums.  A game that will provide the first normal information services will enter the top and get some advantage.  In fact, the majority of users do not care what to play, and the developers, interfere with so many genres in one game that they cover several target audiences at once.  As always, it's all about service.  For now ... we have what we have. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25083/</a></p>
