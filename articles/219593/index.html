This happened because the search engines themselves changed the site ranking algorithms in the results.  New, sophisticated algorithms require the use of large amounts of data and new technologies in order to promote the site to be effective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, SEO experts observed the following literally revolutionary changes: <br>  1. Behavioral and social ranking factors come to the fore. <br>  2. Text factors go into the background. <br><br>  What does it mean?  And the fact that the good old ways of moving by keywords are no longer ‚Äúkey‚Äù.  Texts in the style of ‚ÄúA seoshnik came to a bar, restaurant, cafe, entertainment in Moscow‚Äù - have long been no way to raise the site in extradition, but, on the contrary, the surest way to drown it.  So, the good old copywriter will not help you to promote your website.  The ‚Äúarms race‚Äù between search engines and SEO professionals will benefit the one who first masters BigData.

      <b>What's happening?</b>  Due to changes in the ranking algorithms, now the sites that would never have been there before would be in the TOP, namely: <br><br>  1. Sites with short texts.  Sheet text can now only harm. <br>  2. In the texts of the site there is only one entry of a key phrase or even synonyms - and this is enough. <br>  3. Sites that use content output on AJAX or in general only for authorized users <br><br>  These sites were in the top is not accidental.  The new strategy of ranking sites allowed search engines to bring better and higher-quality sites to the top, and, accordingly, to eliminate ‚Äúseoshny‚Äù spam.  But if the ranking now does not depend directly on keywords, what does it then depend on?  What signals are now ‚Äúread‚Äù by the search engine before putting the site to a certain place in the list and how can we influence it now? <br><br><h4>  Behavioral factors </h4><br>  The way the user behaves on the site, how and where he comes from, whether he returns, and whether he regularly maintains the site on social networks - these and many other factors make up the so-called layer of behavioral factors that, more recently, almost begin to play key role in ranking for search engines.  Obviously, a similar amount of information about each user can only be processed using the latest technology, in particular - BigData. <br><br>  And if search engines use new and complex technologies, SEO professionals are required to offer you mechanisms that can also analyze a huge number of behavioral factors and effectively influence them, as does, for example, the service <a href="http://www.serpclick.ru/">SERPClick.ru</a> , which was launched in December and now performs daily promotion of behavioral factors for several thousand clients. <br><br>  So, today site optimization includes the skillful management of natural behavioral factors.  How to safely affect these factors? <br><br><h5>  Method one.  Dear </h5><br>  It is necessary ‚Äúonly‚Äù to place the site for all thematic requests in the special.  Yandex and Google at least a year.  If you can get targeted traffic more than the leaders, then this will raise the site in the search results in a rather long period of time. <br><br>  And although it is difficult to make a mistake in such an advancement, its price will be extremely high: from a few hundred thousand to millions of dollars.  Search engines, themselves promoting a similar way to promote websites, argue that, for example, in the case of Yandex, people should invest in Direct even at a loss, taking into account the understanding of all repeat sales and growth of the company's capitalization (Client Lifetime Value will be significantly less than Direct cost).  Which is partly true.  But expensive. <br><br>  It turns out that if you are a market leader in your subject and you already have a lot of traffic, then it may be enough for you to create a site with a good conversion - and you are guaranteed to stay in the TOP.  Or - spend a huge budget for promotion through the specials.  the search engines themselves.  But if the leadership is far away, then there is nowhere to go, and you will have to fight over behavioral factors.  But as? <br><br><h5>  The second way.  Smart </h5><br>  There is another approach: try to influence behavioral factors by attracting an audience in other ways.  Formerly, ‚Äúcheats‚Äù were simply used for this.  As we remember, the first systems generated bots that performed the necessary actions in search results and on promoted sites.  But search engines began introducing systems capable of sifting through such promotion and making it useless, ineffective, and even harmful. <br><br>  In response, the optimizers have moved from robotic "cheating" to the distribution of tasks to all users in a row, which still works well for promotion, but with the reasonable use of technology. <br><br>  As a result, now the market of behavioral factors began to develop dynamically, and behavioral services began to remotely resemble the good old reference exchanges.  The <a href="http://www.serpclick.ru/">SERPClick.ru</a> service I mentioned earlier just allows you to effectively and, in my opinion, much more beneficial to influence behavioral factors for ranking a site in the issue. <br><br><h4>  What will happen to the market of behavioral factors next? </h4><br>  Obviously, in response to the spread of such services, search engines will very soon strike back: simply distributing tasks to living users will lose their effectiveness by improving the anti-spam mechanisms in search engines.  This means that, like cheating at one time, the method of promotion due to ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù users will begin to lose its effectiveness.  And this is already starting to happen. <br><br><h4>  How to maintain your position in the new environment? </h4><br>  In order for behavioral factors to remain an effective way of promotion, it is necessary not only to bring everyone to the site, but to analyze in detail the profiles of those people who will navigate to the site from search engines and other resources. <br><br>  As the head of one of the largest SEO-holdings, understanding this situation at the beginning of 2013, I decided to invest heavily in technology platforms for processing and collecting large amounts of data on user profiles, machine learning mechanisms for recognizing interests and predicting user needs, as well as RTB . <br><br>  As a result of these actions, we now offer solutions and services that effectively improve behavioral factors: from the powerful <a href="http://rtarget.ru/">rTarget</a> retargeter to the <a href="http://rtarget.ru/">ProfitTask</a> job distribution system through which <a href="http://socialtask.ru/">SocialTask</a> , <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick</a> and <a href="http://megaindex.ru/">MegaIndex work</a> . <br><br>  Every day we get more and more information about user profiles, which prompted me to create a separate technological project that will collect, process and provide information about user profiles.  This project will aggregate data on hundreds of millions of users, which will be built on the basis of tens of billions of information signals.  For a number of users, we will know their social media accounts, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, name, etc. <br><br>  I would not launch this project in open access if I had not seen potential opportunities for webmasters to increase conversion.  Imagine, a new visitor only comes to your site, and you already know everything about him: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ what is its budget <br>  ‚Ä¢ what products to show him <br>  ‚Ä¢ what does he like <br>  ‚Ä¢ what is he thinking <br>  ‚Ä¢ where to deliver it <br><br>  And if you do not buy, you can catch it by SMS, e-mail or banner.  The project will be launched before the end of April, as soon as all technological solutions to the level of a mass product have been debugged. <br><br>  Actually, these opportunities will allow much better influence on behavioral factors, attracting exactly the audience that will lead to an improvement in ranking. <br><br><h4>  And that is not all! </h4><br>  We are actively researching social graphs and user behavior patterns in social networks.  Based on a large amount of user data, we are already significantly increasing the effectiveness of influencing social factors. <br><br>  More than a year of the product's existence on the impact on social signals in the search rankings <a href="http://guru.megaindex.ru/">guru.megaindex.ru</a> , several thousand clients began to use it.  In the near future, the market for social impact factors will also be quite large. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219593/</a></p>
