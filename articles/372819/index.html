  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Survey: strong AI as a human surveillance system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It‚Äôs no secret that AI systems are developing and the day is not far off when an idea comes to anyone in the government: there are a lot of cameras in our city.  And what if you put them behind the watch AI and give him the opportunity to signal the police squads in the event of a potentially dangerous situation? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, at first, the system turned out only as a signal for the police, so that later, according to the records from the camera, to establish the correspondence of the alleged violation to what was actually happening.  Naturally, the system keeps records of who exactly and when hit on her camera.  Let's call it "Signaling observer" <br><br>  But gradually, accumulating the experience of observations, the police came to the conclusion: the citizens of our country are simply stunningly legally ungraved!  And because the camera system is supplemented with an alert system: by phone or by speakers.  Now, if a person commits such an offense for the first time or is able not to know / forget about the relevant law, the system says: ‚ÄúAttention !, you may [Ivan Ivanovich], break / prepare to violate the law such and such, article such and such .  The authors took into account that a person has a tendency to forget about his incidents and set that the warning is repeated every three months.  During these three months, a person is considered forewarned.  Naturally, if a forewarned person continues his activity, the system calls up a police outfit. <br>  This system is called "signaling observer with alert." <br><br>  Further development of the system made it possible to reduce the number of recognition errors to 1 by ten thousand.  As a result, already in court (or during the investigation) they began to turn to the system for advice on a particular issue, recognizing the opinion of the system as an undeniable truth.  The matter began to go so far that the attorney or the prosecutor began to raise doubts among the judges and the public.  But, naturally, the decision (sentence) is still made by the person.  Let's call such a system ‚ÄúObserver-consultant‚Äù.

      Upd.  This refers to advice on offense.  For example, there was a robbery attack on citizen Ivanova in a place where there are no cameras.  Citizen Ivanova stole an amount in the amount of the cost of an apartment - she just sold it, here are the documents.  At the same time, the cameras noticed that Ivan Petrovich and Vasya Petechkin were heading there.  Ivan Petrovich was very tipsy and barely able to stand on his feet, Vasya Petechkin is distinguished by a fragile physique and, in general, an obedient boy.  But citizen Ivanova repeatedly received warnings under the article "fraud." <br><br>  Naturally, such high efficiency could not help but interest the authorities as a system for monitoring the fair territory.  By promoting it under the slogan "Down with Domestic Violence!" And "stop death in drunken fights!", The authorities nevertheless took care to get access to the video from cameras in private territory either by order of the court, or if the system itself recognizes the cameras as evidence of the commission of an offense.  Prior to this, anyone who tried to gain access automatically commits an offense (of course, with registration by the ‚ÄúObserver‚Äù system).  Let's call such a system "Personal Observer". <br><br>  Upd.  It is meant to oblige citizens and entrepreneurs to install cameras at home and in enterprises.  But getting a recording from the camera in the bedroom, behind the five-centimeter symbolic villa fence is only ordered by the court.  Otherwise - hello fine and possibly term. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372819/</a></p>
