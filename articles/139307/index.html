  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Azure - first acquaintance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to try the Windows Azure platform for our new project.  At first, he was very skeptical.  Well, I did not believe in the clouds after a rather sad experience with Google App Engine.  And still not very sure, but still decided to try Azure.  I downloaded the SDK, installed it, opened the ready-made ASP.NET MVC application in the studio and went to watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Azure-Developer-Experience-Videos/NET-Windows-Azure-Introduction">video</a> .  To my project, I simply added to the possibility of deployment in Azure.  I must say, I was surprised - everything was a bit like a video manual. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the process, I ran into some in my opinion limitations and oddities.  It should be noted that I have a 30th trial subscription which I received in <a href="http://azure.softline.ru/freetrial/">Softline</a> .  Perhaps, if I had a normal subscription, some of these oddities would disappear by themselves, I do not know.  However, I will list: <br>  1) When creating a hosted service, you can choose from only three options <br><ul><li>  East Asia </li><li>  Southeast asia </li><li>  Anywhere Asia </li></ul><br>  2) When creating SQL Server Azure, you can select the following locations: <br><ul><li>  South Central US </li><li>  North europe </li><li>  West europe </li><li>  East Asia </li><li>  Southeast asia </li></ul><br>  3) I understand that once having created a Hosted Service with a specific name, no one else can use it.  Those.  it is unique on the platform.  Moreover, even if you delete, it will still be unavailable for use in the new service.  By the way, Google App Engine has the same story - it is impossible to create applications with the same name. <br><br>  In general, everything went smoothly.  But immediately the question: why does the process of publishing to the cloud take so long?  12-14 minutes!  I was not lazy and tried to publish the project several times - the result is the same.  In a regular web application, this was fixed by setting ‚ÄúReplace matching files with local copies‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúDelete all existing files prior to publish‚Äù.  And here as if the second option is always worth it.  Google immediately gave a link to stackoverflow - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5080445/why-does-azure-deployment-take-so-long">Why does Azure deployment take so long</a> ?

      As a result, after reading the articles and manuals, I had to accept this.  Looks like there's nothing to be done.  It is necessary to adjust the process so that it does not greatly affect the speed of development and testing.  Okay, we will survive.  Let's go further. <br><br>  Having tested the automatically generated name of the form xxxxxx.cloudapp.net we are convinced that our application is working.  Now I want to be able to contact him with a domain name that I specifically registered with the type myapp.ovlad.com.  I did it very simply - I pinged xxxxxx.cloudapp.net and got the received IP address in a new A-record in the DNS settings.  After about a couple of hours I could already use it. <br><br>  <i>UPD: as already unsubscribed in the comments (thanks to people for useful information) through the A-record is better not to become attached.</i>  <i>This should be done through CNAME.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  In my opinion, the beginning is quite good, not counting the aforementioned oddities or limitations.  We will explore further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139307/</a></p>
