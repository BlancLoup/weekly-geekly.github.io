How to become stress resistant?  How to resist manipulation and emotional blackmail?  How to succeed?  How to overcome shyness?  Answers to these and many other questions can be found in non-fiction books, that is, books on psychology, business, self-development, personal effectiveness, health, science, and everything that contributes to the broadening of horizons and the personal and professional growth of their readers.  Ideas from these books help make life better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But a modern and active person may have several problems with reading: <br><br><ul><li>  Where to find time to read all the books of interest? </li><li>  How not to make a mistake and choose a book worthy of attention? </li><li>  Is this particular book worth my time (on average 5 hours) and / or money? </li></ul><br>  There are many useful and decent books that help to change life for the better, if you read them at the right time, but how to find the time for it?  Of course, you can search for information of interest on the Internet, but how often are you satisfied with the answers from the network?  The quality of many online articles leaves much to be desired, and everyone who is not lazy can publish articles.  Too often, you can get bad advice and load your head with unnecessary information.
