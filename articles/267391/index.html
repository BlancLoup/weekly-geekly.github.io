We at voximplant really like this platform: we have a native android sdk to our cloud telephony, and right now the developers are porting a version for React Native.  Yes, for those who are in the tank (rate the new sayings of life) - the platform from Facebook, which allows you to create native mobile applications using javascript, is now available for Android!  At least in the beta version.  On the second day of the conference, Olivia Bishop from facebook will talk about this platform, and on the third day I will go on stage, and I really hope I can show you the working version of our sdk and share the first experience of porting.  Under the cut - my subjective opinion about the most interesting thing that awaits us at the conference.  Spoiler: there will be Sony! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  A little bit about droidcon </h1>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8b/ef2/09d/d8bef209d8364f52a9e65f988900c7ea.png" align="right">  Oddly enough, droidcon is not really a Google story.  This is the story of the initiative guys, who in 2009 gathered and made the first conference dedicated to everything related to the Android platform and the development for it.  It turned out well for them - so good that next year the conference "spread out" in several countries.  Well, and then Google joined - but not as an organizer, but as a sponsor and participant.  Such independence allows inviting any speakers to the conference and discussing any issues, including ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù ones. <br><br>  Last year, when I was not yet a technical voximplant evangelist, I happened to take part in organizing the <a href="http://apps4all.ru/post/04-17-14-droidcon-obedinil-luchshih-android-razrabotchikov-rossii">first droidcon</a> in <a href="http://apps4all.ru/post/04-17-14-droidcon-obedinil-luchshih-android-razrabotchikov-rossii">Russia</a> as the leading <a href="http://apps4all.ru/post/04-21-14-rezultaty-droidcon-moscow-hakaton">parallel hackathon</a> .  And it was cool - hundreds of developers, dozens of speakers, cool afterparty, lots of interesting topics for discussion, and a poor joke in a green robot costume.  This year I again help organize the event: I will lead one of three streams, show you at the voximplant stand, answer tricky questions about our android sdk and the cloud, and at 16:00, on Sunday, I will give a master class on React Native and try Call from android phone to web page. <br><br><h1>  Android NDK </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fca/830/c3a/fca830c3a3b5460f83ada0f78607a31c.png" align="left">  As you probably know, Google recently released a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2015/07/get-your-hands-on-android-studio-13.html">new version of</a> Android Studio in which, finally, you can comfortably work with C and C ++ code: there is even a debugger.  Therefore, I recommend everyone who is not indifferent to the low level to look at the light to Dmitry Yunitsky from Mail.Ru Group, listen to his point about NDK - and then torment him with questions for two days.  Questions I recommend to prepare in advance. <br><br><h1>  Round table with SMS </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06a/87d/6cd/06a87d6cdcf84dd2bc20cc09c03dbe9c.png" align="right">  At the very beginning of the second day, Oleg Dronov with OneAPI at the ready organizes a round table, during which we will discuss the use of the mobile operators' API for developers for mobile platforms.  Cell phone operators, Carl.  Want to know why SMS does not reach?  Join now! <br><br><br><br><br><br><h1>  A cup of very hot coffee and a zoo </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd8/43a/7bd/cd843a7bd08e47e1b46af098a3b5e0bd.png" align="left">  Also on the second day, we release two reports in parallel - one for enthusiasts, the second for the curious.  Dmitry Ryzhkov from Intel will tell us how to make cross-platform mobile applications in Java <s>Script</s> .  Yes, yes, in Java.  New Intel Multi-OS Engine. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c78/fec/27e/c78fec27e90e42caba6815d898b2fec4.png" align="right">  At the same time, Evgeny Alminov from J'son &amp; Partners Consulting will talk about the zoo of Android devices on the Russian market.  Or no longer a zoo?  Come and find out.  And ask.  And take the guys from the testing department with you, I suspect they will have something to ask. <br><br><br><br><br><h1>  React Native, Facebook View </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/6a2/2d7/78a6a22d70e04b0f945a5be5ffb648f8.png" align="left">  The second day is very intense, at least in my subjective opinion.  By the way, I write these lines on the plane, returning after speaking at PyCon - and I don‚Äôt know yet who Olivia is.  And these lines - an hour ago, and I already know that she - Android Engeneering Manager from Facebook, flies to us from London and not only tells you about the vision for the further development of React Native, but also answers your questions.  Where else would such a case be presented to touch the future of mobile development? <br><br><h1>  BarCamp and Democamp </h1><br><br>  Always wanted to look at the ‚Äúreal pitching startups‚Äù, but did not have time to get to the profile event and do not like anglicisms?  On the third day, interesting reports were heartily diluted with IT-social activity.  BarCamp: I bring developers to the stage and they tell their successful and interesting cases.  Democamps: the pre-selected teams will have only 2 minutes to present their VC project (former ‚ÄúCP‚Äù), experts and investors.  They are trying to answer their tricky questions already.  And you enjoy this show and learn what works and what doesn't. <br><br><h1>  My demo of React Native </h1><br><br>  The third day.  Sunday.  4pm  I go on stage and try to apply my 15 years of development experience to show you live React Native, webRTC, and not screw it up.  If you are not lucky, then I will try to apply a little less experience of public speaking to get out.  I hope one of the two will work for me. <br><br><h1>  And that's not all. </h1><br><br>  From our huge program, I chose several performances to your taste.  But this is not all that we have prepared for three months to work on this conference.  <a href="http://droidcon.moscow/">See for yourself</a> - there is something to see.  And I hope there is something for the sake of which you sign up for the conference and will be our guests.  Together with representatives of Apps4All, we are waiting for you at the event, <a href="http://droidcon.moscow/">register here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267391/</a></p>
