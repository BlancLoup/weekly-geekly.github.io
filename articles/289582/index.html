Any organization has good times and bad times.  In a good team like drifting, calmly and measuredly fulfilling customer requests.  In the heavy - the team can hardly row against the current, still fulfilling all customer requests.  In both cases, the difference is not visible to the client. <br><br>  You may have the best, most thoughtful customer-oriented service process, but if your people are poorly motivated, sad, or simply do not know how to work smoothly, everything will collapse.  That is why it is important to preserve the significant asset that you have - people.  Today we will talk about how to take care of your team. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Motivation with tangible and intangible rewards</b> <br>  There are many ways to target employees for success and positive mood.  Promotions are one of them.  Each company has its own atmosphere and should be treated carefully.  Promotions should reflect the norms and habits that prevail in the team.

      Awards can significantly increase employee morale and job satisfaction, but you need to take into account several pitfalls.  Next, we will give you a few tips on how to make your team issue a maximum. <br><br>  <b>Avoid cash incentives</b> <br>  Cash incentives do not necessarily lead to the expected result.  At first, this seems like a good idea, but it often leads to the fact that cohesion is destroyed and the competitive spirit comes to its place.  As a result, it harms the atmosphere as a whole.  Use this method with caution.  It is usually better to introduce a system of bonuses that reflect the actual achievement of specific goals.  In many companies, this is called ‚Äúvariable compensation,‚Äù or compensation based on results.  Focus on personal achievement, not comparison. <br><br>  <b>Be selective</b> <br>  Systematic rewards lose their power.  Employees stop fighting for them.  Pay attention when workers go for an over-result.  Establish the principle by which you determine how often to encourage an employee for real achievements.  Another approach to rewards is to single out employees at the end of a difficult task or project. <br><br>  <b>Treat employees as individuals</b> <br>  Some people need fanfare, others have rather loud approval.  So remember, rowing all on the same comb in matters of encouragement should not be.  Workers should feel that your gratitude is sincere, thanks to the individual choice of this gratitude. <br><br>  <b>Stay calm in a situation of staff shortage or congestion.</b> <br>  There are days when employees are sorely lacking.  The flu epidemic, the holiday season, the release of a new product - and the influx of visitors is increasing dramatically, and you remain with the same limited number of employees.  Unpleasant situation, but inevitable, so the best strategy is to prepare for it in advance. <br><br>  First of all communicate with the team.  Explain the situation to them, tell them that you really need their participation to cope with the problem.  Confirm that you are with them, and not just ask them to work more.  Also use your gaming and promotional tools to increase employee motivation for a period of heavy workload.  Cancel all your appointments and ask the staff to do the same.  Focus on the current moment. <br><br>  Optimize your day job.  Maybe there are applications that do not require immediate execution?  If so, do not follow them.  Save them until the time when it is more free.  Maybe someone from the neighboring department can handle them?  Use the help of neighbors.  Anyway, applications often go to them. <br><br>  Do you like long lunch breaks in your company?  Not today.  Moreover, it is better if lunch is at your expense.  Employees will be pleased to feel your care.  The most important thing is to stay calm and focused.  One way or another - the day will end.  In your power to determine what it will be. <br><br>  <b>Expand your people‚Äôs horizons with activities</b> <br>  To build a motivated team that likes to work together is a creative task.  To keep people in good shape, engage them in other company activities, including travel and out-of-office activities. <br><br>  Trips create good conditions for learning and cooperation in your team.  During the events, the team shares its experience and knowledge with other people from the industry.  Here, employees can hone their skills, present interesting information, become the leader of the group. <br><br>  <b>Retain freshness by changing roles.</b> <br>  Search and retain talented personalities are often not as easy as they seem.  One of the best ways to do this is to create an interesting and enriching working environment.  The team structure should include the exchange of roles and assignments. <br><br>  Ensure regular rotation of roles: <br>  - Sorter.  Distributes applications into groups. <br>  - Telephone coordinator.  Manages the phone lineup.  When there are no calls, deals with applications. <br>  - Application Collector.  Studies complex, complex applications. <br>  - Chat.  Answers questions in the chat. <br>  - Phone.  Answers calls. <br><br>  Here are some examples of roles for other departments: <br>  - Training.  Helps customers to better master the service.  There is no better teacher than the person who supports the product. <br>  - Knowledge Manager: keeps a blog, writes posts in forums, tips, articles.  A good candidate for the first role in the case of blockage. <br>  - Sales Representative.  Is in constant contact with customers.  Participates in discussions of goods or services.  Sees the situation from the client. <br><br>  <b>Give the team more rights</b> <br>  If you are the leader of a support team, let the team have the freedom to make decisions on how to respond to customers and make concessions within the assigned boundaries.  If you have properly empowered employees, consider that you killed two birds with one stone: employees are motivated, and you have more time for important tasks.  Let your people treat your business like yours. <br><br>  <b>Give the team a handy tool</b> <br>  Find out how comfortable the team is to work with the company's internal systems.  Even if you have no complaints about the quality of their work, this does not mean that employees have no difficulties in the process of its implementation.  Perhaps too much time is spent on the routine, the interface forces us to produce a bunch of unnecessary actions, the staff spend the energy to streamline and control the flow of requests.  Make sure that you give the staff a magic wand - a tool that only helps to communicate with customers, and working with them is easy and pleasant.  Our <a href="https://usedesk.ru/">Usedesk</a> is just right. <br><br>  <b>Transparency</b> <br>  The transparency of your team, starting from the executive directors and ending with the front line, is the primary condition for success.  Open communication contributes to a positive attitude.  The larger the organization, the more important is transparency and openness.  Here are some ideas on how to increase interpersonal communication in your organization. <br><br>  <i>Guide on sight</i> <br>  Management should regularly appear in general meetings with the agenda with which everyone is familiar. <br><br>  <i>Consent to the agenda</i> <br>  Send out a list of topics, including the amount of time you have scheduled for each topic, in advance of the meeting.  Based on the feedback received, edit it and distribute the final version so that everyone is prepared to effectively spend the time allotted to it. <br><br>  <i>Don't be a hermit</i> <br>  It is not enough to sit in the office, making decisions and lowering them down until the return, good or bad, slowly gets back to you.  Hold one-on-one weekly meetings.  At meetings with management, share information with your directors for distribution. <br><br>  Information must move up and down quickly so that decisions do not linger. <br><br>  The basic rule that should not be forgotten is to devote time to the front line, entering into the course of their affairs.  This will allow making reasonable proposals for changes. <br><br>  <i>Explain your decisions</i> <br>  It is very important to explain why the decision was made, regardless of the reaction of your team.  Thus, you show that you are at the same level with your team. <br><br>  <i>Allow anonymous reviews</i> <br>  For example, through the Google web form. <br>  Employees express their questions and suggestions, if you do not have enough available reviews, you can open a survey.  It is important to let your staff speak without risking. <br><br>  <i>Full review</i> <br>  If you decide to use anonymous feedback, then be prepared to accept feedback about yourself.  This will allow you to figure out what makes it so, and what's wrong.  Do not allow people to waste time on their ideas that will never be realized. <br><br>  We hope that our tips and tricks will help your people to treat their work with inspiration and make your services excellent in terms of customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289582/</a></p>
