  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 tips on creating email newsletters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have already written in our articles about the importance of design when creating an email campaign.  ‚ÄúDesign is everything‚Äù, progressive foreign marketers, PR managers and designers shout.  Beautiful design of branded materials, ranging from the company's website and ending with leaflets and posts in social networks - the key to the popularity of the business of the modern buyer.  Email newsletters should not be an exception. <br><br>  In this article we share with you the ten most important and relevant principles of attractive letters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  First impression </h3><br>  Effective email design is not only the right color scheme and the selection of beautiful pictures for writing.  The design action begins in the Inbox - before the subscriber has clicked on the "Open" button.  Therefore it is worth paying special attention to the following points. <br><br><h4>  1. Count "From whom" </h4><br>  The first reason that users open letters is that they recognize the addressee.  Try to make your subscribers recognize your sender's name without any problems and, without thinking, immediately move on to reading the letter.  Do not use common names like ‚Äúdo-not-reply‚Äù, ‚Äúnews‚Äù and the like.  Ideal: the name of the company + the name of one of its employees - for example, ‚ÄúElena from Imobis‚Äù.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  2. The subject and preheader </h4><br>  The topic should attract attention, generate interest and keep a little intrigue, giving the subscriber an additional reason to open the message.  Do not regret spending more time on its wording - it‚Äôs not so easy to fit the message of the whole letter in 32-50 characters. <br><br>  In order not to get into the ‚ÄúUnwanted Letters‚Äù folder, of course, avoid CAPS LOCK and the abundance of exclamation marks. <br>  To help the main subject of the letter, use preheader - an additional field that will help the recipient to learn more about the content of the letter. <br><br><h3>  Aesthetic perception </h3><br>  If you believe the research of Constant Contact for 2014, about 75% of users immediately delete a letter if it is incorrectly displayed on their mobile device.  To date, this number has undoubtedly increased.  So, what should be done so that the design of the letter provoked positive emotions among the subscribers? <br><br><h4>  3. Use responsive design </h4><br>  As we have repeatedly said, this is very important.  The width of the layout does not exceed 600 pixels, and the size of the button varies from 35 to 47 pixels (for easy finger pressure). <br><br><h4>  4. Make your email letters part of the brand. </h4><br>  Recognizability, recognizability and again recognizability.  Branding e-mail helps to stand out among thousands of other messages.  Include the company logo in the letter layout, create a standard template that can only be slightly modified from mailing to mailing. <br><br><h4>  5. Monitor the font set. </h4><br>  It is not necessary to excel with a variety of styles, thereby overloading the overall look of the letter.  Choose one or two basic fonts that will become your brand, and always use only them. <br><br><h4>  6. Find the right color balance. </h4><br>  Branded colors that will be combined with the logo - a great option.  Do not overload letters with bright parts, leave more ‚Äúfree‚Äù bright space: such letters and information in them are perceived by subscribers much easier.  When filling the main title or motivational message, avoid light shades (even if the color, for example, is bright orange) - it is the dark inscriptions that will help to highlight accents.  As practice shows, only a change in the color of the motivating text leads to an increase in the number of targeted clicks by 6.64%. <br><br><h3>  Call to action </h3><br>  The previous tips help create a letter that subscribers want to open and read.  However, this is not exactly what we need.  The main goal of any email campaign is to perform a consumer action by the user. <br><br><h4>  7. Paste at least one call to action </h4><br>  Clear, clear and understandable, it should be at the beginning of the letter.  And after - button or link call-to-action, bright, visible and easy to click. <br><br>  Buttons or links?  Analysts do not give a definitive answer to this question - it depends on the context.  Therefore, it is more efficient to use both buttons and links.  If the links are more or less clear, then the design of the buttons should be emphasized in our article. <br><ul><li>  Size - at least 40 pixels; </li><li>  Match the color of the button to the design of your newsletter; </li><li>  Simple and clear wording; </li><li>  Your call should complement the phrase ‚ÄúI want‚Äù; </li><li>  Leave enough space around the button; </li><li>  Check the convenience of pressing a button on mobile devices; </li></ul><br>  Recent Campaign Monitor research has shown that adding more than 5-7 links (excluding links to social media) has minimal impact on the number of clicks.  Emails with 1‚Äì3 links give the highest click through rate. <br><br><h4>  8. Insert social buttons </h4><br>  Links to your accounts in social networks is a great way to increase the efficiency of your business, even with the help of newsletters.  By inserting links to social networks, you get an additional opportunity to interact with your own audience on other Internet sites. <br><br><h3>  Confidence in successful delivery </h3><br>  In conclusion, I would like to tell you how to increase the chances of getting messages in the Inbox folder, and not in the Junk Mail folder. <br><br><h4>  9. Be careful with the size of the attachment. </h4><br>  Most email providers limit the possible amount of media attachments in the body of the letter.  Stick to size 10 MB and lower to avoid any problems with mailing delivery. <br><br>  You should not embed pictures of high resolution: the width of the letter layout, as we have already found out, should not exceed 600 pixels, therefore it does not make sense to use an image larger than this value. <br><br><h4>  10. For each image, even the logo in the header, it is necessary to prescribe the tag "alt" in Latin </h4><br>  Approach the process of creating an email campaign wisely.  Do not forget that subscribers and their satisfaction with newsletters - the key to the success of your company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306416/</a></p>
