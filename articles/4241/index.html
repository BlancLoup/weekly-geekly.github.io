They look at Russian free hot spots with envy and complain about the expensive Internet, which does not allow them to develop podcasting in their native Belarus. <br><br>  Igor Karanevich and Yevgeny Smole, who a year ago opened the first in Belarus podcasting portal Podcasting.By, answer the questions of Habrakhabr. <br><br>  <b>Hello, podcasters!</b>  <b>When did you even know about this concept - podcasting?</b>

      Igor Karanevich: Very simple.  We are all wrapped up in Macs, and Macs and Podcasting are almost inseparable things.  Even the word "podcasting" comes from this wonderful iPod. <br><br>  <b>Are you a member of <a href="http://mac-by.com/">the Apple Belarus Fans Club</a> , Podcasting.By went as a side project?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  In fact, the way it is.  We had some thoughts, maybe, to make a commercial project out of it.  Maybe he will ever become like this.  But it really happened like this: three people gathered and decided to make a website.  One had the possibility of programming and design, the other had a desire to just participate (from me), and Zhenya, in fact, gave birth to this idea.  He suggested: let's make a website. <br><br>  Evgeny Smole.  Actually, iTunes 4.9 came out with podcasting support ... <br><br>  I.K.  Yes, it all started with iTunes, there appeared support for podcasting, and at the same time there was a new firmware for players with this feature. <br><br>  <b>When it was?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  A few months before the appearance of our site.  It was all spring and summer last year.  First iTunes came out, then <a href="http://russianpodcasting.ru/">RussianPodcasting</a> opened, and a month later we.  At first, we tried with Strelnikov [the founder of RussianPodcasting, the main enthusiast of the podcasting movement in Russia] to build some kind of bridges, but ... <br><br>  E.S.  ... but he ignores us. <br><br>  I.K.  (smiles) The man is clearly above all our ambitions ... I will tell a couple of wonderful stories about him. <br><br>  <b>What is Podcasting.By for you?</b> <br>  I.K.  For us, a project is a hobby.  Note that nothing has changed in a year: neither in design, nor in anything else.  No new features on the site either. <br><br>  E.S.  No, well, two or three months after launch, support for new video formats was added.  In fact, it was possible to immediately rename the site as ‚ÄúAudio-video-podcasting‚Äù. <br><br>  I.K.  On RussianPodcasting is also supported, they have restyled there, a lot of things have changed.  They used to have two sites: one for video, the second for audio, and now they have decided to combine everything into one stream. <br><br>  <b>Is RussianPodcasting a role model for you?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  No, of course, there is nothing better in the post-Soviet territory. <br>  Of course, there are much more advanced things in the Western world, but RussianPodcasting is the best national project. <br><br>  E.S.  Here they were created at the same time with us, but have progressed much further.  Why?  Because in Russia there was one very good push for podcasting - cheap Internet.  The main difficulty for Minsk podcasters is to post podcasts.  It‚Äôs not a problem to write down, but to lay out ... There were a lot of people who tried to contact Igor, and me, who suggested: we will write down, and you will post.  We will bring you to the disks every day ... <br><br>  I.K.  Yes, in general, because of this, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpodcasting is killed at the root. <br><br>  <b>Oh yeah!</b>  <b>Without affordable and fast Internet there will be no mass audience ...</b> <br><br>  I.K.  Dear Internet is a big Belarusian problem.  If the Internet was cheaper, and with downloading, and with the laying out there would be less problems. <br><br>  E.S.  We have ideas on this subject, which we cannot implement for half a year already, although we already have an agreement with the directors.  We have agreed with most Belarusian providers to make traffic from the portal Podcasting.By free for users.  To do this, you need to mirror the server in the inner ring, which is used by Belarusian providers.  We have agreed on this with the provider "Solo", just need to find the time and do all this to the end. <br><br>  <b>A good option to bring Podacsting.By to a new level of development ...</b> <br><br>  E.S.  Of course, this will be a new stage.  The influx of people will be very big.  There are a lot of home users on the broadband Internet in Minsk. <br><br>  I.K.  Then we will have to expand the project, to recruit people. <br><br>  E.S.  A very big team will be needed ... <br><br>  I.K.  And people who will listen and process everything. <br><br>  <b>Why don't you mirror the server?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  Just no time to do it.  The project works completely autonomously. <br><br>  I.K.  We do not participate at all. <br>  The only thing that I personally listen to is everything laid out there. <br><br>  E.S.  We are passive administrators ... <br><br>  I.K.  (laughs) Sometimes we react to any glitches that appear there. <br><br>  <b>Take a passive position and wait?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  We didn‚Äôt invest practically any funds in the project, well, we printed a poster ... <br><br>  I.K.  ... staked the domain name and watch the situation.  It must be said that the changes are felt.  If the last year nothing happened at all, then now a certain revival is noticeable.  Now journalists have begun to be interested. <br><br>  <b>Are there more podcasters?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  Yes, and the number of downloads also increased.  Now we have 280 podcasts in the archive.  The total number of downloads is about 24 thousand. Statistics show that with the introduction of cheaper tariff plans for Internet providers, the number of hits to our site dramatically increases.  Interest directly depends on the price of the Internet. <br><br>  <b>But still it is very difficult to compare with Russia?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  Yes, the situation is different there.  In addition, there is Strelnikov - a man who devoted himself to podcasting.  For him, it was a new hobby at the moment when he was ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù.  I am sure that he even pays some money to his podcasters, it‚Äôs not just the way they do it.  <a href="http://strelnikov.russianpodcasting.ru/">Vasily Strelnikov</a> and <a href="http://u8.russianpodcasting.ru/">‚ÄúTits - Pussy Shows‚Äù</a> are the two most popular podcasts in Russia.  They are made by professional DJs. <br><br>  <b>On professional equipment?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  Nothing like this.  For example, ‚ÄúTits - Pussies‚Äù are recorded at home, but the quality is quite decent. <br><br>  <b>Have you met your colleague Strelnikov?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  No, we only saw him on TV.  At the dawn of the Russian MTV, he conducted many programs there.  And now, on RenTV, he hosts the Brainstorming show and generally we love listening to his podcasts ... But, Zhenya won't let me lie: no matter how many letters we try to write to him, there is no answer.  Only in one of his podcasts, he mentioned us.  There, in a conversation with someone from the podcasters, he dropped: ‚ÄúWell, they say Belarusians will always accept you.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>So he wanted to insult the other person?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  (laughs) Like that.  He does not perceive us at all, although he is afraid.  He sees us as a rival, although we have never tried to become such, and never will be. <br><br>  E.S.  Just initially, a year ago we were at the same level.  Even the podcasters had almost the same amount.  Just Russia is a different level. <br><br>  I.K.  They constantly had stocks-shmaktsii, everywhere advertising. <br><br>  E.S.  They stuck ads wherever possible.  "Boobs - Pussy show" advertise condoms! <br><br>  <b>What is your relationship with radio stations?</b>  <b>Probably planned to cooperate with them?</b> <br><br>  I.K.  Yes, but then we realized that it was a useless thing. <br><br>  E.S.  DJs are not interested because they are high-flying birds, as it turned out.  They do not have time to create their own podcasts. <br><br>  I.K.  And duplicate radio programs in mp3 format makes no sense.  Podcasting and radio are slightly different things, and they obey differently.  Radio is sharpened on live broadcast, it is listened to at the moment when the broadcast is on.  This creates the effect of presence.  Podcasting is built on the back of this effect. <br>  The transfer is recorded once and for all, and you can listen to it whenever you please: at least immediately after publication, or in a month. <br>  Radio and podcasting are different formats.  Therefore, those programs that are recorded in the studio on the radio, they are not so effective.  You feel that this product is not the first freshness.  And the podcast is recorded with the expectation that it will be listened to later. <br><br>  E.S.  In general, initially we positioned Podcasting.By as a ‚Äúradio on demand‚Äù. <br><br>  I.K.  As practice has shown, this is not entirely true.  Podcasting is not ‚Äúradio by request‚Äù, but author's radio, personal radio. <br><br>  E.S.  For all of my friends who I pulled into podcasting, who constantly listen to podcasts, for all of them the main thing is the technology of RSS feeds.  The person selects topics that are interesting for him, and these podcasts are automatically updated in the program, automatically downloaded to the computer. <br><br>  <b>In autonomous aggregator ...</b> <br><br>  I.K.  In general, there are pluses and minuses in these autonomous aggregators.  Indeed, for podcasters feedback, feedback, comments on the site, communication is very important. <br><br>  E.S.  Lack of comments is one of the main problems.  Here people post their podcasts, and then watch - no one appreciates them, the audience is silent. <br><br>  I.K.  This is very significant for our site.  The person puts one podcast, the second, the third, looks - but there are no comments.  The podcast seems to be downloading, the counter is working, but silence in response.  And he thinks - why do I need all this? <br><br>  <b>Which podcasts cause the most comments?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  The transfer must be very, very good to trigger a discussion. <br><br>  I.K.  It is hard to say.  Here we have the latest example - the <a href="http://mfshow.podcasting.by/">Lemming &amp; Sad Joker's Metal MF Show</a> podcast. <br><br>  E.S.  These guys just really liked "Tits - Pussy Shows" on Russian Podcasting, they listened and flooded them.  In this style and make their transfer.  However, they are real fans of metal music.  Now Metal MF Show is the most popular podcast on our site, on average it is downloaded a thousand times, this is a lot.  In general, the proportion is approximately as follows: if a podcast is downloaded a hundred times, then two or three comments appear. <br><br>  I.K.  Yes, we have a very passive audience.  I myself am such a passive listener. <br><br>  I.K.  Podcasts are a great alternative to our FM radio, which is impossible to listen to in Russia or in Belarus.  This is a complete garbage: advertising and some kind of musical mess ... And podcasting is a real outlet.  I'm in the car for about 80% listen to podcasts, and only 20% listen to music. <br><br>  <b>Which podcasters on your site are the most prolific?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  Most of the podcasts from <a href="http://stern.podcasting.by/">Solomon</a> : almost 40 issues of "Hard News".  He is catching up with the Metal MF Show.  The same Solomon uploads his podcasts simultaneously to RussianPodcasting.  Many people simply mirror their programs.  In fact, it is not necessary to upload files to us.  Just an external link is enough. <br><br>  <b>The site works offline, and anyone can go in, register and upload their files?</b> <br><br>  E.S.  Yes of course.  There are no restrictions yet.  The only restriction is to follow our rules on music and politics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4241/</a></p>
