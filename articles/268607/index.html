  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Volker Simonis - Interiors of SAP JVM [Meeting JUG in St. Petersburg]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already this Wednesday, October 14, a meeting of JUG.ru with <b>Volker Simonis</b> from SAP will take place at the St. Petersburg office of Oracle.  The subject of the meeting is the <b>internal structure of the SAP JVM</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f66/e77/8b6/f66e778b675ce5553c18e142cda1909b.png" alt="sap-jvm"></div><br>  Surely many of you have heard about SAP - the German giant, which makes different corporate systems - accounting, production control, finance, HR, personnel, warehouse management and other ‚ÄúBlood Enterprise‚Äù, which most likely is in your organization, if its number exceeds a thousand people. <br><br>  The trick is that many (if not all) of these solutions work in one way or another on Java, and accordingly the JVM is spinning inside them.  The joke is that this is <b>their own JVM</b> .  Well, as its own - at one time it was licensed from Sun, along with the source code, of which it was developed.  Currently licensed from Oracle.  Accordingly, this is some kind of fork of Oracle JDK / JVM with its kerchief and secretaries, licensed, compatible, etc.  etc. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, this is not only a fork, but also a <b>port</b> that supports 7 CPU architectures: x86, x86_64, SPARC, PowerPC, Itanium, z / Arch and PA-RISC on seven different operating systems: OS X, Windows, Solaris, Linux, AIX, as400 and HP / UX.  According to SAP, they support a single configuration system, a single behavior, identical buns and extensions, analysis tools and support throughout this whole hellish combination of platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/246/a6e/d99/246a6ed991c846689d723d5a284e88a1.jpg"><br><br>  As can be seen from this label, they still support Java from 1.4 to 8 on all the mentioned platforms.  For example, Oracle now supports only Java 8, and Azul and Red Hat, as I understand it, only 6, 7 and 8. <br><br>  So, we have a great happiness.  On Wednesday in St. Petersburg, JUG <b>Volker Simonis</b> , our big friend and developer of SAP JVM, will talk about all this happiness in a standard two-hour format.  He will speak at Joker and planned to fly on Thursday, but we specifically asked to fly him a day earlier to make a separate JVM event with him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, Volker will talk about what motivated them at the time to make this difficult decision - to make and maintain their own JDK and tell about their development model.  The difficulty in this place is clear: on the one hand there are commercially licensed sources of Oracle, on the other - OpenJDK, which is open source, but there are no features in it, and on the third there is their own code.  Accordingly, it is necessary to somehow live with all this, managing and developing. <br><br>  And then we will talk about the specific buns that are in their virtual machine.  Among those that are in the announcement: <br><ul><li>  <b>Debugging on Demand</b> - the ability for a debugger to connect to a running application without restarting it and receive absolutely any debag information (in a similar way, HotSpot, but in a more limited version) </li><li>  <b>Cloud Debugging</b> - debugging remote machines without performance loss </li><li>  <b>The SAP JVM Profiler</b> is a virtual machine profiler that attaches to it without restarting and without special configuration of the VM at the start. </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, they have several features that allow developers to catch errors more effectively.  For example, these are CPU, memory and I / O traces, extended thread dumps, and advanced error messages for the most critical exception types, such as NPE or ClassCastException. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/098/1b4/144/0981b4144eb04271a3f08a85f0b7aebd.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, an essential part of Volker‚Äôs story will be devoted to the details of the implementation of all the above features.  We are not doing advertising here, but with technology. <br><br>  It is important to point out that while the SAP JVM is a licensed JDK, available only to SAP customers, there is a trial version that can be downloaded <b><a href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/">here</a></b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/208/1de/995/2081de99555c496aa4cb4d971fcde948.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><h5>  About Volker </h5><br>  <b>Volker Simonis</b> has been with SAP for many years in the SAP JVM Technology group.  OpenJDK contributor from the very beginning of its existence, committer, reviewer, Project Lead of the OpenJDK port on PowerPC / AIX.  To be more precise, they and their colleague in four hands dragged at one time OpenJDK on PowerPC. <br><br>  Volker knows Russian well, but prefers to speak English about technical things.  Therefore, the meeting language is <b>English</b> . <br><br><h5>  check in </h5><br>  <b>As always, admission is free, register <a href="https://jugru.timepad.ru/event/250855/">here</a> .</b> <br><br>  For those who are not in St. Petersburg - a video in a week will appear <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JUGRuVideo/">here</a></b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268607/</a></p>
