Every person needs a new service.  A chance for modern knowledge, a chance for the development of talents and abilities, a chance for gaining strength and confidence, and hence a chance for a change in one‚Äôs fate and the fate of one‚Äôs environment. <br><br>  Who, if not you, to lead the exodus of mankind from poverty?  You got rich and created the largest electronic services from scratch.  So, you are capable of creating a global online platform with a clear mission - education for the sake of prosperity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The problem of poverty and the responsibility of the rich </h3><br>  Poverty is one of the causes of war and conflict.  A community of people on the planet is like a single organism.  No body flourishes at the expense of the diseases of others, and therefore there is no excuse for income imbalance both between countries and within nations.  Angus Deaton, the Nobel laureate, calls the extremes of wealth and poverty a source of destructive internecine wars.

      Poverty is inequality: material, educational and digital.  The poor do not spend time on school, but earn their daily bread.  Therefore, there are still 750 million illiterate people in the world, of which 250 million are children and teenagers of school age.  And educational and digital inequality again leads to material inequality.  Devilish vicious circle closes: the rich get richer again, and the poor get poorer. <br><br>  Poverty is personal and social habits.  Scientists from MIT found that old habits are never forgotten, but only hidden by the formation of new ones.  And the formation of new neural connections takes up to 8.5 months.  Therefore, in order to replace the habits of generational poverty with the habits of prosperity, humanity will need decades of hard and patient work.  And this path is akin to Exodus - the 40-year-old gain of freedom under the leadership of Moses. <br><br>  Poverty is the responsibility of the prosperous.  Yes, many rich people aggressively protect their personal fortunes, unfairly closing the path to prosperity for others.  And many poor people, in their turn, are not zealous in personal development, they do not develop, are rude, offended and satisfied with little.  At the same time, it is obvious that man is a noble being.  And he needs fair social models that will destroy existing inequalities, for example, educational facebook, which can be created only by strong and successful people. <br><br><h3>  10 attributes of educational facebook </h3><br>  Why do we need a new service, but not the already established social networks?  Because social media does not change the fate of a person, his biography.  Surveys show that almost 80% of users thought about deleting an account from social networks, because they were tired of wasting time.  Other studies claim that 99% of published content is useless.  In addition, social media have developed persistent patterns of behavior, which are almost impossible to change. <br><br>  The philosophy of new relationships to get out of poverty - Equal Educational Exchange (Equal Educational Exchange).  It corresponds to 10 attributes of educational Facebook. <br><br><h3>  Attribute one: global e-learning infrastructure </h3><br>  In the pre-digital era, education was completely dependent on buildings, textbooks, pens, notebooks, curricula, school administrators, teachers, and teachers.  Poor countries were almost incapable of creating an offline educational infrastructure.  Inequality of opportunity led to inequality of results.  New educational infrastructure - smartphones.  These mobile devices will soon be on everyone, regardless of income.  So educational Facebook will be able to accumulate the majority of paid and free courses on one platform.  So that the user can feel in the "driver's place". <br><br>  How non-classical education is effective?  Kenyan Julius Yego became the world javelin throw champion, and he took his first lessons while watching videos on Youtube.  China‚Äôs richest man rode his bike to the hotel for free excursions for foreigners to practice English.  And the youngest billionaire of the planet left the second year at Harvard University. <br><br><h3>  Attribute two: everyone can become a teacher and a student </h3><br>  Anyone can become a teacher or a student on an educational facebook.  Everyone can create their own educational program for others.  The online Facebook platform for creating training courses, webinars, online trainings and coaching consultations is similar to WordPress for personal sites.  A large number of volunteers and organizations around the world will quickly identify and solve user needs to strengthen the habits of prosperity: from the basics of reading to rhetoric, from Duolingo to Coursera.  In addition, being a teacher is 9 times more effective than a student.  "Do you want to study the subject - <s>read</s> write a book about it."  Everyone knows how to do something good in life.  And we need to give him a chance to teach this to others and thereby cope with his own depression, as did Colonel Sanders and JK Rowling. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Three: lifelong learning </h3><br>  In the world of VUCA - volatility, uncertainty, complexity (complexity) and ambiguity (ambiguity) - it should be recognized that you need to learn all your life.  The traditional educational trajectory - one higher education up to 25 years old - is outdated.  It is correct to speak of a three-peak model: the second is the working age of 30‚Äì55 years and the third is 55+.  The average person for life changes 8 areas of activity.  Therefore, educational Facebook should be a platform for lifelong learning. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Four: Education for Prosperity, Healthy for Life </h3><br>  The main mission of educational Facebook: education for prosperity.  The acquisition of useful knowledge, skills and competencies for life, for self-employment, for business, for opening new jobs.  For the sake of forming an integral ability to solve complex issues of life. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Five: Personalization of Learning for Discovery of Potential </h3><br>  The focus of the educational facebook is to uncover the innate potential of users.  A large array of data from an online educational platform will offer everyone the courses and programs that will most fully reveal their talents, inclinations and abilities.  This is similar to how the behavior of customers in Internet marketing captures Google Analytics and make offers neural networks. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Six: voluntary change support </h3><br>  Habits, especially social ones, change slowly, and constant support is required.  In Germany, 30% of students do not cope with their studies and drop out of universities due to high loads and low motivation.  New users of educational Facebook will definitely need the support of mentors, coaches, tutors, advisors, both paid and free of charge.  Thousands of volunteers have created Wikipedia, because participation in charitable programs increases self-esteem, self-confidence and increases competitiveness in the labor market.  Therefore, many will want to become a voluntary mentor. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Seven: the practice of respectful dialogue </h3><br>  For the development of habits of prosperity, good dialogue practice is needed, in which communication skills, negotiation and conviction skills, idea formulation skills, etc. are formed. The resource's task is to create a fruitful environment for group dialogues, but at the same time prevent conflicts.  Everyone deserves respect, and especially hurts when they slander you for not committing.  Without a space of trust, understanding and support it is impossible to form new positive habits.  Educational Facebook is designed to be a place of respectful and meaningful dialogue. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Eight: Achievement System Recognized Offline </h3><br>  Useful habits are shaped by encouragement.  Therefore, meaningful actions should be rewarded for achievement and diligence.  In this case, a scientist from Europe and the Australian Bushman should be equal in assessing the dynamics of development.  And the accumulated results should lead to a ranks system recognized offline, for example, by a Ph.D.  The rating will also affect the percentage of payment for some professional services of trainers, consultants, tutors, psychoanalysts, etc. <br><br><h3>  Attribute Nine: Continuous Service Development and Scientific Approach </h3><br>  The world is perfect in its imperfection.  Therefore, after 100, and after 300, and after 10,000 years, education as an industry will be as relevant as it is today.  However, every nation and every person has its own level of training needs.  Therefore, you need to consider the development proposals from the users themselves.  And use a scientific approach to the development of the resource, including for creating programs that purposefully reveal individual talents and abilities. <br><br><h3>  Attribute ten: profitable business service model </h3><br>  Sources of income: advertising systems, a percentage of the cost of paid educational services, courses, webinars, consultations, etc. according to the ‚Äúclient protection‚Äù scheme, as well as bonuses from using a dataset.  A profitable business model will provide educational Facebook with independent development in achieving higher goals: victory over global poverty and giving everyone a chance for education, which will provide modern knowledge, unleash potential and strengthen internal strength. <br><br><h3>  Will we start? </h3><br>  Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Alisher Usmanov, let's start the Exodus from poverty.  Let's start work on creating an educational facebook.  The strong should teach the prosperity of the weak.  Being the first is complete insanity, but maybe that is why the names of the first survive the centuries.  Mark, Jack and Alisher, are you going? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/84e/97b/277/84e97b27719b4f8b8e53b73694039855.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331758/</a></p>
