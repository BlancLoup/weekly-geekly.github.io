I study in one of the technical universities, which is recognized as ineffective. <img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a4/f60/7a2/1a4f607a2f617c1cf97a354e8435d22d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  First grade </h1><br>  Studying in the first year of university, I did not experience any problems.  Everything was perfect: at the open door, applicants were advertised for their cool students, they study a whole stack of modern programming languages, excellent teachers, and so on.  Spent an impressive presentation. <br><br>  Of course, first of all I was interested in precisely those disciplines in which they teach programming.  A university is a university - you cannot get anywhere from general disciplines (such as philosophy, economics, ecology, cultural studies, etc.).

      But!  I was happy.  I enjoyed studying at this university.  Really good teachers.  Mathematics is high.  Informatics began to learn office suite.  And here I began to doubt the teacher (let's call him X). <a name="habracut"></a>  I asked the teacher to give assignments in the LibreOffice office suite.  I do not want to use paid (or illegal) software, especially if there is a free version.  X refused my request and what should I do in Microsoft Office?  So in our country, students are encouraged to switch to free software.  By the way, there is no explanation at all: a training manual with tasks and everything. <br><habracut><br>  In parallel with the seminars (Microsoft Office) lectures on the programming language SI were held.  No one understood anything.  The teacher just simply inserted the text from a textbook on the slides and read it monotonously monotonously.  At first, I, like the others, tried to write off at least the code from the slides, but did not have much time, because with such font size and number of lines it is too difficult to do.  It was funny that the teacher tried to improvise: from time to time he changed words in places or inserted the word "actually" into his speech.  Then I had to come to terms with this situation.  Many people understood that attending these lectures was a waste of their time. <br><br>  The next semester began the course "Object Oriented Programming in C ++."  This course was the most useful for all the time at university.  Although the local teacher and taught the book, at least he told and showed!  I do not mind what he taught on the book, which we were not officially given.  The book, by the way, of the same name. <br><br>  It turned out that the material required for the lab in different disciplines largely intersects.  As a result, one teacher clearly lectured another.  And X is still working at our university. <br><br><h1>  Second course </h1><br><img src="http://trunset.ru/images/news/18647fd0e41690601e4cdd202a7c11db1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the second year, the university began to bother me.  There was a discipline of ‚Äúoperating systems‚Äù in which we were given boring lectures (with all my programming effort ... It probably depends on the ability of the teacher to deliver the material).  Fortunately, there was a manual with tasks for the shell in ubuntu.  I myself began to do these tasks and slowly get acquainted with Linux.  But where, one wonders, is the university's merit?  I could just as well go to work and study what I need in the evening. <br><br>  We had another teacher "nihilists."  He didn‚Äôt say anything at all, but didn‚Äôt demand anything.  The teacher pretended to teach, students - that they study.  In principle, maybe that's why I did not do anything, but simply departed this semester at the ‚Äúlectures-gatherings‚Äù. <br>  In the next semester, I finally got angry.  The situation when the teacher himself knows nothing, explains nothing, but shows off and REQUIRES me.  Two of these were the last straw that made me write this article. <br><br><h2>  Graduate student </h2><br>  We have a graduate student who takes his duties very formally.  That is, he formally conducted lectures, conducted seminars.  But he spent them in such a way that it would have been better not to spend and not waste our time.  He told that there are functions in JavaScript, showed a couple of examples and that's it.  A nightmare. <br><br>  Giving a laboratory assignment job such that I myself had to look for books and video tutorials - after explaining the material ... By the way, I prepared well for laboratories.  But the thing is different. <br><br>  Where is his job here?  Why does he work in our university, wasting our time uselessly?  He even gave almost no foundations!  Just an assignment.  Freshmen he also gave the task to write a site.  And why not immediately come to grade 11 to schoolchildren and say: ‚ÄúGuys, write a diploma‚Äù? <br><br><h2>  Bearded man </h2><br>  Another teacher (let's call him E) disrespectful of his work - reading lectures.  He literally reads them from the leaves.  A pile of boring mumbles with irregular intonation.  Sometimes it was even funny, for example, E when decoding the RGB abbreviation instead of ‚Äúred green blue‚Äù said ‚Äúred green black‚Äù.  The audience under the table =).  He raised the mood for everyone, while reading the words ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù, uttering ‚Äútra‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. <br><br>  How would a teacher react if a student comes to the exam with printed answers that he hasn‚Äôt even read before, and will read these answers?  Negative.  Then why should students tolerate such a teacher who behaves similarly?  The fact is that E requires you to complete tasks that, to do, you need to shovel a non-sickly pile of documentation.  He also has a number of other stupid requirements, but I will not talk about them, as if I began to spread to every little thing, you would hardly have read this article. <br><br>  So, E requires that tasks be completed without errors.  If there are errors in the work, it makes the report reprint.  Fortunately, I posted the material in such a way that the task begins with a new sheet.  If it turned out to be without errors, then I insert it into the new report.  I just feel sorry for the paper to mercilessly spend it on reprinting the same thing, and even on one side only. <br>  In ignorance of the material, E reproaches the students themselves, saying that they do not attend lectures.  By the way, at first everyone went.  But after several such lectures only 5 (think!) People came to the audience.  One wonders why people don‚Äôt go to lectures.  If he read them normally, everyone would go. <br><br><h1>  What to do? </h1><br>  I don't want to argue with him for several reasons.  First, there are not enough teachers in the university.  Therefore, even if we write a complaint to him with the whole group or even with a stream, they will not dismiss him.  But then we will backfire: he must take the exam. <br><br>  Secondly, I could argue with him, if I knew the material perfectly, then he would not be able to fill up.  But the fact of the matter is that if I knew the material, I would not have such problems.  I would just pass everything. <br><br>  Some absurdity is obtained.  The task of the teacher is to teach the student, and not to read the text from the paper.  If a person does not know the discipline, he can not complain not to the teacher - he will later pass the exam to him.  If a person knows how to make a lab (due to self-study), then there will be no problems with it.  A student makes and rents a lab.  But the teacher did not do anything!  He did not take part in teaching a self-taught student and did not train those who did not study self-study. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  As a result, this semester, no discipline related to programming, but a lot of time spent. <br>  As you can see, our university is not the worst in terms of IT, but it still does not provide the necessary skills.  Now I stand on the border between the third and second course.  And more and more often the thought comes to me: should I not leave the university?  I get little benefit there, and all I want to learn is that I have to study it myself.  University only hinders.  It is a pity only for the time spent ... I did not go to the university for the sake of physical culture and philosophy ... <br><br>  Waiting for comments and your advice.  How do you find justice for such teachers? </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183224/</a></p>
