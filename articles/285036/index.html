  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programmer Motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, My name is Eugene. <br>  I have been working in the human resource field for about 1.5 years. <br>  During this time, I conducted a large number of interviews with specialists in various fields - testers, technical writers, developers, database administrators, user interface designers, team leads, project managers, etc. <br>  Naturally, having some experience, some information that has accumulated - each person seeks to systematize it.  So it was with me.  In this case, I chose one factor by which I selected several categories of programmers - motivation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. I speak: professional experience and salary.  I think: to get into this company, a year to work out and you can go to a solid western company.  The main thing to gain experience.  This motivation is typical for young professionals who have little experience <br><br>  2. I say: it is important to increase knowledge in new technologies, to see the results of their activities.  I think: if they offer me as much as I get now - is there a reason for me to switch? <br><br>  3. I say: it is interesting for me to develop in the X direction, because at the previous place they tried to implement it, but they did not implement anything.  I want to develop alongside real professionals.  I want to work in a company where the software development process is documented, there are clearly defined procedures.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

      4. I say: I want to manage the team, I have enough background, a lot of successful projects.  I think: it seems to be under way, if he knew how much I was getting now. <br><br>  5. Salary is important to me.  For a decent s / n, I am ready to work with dignity.  I think: I am a really good specialist and deserve an adequate salary. <br><br>  So, as we see, motivation revolves mainly around two phenomena - salary, professional growth. <br><br>  Salary is what everyone is willing to work for. <br>  Professional growth is what salary often covers as a socially desirable response.  I have met very few people who are motivated only by growth - these are very valuable people, but only for the company.  So the company gets a good specialist for relatively little money.  for a man, this is not always good.  After all, such people are mainly focused on work - no personal life, only a passion for development. <br><br>  People who talk only about wages - at least they are not cunning.  But monetary motivation is a very primitive level.  Often these people overestimate themselves. <br><br>  The most effective ones are those who aspire to develop and at the same time receive good money.  Moreover, professional growth must be accompanied by financial growth.  And believe me, dinners, insurance, gyms are not as motivating as regular salary revisions, as well as revision of the employee‚Äôs remit.  After all, the expansion of responsibility and increase of income is the most effective criterion of professionalism (in the event that all this happens fairly) for the majority of specialists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285036/</a></p>
