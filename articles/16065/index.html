  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will there be normal hosting in Russia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://vedomosti.ru/">Vedomosti</a> published an article with communications from telecommunications companies about plans to build several large data centers at once. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I quote the <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2007/11/12/135898">article</a> here almost completely: <br>  " <br>  Last week, the intention to build in Moscow a data center area of ‚Äã‚Äã1000 square meters.  m announced telecommunications company "Karavan".  Its marketing director Andrei Tsumanov assumes that this center will become one of the largest in the capital.  "Caravan" is going to spend on this project most of the investments planned for next year - $ 6 million. <br>  ... <br>  In September, Synterra Holding announced plans to build a network of 40 data processing centers in Russia (data centers, or data centers).  Its project is called ‚Äú40 √ó 40‚Äù: data centers will be located at 40 sites, and the capacity of communication channels will be 40 Gbit / s. <br>  ... <br>  Russian system integrator ISG invests 2 billion rubles.  in the construction of a network of data centers at nine sites.  At one of the sites in Dubna, there will be five buildings with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã20,000 square meters.  m - this project claims to be the largest in Europe.  Investments in it will amount to 1 billion rubles. <br>  ... <br>  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù in September built the fourth own data center, it occupies 2000 square meters.  m <br>  " <br><br>  And now from myself. <br>  Problems with the hosting provider have already got nowhere higher.  For the current year I replaced three: masterhost, spaceweb, ru-center, they are all from the top ten. <br>  On the masterhost, the famous May disconnection didn‚Äôt happen - it moved out earlier, after 3 failures in 4 months on my server. <br>  Spaceweb seems to have stopped catching mice at all.  Earlier a year ago, it was possible to contact technical support, they helped, now after half a day the answer is ‚Äúsorting out‚Äù and then silence, that's all.  It is customary to roll barrels at RBC, ready to throw your stone.  I can be mistaken, but it seems that the team on her own spat on the job after the purchase of this hosting.  I did not know when the purchase was made, but I fixed a change in the mood of technical support, it seems that they don‚Äôt want to work.  In this case, despite the fact that I sit on the VIP rate, sometimes the brakes are terrible, although at times everything flies.  Weekly fever with email: the spam filter was configured without warning - a fair amount of messages just disappeared. <br>  Now I transported mail and part of the servers to the pv-center, I could not rejoice for two weeks.  Then a major failure on the equipment, two days with almost no mail.  As luck would have it, these two days were ‚Äúhot‚Äù and the company suffered significant losses from idle mail, not to mention reputational ones.  In the middle of the night, calling partners from Canada to Irkutsk and asking them to repeat urgent mail for a free service - my colleagues will not forget this for a long time. <br><br>  Everyone has failures, and sometimes a particular person has bad luck, but something tells me that not everything is all right with the hosting level between the ‚Äúhome page‚Äù and the VPS in Russia.

      For hosting with guaranteed resources and RELIABLE is ready to pay 3000-4000 rubles.  VPS, when you start to consider the cost of administration is much more expensive, and he does not need it.  Overseas hosting also has its disadvantages.  It remains to wait and hope that someone will guess to raise money where they do not just lie, but cry out about quality service. <br><br>  I apologize for the emotionality, all successful hosting :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16065/</a></p>
