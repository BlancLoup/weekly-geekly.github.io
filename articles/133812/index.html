  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is outsourcing in telecom scary as it is painted?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, increasingly, large telecom operators are thinking about reducing costs.  One of the most obvious ways is to outsource network operations.  And if you work in such a service, it is quite logical that you will have doubts about your future fate.  Is it all really dark? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By writing this post, I was led by a recent meeting with potential ‚Äúvictims‚Äù of outsourcing.  It was felt from their side that they were more interested in the question ‚Äúhow to prevent a transition,‚Äù and this is due to the fact that people are not sure of their position after the transition. <br><br>  I am engaged in Managed Services (outsourcing) from one major vendor.  Before that, I worked for a western telecom operator and supervised the operation of the network, which is being outsourced.  I will try to formulate my experience in the field of outsourcing, the main issues and problems, so to speak, a view from the inside from a participant in the process from two sides. <br><br>  When I first learned that my service was scheduled for outsourcing, I felt a little uneasy.  A little, to put it mildly.  I am a person with more than ten years of experience at telecom operators, moving to the equipment manufacturer?  This is not mine!  I have been working here for nine years, and me to the vendor?

      The first few years we successfully fought off this project, but the transfer was inevitable, as the telecom operator around the world uses such a service, with the exception of Russia.  And this ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù needed to be changed, especially since the ‚Äúaccession‚Äù of Russia paid off with an additional discount on the entire service. <br><br>  We are all human, and we all feel insecure about tomorrow, when we cannot plan it.  And this is exactly the situation.  Another company, other people, other processes.  Moreover, by the number of employees in Russia, the vendor surpasses the operator by almost 20 times. <br><br>  However, there is nothing to do, the global treaty has been signed - it is necessary to begin the process of implementing Russia.  The operator's manual was also concerned about possible problems, but, first of all, problems of maintaining the quality of network service.  Therefore, I was asked to move ahead of the rest of the staff for a month, for, so to speak, ‚Äúpreparing the soil‚Äù.  At that moment, the process seemed simple and obvious.  Alas, the number of rakes laid out on the way was very much.  Each question had to be solved long and hard.  But this post is not about that, if it becomes interesting to someone I can separately describe the legal, financial and organizational issues of outsourcing. <br><br>  I think that outsourcing is more interesting for people who will be transferred to another organization.  I noticed that at meetings with potential customers their technical staff are interested in the same questions as my colleagues in the telecom operator.  Chief among them is "how to stay?" <br><br>  Obviously, the main reason is concern for their future.  Everything is quite clear here.  As soon as a contract is signed, people are transferred (namely, a transfer) to the vendor's staff.  And this means that the operator can no longer get away from the vendor: people who know the network, transferred. <br><br>  In fact, people remain in their positions, dealing with the same issues as before with the operator.  The issue of reducing staff at a vendor in such a project will not be at least a year - the larger the network, the more personnel, and, therefore, the more difficult the adaptation procedure. <br><br>  In addition, the vendor has other areas of business, so that there is the possibility of growth in other areas. <br><br>  Well, and finally, it is important to note that there is an alternative to outsourcing to reduce operator costs - staff cuts.  Agree that a transfer to another company is better than being fired due to a reduction.  Often, for companies with Western accounting, such a parameter as Head Counting (profit per person) is more important than the amount of transaction costs. <br><br>  From my own experience, I can say that having gone to a vendor, I became involved not only in the operation of one communication network, but also in preparing for the outsourcing of other networks.  And this is very similar to planning your own business. <br><br>  So, <s>devil</s> outsourcing is not so bad as it seems.  For many, it will be an opportunity to grow in the future, or change the direction of activity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133812/</a></p>
