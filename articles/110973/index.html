That is, even I am several years older than this company;) <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/110973/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c1/093/bc0/9c1093bc0d3aa17909ffbe512a327019.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Actually, rewind just before 1989.  It would seem that you wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by anyone with a computer, but the interest in them is enormous - there is nothing surprising in the fact that many people wanted to make money in this area.  IBM also contributed to this, and shortly before that, it made the architecture of its computers open - it turns out, anyone could make computers or components for them.  Yes, yes, at that time Taiwan was literally teeming with all sorts of electronics companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is now we calmly refer to the nameplates of ‚ÄúMaid Inca‚Äù, but then such production was not very much appreciated, which means it did not give an opportunity to anyone who wanted to enter the world market.  Even the largest ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù companies from Taiwan were faced with a problem in the face of the policy of Intel Corporation, which sent product samples exclusively to its partners, which had a good reputation during their long joint work.  Samples coming to Taiwan (six months or a year after the announcement) were of much lower value - it was almost impossible to compete with Western manufacturers with such an approach.

They were former employees of the company ... Acer :) Namely, they were named <b>Wayne Hsieh</b> , <b>TH Tung</b> , <b>MT Liao,</b> and <b>Ted Hsu</b> (to make pronunciation easier, the names are written in the official English transcription).  Having a good experience in a promising area, they decided to establish their own company, ASUS, in a small apartment.  Where does this name come from?  Everything is just like the world.  There was a desire to be closer to the top of the alphabetic chain, so from the original word ‚Äú <b>Pegasus</b> ‚Äù (ancient Greek Œ†ŒÆŒ≥Œ±œÉŒøœÇ, ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù is a symbol of success and rebirth in Greek mythology.) Decided to keep only the last 4 letters.  Having added a few pretentious words, ‚Äú <b>ASUSTeK Computer Incorporated</b> ‚Äù was born - this very name is considered correct and complete. <br><br>  So here.  Originally, the newly minted Pegasi planned to engage in consulting other companies on the production of motherboards.  But they didn‚Äôt go uphill with this business - the tricky Taiwanese from other companies were quite satisfied with fulfilling third-party orders for boards and components, so the creation and implementation of something innovative was simply not the case.  Things did not go well with the production of our own chipsets - there was a shortage of production capacity and a corresponding test base, for example.  As a result, it was decided to retrain into a ‚Äúlighter‚Äù business sector - the creation of motherboards by hand. <br><br>  The year was still 1989 - by this time, Intel released its 486 processor ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486">Intel 80486</a> ) - without thinking twice, ASUS decided to take a bold step, namely ... to develop a motherboard for a new processor based only on its own experience and having it with you Only publicly available information about the new CPU.  Even more surprising is that they succeeded - the ‚Äúmother‚Äù was released pretty quickly (in the same 1989) and just as quickly sent to the local Intel test lab.  The fee was appreciated by experts, after which ASUS began to be regarded as good specialists, which was the key to a long and fruitful cooperation.  American processors and Taiwanese "mothers" literally healed soul - ASUS began to receive rich information support from Intel, thanks to which reputation and revenues went up.  It can be said that it was precisely since then that the company opened its doors to the world market and finally there was a serious reason to officially register ASUS, which was done on April 2, 1990. <br><br>  The company had a lot of mottos, here are just a few of them: ‚Äú <b>Heart of technology</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>Rock Solid - Heart Touching</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>Inspiring Innovation - Persistent Perfection</b> ‚Äù. <br><br>  For several years, ASUS was, as it is now fashionable to say, a ‚Äúyoung, dynamic company‚Äù - new boards appeared, production volumes grew, and the staff increased proportionately.  Many technologies were developed, many of which later became the de facto standard. <br><br>  In 1994, <b>Johnny Shih</b> (Jonney Shih), who at one time proposed to create an independent company, came to the position of executive director;  By the way, Johnny Shea still works in the company, being its president.  Pretty soon, under his leadership, ASUS became the world leader in quality and quantity of cards produced - thanks to a creative approach to market problems, the company succeeded in producing motherboards in almost all segments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14b/c61/39e/14bc6139e7bf82706c7d3f26ca56dffa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the fact that the company produced products mainly in the middle and high price ranges, ASUS‚Äôs position at the beginning of the new millennium on the motherboard market has been shaken.  The reason for this was the aggressive pricing of competing companies <b>ECS</b> and <b>Foxconn</b> , which sold their devices at lower prices.  To meet the demand in the low price segment, ASUS established a subsidiary <b>ASRock</b> , which over the next couple of years allowed to catch up.  Already by 2005, ASUS had regained the title of the largest manufacturer of motherboards - even then they were used in every third computer.  A little later, ASUS took up the production and other devices - for example, video cards and optical drives. <br><br>  It is clear that such activities could not go unnoticed by other companies, so the number of partners continued to grow every year.  For example, cooperation with <b>Hewlett-Packard</b> has led to the appearance of servers in the company's products that are assembled to order;  and since 2001, servers have been produced under its own brand. <br><br>  When in the tower of a cramped computer case (even if the server one) it became cramped and just tired, the company decided to grow not only high, but also in breadth - products began to appear in many new areas, which later became known as ‚Äú <b>3C Strategy</b> ‚Äù (which can be ‚Äúdecrypted as‚Äú Computers, Communications, Consumer electronics ‚Äù.) <br><br>  For example, in 1997, under the ASUS brand, the first laptop appeared - after a certain success of such a debut, the company decided not to lag behind other manufacturers, but rather made a special emphasis on a new category of consumer devices, after which new laptop models began to appear like mushrooms after rain. <table><tbody><tr><td> An interesting fact - several laptops, including the models <b>ASUS U5</b> , <b>S6</b> (both in leather and bamboo), <b>W7</b> and <b>U1,</b> became satellites of one team of climbers during the conquest of Chomolungma.  To reach the base camp at an altitude of 5000 meters, only ASUS laptops continued to work.  Other laptops could not even boot up due to the extremely low ambient temperature.  Thanks to the efforts of the leader of the team of climbers, captain Wang Yongfong, the ASUS U5 laptop reached Everest (height 8,848.43 m).  The mountaineer took with him this laptop as a symbol of harmony of environmentally friendly technologies and nature - thus, ASUS laptops were the first in the world to conquer the Top of the World.  Speaking of Everest.  In 2008, over 24 million ASUS motherboards were sold in the world - if you put them on top of each other, the height of the resulting tower will be 600 times higher than the highest mountain on Earth.  The first ASUS laptops ( <b>S200N</b> and <b>Lamborghini</b> ) visited the south and north poles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/686/bb3/e52/686bb3e522c0cd595be7da360c7bd763.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUS laptops were the first to be in space - during the 600-day orbital mission of the Mir space station. </td></tr></tbody></table><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a6/358/554/7a6358554c8e3cfbab4a9cc5b0cf9a4d.png" align="left" alt="image">  Due to the fact that ASUS has succeeded in the release of motherboards, the company has the means to further develop the business.  In this regard, the year 2005 turned out to be particularly fruitful - it all started with the creation of the ‚Äú <b>Republic of Gamers</b> ‚Äù product concept, intended primarily for players and enthusiasts.  In the ROG series, the most high-tech products are still being produced, which, by the way, can rightly be considered image-based - the price is very good;) <br><br>  The pioneer was the <b>ASUS Crosshair motherboard</b> , and the most powerful product of this series today is the <b>ASUS Rampage III Extreme</b> motherboard, which works with Intel Core i7 processors on socket 1366. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ce/ebe/c6e/4ceebec6eedac894ba62a45e2939e348.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In January of the same year, the company announced cooperation with the notorious Italian company <b>Lamborghini</b> , after which the fruit of joint work was presented: the fruit of joint work, the <b>VX</b> series laptops, was presented.  This is another image series, which has recently been replenished with devices of the seventh generation - apparently, the fruitful duet is not going to dwell on this. <br><br>  A year later, on June 5, 2007, at Computex, ASUS and Intel presented to the public a new series of ultra-compact notebooks, which later formed a new class of devices, netbooks.  The first representative of the new series was the <b>ASUS EeePC 701</b> netbook (working under the control of the <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D27157">Intel Celeron M processor</a> ), the appearance of which really made you think about the future of all other notebook manufacturers - I think it‚Äôs not worth telling about the netbook growth rate. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e58/05c/b8b/e5805cb8bc5a5d4bd0ce6fc2d15ab2a8.jpg" alt="EeePC">  = Easy to play, easy to learn;  easy to work. </td></tr></tbody></table>  Together with the launch of netbooks, in the same year, the company began developing new devices for itself - communicators under its own brand.  Although in fairness it should be noted that the company began producing mobile phones in 2003. <br><br>  On January 3, 2008, the company underwent a major reorganization, which resulted in three separate industrial groups: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  <b>ASUSTeK Computer</b> , which all products (motherboards, laptops, smartphones, monitors, servers and communication equipment, multimedia devices and consumer electronics) began to produce exclusively under its own brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  <b>Pegatron Technology</b> , under the brand of which are manufactured computers, enclosures and other devices.  In the name of this subdivision, one can unwittingly notice the beginnings of the same ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  <b>Unihan Technology</b> was responsible for the contract manufacturing of computer components.  Clients include leading integrated equipment manufacturers (OED), distributors, active resellers (VARs) and system integrators from over 50 countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/023/c75/6c8/023c756c815aa1fae739413b88d55127.jpg" alt="image">  Of the latest events - in 2009, ASUS together with the navigation ‚Äúmonster‚Äù <b>Garmin</b> organized another duet, the main purpose of which is to produce devices under the brand <b>Nuvifone</b> , which are smart phones with a full-fledged navigation component.  More recently, the duo has released a new model, <b>GarminASUS A50</b> , running the Android OS - I will review this novelty next year, but for now I‚Äôll use it to learn more about the pros and cons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/313/00c/e77/31300ce77a002c7f5f469bbf7391b765.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since its introduction in the near 1989, the company has gone from unknown ‚ÄúPegasuses‚Äù to the large international corporation ASUSTeK Computer Inc., with more than 100,000 people now scattered around the world. <br>  Today, ASUS products are among the best-selling in the field of mobile technologies and computers.  Among the Taiwanese manufacturers ASUS ranks first in terms of product quality, and in the near future is going to come out on top in the world.  Well, the most interesting, perhaps, is still to come. <br><br>  <b>Holiday greetings!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110973/</a></p>
