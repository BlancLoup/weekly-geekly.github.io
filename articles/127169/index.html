      It substantiates the statement that in order to make a project on IP implementation successful and quick, the customer, apart from understanding the goals of such a project, wanting to achieve them and resources to achieve them, will need to spend a lot of their time to participate in each project stage as a full-fledged project. the participant.  To facilitate the understanding of projects for the introduction of IP by the customer, an analogy was drawn between custom software (software) and a regular product - a carpet, which can also be made to order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>How does the implementation of an integrated information system (CIS) differ from ordinary services?</b> </h4><br><br><h5>  <i>Sample Product and Related Services</i> </h5><br><br>  For example, take the production of carpets to order.  Here there is a product - a carpet, and a service - we are ready to sell you not just some kind of carpet, but the carpet that you need, and we will not only make it according to your design, but also deliver it to you.  Carpet is a product that is identified by the article number, edging, pattern, color and size.  Quality carpets are individual and bulky.  Because of this, they are sold under a complex scheme - an individual order with delivery, and orders can be made by both intermediaries and end customers. <br><br>  Everything is simple and clear to everyone.  There is a product, and there are related services. <br><br>  A lot of things are made to order with delivery to the client: anyone knows what a carpet is and how to use it;  how many people know how to produce it, and almost everyone knows how to sell and deliver it.  Competition requires suppliers to optimize processes, improving product quality and reducing its price, adding various related "chips" - delivery, original raw materials, processing, bonuses, special programs for loyal intermediaries and much more. <br><br>  The production cycle itself is quite complicated: many stages, different groups of products go through different production cycles, products must be monitored individually.  The main production process (weaving) is also very complex and practically impossible without the use of machine tools with numerical control (CNC). <br><br>  Many production cycles for similar massively demanded products are similar to those described: automobiles, clothing, furniture, heating systems, etc.  Anyone who knows from ‚Äúa‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äù one of the listed industries will have no difficulty in understanding any other. <br><br>  Basic and higher education institutions teach the basics and basics of all production and trading cycles.  These objects are made over many centuries, continuity cannot be stopped, they will be produced and used as long as the consumer exists. <br><br><h5>  <i>Now about IP, software and IT</i> </h5><br><br>  The quality of the product is the so-called software (software, software).  The first serious trouble is that it is an intangible asset.  Those.  it cannot be touched and seen just like a carpet.  Software exists only in the minds of people.  Many people think that it exists in computers - a delusion that is easily verified (open the computer lid and you will see that it is not there). <br><br>  In order to understand the problem of intangible assets (IA) in general, let us turn to music.  This is a very ancient intangible (spiritual) asset.  It would seem that over the millennia of the existence of music (by analogy with carpets), its essence should be clearly understood by everyone.  But try to find two people who would absolutely equally explain in words what music means to them, or what kind of music they would like to listen to. <br><br>  What is the analogy?  Both music and software mainly exist in the minds of people.  And all people are different, and accordingly the understanding of the essence of each IA will be at least somewhat different. <br><br>  So, although carpet and software are products, the degree of their perception by people is fundamentally different.  This means that methods for determining the quality of material products may not work for software.  Anyone can be unable to perceive certain software, and it will be simply useless to prove the opposite. <br><br>  Another fundamental difference is the absence of any standards for software production processes, solid OPTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS and methodologies.  For example, the development methodology in small groups of programmers ‚ÄúExtreme Programming‚Äù, which greatly simplifies all processes, minimizing documentation, testing, and providing for interaction between the customer and the supplier in half-game form.  From practice, there are cases when one person, sitting at home, created software. <br><br>  In turn, the carpet production process is strictly regulated, supplied with a set of mandatory certificates and regulations, requires serious investments and a certain minimum number of people. <br><br>  But the most important difference between intangible and tangible assets is the following: one carpet goes to one consumer, and a second carpet needs to be produced for the second consumer;  in the case of IA, this is not the case, and the same software once produced can reach a large number of consumers. <br><br>  The desire of software manufacturers to create a product that meets the requirements of various customers has led to the fact that the software has many settings (even if they are not available to the simple user, and exist only for specialists), which can even affect the basic functionality. <br><br>  Because of such opportunities, software manufacturers supply their products with documents in which they disclaim any responsibility for the possible consequences of various software operation options and fully place such responsibility on users. <br><br><h5>  <i>An example of a CIS and related services</i> </h5><br><br>  The service often accompanies the product as a necessary component for the final satisfaction of customer requirements.  In the case of a product, the service is optional, i.e.  not required.  For example, any client can independently deliver the carpet to his home.  As for serious software with a large number of settings, it is almost impossible to use them without resorting to certain services of software implementation specialists, i.e.  third-party services are required. <br><br>  Given the above complexity of the perception of software and the need for additional services, customers often perceive the software and service as a whole.  The problem is further aggravated by the fact that the consultant is not obligatory for the final choice of the carpet, in the case of software it is impossible to do without it, and often the choice of software is left to the consultant.  Thus, services on ‚Äúdrawing up a technical assignment (TZ)‚Äù + ‚Äúsoftware delivery‚Äù + ‚Äúsoftware implementation‚Äù are very often perceived by the customer as one whole.  We note a unique feature of the implementation process - its enormous influence on the final state of the product.  An illiterate introduction may invalidate a product or distort its main functions beyond recognition, and this will not be the fault of the manufacturer.  For comparison, illiterate delivery of a carpet or illiterate placement of it on the floor or on the wall does not greatly affect its consumer qualities. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that it is in the selection procedure of the software and the design of the TOR that most of the problems arise with its subsequent operation.  Incomplete or ‚Äúfor show‚Äù compiled TK easily leads to the failure of the project.  That is why it is desirable to involve independent experts for the preparation of TK. <br><br><h4>  <b>To order or not to order TZ?</b> </h4><br><br>  TK is needed when the necessary software can not be found in the finished form.  The volume of TZ directly depends on the amount of planned changes.  If the number of improvements significantly exceeds the volumes of the finished functionality, then it is better to buy only the basis (platform), and develop a specific solution (configuration) ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù based on the TK.  Sometimes the documentation on an already existing system, which for some reason does not satisfy the customer, can act as a TK.  In the case of carpets, TK is necessary only when it comes to individual ordering.  It is clear that it is necessary to issue an order in writing, specifying all the parameters of the carpet and attaching a picture.  This is the so-called statement of the problem (PP) - a summary of the client's requirements. <br><br>  So, PZ is always needed.  The PP begins with the objectives of the project, determines the composition of the software and the implementation priorities. <br><br>  TK is necessary if there is no ready or similar software. <br><br>  PZ acts as a kind of guarantee that the purchased product will solve the formulated tasks. <br><br>  The PZ must be formulated by the customer, since only he knows what he wants to receive as a result. <br><br><h4>  <b>How to choose software</b> </h4><br><br>  Choosing a carpet, you, most likely, make the final decision on your own, based on your own many years of experience in using carpets and your visual perception.  A custom-made carpet with a non-standard pattern will require from you the skills of a designer and artist, and most likely you will contact specialists in these areas.  Similarly, with the choice of software: if you have not previously used software to solve a certain range of tasks similar to the new task, then you cannot do without the help of consultants.  Moreover, by this time it is necessary to have at least the formulation of the problem. <br><br>  And for a complex project, finding good consultants is not so easy. <br><br>  Moreover, to whom the choice of software is entrusted, to that and answer that it (software) will cope with the task.  Those.  Consultants must be responsible for both the selection at the beginning and the acceptance of the software at the end of the project. <br><br><h4>  <b>Implementation options</b> </h4><br><br>  The introduction of the carpet has not many options - hang on the wall or put on the floor. <br><br>  Implementing custom software (for example, ERP systems) is a very complex process consisting of presentations, demo versions, installations, testing, refinement, re-testing and operation. <br><br>  And the Customer MUST spend a lot of their own time on it, otherwise the project will fail without it. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is required from the customer KIS</b> </h4><br><br>  Clearly formulate requirements <br><br>  Understand the need for continuous participation at each stage <br><br>  Have a basic knowledge of IT and computer literacy <br><br>  Have a computer at the level of confident user <br><br>  Allocate time to each phase of the project. <br><br>  Orders appoint employees responsible for the timing <br><br>  To appoint the competent manager (coordinator) of the project <br><br>  Allocate cash resources <br><br>  Have and use the experience of similar projects <br><br>  Prepare a workplace for the performer <br><br><h4>  <b>What is required from the supplier of KIS</b> </h4><br><br>  Have and use the experience of similar projects <br><br>  Possess adequate information technology tasks <br><br>  Have enough competent specialists <br><br>  To appoint the competent manager (coordinator) of the project <br><br>  Commit to software product support <br><br><h4>  <b>How long will it take</b> </h4><br><br>  The timing of the project is a separate topic that requires both sides to have a professional approach to project management.  In any case, the deadlines are more often broken than fulfilled.  To control the timing you need a phased schedule.  Each performer makes it independently for himself, and if the final date for the completion of the project is given, then when developing the schedule, they are repelled from it. <br><br>  In the course of the project it is recommended to jointly adjust the time after each stage is completed.  The customer‚Äôs pressure on the contractor in terms of meeting the project‚Äôs deadlines (if they were initially compressed) often significantly reduces the quality of the latter‚Äôs work. <br><br>  Actual terms depend more on the customer than on the supplier, since the customer has less experience in such projects and, consequently, more risks to disrupt the project stages depending on him. <br><br><h4>  <b>Testing</b> </h4><br><br>  In principle, this process also exists for carpets: you buy a carpet and try to walk on it.  I didn't like it - you bring it back to the seller: he will either return the money or replace it with another carpet. <br><br>  Software is much more complicated.  The customer is forced to spend a lot of time on this procedure, and the supplier will correct the defects found (possibly associated with the spaces and omissions of the customer in the formulation of the problem).  The customer often believes that testing is the prerogative of the manufacturer.  Like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm paying money, look for your own mistakes.‚Äù  This is valid only if the implementation follows the scheme of buying ready-made software without any additional settings and improvements.  In all other situations, even related to the primitive software configuration in accordance with the CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, there is a need for testing by both the supplier and the customer.  Here the principle works: ‚ÄúDo you need these improvements?  You will have to check and accept them. ‚Äù  The same situation is with the system updates in the period of post-warranty support.  Since in most cases these changes are necessary first of all to the customer, he will also have to check the consequences of these changes. <br><br>  It is very important to use separate test servers for testing.  This minimizes the impact of the testing process on the customer‚Äôs work if the system has already been put into commercial operation. <br><br><h4>  <b>When you can sign an act of completion</b> </h4><br><br>  There should be several acts - in accordance with the most important stages of the project: <br><br>  1) The act of deploying the system (in demo version mode) on the territory of the customer.  It fixes the readiness of the customer‚Äôs infrastructure and the installation of an information system with a demonstration (ready ‚Äúas is‚Äù) configuration from the supplier (which may have been shown during the system demonstration), provision of standard documentation and training video courses. <br><br>  2) Act on the completion of the collection of system requirements (PP).  It records the time of collection of 50-80% of all incoming and outgoing data in the IP, as well as the completion of familiarization with the existing IP functionality of customer representatives on the basis of a demo version. <br><br>  3) The act of putting into trial operation.  It fixes the completion of testing by the supplier and the installation at the customer of the configuration adapted to the requirements specified in the problem statement, the start of the joint tests (or independent of the customer).  Training customer specialists.  Test transfer of initial data from old software products. <br><br>  4) The act of entering into commercial operation.  Fixes the completion of joint testing and the transition of the customer to work in the new system. <br><br>  5) The final act.  It is signed after the completion of all tests and / or after at least a month of industrial operation of all modules of the system.  Provision by the contractor of the documentation on the created software configuration.  It is very important that the customer understands the practical impossibility of a complete lack of complaints and questions about the already used new system.  If questions were not included at the task setting stage, then they will be considered additional - otherwise the project will enter the conflict phase of endless ‚Äúminor improvements‚Äù and will eventually be blocked by the supplier due to depletion of the project budget for software refinement. <br><br>  Attention: the successful signing of the final act only means the beginning of an infinite path of development and maintenance of IP, associated with constant changes in the customer's business and market situation. <br><br><h4>  <b>What's left overs</b> </h4><br><br>  Estimated and cost of the project <br><br>  Project Management Problems <br><br>  Features of each project and the people who participate in them <br><br>  And remember: the <u>road by walking!</u> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127169/</a></p>
