    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Definition of keywords </h4><br>  Speaking of search engine optimization, first of all, we need to determine by what keywords (inquiries) content should be found. <br>  The easiest way is to imagine what the user could type in the search box to get to the page with your content. <br>  Then select from the resulting list the phrases that, on the one hand, most accurately characterize the content, on the other hand, are more or less general, common and acc.  popular.  Do not take very long specific requests (as a rule, they are not popular) and too general words (they are very competitive). <br>  If you need a more professional approach, then turn to statistics.  Statistics will help to understand in what form the request is more popular. <br>  I recommend the <a href="http://adstat.rambler.ru/">Rambler statistics service</a> , since  in contrast to the similar <a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/stat/wordsstat.pl">service of Yandex</a> , it shows the exact number of requests for a specific request, and Yandex is a summary (all requests with this phrase / word). <br><br><h4>  2. Optimize headings and text </h4><br>  When we have decided on the requests, we need to write them in the text. <br>  The most important thing for placing a request is the place on the page - the title tag.  As a rule, all normal engines process this field automatically, if not, you need to register it manually or change the code of your engine.  Type one or more of the most important words on your list in the heading. <br>  But remember the main thing - <b>readability should always be in the first place</b> !  No need for "far-fetched" optimization.  Use keywords only if you can keep the meaning! <br>  Then make sure that the selected keywords are at least once in the text of your content, rephrase the sentences, if necessary.  Where appropriate, try to use the h1-h6 subheadings, and put keywords in them, this also helps the reader.  But again, do not get carried away and do not overdo it. <br>  <b>Text optimization should be invisible!</b> <br>  If it‚Äôs not about your content, you can help it become more visible by leaving a keyword in the comments on the page (of course, in the context of your review, and not just one word). <br><br>  <i>For example, for a long time I could not find how to correct one mistake in Windows and found a solution on a Western blog.</i>  <i>Having used the Russian-language phrase in my commentary, I achieved that this blog can now be found on the Russian request</i> . <br><br><h4>  3. Correct links </h4><br>  Of course, text optimization is often not enough to get to the top positions in search engines.  For more confident promotion you need inbound links to the page with content. <br>  Yes, many people do not really know that by referring to our own or someone else‚Äôs page, we increase its position in search engines.  But it is necessary to arrange these links correctly - in order for the link to be really useful for the page, it should contain keywords (which we defined in the first paragraph) and not the address of the site itself, as is often done. <br>  And <b>do not be afraid to refer</b> to high-quality content, regardless of whether this is your page or not! <br>  After all, it is you who determine whether other users will see it or not.  Refer to your friends, interesting and useful materials, and of course, refer to your own content (whether it is an article or a photo).  If you do it sincerely, and not for money (like me :)) then it is not at all ashamed.  This is also natural, as is the mention in speech. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, I want to caution against the opposite effect, if you do not want the popularity of any website or page, do not refer to it even in a negative sense, because the search robot does not distinguish between emotions. <br>  Better not to mention it at all.  If you really need to show the address of the ill-fated site, then use inactive links (without "a href =").  Then and only then it is permissible to use the prohibition of typography (automatic conversion to code) such as writing " <b>_http</b> ".  In other cases, this is unacceptable! <br><br>  Of course, this is the most basic information about search engine optimization, it is a whole science with a lot of aspects.  Read the <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/">seo forum</a> and experiment, of course! <br><br>  Separately, it makes sense to consider the features of optimization under " <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">Blog Search</a> ", under <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> , etc.  I can do this later if you enjoyed reading :) <br><br>  Miroslav Marshalkin <br>  leader, optimizer, startup <br>  <a href="http://www.marshalkin.ru/">www.marshalkin.ru</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38142/</a></p>
