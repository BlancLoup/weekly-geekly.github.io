Forgotten names, gender discrimination and advertising gadgets - under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>1. Automatic substitution of the name</b> <br>  A compilation opens with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D245189115563264">letter from Sony Ericsson</a> , in which the company has forgotten the name of their client.  Classic error:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/106/b29/7ca/106b297caa4f9d3fe6eec0417d16b1f3.jpg"><br><br>  Personalization of letters - an excellent technique that helps to attract the attention of the recipient and increases customer loyalty.  However, poorly individualized messages can quickly destroy so carefully built relationships, reducing all your efforts to nothing.  Therefore, even using automatic mailing of messages, check that everything is configured correctly, and instead of ‚Äúclient‚Äù, ‚Äúsubscriber‚Äù a person saw his name. <br><br>  <b>2. Gender discrimination</b> <br>  As you know, letters can be personalized not only by name, but also by other parameters: by gender, age, behavioral factors.  This is especially true for greeting email. <br><br>  On February 23, QIP.ru portal, congratulating its customers on the men's holiday, forgot to target letters by gender.  As a result, in addition to men, the girls also received congratulations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7cf/ab1/345/7cfab1345f31d8232abf9af2065e86fb.jpg"><br><br>  And on March 8, on the contrary, not all female QIP.ru audience waited for pleasant words for the holiday.  Whether men have received these letters for them - we do not know.  So in the future be careful with congratulatory letters. <br><br>  <b>3. Unsubscribe can not receive</b> <br>  Another common mistake of mailing is an illiterately implemented or absent unsubscribe procedure. <br><br>  We give you 2 examples: one is connected with the link to the formal reply, and the second is related to the process of the formal reply. <br><br>  Not so long ago, we received a letter from a reputable resource about the internet business <a href="http://roem.ru/">roem.ru</a> , who forgot to provide a letter with a link to a reply.  Given that this is, in fact, the basics of literate mailing, you can understand our impression - it is as if a gentleman left the house without pants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/309/c0a/b2e/309c0ab2e28eba76fff5a4cddd2513d8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. And this is how Apple unsubscribe works:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f7/8ea/a9b/9f78eaa9b872a99ba37bce592a4aa8dc.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, Apple has been famous not only for its excellent products, but also for its somewhat totalitarian approach to many issues.  As it turned out, the ‚Äúwe know better what you need‚Äù policy extends to the company‚Äôs newsletters: you can see in the photo that, despite the unsubscribe, the news will come in another 10 days.  To frivolous addressee changed his mind, therefore. <br><br>  <b>5. Measure seven times</b> <br>  Often, especially when time is tight, companies send their letters without checking them in advance.  As a result, subscribers receive letters with broken links, with a strange set of characters instead of words, incomprehensible images, and so on.  In the last post, we just published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/unisender/blog/143639/">selection of services for previewing your letters</a> .  But what happens if you do not use them: <br><br>  Dick's Sporting Goods sporting goods store was in such a hurry to inform their customers about the sale taking place in their network that they forgot to check the letter before sending.  As a result, no matter how hard the recipients tried, they could not find a single working link: either to the site where additional information about the conditions and terms of the sale was posted, or to the image links to the product catalog.  To top it off, they also did not leave their contacts, and they did not provide subscribers with a list of stores.  In short, Dick's Sporting Goods tried to do everything so that their customers could not get on sale: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d7/c7e/577/1d7c7e577e0fc4139e58d2c2c789caa9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>6. And in this letter from eLama.ru obvious problems with images:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/482/1a7/78b4821a70f4f7e06b46ff84ab7e924c.jpg"><br><br>  But the problem is not even this (problems with pictures are found in almost everyone), but the fact that in this case, the pictures contain text that cannot be done categorically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96c/17e/8ad/96c17e8ad277a7c1675efb3e5b8ccbaf.jpg"><br><br>  Remember: if you offer text information, then give it in text format.  Images are recommended for illustrative purposes only. <br><br>  <b>7. Freudian reservation</b> <br>  In a hurry, sometimes quite funny mistakes happen.  For example, one of our clients <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D299779393437569">shared a story about</a> how his company once sent a million subscribers a letter with an interesting headline: ‚ÄúSale of Geypad.‚Äù  Surely these letters had amazing open rate and CTR. <br><br>  <b>8. And one company included 24 thousand people in the mailing list.</b>  Many of them probably never got to the text of the letter, tired of scrolling through the mailing list. <br><br>  <b>9. Signature errors</b> <br>  Here, typical blunders can be divided into 2 groups: incorrect design or too much / too little information. <br><br>  Signing the email is needed to inform the recipient of the letter how he can contact you, as well as promote the necessary resources.  But you should not get too carried away and go into the smallest details, otherwise your signature may be even more than the message itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c2/041/0a0/9c20410a08a8b8d355dee5d2158e494b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention.</b> <br><br>  We wish our readers and customers to be more careful and careful.
