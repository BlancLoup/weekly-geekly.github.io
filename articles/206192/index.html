After examining the existing hardware, I chose an Intel D945GSEJT motherboard with an Atom N270 processor.  I didn‚Äôt like the cases that were on sale for this motherboard, so I screwed the whole thing to the cardboard along with the hard drive, put Hackintosh and hung it up behind the cabinet.  The whole thing hung for a couple of years, intensively downloading and distributing files and the Internet throughout the apartment. <br>  Everything would be fine, but the speed of this unit was enough only to give and take, there was no talk about playing, or converting HD video, or helping when rendering 3D graphics.  And I would like to. <br>  The idea to make a powerful home mini-server seized me finally at the beginning of this year.  Just could not sleep at night.  And to get rid of this obsession, it was decided: <br>  1. Do not like everyone else <br>  2. Make the smallest Desktop of the existing <br>  3. To make the project not individual, but taking into account industrial standards, as well as with the justification of the adequate cost of further serial production. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  - So, practice: </h4><br>  Desktop implies (at a minimum): any desktop processor (not mobile or truncated), built-in power supply, as well as the possibility of expansion and upgrading (if possible). <br><br>  Since the budget is limited (unfortunately), I did not develop my own PCB.  The choice fell on the existing <a href="http://luna-design.org/docs/DNK-H_Basics_EN.pdf">standard Thin Mini-ITX</a> - compact motherboards with support for desktop processors.  They also have the ability to power from a 19.5v internal power supply.  In the future, this greatly simplified the development of the power supply.  Another feature of this standard is that for all Thin Mini-ITX motherboards, the location of the CPU is at the same place regardless of the design of the board and the manufacturer.  This parameter was key in the design of the compact body.

      Then came the moment of choosing materials and production technology of the case.  Since I have never done this in my life, I had to study several books on metal working (stamping, die casting, laser cutting, CNC milling), thermal conductivity of materials, as well as the principles of constructing electrical circuits for a power supply (and many what else now I do not remember). <br>  As a result, the choice fell on aluminum, because of the excellent thermal conductivity, ease and simplicity of metalworking.  As a production technology - CNC milling.  Much cheaper than stamping and casting due to the lack of expensive forms.  The power supply is a high-frequency, non-transistor TOP-251 shim, with a power of 120w + efficiency of 85+ <br><br>  After examining the nomenclature of a domestic manufacturer with CNC Milling technology (CNC milling) and sending several requests for sample production (and having received in response either a fig or prices equal to a used car), I realized that I need to look further ... to the South East ... to Asia. <br><br>  There is such a site.  Called Alibaba.com.  It presents almost all Asian manufacturers of a variety of goods and services.  Everything's there.  Really everything.  Having studied the offers and prices, I realized that this is what I need.  Here I must say that Asians are good performers, but to make them come up with something is a perfect useless thing.  If you want to get a distinct result, they need to clearly describe the procedure.  Make the most detailed documentation on the part (in our case) and additionally describe its final properties (finishing, for example).  It is desirable to flavor all this with pictures, or (ideally) with examples of the final result. <br><br>  In the end, I needed to prepare models and drawings in one of the industry standards.  Unfortunately, at that time I was not in the tooth with my foot as it is done at all ... After reading on the Internet and learning which programs all these wonders are drawn, I chose Solidworks for modeling and visualization, and for developing the Altium Designer power supply (by the way, Altium Designer) I didn‚Äôt master it. The power supply unit ordered on Freelancer.com).  Two weeks to study video lessons on Solidworks - and I began to calmly embody my idea. <br><br>  The main difficulty in the development of a small body is to pump the necessary air flow through it.  In my case, at least 25 cubes.  I would like the case to not look like a colander or a sieve (neither from above nor on the sides).  I would also like the design to be as strong as possible, light and protected from sudden impacts in the form of a spilled cup of coffee on the system unit, or a fall from the height of the table (at least).  Skip the flour of creativity and countless number of options during the design of the hull.  I will dwell on the final version: <br>  1. Fully managed to separate incoming air flows from outgoing.  What allowed to successfully start processors with 77w power <br>  2. One processor cooler managed to cool both the processor and the power supply and the rest of the board‚Äôs components <br>  3. It was possible to make the case as closed as possible, durable (withstands my weight - 90kg) and protected from external influences <br>  4. Ability to use different cooling fans (not a lot, but there is a choice) <br>  5. Make the computer silent when performing normal tasks (watching videos, torrents, distributing the Internet, etc.) <br>  6. Simplify the design for easy assembly and cost reduction. <br>  7. Make the case as small as possible.  It turned out 190x190x50 mm <br><br>  As a result, the following configuration was obtained and started up: <br>  Intel motherboard DH61AG <br>  Core i7-3770 processor <br>  Memory 8Gb SO-DIMM DDR3 1600 <br>  Plextor 64GB SSD <br>  HDD WD Blue 750Gb <br>  WI-FI Broadcom 4322 <br>  Fan Akasa AK-CCE-7106HP <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce5/e68/629/ce5e68629d55c998fc933ccfad51b762.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f3/966/a22/4f3966a22e7657aa20396fc0ef925518.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c26/bbd/ce5/c26bbdce581e0ebad78f5a0f50671cf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b4/16b/510/7b416b51005d64596c3f274d1e56c031.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/063/70a/ed9/06370aed97009850ec6491809407bedb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a2/f41/609/9a2f416092bcef3cc8071511f6442346.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/6b2/181/48c6b2181f9bd72673e0ad3c77f27f47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d8/d35/14e/6d8d3514e28df748157eb2addb517f7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Test results: </h4><br>  1. The case temperature when performing normal tasks is warm.  Almost no noise <br>  2. The case temperature when using Core i7-3770 and 100% load is really hot, but not going beyond the limits of nominal temperatures for the operation of internal components.  Noise, but does not take off <br>  3. After several minutes of operation, the processor turns off the Turbo Boost and runs at a nominal frequency of 3.4Gh <br>  4. On the Core i3 and processors with the letter S in the title - everything is quiet and dust free <br><br>  As a result, I revised the design, adding a ventilation slot in the front and sides.  This should increase the flow of air through the body (relieve pressure) and ensure the normal operation of the processor in Turbo Boost mode.  I also decided to change the power button.  Painfully, it turned out terrible. <br><br><h4>  The last option with the modifications on the design (Not photo. Visualization): </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78a/d21/39d/78ad2139dacfc4df20e1ecb5de7b97e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/850/350/1f2/8503501f2abcdc0b888a867bd8bae87d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/a66/67d/5e6a6667d472855438930499bd061ee9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/f46/790/ac7f467906554cc572190dd2bef1fb96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/13d/878/f3113d8786cfb1e3e06d8c0885ff6167.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Balance: </h4><br>  In principle, such a development is not expensive.  And everyone can afford it (if desired, and certain knowledge). <br>  What and how much was spent (not counting the components): <br>  1. Production of 2 case samples (Malaysia) - $ 520 <br>  2. Delivery Malaysia - Bangkok (at that time I lived in Thailand) - $ 71 <br>  3. Development of the power supply and assembly of two samples - $ 550 <br>  4. Delivery of power supplies Kiev - Bangkok - $ 130 <br><br>  In the end - about 40.000r <br><br>  Update: <br>  Many questions on cost.  Here you need to understand that the cost of production of the sample is one thing, and the cost of small circulation is quite another.  In my case, it was possible to agree in advance with the supplier on small-scale production in the region of 3800r with the power supply unit included.  This is without beautiful packaging, customs, our taxes, margins on sale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206192/</a></p>
