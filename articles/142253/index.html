  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remart: how I created my business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Part III: The Team <br><br>  So, after a long journey of searching for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139498/">ideas and investors</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141703/">making decisions,</a> we are getting close to the most difficult and interesting stage of our project.  There is no way back, only forward.  And the most important thing now is to take with you the right people, i.e.  build a great team. <br><br>  How to organize a team and infect all members with a common goal?  I am constantly tormented by the question: ‚Äúwell, why don't they understand?‚Äù After all, you first need to strain and work hard to get a result, and only then you can think about how to relax.  Obviously!  It turns out that not many people think so; I would even say a minority.  It turns out most want it all right now.  They care little that you are at the very beginning of the journey, that you do not have the resources to make their life a fairy tale, and that they need to be pressed into spending for a certain period of time.  There is such a concept ‚Äúthe desire to avoid uncertainty‚Äù and, it turns out, most people aspire to avoid this very uncertainty as much as possible. <br>  Working in a startup, the team is faced with the fact that such uncertainties at every turn.  Referring specifically to our project for sure.  We are launching a new product on the market, no one has done it before, which means it is difficult to understand the value of the product for consumers.  According to our assessment, this is valuable, but this is our assessment, and conducting some kind of research is expensive.  Often we turn to an opinion from the outside in order to evaluate the service and our entire.  Thanks for the feedback in previous articles, I see that you like, that our efforts are not in vain and we need to move only forward.  We work, we communicate with partners, for them it is also new and unpredictable, the reactions are also different.  It seems that it‚Äôs not fitting to us to turn our noses, because we are still small and not very interesting to everyone.  It is impossible to calculate the revenue: how to build a model, if not with what to compare and there is nothing to be attached to?  Accordingly, the team has nothing to promise, in any case, reasonably calculated.  Complete uncertainty. <br>  In such conditions, we focus on several areas: <br><a name="habracut"></a>  1. The team must constantly be motivated by personal example and infect their optimism. <br>  2. Releases.  Break them into smaller steps to see the result.  To understanding this point, we did not come immediately, but still came.  Before the official launch of the project, we identified 5 stages for ourselves and, gradually, reaching each goal, we felt that we were moving forward and not standing still. <br>  3. Yes, you have to promise and promise mountains of gold.  However, do not give out empty promises.  I approach this issue with caution and promise that I will be able to provide if all goes well.  Uncertainty exists, but it cannot be completely eliminated. <br>  4. Communication outside work and at work, we try to do the most open.  For example, when they rented an office, they made repairs themselves.  We could hire people and our losses would be minimal, given the total costs and the length of the repair time by our efforts.  We did everything ourselves, except for specialized work with electricity and a computer network.

      Here is our repair and team in the faces: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/648/915/7dd/6489157dd1b2a1d9545e0500b1da329d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You know, after all, we really got to know each other and understood who is who and who you can rely on.  As an example, a man recently left us, and he simply set us up.  He is the only one who never came to help.  We expected something similar, but not so fast. <br>  The main thing that I realized is that you do not need to succumb to the momentary impulse and take the first less suitable specialist into the team.  A person should really come to you if you want to work with him side by side.  A startup problem is a small and unknown company, therefore it is very difficult to attract people.  This process takes longer than a company with a name, but taking everyone in a row is disastrous for you.  Now I can say that we have almost fully staffed our company.  People are interesting and talented, which is always a pleasure for me to celebrate.  Working with such people is interesting, but also difficult, because everyone has their own opinion on each question, and finding a compromise is not easy.  I say that the staff was practically staffed, because the appetite comes during the game, i.e.  I want more and more, and the amount of work is only increasing.  I would like to note that we are trying to take a balanced approach to new tasks; therefore, we periodically conduct tests to determine our performance, identify inefficiencies and solve them.  Of course, there is no limit to perfection: we are constantly working on it, and we understand that we still have a lot of reserves in our team, but we are purposefully fighting this.  I advise everyone to pay attention to labor productivity and do periodic monitoring, besides this, the practice of internal training has proven itself well in our practice, when leaders in productivity pull in laggards. <br><br>  Time is the most valuable factor in our work, despite the fact that our service has no direct competitors, customers still want and ask for development, rapid development, new services, new interiors, new partners, and so on.  We ourselves want to provide our clients with full service so that, without leaving the house, by pressing one button, we can transfer the picture to our home.  We learn to value time, for example, all kinds of meetings and meetings are an obvious time eater.  The introduction of simple and long-standing rules in management books allows this time to be clearly saved.  For example, the preparation of a list of issues discussed before the meeting, a letter at the end of the meeting with the decisions taken and with the executives and deadlines.  After these simple measures, our discussion has ceased to go into the air, i.e.  each meeting already brings changes to the work.  For me, it was also a discovery that a good positive effect has the joint viewing of such films as ‚ÄúPirates of Silicon Valley‚Äù and ‚ÄúSocial Network‚Äù - this motivates everyone and helps to prioritize them correctly. <br><br>  People can both raise your project, and destroy, be careful!  Successes! <br><br>  Come to our <a href="http://remmart.ru/">website</a> and <a href="">group on facebook</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142253/</a></p>
