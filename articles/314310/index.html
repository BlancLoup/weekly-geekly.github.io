  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design of Russian cities, where is he?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I grew up in a typical 9-storey apartment building built in the Soviet years.  And our entire neighborhood consisted of either of these houses, or of "Khrushchev".  Most people of my generation (80-90 year of birth) one way or another also grew up in such gray and similar-type "boxes". <br><br>  I won't say that at that time I was somehow worried.  Everything changed when I first went abroad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ac/962/c65/9ac962c65ee34f928e5c7c78a84c9f0d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  And what's in there? </h3><br>  My first path lay in Montenegro.  Upon arrival, I was amazed at how harmonious the city might look.  I felt like I was on another planet.  Ginger tiled roofs and stone houses created an indescribable atmosphere of togetherness.  All the houses in the city were interconnected by one architectural style.

The realization that completely different people live there began to visit me more often.  Europeans otherwise refer to the space in which they live.  Even on the outskirts they do not build their houses according to the principle ‚ÄúAnd so it will come down!‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc7/d47/0fd/fc7d470fd42148db873c89546a12208c.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Let's talk about the Russian resorts </h3><br>  I personally associate the word ‚Äúresort‚Äù with something warm and sunny, something that gives aesthetic pleasure and comfort.  Now look at the photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a92/dfd/1f3/a92dfd1f31174b12a708fe3ad1fcd586.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Find on it Gelendzhik.</b> <br><br>  Personally, I have photos of Russian resorts does not cause a desire to go there, and you? <br>  But investors invest millions of dollars in them.  Build hotels, beaches, infrastructure.  What is the result?  Hello Soviet Union. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/5df/692/b2c5df6924c048b7bb27023d94815085.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Small retreat</b> <br>  <i>Before I continue the article, I will tell you briefly about myself.</i>  <i>I am 32 years old.</i>  <i>Born and lived in Omsk.</i>  <i>Visited 18 countries, was in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean ( <a href="https://smartprogress.do/goal/89/">my full list and impressions</a> ).</i>  <i>I traveled a lot around Russia too: from the Caucasus to Kirovsk (Murmansk region), from St. Petersburg to Irkutsk.</i>  <i>6 years lived in Moscow.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/885/505/121/885505121eb04019802a90ced8062ae5.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Fools, roads and ... </h3><br>  From the height of such an experience of relocation, I can say that almost all the cities of Russia are poorly designed and polluted by Soviet architecture.  All have one disease: the center is sometimes a beautiful small area where you can at least see something, and the outskirts are strewn with a bunch of chaotic gray buildings of the same type.  The lack of infrastructure in each specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city makes people move around it every day, creating huge traffic jams. <br><br>  And even though the situation in the capital and St. Petersburg is much better, these cities did not escape the fate of being built up with tasteless boxes.  I think Peter I would have cried with bloody tears when he saw what the outskirts of his brainchild turned into.  And despite this, I consider St. Petersburg the most beautiful city in Russia.  And I would definitely live in this city if it had changed the climate with Sochi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2c/9e1/e5e/c2c9e1e5e21c42e3919a9dc4c94200a7.jpg"><br><br>  When I talk about good architecture and convenient cities, I often mean Europe, or America, but America to a lesser extent, since I can judge it only from films and acquaintances' stories. <br><br>  In Asian countries, the situation with the design is not better than Russia.  Take, for example, Bangkok, which I visited this summer.  In Bangkok, everything is mixed up: super-modern shopping malls stand next to the old square towers, with slums interwoven between them, and there is a constant natural trade in food and household utensils next to the busy road.  The city has no style: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72a/eb5/aed/72aeb5aede4a4d87b91d1805dc0bbad3.jpg"><br><br><h3>  All roads lead to Omsk </h3><br>  By the will of fate, after 6 years of living in Moscow, I returned to my "native" Omsk.  Recently, in our city, the main roads were repaired, and the center was restored. <br><br>  But for me, this city has long lost its relevance.  He is not for the life of a modern young family.  This city, where you can only drink too much.  Seriously.  You will be surprised by the abundance of alcoholic shops and stalls with draft beer, which are in almost every home.  All parks stopped developing in the 90th year.  They are old and wretched.  And the youth is leaving here, almost all of my friends have left. <br><br>  Now I'm still looking for "my city", in which I could look out the window and not see it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea9/747/cfe/ea9747cfe8294687bf7f35feedfd96f6.jpg"><br><br>  A city where there are many modern parks (by the way, I am a fan of Gorky Park and Museon), where all state institutions and supermarkets are within walking distance.  A transport system allows you to reach any point of the city in 20 minutes. <br><br>  I am mobile enough, I am not burdened with a loan for a car and a mortgage, I have a minimum of things and I work remotely.  And the wife is ready to go with me anywhere. <br><br>  Someone will say: go abroad.  I went to Turkey for a month (even before the crisis with Russia), I tried to understand if I wanted to live there.  This year 5 months spent in Thailand.  As a result, I always found myself feeling that ‚Äúthere‚Äù was a good rest, and in order to live it was necessary to rebuild myself a lot, and almost everything connected with the homeland: family, friends, mentality. <br><br><h3>  Sometimes the mountains move </h3><br>  Now in Russia, large construction companies are beginning to understand that modern people need more than an apartment.  They want comfort not only inside the house, but also outside.  Each of us, buying an apartment for the long term of our life and investing all our money in it, does not want to have a view of the garages or dilapidated Khrushchev houses. <br><br>  Residential complexes do not fully solve the problem.  They are replaced by larger-scale projects from developers: townships and even small cities. <br><br>  I was surprised when I first saw a project of this magnitude.  Right now in the suburbs are building a city of 30 thousand inhabitants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75c/83b/baf/75c83bbaf72c4cffb10cbe06a787725a.jpg"><br><br>  According to the company's website, it will be the world's largest new city, built in the classical style.  The city will have the longest artificial canals in the Moscow region. <br><br>  Well, not cool?  After that, my hope began to warm up, that sooner or later ‚Äúmy city‚Äù would still appear. <br><br><h3>  What's next? </h3><br>  I think this can not stop!  Russia has the largest area on Earth.  So why not use this advantage and not build new tech-friendly, eco-friendly private cities and designed for modern realities?  I thought for a long time that such an idea was utopian.  But global projects prove that this is entirely feasible. <br><br>  <b>PS Habrasoobschestvo, I raised this topic to understand the interest of people in this topic.</b>  I am interested to find like-minded people who think like me.  If the topic turns out to be in demand, then in the next article I will share my ideas of creating a private city in Russia. <br><br>  I also created a group in VC in order to share thoughts and form a team to promote the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprivate cities in Russia: <br><br> <a href="https://vk.com/designgorod"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be0/d82/e26/be0d82e265644644a8622cf5a72fc2cc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The second part of the article " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315428/">The first private city in Russia, to be or not to be?</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314310/</a></p>
