However, only after this postal service will work normally again.  The fact is that now the service is under a powerful DDoS-attack, which continues from Tuesday. <br><br>  In the appeal to users, the creators of the service report that the attack is made by unknown persons, and as a result of the problem now, not only the service itself, but also third-party organizations that work with ProtonMail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To implement the attack using IP-flooding.  The problem now concerns not only the postal service, but also the entire data center where the postal service servers are located.  As a result, interruptions are observed in services / sites of other companies that depend on this data center.  These are several banks and telecommunications companies.

      Despite all the attempts to solve the problem, it is not yet possible to do this, and the support team works almost around the clock, trying to find a way to eliminate the attack. <br><br>  The support notes that despite the interruption of the service itself, encryption remains unaffected, and all user data is secure. <br><br>  The motives of the attackers remain unknown.  ProtonMail uses its official Twitter account to keep users informed of the problem. <br><br>  Let me remind you that ProtonMail is a mail service created by network security experts and CERN.  The goal is to launch a mailer into a robot that would be completely protected from the influence of the intelligence services of any country. <br><br>  Back in May last year, the news appeared on Habr√© that several employees of the European Laboratory for Nuclear Research (CERN) created the ProtonMail mail service.  This email service is one of the most secure in the world.  For example, all information is encrypted on the client side, and all servers of the service are located in Switzerland. <br><br>  In this country it is very difficult, if not impossible, to gain access to private information.  In general, the service can surpass the recently closed Lavabit, which was used by Edward Snowden, which was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/223649/">also written</a> on Habr√©. <br>  For authorization user uses two-factor authentication, with two passwords.  One password is used to log into your own account, as well as to get your own data in encrypted form.  The second password gives access to the encryption key, with which all information is presented in a readable form.  At the same time, the second password cannot be restored - the support service will not help if the password is lost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357788/</a></p>
