Numbers, trends, forecasts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We present new data from the research cycle ‚ÄúSocial networks in Russia today: numbers, trends, forecasts‚Äù, for the second half of 2014.  This is the fifth regular publication of current data on the penetration of social media in the regions of Russia, the demographic analysis of the authors of the messages and the degree of their activity, as well as on the levels of positive in various social media.  For the first time, the study presents data on the social network Instagram. <br><br>  It should be noted that for the first time in the course of research according to TNS data, there has been a slight decrease in the monthly audience of Odnoklassniki, My World and LiveJournal. <br><br>  The first place in popularity among social networks, as before, is taken by VKontakte, whose attendance in November 2014 increased to <b>54.6 million people</b> , Odnoklassniki was second, with a monthly audience of <b>40.1 million people</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1.png">

      <i>* Twitter data are extrapolated based on daily and weekly audience.</i> <br><br>  The study further provides data on ‚Äútalking‚Äù users who openly express their position with public messages in social media.  There were over 35 million such active authors in Russia in December 2014, which generate more than 40 million messages per day.  Active authors, creating public content, make social networks a relevant indicator of public sentiment, allowing you to catch the "live" social problems at the very beginning of the formation of significant trends. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Number of public messages and authors </h2><br>  As for the volume of content posted daily in social networks, here the first and second places are shared by Twitter and VKontakte. <br><br>  It is worth noting that six months ago, the first place in the number of published content was VKontakte, which in Russia traditionally takes over some of the functions that Twitter performs in the world - the exchange of short status messages.  However, by the end of the year, leadership in terms of content with a slight margin was left for Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2.png"><br><br>  <i>* Classmates - data for the Top 100,000 groups</i> <br>  <i>** Facebook - lower score</i> <br><br>  By the number of ‚Äúwriting‚Äù Russian authors, VKontakte is in the lead, and by an order of magnitude ahead of competitors - 23.8 million unique authors.  The next-highest Instagram has only 2.7 million authors. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3.png"><br><br>  <i>* Classmates - data for the Top 100,000 groups</i> <br>  <i>** Facebook - lower score</i> <br><br>  Twitter is the leader in terms of engagement - 119.3 posts per month per active author on this network.  In second place on this indicator - LiveJournal - 34.6 posts.  The rest of the social networks show very close results: 10.3 on VK, and 6.2 on My World. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4.png"><br><br>  <i>* Classmates - data for the Top 100,000 groups</i> <br>  <i>** Facebook - lower score</i> <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Portrait of a user of social networks </h2><br><h3>  In contact with </h3><br>  The monthly audience * - <b>54.6 million people</b> , half of which - <b>23.8 million</b> - showed public activity. <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8a/946/3bf/e8a9463bf4bb4fb68e18aa386c4765dd.png"><br><br>  The gender structure of VKontakte authors has not changed much as compared with May data and is within the margin of error (0.1%). <br><br>  <b>Age of authors</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5.png"><br><br>  Compared to the May data, the active authors of VKontakte matured - the number of authors younger than 18 years old decreased by 4%, from 18 to 24 years old - by 1%, while the number of authors aged 25 to 34 years and from 35 to 44 increased by 6 % and 1% respectively. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vk1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/d87/71a/7c5d8771a2904bb3bb109e3ae9048455.png"><br><br>  The penetration of VKontakte in the regions of Russia increased among the leading regions - by an average of 5%.  As before, the greatest penetration of VKontakte in St. Petersburg is 40% of the population of the region, second place is Moscow - 29%. <br><br><h3>  Classmates </h3><br>  Classmates, as before, remain primarily a platform for interpersonal communication.  The monthly audience * of the network is <b>40 million people</b> , while only <b>1.7 million authors</b> demonstrate public activity in groups. <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1be/4f7/dc9/1be4f7dc9f274e56a36e1b587e203d93.png"><br><br>  In Odnoklassniki, the share of female audience increased even more - by 7%. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6.png"><br><br>  Classmates, as well as VKontakte, demonstrate a trend towards maturing audience.  With the reduction of authors younger than 24 years old by 6%, the number of authors aged 35‚Äì44 years old increases by 2%, 45‚Äì54 years olds - by 5% and over 55 - by 8%. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ok1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/052/667/35605266710144e9b869411ad85a61b2.png"><br><br>  Classmates are traditionally more popular in the regions of Russia, in the first place in terms of penetration, as before the Sakhalin region, Khabarovsk and Trans-Baikal Territory. <br><br><h3>  My world </h3><br>  The December study showed a serious drop in the activity of users on the My World network compared to summer data.  Thus, according to November data, the monthly audience of the network * was <b>25.1 million people</b> , and the number of active authors in December was only <b>0.8 million people</b> . <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b5/614/707/2b56147075294d859884c7d596ea6cf4.png"><br><br>  The gender structure of My World practically did not change, the proportion of men increased by 1.3% compared with May data. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/7.png"><br><br>  The age structure of the authors in My World is almost unchanged.  The number of authors under the age of 18 and from 18 to 24 years decreased by 2% and 3% respectively.  In all groups older than 25 years, the number increased by 1-2%. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mm1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6df/25c/435/6df25c435d204f5ab75657f65de18dfe.png"><br><br>  The top 5 regions in terms of penetration remained virtually unchanged, but the proportion of My World authors among the population has decreased significantly.  The Chelyabinsk region is in the lead in the rating, and if in May 4.22% of its residents showed public activity in My World, in December their share was only 1.39%. <br><br><h3>  Facebook </h3><br>  On Facebook, the activity of the authors is consistently low.  According to the results of the November measurements, the monthly audience * of the network was <b>24.2 million people</b> , the number of active authors in December was <b>0.8 million people</b> . <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/322/90e/6b1/32290e6b1dff42f2a57fbb22f3378274.png"><br><br>  The gender distribution of authors on Facebook has not changed since May. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/8.png"><br><br>  <i>*** according to Facebook rules, a person may be at least 18 years old.</i> <br><br>  On Facebook, the most noticeable changes occurred in the group of authors of the range of 34 - 44 years old - their number decreased by 10%.  At the same time, the share of authors aged from 25 to 34 years and from 45 to 54 years increased significantly - by 6% and 3%, respectively.  The number of authors older than 55 years has increased by 2%. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fb1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecf/bf8/558/ecfbf8558786443b9f2da2332b9b8b1e.png"><br><br><h3>  Livejournal </h3><br>  LiveJournal remains a place for ‚Äúto read, not to talk‚Äù lovers: out of <b>16.7 million people</b> per month audience *, only <b>188 thousand authors</b> are active. <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05b/117/eed/05b117eed6b54bdfba4f3e06f5c53135.png"><br><br>  The number of active male LJ authors increased by 2.5%.  It is worth noting that LiveJournal is still the only popular social network with a predominantly male audience. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/9.png"><br><br>  LiveJournal is the only social network that has become younger in the last 6 months: almost 3% of authors under 18, authors aged from 18 to 24 years old increased by 2.5%, authors from 35 to 44 years old decreased by 4%, and in the remaining age groups, the number of authors decreased on average by 2%. <br><br><h3>  Instagram </h3><br>  Instagram is gaining popularity in Russia and bypasses Twitter in both the number of active authors and the size of the audience.  The monthly audience of the network * was <b>13.3 million people</b> , and the number of active authors was <b>2.7 million</b> . <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/869/ed9/878/869ed98781014392989b8f8d9444edfd.png"><br><br>  Among the active authors of Instagram, the overwhelming majority - 70.6% are female audience.  Despite the predominance of the fair sex in all social networks, Instagram is the undisputed leader on this indicator. <br><br>  Data on the age of active authors in Instagram is missing. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/In1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/fb9/93b/233fb993b68a4e2c8e8b50915f87915b.png"><br><br>  In terms of Instagram penetration, Leningrad Oblast, Moscow, Sakhalin Oblast and Moscow Oblast are leading.  Instagram is participating in the study for the first time, so it‚Äôs impossible to talk about the dynamics so far, the dynamics will manifest itself in our next regular research. <br><br><h3>  Twitter </h3><br>  Twitter has significantly reduced the pace, but nevertheless continues to grow.  In November, the resource audience * amounted to <b>8.5 million people</b> , and the number of active authors - <b>2.1 million people</b> . <br><br>  <b>Gender of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/3b7/275/8f53b72758b941c589cf7a1b07ba1d0b.png"><br><br>  Data on the age of active authors on Twitter is missing. <br><br>  <b>Geography of authors **</b> <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tw1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bae/8bd/1ed/bae8bd1ed1d04c5fa2967cd98847a112.png"><br><br>  In terms of Twitter penetration into the regions of Russia, the previous leaders of the rating - St. Petersburg and Moscow practically did not change their shares, but lost places in the rating due to the growth in the number of residents of the Sakhalin Region and the Chukotka Autonomous Region who became the leaders of the rating. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Comparison of socio-demographic characteristics of the authors </h2><br>  <b>Age of authors</b> <br><br>  The youngest social network - Vkontakte.  Here, the minimum number of active authors is over 44 years old, authors over 35 is only 6%.  The core of an active audience falls on authors aged 18 to 34 years. <br><br>  The most adult network is Odnoklassniki: authors under the age of 25 are only 19%, the core of the active audience is 24-44 years old and almost 20% are users over 54 years old. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10.png"><br><br>  For Twitter and Instagram data on the age of active authors are missing. <br><br>  <b>Gender authors</b> <br><br>  With regard to the gender distribution of active authors, women dominate in almost all social networks.  Instagram and Odnoklassniki are in the lead - 50.6% and 50.2% respectively.  The only exception is LiveJournal, in which there are only a few men, but still more than women - 55.8%. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/11.png"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Positive and negative in social networks </h2><br>  The number of positive messages in social networks prevails over the negative, and compared with the summer data, it has become more positive.  Positive leader is Instagram, the number of positive messages is 91%.  In second place - My World: 88% positive messages.  VKontakte and Facebook show similar results - 83% and 82% positive, respectively.  A bit worse with the positive in Odnoklassniki and Twitter - here there are slightly less positive messages: 77% and 76%.  And the maximum negative is almost 30% for LiveJournal. <br><br><img src="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12.png"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Trends and forecasts </h2><br><br><ol><li>  The main trend of the second half of 2014 is the explosive growth of Instagram in Russia.  This network first came to TNS research by audience, and by the number of active authors came out on the second line after VKontakte. </li><li>  Social networks that are traditionally popular in Russia are growing up - there is a simultaneous reduction in the share of users under 18 and an increase in the share of the older audience. </li><li>  The gender structure of social networks is stable and almost unchanged.  In all networks, except LJ dominated by women.  Interestingly, the most feminine social network - Instagram, is at the same time the most positive, while the ‚Äúmale‚Äù LiveJournal is the most negative social network. </li><li>  The trend for the positive remains in all social networks, despite the difficult economic and political situation in the country.  The share of positive on average increased by 10%. </li><li>  Summarizing, it can be noted that social networks in Russia continue to grow, although not as active as before.  Instagram has the largest growth margin and, to a lesser extent, Twitter. </li></ol><br><br>  <i>* TNS Web Index, November 2014</i> <br>  <i>** Brand Analytics, December 2014</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284042/</a></p>
