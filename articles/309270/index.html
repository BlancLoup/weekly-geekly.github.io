For the seventh time the School opens its doors - this year we will again prepare the full-stack of developers. <br><br>  Training will be held in the Moscow office of HeadHunter in the evenings twice a week.  The first stage of selection <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">can be done</a> directly on the school website, filling out a questionnaire and solving the proposed tasks.  Those who have coped with them are waiting for tasks more difficult, and then an in-person interview.

      A quarter of our technical department are <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">graduates of the School</a> .  We love developers because we can cook them! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  School 2015: how it was </h2><br>  Each School traditionally begins with the stages of selection - this is a serious test not only for those who want to enroll, but also for ourselves.  Every year we change and complicate the selection process - we introduce additional steps, invent new tasks - and every year we receive an increasing number of applications. <br><br>  Last year‚Äôs sixth set was no exception - more than a thousand people sent their questionnaires with solutions to the tasks of the first stage, and more than half of them went to the next round.  According to the results of the second stage, 80 people were invited for an interview and only 12 started training.  Such a rigorous selection is not a whim, but a harsh necessity, because we strive to give a chance to the most capable and purposeful.  However, we immediately made a job offer of one of our "entrants", so that to attend lectures at the School of Programmers, it was enough for her to just look into the next room. <br><br>  This curious fact illustrates another pattern - along with the number of applications, the level of students also grows.  Therefore, every year we make changes in the training program.  For example, we abandoned the basic lectures on Java, with which many of our "students" have already managed to work closely - it allowed us to focus on more advanced things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/ca0/e4f/aa3ca0e4f4bd491a968546a7c1341ecb.jpg" alt="HeadHunter technical department office"><br><br>  Says Stas Yarkin, a graduate of the sixth set of the School, and now - the developer HeadHunter: <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/763/1c5/63f7631c59504b889e35e7e3a03b623f.png" alt="Stas Yarkin - a graduate of the School of Programmers" align="left">  Before school, I was developing various ERP systems on the .NET platform.  The school was interested in the opportunity to get acquainted with the new world of web-development for me, to explore a variety of technologies with which I had not dealt with before. <br><br>  The first thing that immediately struck me was how important the school is for hh.ru itself, how much effort and attention they put into it.  On the first day we were given a warm welcome with gifts and cookies.  And then there were many interesting lectures, each of which was perfectly prepared.  In addition to theory, there was also a practice, thanks to which I got a real experience of programming in Java, and finally learned to write tests. <br><br>  Throughout the training, we were constantly asked to give feedback: what we like, what we don‚Äôt like, what we are interested in to know, what can be done differently.  Therefore, I am sure that this year the school organization will be even better, and the classes will be even more interesting. </blockquote><br><h2>  School Seventh Season - Earlier than Game of Thrones </h2><br>  In the best traditions of the School, the next academic year will be divided into two parts: theoretical (from November to February) and practical (from March to May).  Within the theoretical part, our teachers - HeadHunter developers - will talk about modern web technologies that they themselves use: from the JVM device and popular Java frameworks to JavaScript and Python.  We pay special attention to engineering practices, flexible methodologies and product development.  More information about the program can be found on the <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">website of the School</a> . <br><br>  Compared to last year, we tried to make the program richer, replacing some general lectures with more advanced material, and also make an additional emphasis on the practice of homework.  During the theoretical part, the training will take at least 10‚Äì15 hours a week.  Future students should plan their time in advance - unfortunately, many have to leave the School ahead of time precisely because of academic performance problems. <br><br>  The practical part of the time may take even more, because in three months our students are developing from scratch a working prototype of a real service.  Students are required to be fully involved in the product development process: participation in stand-ups and intermediate demos with the customer, determining the MVP and prioritization of tasks, and in the end the final defense of the project to HeadHunter employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a76/b49/90f/a76b4990ff8b45268de7f4c2e857e6f3.jpg" alt="Peter Dosychev, graduate of the School of Programmers on the protection of the project"><br><br><h2>  What to do to get me? </h2><br>  The only condition for admission - the successful passage of all stages of selection.  This will require training in Computer Science and familiarity with algorithms and data structures.  It‚Äôs not necessary to quote <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B:_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7">Cormen</a> or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Knut</a> from memory, but we expect you to navigate in the subject area, know how to assess the complexity and find effective solutions.  Also at the first stages it is necessary to demonstrate proficiency in one of the programming languages: Java or Python. <br><br>  First of all, we focus on recent graduates and young professionals to give them a chance to start a career in development.  However, neither experience, nor the presence of specialized education do not play a big role - many of our graduates were still university students, and some up to the School worked in specialties completely unrelated to web development.  The main thing that united them was the desire to grow and develop. <br><br>  To go through the first two stages of the selection, you do not even need to get out of the chair - just <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">fill out the form</a> and proceed with the assignments.  See you soon at the School of Programmers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309270/</a></p>
