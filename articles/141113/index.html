JS Lovers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is a continuation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140831/">previous</a> and second of the general series of biographies.  This time I reviewed a few last names that are better known among JS fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a95/2cc/be1/a952ccbe19bd5e666998a6e4b1002394.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  John Resig </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed0/d37/05c/ed0d3705c089c2cf4bd303862ced37d8.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://ejohn.org/">ejohn.org</a> <br>  In his 27 years, John has already managed to leave a mark on the history of the web.  First of all, it is known as the creator of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> - the most popular js-library in the world (the <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library/all">latest W3Tech rating</a> ).  Love for JS can be traced throughout his biography.  For four years he worked at Mozilla Corporation, first as a JavaScript evangelist and later as a JavaScript Tool Developer.  Exactly a year ago, he <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/118640/">left</a> Mozilla to join the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> , where he became the head of their Open Source activities and JS-development.  In addition to the main work, Resig participated in the development of a large set of useful pieces, including <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/fuel-02-progress/">FUEL</a> (project for Firefox Plugin development), <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a> (language for creating visual effects), <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle</a> (engine for CSS selectors), as well as <a title="Envjs" href="http://www.envjs.com/">EnvJS</a> and <a title="TestSwarm" href="http://swarm.jquery.org/">TestSwarm</a> .  In addition, he wrote two books on JS - <a href="http://jsninja.com/">"Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja"</a> (2011) and <a href="http://jspro.org/">"Pro JavaScript Techniques"</a> (2006).  And yes, John is an amateur playing Starcraft 2 (id: frowny.396, Silver Protoss)

    <h3>  Nicolas Zakas (Nicholas C. Zakas) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ba/134/e75/1ba134e75aa6d053362d649753b441ac.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">www.nczonline.net</a> <br>  Nicholas began his career as a webmaster in a small software company, then he started designing UI and prototyping, until in 2006 he moved to Silicon Valley and joined Yahoo! .. In Yahoo!  He worked for five years, where he became the front-end techlide of the main page of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">yahoo.com</a> , took direct part in the development of <a href="http://www.yuilibrary.com/">Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://www.yuilibrary.com/">User Interface (YUI) library</a> , and also created the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/cookie/">Cookie Utility</a> , <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profiler/">Profiler</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI Test</a> .  At the moment he is the owner of "Nicholas C. Zakas Consulting" - conducts lectures, trainings, reports and the like.  Like other web developers of this level, Zakas is trying to carry knowledge into the world by all available means.  In particular, he is the author of such books as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047022780X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Btag%3Dnczonline20%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1789%26amp%3Bcreative%3D390957%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D047022780X">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680279X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Btag%3Dnczonline20%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1789%26amp%3Bcreative%3D390957%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D059680279X">High Performance JavaScript</a> , co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470109491%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Btag%3Dnczonline-20%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1789%26amp%3Bcreative%3D390957%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D0470109491">Professional Ajax</a> , in addition he writes articles on various resources - from <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">Sitepoint</a> to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/authors/%2520/nzakas">A List Apart</a> .  The most interesting of his articles are carefully stored in a special <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/writing/">section of his site</a> .  As for public speaking, everything is <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/speaking/">ok</a> here too - his name is as a speaker at various companies - from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> . <br><br><h3>  Nate Koechley </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/947/c8c/3f2/947c8c3f2e42f925723dd8916fc5ebd0.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/">nate.koechley.com</a> <br>  Nate is one of the first web developers at Yahoo !, working there since 2001.  If you look at his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/natekoechley">LinkedIn profile</a> , you can see his full height as a high-class professional in his field.  It is interesting to observe the change of his posts in Yahoo!  - Web Developer, Web Development Manager, Web Development Team, Senior Web Developer, Platform Design Team, User Experience and Design Group, and finally his current position - Director, Design Architecture &amp; Prototyping at Yahoo! .. As for its current activities, it affects the development of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">open-source Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">User Interface (YUI) Library</a> .  Well, when Neith doesn‚Äôt work on YUI, he writes on <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/">YUIBlog</a> and in a <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">personal blog</a> , promotes web standards and speaks around the world - from lectures at National Taiwan University to trainings on <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/01W">Microsoft (MIX)</a> and <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2008-design/ajax-ui-design-dreamweaver-cs4-by-nate-koechley/">Adobe (MAX)</a> .  In parallel, he remains an independent consultant.  In particular, he was invited as a consultant to New York Times Digital, Netflix, PayPal, eBay, TiVo, Walmart, Oracle, Adobe and Microsoft.  Well, and where without books - Neith took part in writing ‚Äú <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309">High Performance Web Sites</a> ‚Äù (O'Reilly, 2008), ‚Äú <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modular-Web-Design-Components-Documentation/dp/0321601351">Modular Web Design</a> ‚Äù (2009) and ‚Äú <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Large-Web-Applications-Producing/dp/0596803028">Developing Large Web Applications</a> ‚Äù (O'Reilly, 2010).  And the last interesting nuance - in 2009, he received his first <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%26Sect2%3DHITOFF%26p%3D1%26u%3D%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html%26r%3D1%26f%3DG%26l%3D50%26co1%3DAND%26d%3DPTXT%26s1%3D7640498.PN.%26OS%3DPN/7640498%26RS%3DPN/7640498">patent</a> , which is associated with a new method of scaling text on web pages. <br><br><h3>  Remy Sharp </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da0/bc1/db6/da0bc1db6917c7f3a9b1f291c5374174.jpg"><br>  Personal site: <a href="http://remysharp.com/">remysharp.com</a> <br>  I first learned about Remy Sharp when I discovered <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/">jQuery for Designers</a> .  In the About section I met his phrase: ‚ÄúThe reason I use jQuery is my laziness.  Its code is easy to write and easy to read.  This library kills a lot of tedious aspects of programming and lets you do funny things. ‚Äù  It was about the same as what I felt at that time, so I immediately liked this guy :) <br>  After that, the name Remy became more and more common to me.  In 2009, he became the organizer of <a href="http://full-frontal.org/">Full Frontal</a> - a conference on JavaScript, held in the UK, which became annual.  <a href="http://introducinghtml5.com/">Introducing HTML5</a> was published in 2010, where he co-authored Bruce Lawson.  In addition, he is one of the authors and editors of the resource <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5Doctor</a> , the developer of <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a> , <a href="http://html5demos.com/">HTML5 Demos</a> and <a href="http://snapbird.org/">Snap Bird</a> (JS-utility for searching Twitter), is a member of the jQuery team.  And yes, he is a web evangelist who loves javascript :) <br>  If you touch the place of his work, it can be noted that he was not seen as an employee of any large company, but rather the opposite - from 2006 he runs his own company, <a href="http://leftlogic.com/">Left Logic</a> , which is engaged in web development and training. <br><br><br><h3>  Jeremy Keith (Jeremy Keith) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43f/ca6/4f3/43fca64f370788a410fbbcfe3f6a105c.png"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://adactio.com/">adactio.com</a> <br>  The name of this Irishman is most likely familiar to you thanks to his books.  Jeremy has three of them so far: <br>  <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 for Web Designers</a> , <a href="http://domscripting.com/">DOM Scripting</a> and <a href="http://bulletproofajax.com/">Bulletproof Ajax</a> .  He currently works for the English company <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> , and is also an administrator at <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats.org</a> .  In addition, over the past three years, Jeffrey has been developing his offspring - the <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">huffduffer.com</a> project - a service that makes it easier to work with podcasts.  Information about his public activities on the Internet is not as much as the other comrades represented here, however, if desired, everyone can get acquainted with his works and interviews on his <a href="http://vimeo.com/adactio/videos">channel in Vimeo</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  Alex Russell </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/48b/f57/2ca48bf57c688fa2ca11d999ad5eae96.png"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://infrequently.org/">infrequently.org</a> <br>  If you dealt with the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> library, you are most likely familiar with Alex Russell, who was one of its creators in the 2004th year.  He is currently working at Google, where, as a software engineer, he is working on a <a href="http://google.com/chromeframe">Chrome Frame</a> and an open web platform.  He also helped Google standardize <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a> <br>  Prior to Google, he served as Director of R &amp; D at <a href="http://sitepen.com/">SitePen</a> , and also did rich user interfaces for <a href="http://jot.com/">JotSpot</a> and <a href="http://informatica.com/">Informatica</a> , where he began to help develop <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> .  In addition, Alex is an excellent speaker, as can be seen by viewing his videos from Google I / O: <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/html5-what-s-next.html">HTML5 &amp; What's Next</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/learning-to-love-javascript.html">Learning to Love JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/html5-today-with-google-chrome-frame.html">HTML5 Today with Google Chrome Frame</a> . <br><br><br>  The next representative from the world of frontend will be a little out of the number of those whom I indicated above.  It's just that I undeservedly forgot to enter him in the first six.  Therefore, I hope that no one will mind if it hangs in this :) <br><br><h3>  Douglas Crockford (Douglas Crockford) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c8/2d8/de9/8c82d8de918e7e2dc49c7d2298e34a13.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://crockford.com/">crockford.com</a> <br>  It is difficult in a few sentences to give complete information about this <a href="https://twitter.com/">Chuck Norris in the JS world</a> .  Douglas works at Yahoo !, where he is the main JavaScript architect and head of JS-related development, in particular YUI.  In addition, he is the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">creator</a> and popularizer of the JSON format, as well as such useful pieces as <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSlint</a> and <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html">JSmin</a> .  A whole pack of articles, reports, videos and other content related to JS can be found on the <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/">corresponding section of</a> his site.  Plus, he is the author of the popular book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> .  But this is information that, most likely, many already know.  However, probably not everyone knows that Crockford once worked on computerization of <a title="Atari" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari">Atari</a> , <a title="Lucasfilm" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> , and <a title="Paramount pictures" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures">Paramount</a> .  When Lucasfilm Games worked on Maniac Mansion, their first game for the NES, Douglas volunteered to do it.  This story is devoted to a section on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion">page</a> in Wikipedia.  Crockford himself has a <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html">story</a> about this episode in his biography. <br><br><br>  PS: Yes, I remember both Jeffrey Way, Chikuenka with Makeev and Baranovsky, and even TJ Holowaychuk with Molly ‚Äúmollydotcom‚Äù Holzschlag.  Well, and about many others, it's just impossible to immediately all of them, not only what to describe, but also remember.  But for them, I prepared separate thematic divisions, so everything has its time. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Found an article relevant to this - <a href="http://www.starming.com/index.php%3Faction%3Dplugin%26v%3Dwave%26tpl%3Dunion%26ac%3Dviewgrouppost%26gid%3D119%26tid%3D11614">30 Developers you MUST Junkie JavaScript</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Douglas Crockford materialized in an amazing way in this article, and PPK moved to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140831/">previous article.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141113/</a></p>
