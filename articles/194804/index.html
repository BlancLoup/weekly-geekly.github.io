And when the appetites increased to $ 6.7 million per year, Bekhar decided, they say, ‚Äústop feeding San Antonio‚Äù and set about implementing the project. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bf/d23/e7c/7bfd23e7c658dae7e08f5852d251f4cc.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-09-20-09-03/i8-5159791/759x315-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Access to library resources is free for residents of the county and for non-residents who pay property taxes and their relatives.  To use the library, you need to get a biennial library card (it is issued in the library upon presentation of documents confirming the name, address and date of birth, additional information may also be requested). <br><br>  At the time of launch, the library has 10'000 items.  At the disposal of the first users - 600 "adults" and 200 "children" readers - for home "hire", as well as 48 computers, 10 laptops and 40 tablets for use in the library reading room. <br><br>  You can download up to 5 e-books for a period of up to 14 days from the website of the online library once a day - then you need to come back to the library to extend the period of use, if by that time the waiting list is empty.  If the user delays the delivery of the reader, the books will be deleted from the device automatically, and the devices themselves will have to pay a penalty ($ 1 for each day of delay, but not more than $ 14).  100 books are pre-downloaded to children's readers, these devices cannot be ‚Äúreplenished‚Äù independently.  Readers for the library will deliver 3M Library Systems.  If the user wants to use his reader, he also needs to get a library card and install the <a href="http://ebook.3m.com/library/bibliotech/">3M Cloud Library</a> application.  The application is available not only for smartphones and computers, but also for the Nook and Kindle Fire readers. <br><br>  The library also provides space for events and additional services (eg printing). <br><br>  This is not the first step of our overseas comrades, to bring library resources into electronic form.  <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a> is a single platform - a catalog of materials of American public libraries and museums with a quick transition to the full versions of materials directly on the site of an institution.  By the time of <a href="http://www.govtech.com/e-government/Digital-Public-Library-of-America-Opens-Access-to-Resources.html">launch</a> (April 2013), the platform has collected about 2.5 million materials, and today this figure has almost doubled (4.5 million).  The aggregation of local archives by larger state libraries was implemented before, but large libraries did not interact with each other, and these projects did not receive wide publicity. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/713/a73/5b4/713a735b43913a21021fcff2e2618723.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-09-20-09-06/i8-5159801/794x364-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  A total of 76% of American libraries offer e-books (while, of course, not all books are available due to the exclusive rights of their publishers). <br><br><h5>  Mobile library </h5><br>  The mobile operator Vodafone Romania and the publishing house Humanitas have come up with another way to increase interest in reading among residents of Bucharest, who, according to research, left much to be desired (52% of Romanians do not read books at all).  Library of electronic and audiobooks opened ... <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-launches-subway-digital-library">in the subway</a> .  The walls of one of the central stations were covered with book covers with QR codes.  The passenger must read the code and go to the page of the work on the electronic library website and upload an excerpt of the book he likes - just as much as you can read for the trip.  If you like the beginning - the book can be purchased entirely, for money.  The project was designed for 3 months, but it turned out to be so successful, and it was decided to repeat it several months later. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3f/6e0/a52/d3f6e0a52477c1821f3ca91f71689894.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-09-20-09-07/i8-5159806/799x419-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a>  . <br><br><h5>  And what about us? </h5><br>  The advertising campaign, like the Romanian, was <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/public-space/122655-biblioteka">repeated</a> in the St. Petersburg metro platform for SamoLit authors and readers, offering 32 works (from Russian classics to detectives, fantasy and fairy tales), and then the Kiev branch of the mobile operator MTS together with the Chitayka bookstore.  Kyiv residents <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/129887-mobilnaya-biblioteka-na-kreschatike">placed</a> ‚Äúracks‚Äù with books for free download on the main street of the city (500 books of which the publishers have rights to).  Books are available only for owners of phones on ios and android. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a38/be0/023/a38be0023b8caf555b23601d574e2da0.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-09-20-09-07/i8-5159808/800x490-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  As for the full-fledged electronic libraries, the current Russian legislation in the field of copyright does not yet allow us to provide us with full-fledged remote access to the literature.  However, it is hoped that the ‚Äúice will break‚Äù and the Ministry of Culture in the process of discussing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a ‚Äú <a href="http://mkrf.ru/press-tsentr/novosti/ministerstvo/detail.php%3FID%3D390954">National Electronic Library</a> ‚Äù will come to a consensus on these two issues. <br><br>  But already <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/public-space/127663-biblioteki">projects for the reconstruction and development of Moscow libraries</a> are already in full swing.  You can already look at the results of this reformation - the library <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/article/biblioteka-dostoevskogo/">.</a>  <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/article/biblioteka-dostoevskogo/">Dostoevsky</a> and <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/article/biblioteka-prospekt-na-leninskom/">Prospect</a> .  We are not going to give up the paper heritage, but the digital component is not in last place: visitors will be able to take home library ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, use laptops and readers in the library itself, paper books will provide FRID tags, rare and valuable publications will be digitized, libraries will appear cinema halls.  In addition, each project will have its own "highlights", for example, the delivery of books to order to nearby hospitals. <br><br>  Another Moscow library that deserves attention is the <a href="http://www.rgub.ru/">Russian State Library for Youth</a> .  Even before the mass reforms of the department of culture, an electronic catalog appeared in it with the possibility of obtaining a printout of the list of publications, a station for round-the-clock return of books, prompt printing services, a comic book center, a film club and a discussion platform.  In the library, you can also get a password to access the electronic library systems ‚Äú <a href="http://www.iprbookshop.ru/">IPRbooks</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.bibliorossica.com/index.html">Bibororossika</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.znanium.com/">Znanium</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.biblioclub.ru/">University Library On-line</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://lib.litres.ru/">LiteRes Library</a> ‚Äù.  True, their materials are purely informational - textbooks, reference books, scientific articles and periodicals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194804/</a></p>
