  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unobtrusive authorization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The purpose of this article is to tell about the experience of organizing the maximum simple and convenient from our point of view model of user authorization on the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The essence of the model </h4><br>  When developing our project, we initially decided to organize a simple and loyal system of attracting users.  The goal is obvious - getting the maximum number of people who will continue to create the main core of our resource. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if this is just my personal phobia, but I‚Äôm convinced that the form of adding a comment or any other action hidden from a simple visitor with the inscription ‚Äú <s>carefully, an angry dog ‚Äã‚Äãin the courtyard</s> can only registered users ...‚Äù either useful on this site.  That is why we initially designed our resource with open for all forms, in which only after sending the data the authorization procedure begins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e7/357/5b4/5e73575b40b6d59783ff9dd660d27700.jpg" alt="The form for adding a comment is available to all site visitors.">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And only after adding a comment, if we are dealing with an unauthorized user, a pop-up window appears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c3/8c9/289/3c38c92897a7d9671b4b9f2de2a57389.jpg" alt="Registration popup"><br><br>  Authorization on our website is possible either by using e-mail or through accounts on Facebook and Vkontakte.  We suggested that such an approach should suit everyone who wants to join us.  The option of using a mobile phone number in small projects smacks of paranoia from our point of view, while we understand other services and social networks, realizing that FaceBook and Contact covers 90% of our audience, we decided to start later. <br><br>  Authorization using Facebook and Contact takes place in a few clicks for the user.  And in order to maximally simplify the option of registering a new user via e-mail, we left in the application form only the most necessary fields.  This is actually the e-mail itself, captcha and username.  Thus, we hoped to make the process of registering new users on the site as simple as possible, or perhaps even completely unnoticeable. <br><br>  In the case of registration of a new user via e-mail, a notification is sent to the specified box about the need to click on the link and specify the password to access our service, with the help of which his authorization will continue to take place.  However, even if this does not happen, the user still remains logged in to the site. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  ‚ÄúPop-up‚Äù authorization is implemented using the <a href="http://fancybox.net/">FancyBox</a> plugin, which displays any html content in beautiful pop-up windows.  The choice in favor of this plugin, among other similar means, was made because it supported the ability to display data dynamically received from the server using ajax.  Thus, we manage to verify the correctness of the data entered in the pop-up window without additional page overload. <br><br>  We add that in addition to the ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù forms for registering and authenticating users, the site also contains static pages with similar forms that can always be referenced in a letter or on another resource, inviting the user to join or authorize. <br><br><h4>  First results </h4><br>  Today, several months after the commissioning of the authorization system described above, we have the first hundred comrades who have joined us and can already draw some conclusions about the effectiveness of the conceived model.  To enable such an analysis, we logged all comments added to the site, including those that did not end with a successful user authorization and all registration attempts.  As a result, we obtained the following data. <br><br>  <u>Out of 95 attempts to post a comment:</u> <br><br>  29 comments did not end with successful user authorization.  In all 100% of cases we deal with a voluntary refusal of authorization by the user, and also, what is most valuable, we have very low quality of the comments themselves, if you can call the words ‚Äúbest‚Äù, ‚Äúagree‚Äù, ‚ÄúDYUSSH-15 with you‚Äù and other "asdf" and "yuty". <br><br>  66 comments were crowned with successful user authorization, while only in 2 cases the comments were deleted by the moderator due to their lack of information. <br><br>  Another 34 users joined us without comment, just follow the link ‚Äújoin‚Äù. <br><br>  <u>Out of 100 registered users:</u> <br><br>  60 people logged in via e-mail <br>  22 using Vkontakte <br>  18 via FaceBook <br><br><h4>  Findings: </h4><br>  In spite of a small (100 users) sample, it suggests conclusions about the sufficient effectiveness of the implemented system.  First of all, we did not discourage any potential user from expressing his point of view with an open comment form.  Secondly, they did not receive a single case of loss of more or less informative comments due to the refusal of the visitor from the subsequent registration.  Third, we received an automatic filtering system for non-informative and non-informative comments. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  At the moment, the user interface of the site is limited only by the possibility of commenting, but we are already developing a system for evaluating our users of players and their individual characteristics, the ability to choose their starting team, the "team tour" and other interactivity.  All these tools, similar to the approach described above with comments, are going to be made ‚Äúopen to all‚Äù with subsequent pop-up authorization.  Also the other day we will add the possibility of authorization using other popular social networks and services.  Thus, we hope to become from the point of view of our visitor at the same time more desirable and accessible for registration project. <br><br>  PS We are pleased to hear constructive criticism and any comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180539/</a></p>
