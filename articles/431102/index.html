      Rowhammer is a problem with some DRAM modules, when certain worst-case memory access models can damage memory.  In these DRAMs, repeated activation of a memory line (‚Äúline clogging‚Äù) causes electrical interference that changes bits in vulnerable cells of adjacent lines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  These repeated line activations can be triggered by multiple access to a pair of DRAM addresses that are on different lines of the same DRAM bank.  Knowledge of the mapping of DRAM addresses is useful because it indicates which address pairs satisfy this ‚Äúone bank, different rows‚Äù property (same bank, different row; SBDR). <br><br><h4>  Guessing and checking the display of addresses </h4><br>  For the test, I have a car with DRAM modules vulnerable to the Rowhammer bug.  Running <a href="https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test">rowhammer_test</a> on this machine demonstrates a bit change. <br><br>  I would like to know the DRAM address mapping scheme for this machine, but it is not documented publicly: here is the Sandy Bridge processor, but Intel does not document the address mapping used by the memory controllers of these processors. <br><br>  In fact, the <code>rowhammer_test</code> test <code>rowhammer_test</code> not need to know a pair of SBDR addresses.  He just tries several times to randomly select address pairs.  Usually 1/8 or 1/16 of them are SBDR pairs, because in our car there are 8 banks in each DIMM (and 16 banks in total).  Thus, we do not need to know the mapping of DRAM addresses to cause a change of bits in the memory, but such knowledge will help to carry out the test more purposefully. <br><br>  Although the address mapping is not documented, I found that I can make a reasonable assumption about it based on the DRAM geometry, and then check the assumption based on the physical addresses reported by <code>rowhammer_test</code> .  The test reports the physical addresses where the bit shifts ( <i>‚Äúvictims‚Äù</i> ) and the pair of physical addresses that make these shifts ( <i>‚Äúaggressors‚Äù</i> ) occur.  Since these pairs must be SBDR pairs, we can test a hypothetical comparison of addresses with these empirical data. <br><br><h4>  Memory geometry </h4><br>  First step: check how many DIMMs are installed in the machine and how they are internally organized. <br><br>  I can request DIMM information using the <code>decode-dimms</code> in Linux (it is in the <code>I2C-tools</code> package in Ubuntu).  This tool decodes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_presence_detect">SPD (Serial Presence Detect)</a> metadata to DIMM. <br><br>  On my test machine, there are two four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO-DIMM">-</a> gigabyte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO-DIMM">SO-DIMMs</a> , which gives 8 GB of memory. <br><br>  The <code>decode-dimms</code> reports the following information for each of the modules: <br><br><pre>  Size 4096 MB
 Banks x Rows x Columns x Bits 8 x 15 x 10 x 64
 Ranks 2 </pre><br>  This means that both DIMMs have: <br><br><ul><li>  Each bank has 2 ^ 15 lines (32768 lines). </li><li>  Each line contains 2 ^ 10 * 64 bits = 2 ^ 16 bits = 2 ^ 13 bytes = 8 KB. </li></ul><br>  Each DIMM has 2 ranks and 8 banks.  A cross-check of the capacity of a DIMM module gives the size as expected: <br><br>  8 KB in a row * 32768 lines * 2 ranks * 8 banks = 4096 MB = 4 GB <br><br><h4>  Display DRAM addresses </h4><br>  On my test computer, the bits of the physical addresses are used as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Bits 0-5</b> : These are the lower 6 bits of the byte index in the string (that is, the 6-bit index for the 64-byte cache line). </li><li>  <b>Bit 6</b> : This is the 1-bit channel number that selects between two DIMMs. </li><li>  <b>Bits 7-13</b> : the upper 7 bits of the index in the row (i.e. the upper bits of the column number). </li><li>  <b>Bits 14-16</b> : XOR with the bottom 3 bits of the line number, which gives a 3-bit bank number. </li><li>  <b>Bit 17</b> : 1-bit number of the rank that selects between two DIMM ranks (which are usually the two sides of a DIMM chip). </li><li>  <b>Bits 18-32</b> : 15-bit line number. </li><li>  <b>Bits 33+</b> : they can be set because physical memory starts with physical addresses greater than 0. </li></ul><br><h4>  Why such a mapping? </h4><br>  This mapping is consistent with the results of <code>rowhammer_test</code> (see below), but we can also explain that the address bits are mapped in such a way as to provide good performance for typical memory access patterns, such as sequential access and step or step access ( strided access): <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Channel concurrency</b> .  Placing the channel number in bit 6 means that the cache lines will alternate between two channels (i.e., two DIMMs) that can be accessed in parallel.  This means that if we address addresses sequentially, the load will be distributed over two channels. <br><br>  By the way, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)">Ivy Bridge</a> (the successor of Sandy Bridge), apparently, complicates the display of the channel number.  <a href="http://www.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc24/HC24-1-Microprocessor/HC24.28.117-HotChips_IvyBridge_Power_04.pdf">Intel‚Äôs presentation</a> mentions ‚Äúchannel hashing‚Äù and states that it ‚Äúallows you to select a channel based on several address bits.  Historically, it was ‚ÄúA [6]‚Äù.  This ensures a more uniform distribution of memory access across channels. ‚Äù </li><li>  <b>Bank slippage</b> : in general, the arrangement of numbers of columns, banks and lines should minimize the frequent change of bank active lines (bank thrashing). <br><br>  A small introduction: DRAM modules are organized in banks, which, in turn, are organized in rows.  Each bank has a ‚Äúcurrent activated string‚Äù: its contents are copied to the <i>string buffer</i> , which acts as a cache, which can be quickly accessed.  Access to another line takes more time, because it must first be activated.  So, when displaying DRAM addresses, SBDR pairs are spread as far as possible in the physical address space. <br><br>  Rowing (row hammering) is a special case of bank slippage, when two specific rows are alternately activated (possibly specially). </li><li>  <b>Banks parallelism</b> : access to banks can be carried out in parallel (albeit to a lesser extent than channels), therefore the bank number changes before the line number as the address increases. </li><li>  <b>XOR scheme</b> : XOR'ing the low-order bit of the line number in the bank number is a trick to avoid bank slipping when accessing arrays in large steps.  For example, in the above mapping, XOR'ing causes X and X + 256k addresses to be placed in different banks, without forming a pair of SBDR. <br><br>  XOR'ing schemes for the bank / line are described in various literature, for example: <br><ul><li>  David Taveya Wang <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~blj/papers/thesis-PhD-wang--DRAM.pdf">'s</a> PhD thesis, <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~blj/papers/thesis-PhD-wang--DRAM.pdf">Modern DRAM Memory Systems: Performance Analysis and Planning Algorithms</a> , 2005. See Section 5.3.5, Bank Address Smoothing (Step Conflict).  You can also find excellent reference information about DRAM technology in general in this thesis. </li><li>  Article <a href="https://impact.asu.edu/cse520fa08/pravin.pdf">"Reducing DRAM Delays Using the Integrated Memory Hierarchy,"</a> 2001. See Figure.  3 </li></ul></li></ul><br><h4>  Cverka c issue rowhammer_test </h4><br>  The work of <a href="https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/tree/master/extended_test">rowhammer_test_ext</a> (an enhanced version of <code>rowhammer_test</code> ) on a test machine for 6 hours revealed a repeated change of bits in 22 places.  (see the <a href="https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/tree/2e35c726fdcf96d5f249094487fd2ba0464d0021/dram_physaddr_mapping">source data and analysis code</a> ). <br><br>  The test of striking lines generates sets of three addresses (A1, A2, V): <br><br><ul><li>  V - the address of the victim, where we see the change of bits. </li><li>  A1 and A2 - the addresses of the aggressor, which we minted. </li><li>  We sort A1 and A2 so that A1 is closer to V than A2.  We tentatively assume that a closer address, A1 actually causes a bit change (although this would not necessarily be true if a more complex mapping of DRAM addresses were used). </li></ul><br>  For all these results, we expect the following three properties to be met: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Line</b> : <b>Line</b> numbers A1 and V must differ by 1, i.e.  they should be in adjacent lines.  (A2 can have any line number). <br><br>  This property makes it easy to determine where in the physical address are the bottom bits of the line number. <br><br>  The test showed that this property holds for all but two results.  In these two results, the line numbers differ by 3, not by 1. </li><li>  <b>Bank</b> : V, A1 and A2 must have the same bank number.  Indeed, this property manifested itself in all 22 results.  It saves only when using the XOR'ing of lines / banks scheme. </li><li>  <b>Channel</b> : V, A1 and A2 must have the same channel number.  This is true for all results.  It happens that all channel = 0 results, because <code>rowhammer_test</code> selects only 4k-aligned addresses and therefore only tests one channel (perhaps this can be considered a bug). </li></ul><br><h4>  Possible further tests </h4><br>  In the future, you can run two more experiments to check if the mapping of DRAM addresses correctly evaluates the SBDR property: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Time metering</b> : multiple access to SBDR address pairs should be slower than multiple access to non-SBDR pairs, because the first one activates the rows and the second does not. </li><li>  <b>Rowhammer Exhaustive Testing</b> : Once we have found the address of the aggressor A1, which causes a repeated bit change, we can check it on many A2 values.  The effect of chasing (A1, A2) will change the bits only if it is a pair of SBDR. </li></ul><br>  In addition, the removal of one DIMM module from the system unit must remove the channel bit from the mapping of DRAM addresses and accordingly change the addresses of the aggressor and the victim.  This can also be verified. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431102/</a></p>
