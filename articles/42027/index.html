  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fight against piracy is supported by fictional figures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret that the fight against piracy in the United States has been going on for a long time.  But very few people know where the numbers come from, which the fighters confirm the need to accept all new restrictions and increasingly strict punishments. <br><br>  According to the statements of the fighters with intellectual pirates, because of the theft of intellectual property in the United States, 750,000 jobs were lost and $ 200-250 billion were lost.  These figures are given each time at the hearing in the Congress of new proposals to combat piracy.  They have already become a kind of talisman fighters.  But what are they based on? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the figure of 750,000 jobs is mentioned by the US Department of Commerce and the US Customs.  More than once the figure was mentioned in Congress.  But when trying to figure out its origin, we are lost in the maze of cross-references of the fighters against piracy against each other.  Most often the source is called Customs.  For example, it is mentioned in <a href="">the 2002 Customs report</a> .  But when independent journalists asked customs representatives about how the figure was calculated, they were told that it was actually calculated by someone else and was mistakenly attributed to customs.  In any case, such extensive economic research does not fall within the competence of customs officers.

      Further studies (in particular in the press) showed that this figure was mentioned as far back as 1986.  More specifically, in the quote by Malcolm Baldridge, who claimed that fakes of American products could cost the economy "as many as 130,000 to 750,000 jobs."  Where does such a large scatter come from?  This is the same mystery, like how many times it is necessary to lick the lollipop so that only the wand remains.  Not a single government document speaks of valid studies showing a figure of 750,000 jobs (which, by the way, is 8% of all the unemployed in the country). <br><br>  But the figure of $ 250 billion in losses is not enough that it is not proven, it exceeds all revenues from sales of music, movies, software and video games in 2005 combined. <br><br>  However, the fight against piracy is based on these numbers. <br><br>  Based on <a href="">Arstechnica.com</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5061450/numbers-behind-the-war-on-piracy-could-be-completely-bogus">Gizmodo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42027/</a></p>
