We did it - we released an ICQ client for BlackBerry smartphones.  In Russia, for subscribers of only one operator, MTS, but the first step is the hardest. <br>  I will be frank, the client is not different cool bells and whistles.  ICQ for BlackBerry has standard features: it sends and receives messages, photos, changes statuses, and so on.  However, non-standard platform more than compensates for the standard functionality of our product.  And in order to better explain all its dissimilarity to others - I'll start with a brief excursion into the history of creating BlackBerry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88c/974/9f4/88c9749f459503814e81232d5761d29f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The little device that took over the world <br>  Alistair Sweeney (Sweeny) <a name="habracut"></a>

      The BlackBerry smartphone is not just a cult device from the Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM).  In the age of high technology, this device has captured the minds and souls of millions of people on Earth, so the manufacturing company may well fall under the article for organizing a sect and introducing idol worship.  However, the minds and souls of BlackBerry are given completely voluntarily, consciously and for big money.  Why love the "blackberry"? <br><br>  The ‚Äúberry‚Äù name of the smartphone did not appear by chance.  Initially, the device wanted to call LeapFrog - a hint of a technological leap into the future.  But later, RIM chose another option from Lexicon Branding Inc.  - A company that named products such as the Intel Pentium and PowerBook.  One of the Lexicon employees noticed that the small buttons on RIM‚Äôs devices looked like ‚Äúsmall strawberry seeds‚Äù.  However, it was decided that straw sounded too sluggish, frail.  But the proposal from another employee of the company - to call the device blackberry ("blackberry") - RIM found it more appropriate.  By the way, the plural of the word ‚ÄúBlackBerry‚Äù sounds like ‚ÄúBlackBerries‚Äù. <br><br>  The past and the present of this miracle device are described in detail by the Canadian historian Alister Sweeney (Sweeny) in the book ‚ÄúThe Planet of the BlackBerry: the story of Research In Motion and the little device that took over the world‚Äù.  In it, the author tracks the evolution of the company itself, the main ideologue of Mike Lazaridis and the BlackBerry device from shaggy times to the present.  For those who have not read this book and are not going to give a brief summary. <br><br>  The history of the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù began in 1997, when Inter @ ctive Pager, a pager with a large screen, was launched onto the market, the main function was the possibility of corporate communication.  The first model of the BlackBerry communicator under the code 850 was introduced in 1999.  In addition to the instant messaging function, it also included an organizer, a calendar, and wireless Internet.  It's funny that the model 850, having the ability to work with wireless networks, was powered by 2 finger batteries and did not have built-in microphones and speakers.  Communication was possible only with the help of a headset.  Nevertheless, in 2005, PCWorld magazine included it in the TOP 50 best devices of the 20th century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a39/76b/725/a3976b72544c4255fea8a6473e96eac2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In subsequent years, the design and stuffing of the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù underwent a significant upgrade: the display size increased 2 times (from 6-8 lines, 16-20 lines), a rechargeable Li-On battery appeared, the flash memory increased from 4Mb to 8Mb, and the amount of SRAM-memory - from 512Kb to 1Mb.  It also increased the number of mailboxes that could be added to the communicator - up to 10 different email addresses.  However, to imagine the appearance of the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù of the last decade, just look at the current model: the design is one of the permanent ‚Äúchips‚Äù of this smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4c/06a/2de/a4c06a2de2b3aca4579a026558242ffc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Early models - the 5000th and 6000th (early 2000s) - worked under the Intel 80386 processor and were typical of the GSM market.  With the growth of CDMA networks in the United States, RIM released the BlackBerry 6750 with support for third-generation communication standards.  In later models, RIM used 312 MHz processors from the Intel PXA901, 64 MB flash memory and 16 MB RAM.  And in modern models used processor ARM 7 or 9 generation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/3e8/070/8a83e8070c2355afff3fe989edf52e2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A characteristic feature of all models of BlackBerry is a QWERTY-keyboard.  At one time, RIM was trying to change the familiar QWERTY into a small-format ‚Äúclavier‚Äù in an attempt to gain the loyalty of the fans of ‚Äúflips‚Äù.  In 2004, the company released a model 7100t, a feature of which was a keyboard with two letters or symbols on each button.  This significantly reduced the size of the phone just to comfortable pocket sizes. <br><br>  The new keyboard was named SureType.  But she did not last long on products from RIM, which sought not to cut the keyboard, but to make it more ergonomic.  So, the later model BlackBerry Pearl instead of the side ‚ÄúJock Dile‚Äù had a convenient trackball, which quickly got to the taste of ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù fans because of the ability to control with one hand. <br><br>  And a little about the evolution of the BlackBerry.  So, the first model with a color screen was the 7200th, the 7250th device received Bluetooth, and the 7270th model turned out to be a WLAN device: it supported VoIP (Voice over IP) calls (Internet telephony). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b5/5b8/93a/2b55b893a625ff2f4fb36e6b2bffd810.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 8000th series - doPearl's - became a discovery for many, if only because it had a Wi-Fi module.  In addition, RIM in the 8700th series has released three types of smartphones: for work on GSM networks with EDGE support, for GSM without EDGE support, and for CDMA networks. <br><br>  Next was the Curve and the 9 thousandth series with 3G standards and GPS navigation.  The Storm model received a touchscreen, the Bold 9700, together with increased battery power and HSDPA support, changed the trackball to the touchpad, and Torch 9800 surprised the new BlackBerry OS 6.0. <br><br>  But RIM presented the main gift to fans of its products in 2009, when it finally installed a camera on a smartphone.  Yes, the company ‚Äúslightly‚Äù sucked in this innovation, but did it intentionally.  The fact is that employees of certain professions in the United States have a camera phone strictly prohibited (for example, judges).  In addition, some corporate rules impose restrictions on the use of devices with photo-shooting.  But the release of the model Bold 9780 with a 5 megapixel camera allowed the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù to overtake the ‚Äúapple‚Äù in the number of sales in the USA in 2010. <br><br>  The latest novelty for the BlackBerry is the PlayBook tablet on the QNX platform.  And in 2011, RIM announced a new version of the BlackBerry BBX operating system.  Under its management, both smartphones and tablets can work (previously, RIM released two separate operating systems for its devices).  In addition, there is information about patents RIM slider-devices, touchscreens and "corner" keyboard.  This suggests that RIM is planning a new product line. <br><br>  Now BlackBerry accounts for more than 9.4% of the key American market for it.  Perhaps the "blackberry" from the berries for the business segment will be "tasty" and for ordinary users. <br><br>  How to cook blackberry stuffing? <br>  In principle, everything is simple.  We take an ARM processor, BES and BIS technologies, mix them with AES encryption standard, and season with GPRS, CDMA or GSM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, QWERTY or Touch Pad to taste.  Best of all this dish is combined with ties.  Serve to middle managers. <br><br>  But seriously, the filling of the BlackBerry has a fundamental difference from the same Windows Mobile, Symbian Android or iOS.  First of all, thanks to its target audience, 99% consisting of corporate clients.  This feature and identified the unique characteristics of the platform - the very BES and BIS. <br><br>  BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) is a special server that is installed in a company that wants to give out to its employees on BlackBerry.  The pleasure is not cheap: the cost of BES is about $ 10,000, and each device connected to it must be licensed.  Of course, not free. <br><br>  BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) - equipment that is installed at the cellular providers. <br><br>  As a result of the interaction between BES and BIS, the BlackBerry has the following features: the BlackBerry email network, where all data is instantly and automatically synchronized, and some sort of BlackBerry Messenger corporate chat for fast and secure communication. <br><br>  The operation of the BlackBerry mail networks is intuitive: after the device is registered on the BlackBerry network, the system recognizes each device by its individual identification number (PIN).  The presence of a unique number allows the device to transfer messages through the peer-to-peer system.  The BlackBerry Messenger application also uses a peer-to-peer data transfer system, but the algorithm of the application resembles the principle of operation of Internet messengers, for example, ICQ.  In order to save Internet traffic and instant data transmission, data compression algorithms are used.  All information transmitted is encrypted with a 256-bit key with the AES / 3DES algorithm. <br><br>  The convenience of this scheme is that the BlackBerry does not require manual synchronization of the smartphone and the mail server.  And if the device is in the network coverage area, it automatically sends and receives all e-mails.  In addition, this system provides additional control over staff: the manager can track delivery and read any mail messages in real time. <br><br>  The user also has the right to use traditional e-mail accounts with access via POP3 or IMAP protocols.  However, in this case, the letters will arrive with a slight delay, and confirmation of the delivery status will be unavailable. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the free email client for Blackberry, called LogicMail, does not know how to send letters with headers in Russian.  And "teach" him to do it is not yet possible.  In addition, this client is not accustomed to sending and receiving email attachments (unlike the already-built Attachment Service, which can convert attached files in Word-to-PDF formats and transfer them to a portable device). <br><br>  An alternative to LogicMail is the paid program Tiggit Mail, which handles encodings correctly and can save (but not view) attachments.  For already saved files have their own applications.  For BlackBerry, this is the ‚Äúto Go‚Äù package, which even understands MS Office formats.  Also in the "blackberry" there is the possibility of receiving, saving, editing and sending attachments in the formats: PDF, WordPerfect, ASCII text, HTML and ZIP, as well as JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG, TIFF. <br><br>  In addition to e-mail, BlackBerry smartphones support SMS and MMS services, and are bundled with a good browser that can view many formats, including HTML, XHTML, WML, SVG, and many types of graphic files. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBlackberry‚Äù devices are very convenient organizers, which include a calendar, address book, to-do list, address book and calculator.  The whole "trick" is that the organizer is integrated with the browser and email client.  Therefore, it is enough to click on the link in any program and, depending on its type, the number will be dialed or the letter creation window will open, or the site will be switched to.  BlackBerry also has a convenient service for organizing meetings and conferences.  They are reported to a group of colleagues, who, in turn, can accept the invitation or refuse, commenting on the reason.  BlackBerry smartphones are also good because they work offline for at least a week. <br><br>  The ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù, which is not surprising, there is also an online app store BlackBerry App World, which in the future will become part of the BlackBerry Application Center (global application catalog).  This service is available to owners of devices under BlackBerry OS version 4.2 and higher, having a trackball or SurePress touch screen. <br><br>  Initially, App World was developed only for users in the USA, Canada and the UK, and the list of supported languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas limited to English.  Today the store is available in 101 countries, including Russia.  In addition to her in the list of Azerbaijan, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, a number of countries in Eastern Europe and Africa.  As for the number of programs available in the catalog, now it exceeds 20,000 items. <br><br>  Interestingly, the BlackBerry App World has more stringent pricing rules than other online app stores.  According to RIM, this should encourage developers to produce more expensive and complex applications.  The rest of the BlackBerry App World is not much different from similar store: <br>  - the store contains collections of applications that can be ranked by rating, genre, and so on; <br>  - the list of available applications in the store is automatically generated based on the capabilities of a particular model; <br>  - there is a BlackBerry ID service that is not tied to a specific device, but is a customer number.  Thanks to ID, purchases can be paid for in various ways, and applications can be conveniently transferred from one device to another; <br>  - Desktop Storefront service allows you to search, download, buy and manage applications using a personal computer; <br>  - users can give ratings to applications, as well as recommend them to other users, sending them links via SMS or BlackBerry Messenger, as well as through some social networks; <br>  - owners of smartphones can scan the QR code of the application they like, and App World will find this application and automatically open the corresponding page; <br>  - in the store there is a special folder My World for storing a list of all applications ever downloaded by the user. <br><br>  One of the interesting features of the BlackBerry App World is that users have the ability to store archived copies of applications on microSD or using the internal memory of the BlackBerry smartphone.  However, it is impossible to install and run applications from the memory card (this was done in order to combat piracy), and also you cannot transfer purchased applications to other devices. <br><br>  Blackberry in Russia <br><br>  As already mentioned, one of the main advantages of these devices is an exceptional algorithm for encrypting and compressing data.  It is precisely because of this that BlackBerry devices have become the corporate standard for tens of thousands of companies around the world.  And it is this feature that has become the main obstacle for the emergence of smartphones in our country. <br><br>  The official version says that RIM refused to share encryption algorithms with domestic intelligence services.  As a result, after quite long negotiations, Blackberry smartphones reached our edges with limited functionality - with BlackBerry Messenger and Wi-Fi turned off.  In addition, according to Russian law, BES servers cannot be located within the company, but must be located at the sites of a cellular operator. <br><br>  Fortunately, now the situation around the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù in Russia has become more favorable: at the beginning of 2011, the BlackBerry App World appeared in the country, they recently turned on the BlackBerry Messenger, and just recently, MTS announced the opening of free Internet access via Wi-Fi to its customers - users of BlackBerry smartphones. <br><br>  In fairness it should be noted that not only in Russia, RIM had problems with encryption.  Thus, French officials actively used BlackBerry devices, including for transferring secret data, without thinking about the company's servers in England and the United States.  At one time, this epic-file caused a significant resonance in the French special services. <br><br>  However, the unpopularity of BlackBerry smartphones in our country is also caused by another circumstance: if in the USA AT &amp; T telecommunications company distributes devices for $ 200 when subscribing to a two-year contract, then we have the same model can cost $ 600 or more.  At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that the hardware filling of the BlackBerry lags significantly behind similar products in the same price category. <br><br>  And finally - two true jokes about the BlackBerry. <br>  One of the most successful unintended PR campaigns of the BlackBerry was the 2008 US presidential election.  Presidential candidate Barack Obama did not let go of the BlackBerry smartphone during his election campaign.  The American media vividly discussed the fact that after taking office, the president would have to get rid of his beloved device, since the United States has a law prohibiting the head of state from having personal communications.  However, after the elections, an amendment to the Constitution was found, which states that during court proceedings over the president his personal correspondence cannot be used as evidence of guilt.  Thus, the head of the United States has the right to use personal e-mail and a smartphone. <br><br>  Surprisingly, Blackberry devices are fraught with grave danger.  American scientists have identified a new disease called Blackberry Thumb ("blackberry finger").  This disease develops as a result of prolonged use of the smartphone and, in particular, the keyboard and is expressed in swelling of tissues, pain and tingling in the fingers, joints.  In fact, this is a mini-version of tunnel syndrome, which affects people who spend too much time at the computer keyboard and mouse.  Get rid of the "blackberry finger" can be.  Guess how :-) <br><br>  You can download ICQ for BlackBerry at <a href="http://www.pda.mts.ru/">www.pda.mts.ru</a> in the section ‚ÄúEntertainment and Information‚Äù, subsection ‚ÄúEverything for your phone‚Äù.  You need to access the site using the device browser. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132772/</a></p>
