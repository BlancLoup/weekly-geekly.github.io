  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do girls still play video games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In fact, girls are not so little playing video games.  I will try to refute some of the statements from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gdev/123042/">topic</a> and give examples of games that girls play actively. <br><br>  <b>Captain obvious</b> <br>  At school, gender separation can and does work, but the older the girls become, the smaller this division is.  Someone chooses "male" professions, someone is disappointed in men, someone simply attracts less and less reality.  Women who are not married for the first year are quite often served in computer games just to diversify their leisure time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Sense of accomplishment</b> <br>  Yes, it is great to grow a beast, plant hundreds of beds and equip a virtual cottage.  But I saw girls who played very and very well at shooters against men.  Moreover, they won.  And this victory brought them pleasure.  Tearing the enemy to shreds and proving to everyone, and above all to yourself, that you are not the "weak" sex - this, believe me, is worth a lot.  And if the girl is also the head of the guild / clan, or is close enough to the "ruling elite", we can assume that she has achieved her.  Her opinions are asked, they listen to her, they need her.  This is respect.  This is power.  Is this not enough as achieved? <br><br>  <b>Yy</b> <br>  Almost all girls play female characters.  And if they play as masculine, they create such a peculiar ideal of a strong and bold handsome man.  However, men seem to do almost the same thing - creating their own "pupae."

      <b>War</b> <br>  Women are happy to go kill enemies.  Especially after a hard day.  And even if they were rude at work, then there‚Äôs a lot of kut to everyone.  Save the princess and the civilians?  Yes, she wanted to sneeze on them.  Now the enemy is the personification of her weaknesses, her offenders.  By the way, about the princesses.  Why don't we save them?  Especially if she got into the tower because of a blithe knight or villain.  Here, women's solidarity is being asked for right, the main thing is not to have a feeling: ‚Äúthis is what she needs, hysterical.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Weapons</b> <br>  If the girls really want to defend - then a more powerful weapon, mowing down enemies with one of its kind, pleases the female soul.  By the way, I repeatedly noticed that many girls love bright, colorful, unusual weapons.  So that it shines with fire so that it is powerful.  And already if it is stronger than the previous one - then this is generally indescribable joy.  And, by the way, if you need to get some resources for weapons, then girls are no less stubborn than men.  If there is a choice of class, then girls will rather play for magicians, as if personalizing themselves: ‚ÄúHere I‚Äôm all so weak, weak and helpless, but I‚Äôm not going to seem a little like fire.‚Äù  Although the girls warriors, I saw a lot.  This is most likely: ‚ÄúI am strong and courageous, but kind in my heart.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Time</b> <br>  If we talk about time, then everything is quite simple.  In my environment there are many girls who combine work / study with games.  For them, this is a way to relax.  When the husband is fed and the children are put to bed, why not feel free from everyday worries.  It kills the routine, but here there is still diversity, new worlds, new acquaintances.  In games, they usually do not talk about everyday worries, which gives freedom, even if it is virtual. <br><br>  <b>What are the girls playing</b> <br>  Yes, a lot of what - strategies, quests, shooters.  Practically every game has its female lovers.  Someone likes to break the brain over the tasks, someone to endure his enemies.  NFS is very popular.  Beautiful car, speed, and freedom on the road.  Many people play MMORPGs, and achieve good results there.  By the way, I myself play Drakonika, and am in the guild, in which there are a lot of girls.  Someone is married, someone is already raising children, but everyone plays with pleasure.  More girls are attracted to consoles - PSP, Xbox, PS3.  They play both the Final Fantasy and Gears of War.  By the way, PlayStation fans are more than Xbox.  Maybe it's in jRPG with cute characters and beautiful graphics.  The girls also play Prince of Persia, Sacred, King's Bounty, Doom 3, Assassin's creed, Two Worlds, Devil May Cry, God of Wars, StarCraft, Half Life.  Secretly, some girls even play adult games.  But they prefer to hide it. <br><br>  And instead of completing, if your friend grows potatoes on the farm in contact, this does not mean that after harvesting, she will not go to conquer another world by chopping another boss into a fine crumb. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123094/</a></p>
