    <h5>  What you need to do to get started? </h5><br>  Everything is very simple. <br>  Step 1. If you have an IPhone or iPad - download and install the Maptrix application on your gadget. <br>  Step 2. Log in to it through your account on the social network VKontakte. <br>  Step 3. Enjoy the spectacle, with joy and surprise discovering your new passion in the next cafe, and a couple of stops from you - a childhood friend with whom you have long wanted to cross. <br>  In real time with Maptrix, you can track friends in space and record their own movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea8/fcd/681/ea8fcd68185ffa1312f58d67decab143.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In real time, you can communicate with almost anyone.  With a colleague who is driving a tram right now past your window.  With a charming stranger that went for a run in a nearby park.  With a group of people who came, like you, to watch a new movie in the cinema. <br>  If you wish, you can limit the functionality of Maptrix and track only your own friends.  However, you can not do this, and then all users who installed Maptrix on their gadget will appear on the map in your phone. <br><br><h5>  How is the location fixed? </h5><br>  To determine the coordinates as accurately as possible, Maptrix recommends using GPS.  However, Android users know that this function consumes battery power with pleasure and high speed.  Therefore, the application development team has provided other opportunities for high-quality fixation of a person on the map: <br>  1) less accurate, but, nevertheless, much closer to reality location based on the coordinates of cell towers <br>  2) the ability to accurately specify the location using the "check in" button, which allows you to signal which institution you are at this very second (the mark will be removed as soon as you leave the building, however, it will remain in your "history" and will affect on "achievements") <br>  The service is always active when you have an included phone or tablet with the installed Maptrix application.  That is, even when Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot running, your friends have an uninterrupted channel of information about you.  If you, of course, want it.  For those who prefer to stay in the shade, privacy settings are provided.  If desired or necessary, simply become ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to all or to a certain particular person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/861/cad/c6c/861cadc6ca389b7018ba0fd349d507af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fixing in space (or remaining incognito), you can explore the surrounding landscape.  The application allows you to do this in several "layers". <br><br><h5>  What features does this app provide? </h5><br><br>  First, you can meet new people with Maptrix.  With a pretty brunette sitting on a bench opposite.  With a burning brown-haired woman who had just entered the doors of a trendy club across the street.  With a cute blonde who stayed late this evening at the University library.  If all these charmer have already learned the benefits of Maptrix, the application will fix them and present them to you.  Further it will be necessary only to begin a chat with the chosen lady.  Or with the chosen gentleman - in relation to the brown-haired, blond and brunette, the application works smoothly as well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64a/e44/c17/64ae44c171f0f8014c2868e5913598d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, using Maptrix, you can track the movements in the space of friends and acquaintances registered on social networks.  How many of them decided to devote this evening to cinema?  Who chose the "great dumb" exhibition of modern photography?  What cafes do friends have today?  No need to hang on the phone, calling friends - find them on the map using Maptrix and just join! <br><br>  Thirdly, using Maptrix in real time, you can exchange messages with people who are in the same building or at the same event as you.  While the impressions are fresh, do not miss the opportunity to share them in the cinema chat.  Report on the University chat about the incomparable shawarma that you have just tasted at the buffet.  Speak something profound in the museum chat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c50/015/be7/c50015be7a1a07825fab5d40ad5dc74a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, fourthly, with the help of Maptrix, you can easily and naturally make a choice of a place for a pleasant stay.  Having recorded your location, the application will show everything useful and interesting that is nearby, you will filter on the desired category (for example, ‚Äúclubs‚Äù), and other users will help you make your choice, leaving your reviews and photos to various institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b9/ee9/5eb/4b9ee95eb8dac9fa8373372c310b6598.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can download the application by clicking on the link from our website <a href="http://maptrix.ru/">maptrix.ru</a> , or directly <br>  via itunes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171523/</a></p>
