Among other things, they put forward new requirements for telecom operators.  Operators are required to keep phone call, SMS and Internet traffic records for up to 6 months in Russia. <br><br>  President Vladimir V. Putin signed the law on July 7, 2016, and after a few days, Senator Anton Belyakov and Deputy Oleg Shein <a href="http://www.abelyakov.ru/news/read_120.htm">introduced a bill</a> that proposes to postpone the beginning of the aforementioned provisions of the ‚ÄúLaw of Spring‚Äù to July 1, 2023. <br><br>  On July 3, 2017, a government commission on legislative activity considered a draft of a positive response from the Russian government to the bill of Belyakov and Shein, the Vedomosti newspaper <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/07/04/707851-perenesti-zakon-yarovoi">writes</a> .  But it was not possible to immediately accept a positive review, because a representative of the FSB intervened in the matter, who made a comment on the draft positive response.  The authors of the project are given time to finalize it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The newspaper Vedomosti received information from a source close to the commission.  The information was confirmed by the participant of the meeting, so that information about events in the government commission can be considered quite reliable.

      It is not known what exactly the comments made by the FSB, but the fact is that a positive review was sent for revision.  However, the likelihood of delaying certain provisions of the ‚ÄúSpring Law‚Äù for five years is still high. <br><br>  After finalizing the document, the government commission will again consider a draft positive comment on the bill of Belyakov and Shein. <br><br>  Presenting his bill in 2016, Senator Belyakov expressed the opinion that the requirements of the law regarding long-term storage by operators of these users cannot be implemented: ‚ÄúAccording to the Ministry of Economic Development, the equipment necessary for operators to implement the Law is not produced in any country in the world.  Until July 1, 2018, less than two years remained, which seems to be an unnecessarily short transitional period for the implementation of such large-scale and technically complex tasks that require large investments from market players, then Anton Belyakov explained, - In an open letter to the largest domestic telecom operators (‚ÄúMegaphone ", MTS, Vimpelcom and Tele2) it was noted that more than 2.2 trillion rubles would be required only to organize the storage of messages, which, in turn, makes up more than 10% of the Russian budget." <br><br>  "The result of this unreasonable rush will be a sharp increase in tariffs of national operators for communication services for Russian consumers, caused by the need to compensate for very rapid growth of investments in the expansion of data storage systems," said the senator.  He also added that a short transition period may entail placing a large-scale purchase order for foreign equipment.  Russian manufacturers, including the manufacturer of systems for operational-search measures "Norsi-trans", are unable to release data warehouses on such a scale, and this contradicts the instructions of the president to store data on Russian equipment and software. <br><br>  In addition to mobile operators, significant cost will be incurred by Internet service providers, who will need to create new data centers.  The cost of Internet access for consumers can also grow. "At the same time, the average construction time of a data center is at least three to four years, that is, in any case, it exceeds the legal transition period," said Belyakov. <br><br>  Representatives of telecom operators Vimpelcom and Megafon supported the transfer of certain provisions of the ‚ÄúSpring Law‚Äù to the five years of entry into force. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373603/</a></p>
