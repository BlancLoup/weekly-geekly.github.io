  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Offline action online portal. Instructions for use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That year in Nizhny Novgorod, the wedding portal of my company held its first major action.  What was the corresponding post on the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ne_startap/56351/">Experience of offline campaign of one Internet project</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  This year we held this action for the second time.  Last Sunday.  Everything was very interesting again.  But for workers, it will probably be more interesting to read not only ‚Äúwhat it is,‚Äù but how all this is implemented, the various points of organizing the action itself. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. We <b>think over the idea</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Actually, like any startup, any action must first be thought out and thought out.  Not in detail, but the framework, the essence of the idea - you need to submit.  If something like that already exists, you need to modify the idea to stand out. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : We decided to hold a wedding promotion.  The action is divided into 2 parts: 1 - girls in wedding dresses in substantial quantities (we got 18) appear in various crowded places of the city - they shock the public, take pictures, videos, media ... move on a motorcade of limousines (we had 5 limousines).  The second part of the action is a show program, participating girls go there (18 people), there are invited those to whom the wedding is yet to come and there various wedding services are shown and a buffet table, of course. <br><br>  2. <b>We discuss the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe action with potential participants, partners, sponsors.</b> <br>  After you come up with and think up an idea - it should be run in.  Alone, a large share of pull is expensive, difficult ... and silly :) Well, if you, of course, do not have a bag of money.  Or does not allow the format of the action.  How to do it?  Chat!  And if you see the interest of all interest groups - it means that you have done everything correctly and successfully in the first step.  And that means you can move on. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : After we have thought over our action, we first of all went to our forum to ask our forum users if they would like to participate in this action.  They wanted.  In the process of discussion, the nuances were already formed.  The same thing, only in personal communication, we did with potential partners and sponsors of the action.  So we found an audience and partners / sponsors. <br><br>  3. <b>Elaboration of details</b> <br>  After you have thought over the ‚Äúframe‚Äù, you have run in the idea and realized that the idea is good and you will realize it, you need to work out all the details.  Write an action plan.  You can already work directly with this action plan, write press releases on it, come to meetings with partners and sponsors and negotiate. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : After we were convinced that it would be very cool for us to do this, we made a detailed plan - time, place, planned expenses, as well as a list of those services that will be useful to us during the campaign. <br><br>  4. <b>Search for partners and sponsors</b> <br>  Since in one of the steps you have already communicated with potential partners and sponsors and they have already said that it would be interesting for them, as well as you already have a detailed plan of action, with this plan we go directly to those with whom we used to be communicated.  It is enough to agree with a couple of companies, so that in the future the whole idea would grow like a snowball.  By negotiating financial or partner support with several companies, you can (if you still need to) go to other companies.  Present your program and refer to the fact that "such and such" already with pleasure wanted to participate in the action.  But it must be true, because  nothing will prevent them from knowing it.  So we find partners and sponsors. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : I will not write a great example.  This year we held an action and with partners and sponsors acted according to this scheme, which I described.  This is an honest scheme.  So here.  23 companies participated in our action (here we have partners and sponsors). <br><br>  5. <b>Work with the media</b> <br>  In order for your action to be successful you have to promote it well.  To do this, you at least need to make a competent press release.  It is advisable that it should be composed by a professional, or, at least, that a professional should check it and give valuable comments.  This is very important.  Because  With your press release, the media will continue to work and it will initially be your face. <br><br>  The press release should be sent the first time - a week or two before the event.  And repeat 2 days before the action.  Your contact information should be indicated in the press release and you should have direct, convenient communication for the media. <br><br>  You can also make a promotional website for your promotion.  This greatly enhances your share in the eyes of all.  This means that your action is not ‚Äúsome kind of garbage‚Äù, but already ‚Äúsomething serious‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : This year we received information about 3 local televisions, one radio, five newspapers, and the local (and not only) websites discussed this a lot.  We also made a promotional website - <a href="http://2009.svadbann.ru/">2009.svadbann.ru</a> and sent out a press release on the media. <br><br>  6. <b>Holding the action</b> <br>  Act according to the plan.  Force majors try to reflect in this plan too.  Well, just be able to get out of situations.  Everything else is a matter of technology :) <br><br>  <b>Example</b> : At our last promotion was force majeure.  Or rather a force majeure :) Driving up to the central square (Gorky Square), one of the limousines decided to stop the traffic cops.  We have already met limousines.  There were media with us.  The first limousine, which had arrived, began to get the traffic police itself.  We are a small crowd with photographers and media began to run up to them.  And the whole thing to shoot.  At first they didn‚Äôt cut the piece and began to swear at us.  A minute later, 4 more limousines arrived :) From there, brides began to go out and another crowd of photographers and an even larger crowd of media.  The traffic police apparently took care of such a turn of events and quietly got into the car and quickly drove away.  It was funny :) <br><br>  Most likely, these same rules apply not only for stocks of online projects, but for others as well.  But we conducted only for online, so I can only talk about them. <br><br>  If readers have any questions, I‚Äôll be happy to answer and supplement my topic with your questions and my answers.  If I am wrong at some point, then I will be happy to discuss this topic. <br><br>  To set the mood, I upload a photo where I am surrounded by our beauties participating this year :) <br><br><img src="http://svadbann.ru/images/svadbannru.jpg" alt="Brides in the Big City"><br><h6>  The author of the photo is Nizhny Novgorod photographer Ilya Kurochkin. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63021/</a></p>
