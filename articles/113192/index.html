On simple examples.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/49c6419f/93b9820a/1a7f0338/f2c4212d.jpg"><br><br>  Now I have the third tool in my turn - the gate, which I like most in terms of sound and all the other parameters.  In the end, I decided to sell my medieval bagpipes, made by German master J√ºrgen Ross. <br><br>  After about two weeks of active search in all the communities I know, groups in social networks and so on, I came to the conclusion that those who have been dealing with bagpipes for a long time are not interested in my instrument. <br><br>  I began to think, but how can I convey information to my audience using the Internet? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I decided to find out why this tool did not gain demand in professional communities.  Here you need to make a reservation: medieval bagpipes - a loud instrument, very suitable for rock bands and teams with a loud sound.  Somehow I played without re-playing during rehearsals, and my comrades played through 200 watt combi ... <br><br>  As it turned out, in large cities (residents of these cities are more actively communicating in communities through bagpipes) the fascination with folk and any elf-middle ages is in serious crisis, almost every second folk has a bagpipe, and some familiar musicians no longer want to play this music.  They say - monotonous. <br><br>  In general, dudelzak is a fairly easy-to-learn instrument with block flute fingering. <br><br>  The bottom line: in the online communities, it makes no sense to try to sell such a tool.  Through communication with colleagues on medieval bagpipes, I found out that some people have been trying to sell the bagpipes for quite a long time, despite the fact that the tool is of high quality and well built. <br><br>  Naturally, this option did not suit me at all.  I have long had a plan to create a sort of flea market flekers, so I decided to experiment: create a one-page website and find a buyer with it.  In the end, am I an internet marketer or not?  If the result is positive, you can safely make a flea market. <br><br>  Naturally, it all started with the choice of domain.  The word "bagpipe" on translite whatever one may say, is written crookedly.  And how do they call everyone from the side of dudelzak, bagpipes, flutes, etc.?  Great pipes! <br><br>  So the domain <a href="http://kupidudku.ru/">kupidudku.ru</a> turned out.  Of course, there was no need to spend money on design, so I spent half a day reworking the free template.  The designer is none of me, so I just tried not to disturb the grid, which made it easier for me to further layout. <br><br>  In order to convey to a stranger, why my bagpipes are so good, I gathered everything that distinguishes my instrument from other similar ones.  It turned out a short list that I posted on the main page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/abb917bb/217acde3/1cfd5384/335ded42.jpg"><br><br>  The second step is normal photos.  I phoned with a familiar professional photographer and within half an hour I received a lot of high-quality photos of various angles and plans, which also got to the main page.  Moreover, I tried to show not only the appearance of the instrument, but also the details - the materials, the bagpipe design, to prove that it is not just a good instrument, but a really high-quality and expensive thing that is worth the money! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/60773171/a16a7b5c/8f9c80a3/b9a6b263.jpg"><br><br>  The next page I did was contacts, where I indicated all the possible data for the connection: ICQ, VKontakte profile, Skype, soap, and even gave my small photo so that it was clear that not some goblin sells the bagpipe, but quite normal person. <br><br>  I deliberately did not give any contacts on the main page in order to determine the percentage of people potentially interested in buying with the help of statistics. <br><br>  As a statistical system, I chose a familiar LiveInternet and a metric in which I indicated a goal - a page with contacts.  Why do we need a metric? <br><br>  It is believed that behavioral factors affect the ranking of sites in search engines.  Naturally, I used elements of search engine optimization in order for the list of key phrases to get my site to good positions. <br><br>  This can be done even without external links, because  the topic is very, very narrow, and the key phrases are only a dozen. <br><br>  To increase the influx of visitors, I smashed the site about all the bagpipers and friends, and also decided to use Yandex.Direct and Google Adwords in addition.  I made one announcement with the following text: <br><br>  <u>Do you want to buy real bagpipes?</u> <br>  Company dudelzak from Germany.  Leather, burned mountain ash.  39 000 rubles. <br>  <u><a href="http://www.kupidudku.ru/">www.kupidudku.ru</a></u> <br><br>  The price, by the way, was declared very tasty for this tool. <br><br>  To be completely sure that I‚Äôm doing everything right, I signed with familiar bagpipers and asked me to evaluate the resulting resource.  As a result, I edited some texts, left only a very short text on the main page, and transferred the technical characteristics of the bagpipe to the inside page, since  made sure that the potential buyer will be interested first: price, sound, appearance and maybe who plays on such instruments (ie, style). <br><br>  Still, in order to hook on all possible sources of visitors, I published ads for sale in VKontakte groups (where this is acceptable and does not cause negative) on the profile forum and posted an article about the experiment on his website <a href="http://www.volynki.ru/%3Fp%3D608">volynki.ru</a> . <br><br>  I decided to spend the whole campaign in a month.  The site was published on February 1st.  Subtotals below. <br><br>  Visitor statistics data: <br>  So far the site has been visited by about 120 people. <br><br>  Sources of visitors: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ff01230/a51f71b2/d32913ea/c83dac01.png"><br><br>  Failure rate (single views): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e5860aff/d7f36a9d/dccde30e/a3df6af9.png"><br><br>  Number of visits to the contact page: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2010d7db/d499849a/c77fe358/4da1086b.png"><br><br>  People who contacted me about the purchase on February 4: <br>  soap: 1 <br>  ICQ: 1 <br>  Skype: 0 <br>  VK: 1 <br>  Phone: 1 <br><br>  Interestingly, the site of the 3rd was already indexed and in February 4th it was visited by 5 people from the search.  Few?  For this topic, given the circumstances - a lot. <br><br>  A couple of days after the site was published, a girl called me and asked if it was possible to buy a bagpipe for a gift - hang it on the wall.  He assured her that it was too expensive a gift for February 14, advised him to find Pakistan.  I thought I added a page with another bagpipe.  Quiet and small.  With a price 3 times lower. <br><br>  I haven‚Äôt yet sold my tune naturally, but: there are several next in line who are waiting for their owners.  All of them will be laid out one by one on the site.  I remember how happy I was when I was just starting to play the bagpipes. <br><br>  And now the planned costs - 600 rubles domain for a year, I already had hosting, Direct will cost me 600 rubles per month, and the same Adwords, photography - 500 rubles, search engine optimization - for free. <br><br>  Total: 2 300 rubles. <br><br>  It turns out that for an advertising campaign worth 5% of the product, I plan to sell it.  Make a bet? <br><br>  About results I will unsubscribe separately with statistics data for March 1. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113192/</a></p>
