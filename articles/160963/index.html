I outlined several key events yesterday, starting in 2012, but now it's time to focus on things that really matter and will matter in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6e/5a8/35c/d6e5a835c1598449cced43acbbe56b0c.jpg"><br>  Photo taken from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/watt_dabney/2587118653/">Andrew King</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Community growth </h2><br>  Currently, MODX has one of the largest software communities in the world.

      Our first step will be the Ambassador program, which was born at <a title="http://modxpo.eu" href="http://modxpo.eu/">MODXpo 2012</a> .  We are still preparing full information, but now we can say that the goal of the program will be to make sure that people like it and give the opportunity to make useful connections in the process of learning and the early implementation of MODX. <br><br>  Ambassadors must make commitments at least for a year, and during this time they will have to organize and coordinate at least <strong>6</strong> meetings (per year) and at the same time on an ongoing basis cooperate and communicate with MODX and the community.  Of course, they should not be at every meeting, but we will help prepare materials and topics that they can show.  Their main role is to take care of finding meeting places, coordinate these meetings and ensure that people learn about them in a timely manner. <br><br>  What do you get in return, becoming an ambassador?  You will get access to MODX, you will be able to influence its future, you will be the first to receive information about what is planned and will receive higher status and recognition in the general MODX ecosystem.  And also the satisfaction of understanding that you are helping to build a bright future for the CMS, which we all love so much.  No doubt, the future Ambassador will make serious commitments on time, but we hope that the benefits you get are worth your investment. <br><br>  If you are interested in becoming a MODX ambassador in your region or community, please write to <a title="http://modx.com/company/contact/" href="http://modx.com/company/contact/">our feedback form</a> and tell us about your experience with MODX, your location, your Skype or other contact details and everything that you thought was It would be appropriate to say, especially why you would like to be an ambassador and a few words about how you would conduct MODX meetings. <br><br><h2>  User experience </h2><br>  We are committed to a radical overhaul of the MODX user interface.  This applies to every detail: from forums, sections of documentation and to the services that we offer.  It all started from the moment Dustin Walker was hired in March 2012 to bring all the images and interfaces to full order.  The results of his work appeared in <a title="http://modxcloud.com" href="http://modxcloud.com/">MODX Cloud</a> , where a simple user interface is hidden management infrastructure and many complex things.  All this continues to be improved every week. <br><br>  Then our <a title="http://forums.modx.com" href="http://forums.modx.com/">Forum</a> was overhauled, which we hope will increase community involvement.  Even with the last weekend, we already saw a noticeable increase in visits and time spent on the forums.  We rejoiced from the very beginning, but we will rejoice even more when we finally release the code into the community.  It will happen later, but this year. <br>  I really can't wait for the UX / UI admin fix from Dustin.  What about you? <br><br><h2>  Constant innovations and inventions </h2><br>  Our first release in 2005 supported HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design.  Today, we already support everything else without the need to change the kernel or write tons of code.  MODX Revolution brought to the world of Media Sources, nobody has ever seen anything like it on other platforms, especially as already built-in functions.  So, if you need to access <a title="http://dropbox.com" href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> , <a title="http://drive.google.com" href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> or <a title="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> storage as a local web server file system, you can do it using Media Sources. <br><br>  But we have only slightly touched what is to come.  Inventing new things and looking for the best way to do already existing things is what is really important and printed in our DNA.  So, in the future, we expect to see more releases, more frequent releases, and will pay more attention to transparent interaction with the community in creating innovations.  All this will happen in 2013 and later. <br><br>  If you have ideas for improving MODX or the processes around it or any other part of the MODX world, do not hesitate <a title="http://modx.com/company/contact/" href="http://modx.com/company/contact/">to contact us</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160963/</a></p>
