Well, it goes without saying that you personally do not want this, do you? <br>  So why do we think that breaking the routine and starting to do something fundamentally new is so difficult?  Because it is really difficult: we are required to change priorities, change our plans and destroy a comfortable life.  It is almost the same as becoming a different person. <br><br>  "Fight Club" - a film about how to live the life you want, and what a thorny path you need to go to make it possible.  Tyler helps the nameless hero of the film take the path of enlightenment.  Perhaps Tyler's words will be able to help some of us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>‚ÄúNo fear.</b>  <b>No wasting yourself in vain.</b>  <b>The ability to let that which is not too important go to chance. ‚Äù</b> <br>  The ‚Äú80/20 Productivity Rule‚Äù states that 20% of all effort spent leads to 80% of the total result.  People are not inclined to consider this rule as something more than an entertaining theoretical research.  However, this approach is vital for entrepreneurs and creatives of all kinds and levels. <br>  The 80/20 rule requires a radical simplification, that is, allowing what is not very important to occur without your participation.  And the released time can be spent on innovative ideas that will undoubtedly lead to success. <br><br>  2. <b>‚ÄúNo fear.</b>  <b>No wasting yourself in vain.</b>  <b>The ability to let that which is not too important go to chance. ‚Äù</b> <br>  I'm serious.  Do not break the first two rules.

      3. <b>‚ÄúI say no need to be thorough.</b>  <b>Stop being perfect.</b>  <b>Grow and let the bricks sometimes fall out of the wall. ‚Äù</b> <br>  If you are going to develop and grow as a creative person, then you are ready to make mistakes.  In fact, you should start to make twice as many mistakes in order to discover a truly innovative ‚Äúsecond wind‚Äù. <br>  Make mistakes and let the stones fall out of the wall.  Perhaps you will enjoy the view. <br><br>  4. <b>"Only having lost everything, we gain freedom."</b> <br>  Oh yeah.  Do not be afraid to make big mistakes.  And, more importantly, do not strive so that everything goes according to plan.  In fact, if everything goes according to plan, the likelihood that something significant will happen is close to zero. <br>  It is said that life is what happens to you while you make plans.  Innovation is what happens when you decide to revise a plan, and perhaps the whole game.  Perhaps the original plan will be postponed or it will have to be abandoned altogether.  Do not let plans restrict your freedom to change the rules of the game. <br>  Losing everything is perhaps the best thing that can happen to you. <br><br>  5. <b>"You are not your work, not your money, your car, your wallet and your clothes."</b> <br>  When we talk about fear, risk, mistakes and total failure, what are we really afraid of?  Are we governed by things we own?  Do we prefer to obey what we achieve and create? <br>  I do not urge to give up my property and take unreasonable risks, endangering myself and my family.  I just want to say that ‚Äúthe things you own eventually start to own you‚Äù to such an extent that you cannot live the life you like and do what you want. <br><br>  6. <b>‚ÄúPeople daily persuade themselves, represent what they would like to be.</b>  <b>But they don't have the courage to just be that way. ‚Äù</b> <br>  I bet you have a great idea in your head right now.  And what do you intend to do with it? <br>  Be what you want to be and do what you want.  It really is as simple as it sounds.  Bold enough to move forward is what distinguishes a full life from a life full of regret. <br><br>  7. <b>"No matter how you catch feathers, you will not become a chicken."</b> <br>  Wearing black pants with low waist and smoking expensive cigarettes does not make you creative.  However, the <u>purchase of MacBook and iPhone also does not make you so</u> . <br>  Creativity and innovation are more of hard work.  It is rather a constant search for ideas and thinking about how to solve these or other problems than wallowing on a sofa.  This activity is simple and clear. <br><br>  8. <b>"This is your life, and it passes minute by minute."</b> <br>  The main thing is to know, not to be afraid, but to know that someday you will die.  Until you realize this, you cannot feel the urgency.  You will think that you have plenty of time at your disposal to do all sorts of pleasant things, but your ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù may not happen. <br>  <i>So stop reading Habr and go do what you need to do today.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79793/</a></p>
