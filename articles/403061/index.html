They build a core and raise a tower.  And so they did what they have done dozens of times since the fall of 2015.  But it is in this particular case that he brought the St. Petersburg skyscraper into the premier league of the world high-altitude club.  Come with me and I will tell you what it means. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d2/14d/c79/4d214dc7993849b59f4326569e08ca49.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Lakhta Center".</i>  <i>Photo by Sasha Sokolova</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why today the tower is not the same as yesterday </h3><br>  The builders finished concreting the walls of the core of the 72nd floor of the tower.  In less than a day, the <abbr title="Automatic Climbing System / Automatic Climbing Formwork">ACS</abbr> will rise higher and they will begin to reinforce the next level.  The recorded height of the core is 302.4 meters. <br><br>  "Lakhta Center" not just exchanged the fourth hundred.  He became Supertoll - now not only according to the drawings.  How does the new one hundred meters differ from the previous ones?

The first two are not so simple.  There are several international high-rise expert organizations.  They have no unity in answering the questions: what is considered a high-rise?  How tall is building to rank skyscrapers?  In the latter case, the discussion is conducted around the boundaries of 100, 150 and 200 meters. <br><blockquote>  International expert organizations: <br><br>  <abbr title="The Council on Tall buildings and Urban Habitat"><b>CTBUH</b></abbr> - Council for high-rise buildings and urban environments.  Works since 1969.  It maintains a list of 100 highest buildings in the world, holds the annual CTBUH Awards. <br><br>  <b>Emporis</b> - the organization began in 2000 as a base for high-rise real estate Skyscrapers.com.  Today is engaged in data collection and analytics for all types of construction.  In their base - more than 550 thousand buildings in 200 countries, more than 640 thousand images of objects.  The Emporis Skyscraper Award is awarded annually. <br><br>  Community of Engineers and Architects - <abbr title="International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering"><b>IABCE</b></abbr> , <abbr title="American Society of Civil Engineers"><b>ASCE</b></abbr> , <abbr title="International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction"><b>CIB</b></abbr> </blockquote><br>  The dispute is not from scratch.  Still, a skyscraper is an unusual category.  Not just a skyscraper, but reaching the sky.  This is a criterion not so much of objective height as of subjective human surprise.  Today, when there are tens of thousands of high-rise buildings in the world, it‚Äôs difficult to impress hundreds of meters up.  Planck surprising moves away.  It was 40 meters - it was 100 - it's time to move on to 200. It's time, but not yet crossed. <br><blockquote>  Skyscraper - tracing from English.  Earlier in Russia they talked about outstanding buildings - ‚Äúteterez‚Äù.  Very similar in meaning, but at the same time hints at the difference in typical weather.  Do not be outdated name, to the skyscrapers of St. Petersburg would fit perfectly well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a7/280/aa4/2a7280aa4020405fac036e629d365b89.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Major League beginning of the 20th century.</i>  <i>‚ÄúA grand building is being built in Moscow.</i>  <i>This house Afremov at the Red Gate.</i>  <i>It has eight floors with a basement.</i>  <i>This building will be not only the highest in Moscow and in Russia, but throughout Europe. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(From newspapers of the beginning of the 20th century) <a href="http://moscowwalks.ru/2010/09/15/vysotki-neboskreby-moskvy/">Photos and quotes from here</a></i> </blockquote><br>  On the other hand, the architectural landscape in countries and cities is different.  In Hong Kong and Hamburg, to a height of 100 meters, they look from different realities.  For some - a skyscraper, for others - the background building.  For some - the accent, for others - lost sight of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/608/ad1/bc0/608ad1bc0d6441b6ae0ccf4c30d7c477.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Dancing Towers" in Hamburg.</i>  <i><a href="http://proekt.by/arhitektura_i_dizaiyn-b26.0/tancuyushie_bashnineboskrebi_v_gamburge-t51212.0.html">Photo source</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a91/427/27c/a9142727c738433aa4301d44997e6c08.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Skyscrapers of Hong Kong.</i>  <i>Photos - Base64, retouched by CarolSpears <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php%3Fcurid%3D4222127">Photo</a> Source</i> <br><br>  With just skyscrapers - the same situation.  For example - is it a skyscraper or not? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/849/ae7/8f2849ae72674168ac73b855ed26ad5d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Village Pucischa, Croatia.</i>  <i><a href="">Photo source.</a></i> <br><br>  In order to somehow get out of the contradictions, the Council on high-rise buildings and the urban environment even suggested not taking the meters into account.  High-rise building can recognize and very small building.  The criteria will be the architectural environment, the proportions and the application of specific technologies from the field of high-rise construction. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  If there is no unity with skyscrapers and skyscrapers, what can be attributed to the ‚Äúsupertolls‚Äù is understandable and even categorical: 300 meters and more.  By the end of 2016, there were just over one hundred such buildings in the world. <br><br>  Seven years ago, with the introduction of the Burj Khalifa (828 m), the first object of the next category appeared - the megatoll, which sends those to whom "for 600".  So far there are three megatolls in the world - even the Clock Tower in Mecca (601 m) and the Shanghai Tower (632 m).  It is estimated that in three years the number of megatolls will reach eight, and the supertolls will exceed 250 buildings. <br><br>  By 2020, should complete the Kingdom Tower in <abbr title="Saudi Arabia">CA.</abbr>  Stated 1000+ meters above sea level.  If the bar is taken, it is likely that a new category of high-rise buildings will be discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4f/3bb/0fc/d4f3bb0fcd5c4160b399fcb2db3911fa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Kingdom Tower, render.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.pickardchilton.com/work/kingdom-tower">A source</a></i> <br><br><h3>  How to measure height </h3><br>  This year, Chinese builders must enter the building of the Ping An International Financial Center in Shenzhen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/c99/af3/233c99af3a4b40d590b48f366367ea0d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>MFC Pinan.</i>  <i>Photo by Jay Sterling Austin.</i>  <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php%3Fcurid%3D37658242">A source</a></i> <br><br>  The height of the tower is 599 m (1965 ft).  If you put a flagpole on top - will it become a megatoll?  And if you make a spire a couple of meters higher, then?  Maybe the length of the piles to count - also a building element? <br><br>  Often, three parameters indicate the height of the building: the level of the last inhabited space, the highest point where the flagpole can enter and the height according to the structure.  In constructive fall roof, tower, spire - integral architectural elements and do not fall flagpoles, antennas, masts and other technical equipment.  Constructive - the main criterion.  If only one figure in height is indicated, then we are talking about it. <br><br>  The lower mark is from the floor of the main public entrance to the building.  Piles, technical floors in the foundation, underground parking lots and deep technical inputs are not counted. <br><br><h3>  Useful useless meters </h3><br>  The Empire State Building, the first Supertoll building, has been the tallest building in the world for 40 years.  Its height is 443.2 m. And this is a building of 1931!  It's like flying to Mars right today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/f88/d81/aa3f88d817fc4a44a9d0cf9aaa57ae47.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Empire State Building and Chrysler Building in the background.</i>  <i><a href="http://de.academic.ru/dic.nsf/dewiki/868379">Photo source</a></i> <br><br>  In the skyscraper - 103 floors.  And the planned 80. The difference arose because at the same time with the "Imperials" was built Chrysler Building - another contender for the tallest building in New York.  Rasobok, who led the construction of the ESB, was afraid that competitors would hide a retractable rod in the spire and take it out at the last moment.  Therefore, he insured himself thoroughly - not only with floors, but also with a 62-meter spire. <br><br>  Think something has changed since then?  Here are stories from modern times - Burj Khalifa kept the height in secret all the way.  The only ‚Äúleak‚Äù was in 2006, supposedly about 808 meters.  Perhaps twenty meters above were built because of her.  Well, if a competitor appeared, the builders were ready to add more heights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/610/591/b57610591fe24c75bd128b9bcdc04b7a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Burj Khalifa</i>  <i><a href="https://city.travel/blog/%3Fp%3D1058">Photo source</a></i> <br><br>  These stories are not only about legislation, which allows you to build up how much you build.  CTBUH describes such cases as "vanity meters" or "useless meters."  These include the entire height between the last exploited space and the highest point of the building. <br><br>  Flagpole on the steeple, for example.  Burj Khalifa has such meters - 244, if you count all the uninhabited top space and 190 - if only the spire.  The spire of Burj Khalifa could become the third tallest structure in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  The highest figure of vanity meters is at Burj Al Arab: more than a third of the building‚Äôs height, 121 meters out of 321, or 111 meters, if you count a helicopter platform on the roof for the last exploited space. <br><br>  It is estimated that 61% of supertolls, having lost their useless meters, would have become just skyscrapers. <br><br>  On the other hand, the opinion of CTBUH can be argued.  Most of the super-highs would obviously look unfinished, if they were left without such an architectural detail as the spire.  Continuing the thought of CTBUH, all ‚Äúarchitectural excesses‚Äù, without exception, everything that adorns buildings, defines style and makes them individual can be attributed to vanity meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/621/74b/e0a/62174be0ace64b81b3c4d48ba2b58945.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Opera in Sydney.</i>  <i>Isn't she <s>beautiful</s> vanity?</i>  <i>Author photo - <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php%3Fcurid%3D5420726">Diliff</a></i> <br><br>  By the way, ‚ÄúLakhta Center‚Äù in any case would remain a supertoll.  The last inhabited space, observation platform, will be located at 360 meters. <br><br><h3>  Super tall in shape </h3><br>  It turns out that the supertoll is only about height?  Yes.  But height is in itself equivalent to the complexity of construction. <br><br>  To the task to conquer the transcendental marks are often added architectural "highlights" and forming them a complex object constructive.  In the selection below you can see how diverse forms of supertolls are.  Often, it is impossible to create such on buildings of lower height - there will not be enough meters to reveal the idea. <br><br>  I will briefly discuss a couple of interesting architectural trends. <br><br>  <b>Ultra slim buildings.</b>  The category includes supertolls 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, One 57 and a number of others - all in New York.  The ratio of width to height in ultrafine can reach 1:23. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a4/a50/4fe/9a4a504fe6014bf6b9c07ee97bd66096.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>One 57. Author of the photo - <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php%3Fcurid%3D33000462">Godsfriendchuck</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Spiral building</b> .  There are only 28 of them in the world, the angle of rotation of the building is from 38 to 360 degrees.  The highest is the Shanghai Tower, 632 meters.  Turns 120 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/008/d94/52e/008d9452e68f4387b8a25a20c9ec67e8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Shanghai Tower.</i>  <i>Author photo - <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php%3Fcurid%3D41840588">Ermell</a></i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúLakhta Center‚Äù is the second in the list, the angle of rotation is 90 degrees at 462 meters height. <br><br>  In 2020 should appear <b>rotating skyscraper</b> .  Dynamic Tower Hotel in Dubai.  With the help of voice commands, hotel guests will be able to rotate an entire floor at different speeds and directions.  It remains unclear - if there are more than one guests on the floor, will they have to somehow agree on where to turn and what the negotiation process will look like. <br><br><h3>  Supertolls.  Selection </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/461/981/1f8/4619811f8f5c4020af8bd2589dca769a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Chicago, Sears Tower.  From 2009 for a period of 15 years, the name was changed to Willis Tower, than the locals were outraged.  The height is 442 m. He was a record holder among skyscrapers for almost a quarter of a century - from 1973 to 1996.  On the observation deck (103 floor) there are retractable glass balconies, which aroused great interest of readers in the post about the glass <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lakhta_center/blog/283836/">here.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/afc/f4a/203afcf4a52743f88b594088137651ae.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.
