The servers from the company's office in Kiev where testing of new technologies were performed were also withdrawn. <br><br>  The Ukrainian authorities have more than once raised the issue of regulating Internet payments, especially in the Webmoney system. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Correspondent.net: <a href="http://korrespondent.net/business/financial/1569891-vedomstvo-klimenko-zablokirovalo-na-schetah-webmoney-desyatki-millionov-griven">korrespondent.net/business/financial/1569891-vedomstvo-klimenko-zablokirovalo-na-schetah-webmoney-desyatki-millionov-griven</a> <br><br><blockquote>  Today, June 12, the Ministry of Revenue and Duties of Ukraine reported that it had achieved a blocking of UAH 60 million on the electronic payments connected with the company WebMoney. <br><br>  This is the agency Interfax-Ukraine, citing the statement of the central office for working with large taxpayers of the Ministry of Alexander Klimenko. <br><br>  “Employees of the Main Operational Directorate together with colleagues from the Main Investigation Department of Financial Investigations of the Ministry of Revenue and Duties revealed significant violations in the operation of Web Money Transfer LLC in Ukraine,” the central office said. <br><br>  In addition, it notes that, at present, over 60 million UAH have been blocked on the bank accounts of enterprises that were part of the criminal scheme. <br><br>  In addition, the Central Investigation Department established that the rules of operation of this payment system are not coordinated with the National Bank of Ukraine. <br><br>  As follows from the message, during the searches of the Kiev office of the company Web Money a significant amount of computer equipment was withdrawn, which ensured the operation of the payment system and on which information is stored regarding the activities of this system. <br><br>  "The users of this system were online stores, providers of information services and individuals who tried to hide illegal financial transactions," the report says. <br><br>  Interfax-Ukraine adds that investigations are currently ongoing.  After their completion, the materials will be submitted to the court for a decision regarding the organizers of the criminal scheme. <br><br>  Earlier today it became known that on June 12, the State Tax Service in Kiev searched the office of the company that provides WebMoney, an instant online payment service (one of the largest settlement systems in the CIS in the network). <br><br>  Recall that WebMoney is an online payment system that has been operating in Ukraine since 2003; according to some reports, about two million Ukrainians use it.  WebMoney Transfer is an international instant online payment system, positioning itself as an environment and technology for business and e-commerce.  The system provides electronic payments in real time through accounting units - WebMoney title characters. <br><br>  Earlier it was reported that the Ukrainian National Bank intends to establish the limit of monthly operations with electronic money in the amount of 25 thousand UAH.  The ministry also calculated that in the first quarter of 2013, the amount of operations using electronic money increased almost 2 times in annual terms, amounting to 511.331 million UAH. <br><br>  As reported, the National Bank of Ukraine intends to oblige the payment infrastructure operators involved in remittances to register with the NBU. <br><br>  Recall also that the Board of the NBU approved the decision on the restriction of cash payments between individuals to UAH 150 thousand from September 1, 2013.  Earlier, the NBU has repeatedly stated that the rules of WebMoney Transfer and Yandex.Money payment systems operating in Ukraine were not agreed upon in the manner prescribed by law.  In September 2012, the ministry reported that the regulator expects to intensify the dialogue with these systems. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183088/</a></p>
