It was he who developed the procedure for passing the greenlight phase of the projects, working in Activision back in 1999.  His career is associated with releases of iconic games and franchises that are familiar to everyone: Call of Duty, 1, 2, 3, Black Ops, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Transformers and Destiny.

He participated in the development of World of Warcraft from the start of the game to the addition of Burning Crusade.  Then he joined the Diablo III team.  He is currently leading the release team for Diablo III. <br><br>  Like all Blizzard games, Diablo III went through many iterations from start to release.  Wyatt‚Äôs talk is about gaming systems that the developers tried out while working on the game.  He told about all the pros and cons of each system, which worked and did not work, as the team used every failure to get closer to success. <br><br>  Speech in English: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYqSZg_faRg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNX0GkINT8InSjXo9mJWnNUi4yiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BiAPlVjij9U%3Flist%3DPLC4iH_1A781SIwrFq2tNd53eGNZLUjEdx">Simultaneous translation into Russian</a> <br><hr><br>  <b>Fatal Designs / Alexander Brazie / Game Design Consultant</b> <br><br>  Alexander Brezi, also known as Xelnath, studied for ten years with veterans of the gaming industry, and another ten worked on AAA projects.  As a League of Legends and World of Warcraft game designer, he is known for his design philosophy, which focuses on interacting with communities of players. <br><br>  Strong game design is not an accident, it is the result of creative ideas, hard work, good discipline and love for the craft.  In the report, Alexander asked five questions that each developer must ask himself in order to make not just good games, but great games. <br><br>  Speech in English: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3eLcJSgeGHs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzUyYxgqZYQaCB-P1o-pLdurDZSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fd0cOMGOPrU%3Flist%3DPLC4iH_1A781SIwrFq2tNd53eGNZLUjEdx">Simultaneous translation into Russian</a> <br><hr><br>  <b>Keith Fuller / Leadership Consultant, Fuller Game Production</b> <br><br>  Keith Fuller is a certified specialist in project management and Scrum.  Now he helps studio managers of any size to develop leadership skills and improve production processes.  However, China has more than 20 years of game development and 12 AAA projects in which he was a programmer, project manager, or producer. <br><br>  There are several major leadership features that affect the result of the studio, the quality of projects and the emotional health of employees.  Using the example of several industry studies, Kit will explain why these traits are important, and how companies can develop them. <br><br>  Speech in English: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WB7HREUNqI0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhb81KJZgnu6P7rFTAsXFow6EutiA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UAkNLqUSMW4%3Flist%3DPLC4iH_1A781SIwrFq2tNd53eGNZLUjEdx">Simultaneous translation into Russian</a> <br><hr><br>  <b>Motivation and emotional needs of players / Nadezhda Ivanova / IXD Researcher, Wargaming</b> <br><br>  Nadezhda has been working as an IXD researcher at the St. Petersburg Wargaming development studio since 2014.  Her main task is a comprehensive study of the World of Warships audience, as well as its interaction with the product (whether it be a game, a project information platform or a video). <br>  In the report, Nadezhda shared the results of a study of the psychology of the players, their interests, needs, values ‚Äã‚Äãand motivations.  Nadezhda talked about how changes in the motivation and game behavior of the WoWs audience are tracked, and what the differences are in the interests, values ‚Äã‚Äãand motivations of players from different regions. <br><br>  Speech in Russian: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNlgweJf5I4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh5-F3Y4cjfd6CdBY92y7IxFVlJGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <b>Development of ideas in conditions of high uncertainty / Nikita Denisov / Senior Game Designer, Wargaming</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The gaming industry has not yet acquired a harsh formula for financial success, and when creating games, we often rely on intuition, sensation and hope to suddenly imagine a brilliant and working structure - all this in a chaotic brainstorming mode.  But such a process is characterized by high uncertainty and enormous risks.  Even if we exclude material goods, there is a great chance to create a game that will not be interesting to anyone, including the creators themselves. <br><br>  Nikita told a story about a game developer.  A story about difficulties and their overcoming;  how to bring a bit of order to the generation and development of ideas;  about ways to develop yourself and increase efficiency, while not sacrificing, but on the contrary, contributing to creativity. <br><br>  Speech in Russian: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVh6U-Q8f7E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhigrCwAzOkCaaSXTvpk_C-AB2of9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Records of all the speeches of the WGDF can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbTBUpE98Nd_IyBSnc55Ag/featured">on YouTube</a> . <br>  Thank you for your attention and see you at WGDF 2017! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305742/</a></p>
