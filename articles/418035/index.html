  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Introduction to the Timeline in Unity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>[In the tutorial about 50 MB images, including animated GIF]</i> <br><br>  To tell part of the plot of the game or captivate the player, developers often use cutscenes.  In some games, specially rendered animated scenes with high-detail models are created, while in others, real in-game models are used.  Through the use of in-game models, you can save a lot of time and money, because you do not have to create new models, rigs and animations exclusively for the cutscenes.  But even if you use ready-made models, this does not mean that you need to sacrifice special effects or drama!  Unity has a powerful tool to create exciting cutscenes - Unity Timeline! <br><br>  In this tutorial, you will learn about Timeline and learn how to create cutscenes with animations and camera shifts.

    <h2>  Getting Started </h2><br>  Download the draft project and the finished project <a href="">from here</a> . <br><br>  Open the Starter Project file and load the Main scene.  She will be our foundation.  There is a hero in it, standing on the tower and looking at the world: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fc/7a6/c5c/5fc7a6c5cd759ce8aa9c08509db3830d.png"></div><br>  With your help, he will be able to jump off the tower, turn around, go up to the treasure chest and kick open it.  With these animations, the camera will also change its position. <a name="habracut"></a>  Here is what the finished scene looks like: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af7/5c6/b3f/af75c6b3fbbe8e5e5ef322edb65b96d9.gif"></div><br><h2>  What is the timeline? </h2><br>  In this tutorial we will work with Unity Timeline - but what is the timeline?  The Timeline is a GameObject with a timeline component that can be edited in the Unity Timeline window, which controls keyframes of animation and object life cycles.  When creating a cutscene using Unity Timeline, we set the animation keys and determine when they should work.  In this tutorial, we will also use an AnimationController, which can be perceived as a superset of keyframe animations. <br><br>  When a character performs an animation, for example, a walk, each individual moving top of the object must indicate its path.  In this tutorial, we will not be engaged in creating models and rigging animations - everything has already been done for us.  But it will be useful to know that when you manually define a keyframe of an animation or use an animation of AnimationController, then in essence they are the same: the position of the objects at a given point in time.  Timeline controls all these movements to create a scene.  All this you will understand when you start to understand Unity Timeline. <br><br>  But before you dive into the study, it is useful to make a brief overview of the Timeline window.  Look at the image and read the descriptions under the numbers: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/275/91e/f57/27591ef57ff5efa79752c74bdbc99906.png"></div><br><ol><li>  <em>Timeline Asset:</em> this is a track tied to a GameObject in the hierarchy.  It stores the keyframes associated with this GameObject, which are used to perform animations or to determine whether a GameObject is active. </li><li>  <em>Associated GameObject:</em> this is the GameObject the track is associated with. </li><li>  <em>Frame:</em> this is the currently specified timeline frame.  When we need to change animations, we set keyframes in the initial and final frames. </li><li>  <em>Track Group:</em> as the scene increases, the number of tracks increases.  You can organize tracks by grouping them. </li><li>  <em>Record Button:</em> when this button is active, we can change the current frame and set the position and / or rotation of the GameObject in the scene.  The changes will be recorded. </li><li>  <em>Curves Icon:</em> Clicking this icon will open the Curves window, where you can fine-tune the details of the associated animation keyframes to change them in the desired way. </li></ol><br>  Do not worry if this information seems too complicated for you so far - in the course of the tutorial we will return to it.  At this stage, the most important thing to remember is where the Timeline window is located, and that when you select a GameObject Timeline, you can access the Timeline window. <br><br><h2>  Light, camera, MOTOR! </h2><br>  After loading the main scene, click Play.  You should see the hero standing on top of the tower: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/ad7/7b9/57bad77b9bb301ff866534b848e143c8.gif"></div><br>  This is the default animation set in the Animation controller.  In this tutorial, we will use pre-created animations, so you do not need to worry about the internal structure of models, animations or controllers.  But if you want to understand this process, you can study our tutorial <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/116652/introduction-unity-animation-system">Introduction to Unity Animation</a> . <br><br><h3>  Creating a Timeline GameObject </h3><br>  The first step is to create a GameObject <em>Timeline</em> .  Create an empty <em>GameObject</em> by clicking with the right mouse button (on a Mac - with Command pressed) on the Hierarchy window and selecting <em>Create Empty</em> .  So we will add a GameObject to the scene and select it: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b50/b0d/cd1/b50b0dcd1373675793c2ad2b912e8119.gif"></div><br>  Without removing the selection from the GameObject, open the <em>Window menu</em> and select <em>Timeline</em> .  The Timeline window opens.  Click the <em>Create button</em> , the Save dialog box opens.  <em>Change the name of the file to Timeline</em> and click on Save: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/90a/840/6cd90a840183dae9b1ceeb36ac181325.gif"></div><br>  <em>Rename the GameObject</em> to <em>Timeline</em> by clicking on it, pressing the <em>F2</em> key and typing the <em>Timeline</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/909/b39/198/909b3919810d8d85ccaa55866aa24aad.png"></div><br>  We created a GameObject Timeline that will coordinate all animations and camera changes in the cutscene.  Inside the engine, Unity saved an asset file called Timeline.playable to disk.  In GameObject Timeline Unity added components <em>Playable Director</em> and <em>Animator</em> . <br><br>  The Playable Director component contains the Playable field associated with the Timeline asset we just saved.  The added Unity component of Animator in theory should allow us to animate the GameObject Timeline, but we will not do this, so you can simply ignore it. <br><br>  Before moving on, I want to drag the <em>Timeline tab</em> to the bottom of the screen.  This will allow us to simultaneously open the Scene and Timeline windows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15f/7ca/f00/15f7caf00a0c02304d0b303475ea64a6.gif"></div><br>  Select GameObject <em>Timeline</em> and return to the Timeline window.  At the moment, we have an <em>Animation Track</em> for GameObject Timeline.  We do not need it, so you can select it and click <em>Delete</em> to delete: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78c/af5/d9a/78caf5d9a6a19b7f9e4a0416839ed893.gif"></div><br><h2>  Animate the jump! </h2><br>  Now we are ready to start the animations.  Expand the GameObject <em>Hero</em> to see the GameObject <em>Model</em> .  Select GameObject <em>Timeline</em> .  Drag the GameObject <em>Model</em> into the Timeline window;  this will open the track menu, so select <em>Animation Track</em> .  Repeat this step for GameObject <em>Hero</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/753/53a/a08/75353aa08cbffd2a4a73d577ad9659e7.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  <em>Note:</em> we have added both Hero and Model in order to correctly use zero local space.  GameObject Hero is a container for the GameObject Model that allows you to play animations without affecting the position from which they are played.  When we need to move the hero, we will animate the GameObject Hero.  When the hero needs to be animated - which can be done while moving - we will use the GameObject Model.  Without this parent-child connection, the animations reproduced by the Model object will incorrectly override the motion parameters of the Hero object, unless you configure it as a child. </blockquote><br><h3>  We write down key frames </h3><br>  Since the GameObject Hero track is the position of the hero, we need to set its position as the starting keyframe. <br><br>  Select <em>the Hero track</em> in the Timeline window and click on the <em>Record button</em> (red circle) to start recording.  Select <em>GameObject Hero</em> in the Hierarchy window and <em>set its X Position to -1</em> , and then immediately <em>set its X Position to 0</em> . <br><br>  Return to the Timeline window and click the Record button on the Hero track to <em>complete the recording</em> .  So we added a keyframe for the initial position of the hero: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c0/626/7e2/0c06267e22f895f6f5ef74c9fa28bff7.gif"></div><br>  In our project, the hero is already in the position from which he must begin.  However, until we change the position, it will not be recorded during the recording as a keyframe.  Therefore, if you ever need to set a keyframe when recording for a position that already has a keyframe, just move it and return it to register. <br><br>  The easiest way to do this is to assign the X Position of the object to -1 relative to its current position, and then return the value to its place.  In this tutorial we will use this trick several times. <br><br>  Next, we need the hero to wait 100 frames before jumping from the tower.  At the moment we have set only the initial position of the hero, but we need to set the hero to the same position (that is, on the top of the tower) after 100 frames.  Otherwise, Unity will immediately begin to interpol the motion. <br><br>  As before, select <em>GameObject Timeline</em> , but this time you need to click on <em>the frame field</em> at the top of the window and <em>enter "100"</em> .  So we will move the keyframe to frame 100. <br><br>  Click the Hero's <em>Record</em> button.  Select GameObject <em>Hero</em> and in the Transform field of the Inspector window, <em>set its X Position to -1, and then immediately return it to 0</em> .  Press the <em>Record</em> button again to stop recording. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9d/f81/629/b9df816295a4a093690123d7c0aad18e.gif"></div><br>  So, we set up the initial keyframe of Hero and are ready to continue working with animations. <br><br><h3>  Adding Animated Clips </h3><br>  <em>Setting position data</em> <br><br>  First we need to set these positions. <br><br>  Click on GameObject <em>Timeline</em> to select it.  In the Timeline window, add animation <em>Animation</em> to the Model track by right-clicking (on a Mac - by clicking with Command pressed) on the Model track and selecting <em>Add From Animation Clip</em> .  Now select the <em>Idle</em> animation: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1da/e61/ba0/1dae61ba06cdce0322107b23ff6f37a0.gif"></div><br>  Next, we animate the hero's leap from the tower, but first we need to move it up and over the railing, and then down to the ground. <br><br>  To do this, first select the Timeline window, and then go to frame <em>138</em> .  Click the <em>Record</em> button in the Hero track.  Now select GameObject <em>Hero</em> .  In the Transform field of the Inspector window, set the Y Position value to <em>3.934, and the Z Position value to 1.97</em> . <br><br>  Return to the Timeline window and <em>go to frame 176</em> .  Select GameObject <em>Hero</em> again and <em>set the Y Position to 0, and the Z Position to 5.159</em> .  Finish recording by clicking on the <em>Record</em> button: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/4ab/f21/25a4abf2175ff8db75ba9f84617592d9.gif"></div><br>  Save the scene and click <em>Play</em> to see the result of your work! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b7/2db/a22/3b72dba221854fa69d6026f3e752d33d.gif"></div><br>  <em>Adding animations</em> <br><br>  We set these positions, but not animations performed with them.  Now we will do this. <br><br>  With the Timeline window selected, right-click (on the Mac, click with Command pressed) on the <em>Model</em> track and click <em>Add From Animation Clip</em> , and then select <em>Jump</em> .  This will add the Jump animation immediately after the Idle animation. <br><br>  Drag the right side of the <em>Jump animation</em> so that it is in frame <em>176</em> .  Now we‚Äôll add another <em>Animation Clip</em> , but this time we‚Äôll add a <em>Land</em> animation (you don‚Äôt need to change its length, just add it): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fc/d59/386/4fcd59386cf3bb429e88dfbd43d9eb2c.gif"></div><br>  Save the scene, click Play and look at the result! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ec/db1/a6e/4ecdb1a6e1251571174489fda2781e60.gif"></div><br><h3>  Add cameras </h3><br>  It is a bit difficult to follow the action after the hero jumps from the tower, so it‚Äôs time to work with the cameras. <br><br>  In the Hierarchy window, rename <em>MainCamera</em> to <em>Camera1</em> .  Select GameObject <em>Timeline</em> .  Drag <em>Camera1</em> into the Timeline window, and the track selection menu will open;  select <em>Activation Track</em> .  Drag the <em>Active</em> strip of Camera1 so that it ends at frame <em>157</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/964/9ba/994/9649ba9949b1ab49a1a35e1ebaf6402f.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  <em>Hint:</em> the current frame marker can be set using the frame counter field in the Timeline Inspector.  If you set a marker on the frame to which you want to drag the track, the track will be attached to the frame marker. </blockquote><br>  The activation or inactivity of a GameObject during a scene is controlled by the <em>Activation Track</em> .  Our main camera will now turn off after frame 157. Click Play and see the result: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30d/d87/28a/30dd8728a41999eb04bbc442a4a608dc.gif"></div><br>  Now we will add another camera, only it will look from top to bottom to show the hero after jumping over the railing of the tower. <br><br>  In the Hierarchy window, select <em>Camera1</em> and create its duplicate by pressing <em>Control-D</em> (Command-D on Mac).  Rename the duplicate to <em>Camera2</em> and <em>disable</em> it. <br><br>  In this tutorial, we use two more cameras, so we will create them now, repeating the same algorithm;  <em>rename them to Camera3 and Camera4</em> and disable it.  After that, all Camera game objects, except Camera1, should be disabled.  Here is what the hierarchy should look like: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/49e/f6c/1ac49ef6c59edbcdc0c13d244044c43f.png"></div><br>  Now we will locate Camera2.  Select <em>Camera2</em> and in the Transform field of the Inspector window <em>set the Y Position value to 10.75, and the Z Position value to 2.84</em> .  Parameter X Rotation set the value <em>79.5</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/453/024/5d2/4530245d2df0228ca5729db4d55630c9.png"></div><br>  As for Camera1, select the <em>Timeline</em> window and drag the <em>Camera2</em> object <em>into the</em> Hierarchy;  the track selection menu will reappear, so select the <em>Activation Track</em> .  Drag <em>the Active bar</em> so that it starts immediately after the activation of Camera1 (frame 158).  Drag the right side of the <em>Active track</em> for Camera2 so that it ends at <em>frame 216</em> . <br><br>  Save the scene, click Play and watch the camera change in your scene. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/675/626/169/67562616913b51e0bf42e7cb68cf648f.gif"></div><br><h2>  It's time to get to the treasure! </h2><br><h3>  We look at the chest </h3><br>  Now that our hero has landed on the ground, he must turn to the treasure chest and start walking. <br><br>  Select GameObject <em>Timeline</em> and set frame <em>202</em> .  Click the <em>Record button</em> in the <em>Hero</em> track to start recording. <br><br>  Select GameObject <em>Hero</em> and in the Transform field of the Inspector window, <em>set the Y Rotation value to -1, and then immediately change the value back to 0</em> to set the initial key frame of the GameObject Hero rotation. <br><br>  When finished with this, select the GameObject Timeline again and <em>set the frame to 216</em> .  Select GameObject Hero again and in the Transform field of the Inspector window <em>set Y Rotation to -90</em> . <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Note: the</em> assignment of keyframes of position and rotation occurs independently of each other.  Previously, when we set the initial position of the hero, the key frame for the rotation was not saved, so we need to set a new frame before moving to the desired turn in the direction of the treasure. </blockquote><br>  In addition, the hero must be in a waiting state at this moment, so add an <em>Idle</em> animation to the <em>Model Animation Track</em> and make it last until frame <em>216</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a2/cc9/f3c/2a2cc9f3c2b9309b71f563b9409a1bc0.gif"></div><br>  So, our hero has landed and is ready to search for treasure.  It is time to go to him and open the chest! <br><br>  <em>Hint:</em> if the Timeline track becomes too large, you can turn the mouse wheel to change its scale.  To move left or right, hold down the middle mouse button, moving it left or right. <br><br><h3>  We are approaching the treasure </h3><br>  Select GameObject <em>Timeline</em> and set frame <em>216</em> .  Click the <em>Record</em> button on the Hero track to start recording. <br><br>  Select GameObject <em>Hero</em> and set the X Position value to <em>-1</em> in the Transform field of the Inspector window, and then return to <em>0</em> to set the keyframe to the starting position.  Next on the Timeline, select frame <em>361</em> on the Hero track. <br><br>  Return to GameObject <em>Hero</em> and set the X Position value to <em>-6</em> in the Transform field of the Inspector window.  Return to the Hero track and complete the recording. <br><br>  Finally, set the <em>Walk</em> object to the Model object by performing the same steps as before, and then drag it to <em>frame 361</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/24e/f3a/9af24ef3ab3b37448c18d1a76650ef15.gif"></div><br>  You may notice that the hero seems to be passing through the treasure, but in reality this is a problem with the preview of the Timeline, because, as we will see shortly, the hero goes straight to the chest and stops. <br><br>  In order for Camera2 not to follow the whole path of the hero, we can now use Camera3 to shoot from behind the hero. <br><br>  To do this, in the main menu of the Hierarchy window, select and drag <em>Camera3</em> onto the GameObject <em>Model</em> , which is inside GameObject Hero, to make the camera its child. <br><br>  Set the <em>Camera3</em> position <em>(X: 0, Y: 2.06, Z: -2.5)</em> .  Give it a turn <em>(X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0)</em> .  The hierarchy should look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/c01/76c/949c0176c544e6fcfaf58f04cd295e38.png"></div><br>  Due to the fact that Camera3 is now a child of the GameObject Model, it will repeat all the movements of the GameObject Model, looking at it from behind.  However, Camera3 still needs an activation track to activate at the right time. <br><br>  Drag GameObject <em>Camera3</em> onto the Timeline and select the <em>Activation Track</em> , as we did with Camera1 and Camera2.  Set as the starting frame of <em>Camera3 the</em> end frame of Camera2, and as the end frame of <em>Camera3,</em> set <em>361</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbe/e67/de1/fbee67de1449ff7f4cc0e4390c398fef.gif"></div><br>  Now save the scene, click <em>Play</em> and see how everything turns out: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/cfb/30f/a70cfb30f5c7f7eb24e2946503f08c7f.gif"></div><br>  We have almost done everything!  Now the hero just has to open the chest ... of course, by kicking it! <br><br><h3>  Open the chest </h3><br>  For the last perspective, we use Camera4, adjusting it the way we did with Camera1 and Camera2. <br><br>  Drag <em>Camera4</em> to the Timeline and add the <em>Activation Track</em> .  Set the starting frame of <em>Camera4</em> to the end of the Camera3 activity phase and drag it to frame <em>555</em> .  It should look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c9/7a8/c48/7c97a8c485527dde14bfc746363179e4.png"></div><br>  Add a kick animation.  Right-click (on a Mac, click with Command pressed) on the Model track.  Select <em>Add Animation From Clip</em> , and then select <em>Kick</em> .  Do not change the duration.  Now the Model track should look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7a/026/bf0/b7a026bf0b4c0a6799b3d30e3ff718c2.png"></div><br>  We need to open the chest, so now we will add an animation of its cover.  Setting up this animation is similar to what we did before. <br><br>  Expand <em>ChestBottom</em> GameObject in the Hierarchy window.  Drag the <em>ChestLid</em> GameObject into the Timeline and select <em>Animation Track</em> .  In the Timeline, set the frame to <em>389</em> .  Now select the <em>ChestLid</em> track.  Click on the <em>Record button</em> . <br><br>  Now, when recording is in <em>progress</em> , select the GameObject <em>ChestLid</em> in the Hierarchy window and set the X Position to <em>-1</em> , and then return to <em>0</em> to set the initial position.  In the Timeline window, set the frame to <em>555</em> .  Finally, in the Transform field of the Inspector window, set the Y Position <em>ChestLid</em> value to <em>6</em> .  Press the <em>Record</em> button on the track again to complete the recording. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/f94/e52/e4af94e527578b184b63008474bb83fd.gif"></div><br>  So we animate the lid of the chest so that it flew through the wall. <br><br>  Now you need to place Camera4 so that it is above the chest when the cover flies away.  We will repeat the same steps as for the previous camera, so I will not describe each action in detail. <br><br>  Set the Camera4 position <em>(X: -9.00, Y: 5.4, Z: 5.18)</em> .  Set Camera4 rotation <em>(X: 90, Y: 0, Z: 0)</em> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2d/9ee/bb5/e2d9eebb5e49796441b0c48b7599d3d2.png"></div><br>  As with all other added cameras, adding animation makes the scene more interesting, so you should zoom in on the camera after opening the chest. <br><br>  Select the <em>Timeline</em> window.  Drag GameObject <em>Camera4</em> into it and create an <em>Animation Track</em> .  Frame <em>389</em> for the track.  Click on <em>the Camera4 track</em> , and then click the <em>Record</em> button.  Select GameObject <em>Camera4</em> .  In the Transform field of the Inspector window, <em>set the X Position value to 0, and then -9 again</em> . <br><br>  In the <em>Timeline</em> window, drag the Animation Track to <em>frame 555</em> . <br><br>  Finally, set the Y Position of the <em>Camera4</em> object to <em>3.74</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/f94/e52/e4af94e527578b184b63008474bb83fd.gif"></div><br>  The scene is finally complete.  Click on <em>Play</em> and rate it! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af7/5c6/b3f/af75c6b3fbbe8e5e5ef322edb65b96d9.gif"></div><br><h2>  Manage complexity: grouping tracks </h2><br>  It was a short animation with just a couple of ‚Äúactors‚Äù, so it was quite easy for us to track game objects and tracks.  But when creating more complex scenes with lots of moving parts and actors, it becomes very difficult to control them.  That is why orderliness is very necessary.  Although the scene is ready, let's spend a few minutes organizing it - in the future, thank you for it. <br><br>  One way to organize work is to group tracks.  First, right-click under the tracks in <em>the Timeline window</em> and select <em>Track Group</em> .  Click on the Track Group and in the Inspector change its name to <em>Activations</em> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/376/e55/34c/376e5534cbfc44d8954cf55b63a908ac.gif"></div><br>  Repeat this process and create a Track Group called <em>Animations</em> .  Now the Timeline should look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/937/cf7/31c/937cf731c4247663201ede9c2e91cb80.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now drag all tracks with Active sections to </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Activations group</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and all the others to </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Animations group</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now you can open and close each group for the convenience of working with them:</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/376/e55/34c/376e5534cbfc44d8954cf55b63a908ac.gif"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not forget to save your work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sit back and direct yourself - you‚Äôve finished your first Timeline.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Where to go next </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you missed some parts of the tutorial, then do not forget that you can download both the workpiece and the finished project </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We did a good job and created a cutscene using model animations, camera changes and updates on the life cycles of objects, but there is still a lot to be learned. One of the most important aspects related to Timeline is creating your own scripts in which you can associate animations with code that can be executed with them.

If you have already mastered it well, then try adding a script to the scene after opening the treasure chest. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it is interesting to you to learn more about animations in Unity as a whole, then study our wonderful tutorial </font></font><a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/116652/introduction-unity-animation-system"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Introduction to Unity Animation</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To learn more about creating 3D models and about the Animation window, check out the detailed series of Unity tutorials presented </font></font><a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/animation"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And finally, if you are interested in creating games, you can purchase our </font></font><a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/unity-games-by-tutorials"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">book Unity Games By Tutorial</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It tells about the creation from scratch of four types of games with a detailed description of each stage of the process.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418035/</a></p>
