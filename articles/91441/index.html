Everything went well, it was a gift to a friend, checked-wrapped-paid-gone. <br><br>  After 16!  days from the date of purchase and 10 days of use the speaker has broken.  On the 17-18th day we arrived there and although we were 5 minutes from the force in the cold, when checking already in the cabin he didn‚Äôt want to turn on, the sellers denoted it as ‚Äúthe battery was cold‚Äù, we also doubted ‚Äúour phones are working, strangely‚Äù , stuck another battery earned, but there was no time for doubt, and signed an act of acceptance for repair.  12 days passed and he came from the SC (from Moscow !, they send everything to Moscow time, they don‚Äôt use local SC), the replacement of the entire front panel with the screen and the speaker itself were listed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He lay down for 3 days, then they threw all the info on him and started using it and all this time at home, -30 was, did not go anywhere))) We went to another city on a bus there was at least 15 degrees and there he disconnected for the first time (rebooted ), during the trip it was overloaded 15 times!  Then it became clear that this is a ‚Äúhome‚Äù cell phone, because it can work normally only at home, and even at home it was plugged in as described above. <br><br>  They wrote a claim for a refund or exchange, accepted.  Within the prescribed period, the answer was "hand over for examination."  They began to describe what the problem was, although it was described in the claim, they were described 3 times, first I was 2 times, then O_o's friend.  As a result, a deed of acceptance of the goods for repair was given for signing!, The question was asked why!  in the repair, in response, it was followed by ‚Äúthis is our standard procedure, diagnostics will be held there,‚Äù they were promised no more than 12 days, it was March 24th.

      After 12 days, the phone did not come, as well as after 20 days (the law gives a maximum of 20 days for examination and after that the penalty starts to tick 1% per day), called ‚Äúwhere is the phone?‚Äù, The answer itself asked for ‚Äúwhy are you fussing? after all, you are under warranty repair, wait up to 45 days, ‚ÄùI said,‚Äú what repair, they passed the examination, ‚Äùthey said,‚Äú we know nothing, you have repair, you signed, wait ‚Äù... then of course I got rid of it, but more about that later ... Today was in the department of consumer protection, well, they said the same thing, that it was not necessary to sign anything, I recognize my joint), so  they said that they had a lot of appeals to Nosimo, that their lawyer was not literate (or even tricky), you could go to court ... They recommended Euroset (‚ÄúAfter Chichvarkin left the place to work with them‚Äù), I they are not a fan at all and have never bought there themselves, and I don‚Äôt really like it, I like the Messenger to like, although my acquaintance also had a story (the standard use of the term ‚Äútechnically complex products is not subject to exchange and refund‚Äù) What do not consider advertising! <br><br>  In general, they promised to call themselves, but I decided to call myself, and first, in SC in Moscow time, they said that the phone had shipped 15 more.  They use DHL for delivery, so the phone had to come either 16 or 19 today, it seems to me that he came 16 more.  I called the salon ‚Äúthe phone came?‚Äù, ‚ÄúEh, what, what O_o‚Äù, ‚Äúemei #, March 24‚Äù, ‚Äúyes yes I did, I‚Äôll check where he is ... where is he ?, I can‚Äôt find something ... let's we will call you back "," well, let us know the phone, "in short, we did not call back, probably lost ... <br><br>  I wrote to the head office in Moscow time a letter, did not answer, a week has already passed. <br><br>  Summarizing: <br><br>  - When you first appeal, a lie about a frozen battery. <br><br>  - Not competent answer lawyer, the conditions specified there were not true. <br><br>  - Lies of the seller when accepting for "repair expertise." <br><br>  - I'm a fool that signed!  And they are even more that they use such terms as ‚Äústandard procedure‚Äù and ‚Äústandard acceptance act‚Äù. <br><br>  - Bad reviews about this office from the Consumer Protection Department, notice if there are a lot of calls (and they said a lot), it‚Äôs not clear what kind of product is there and where it came from, or how it was delivered and whether the storage conditions were met. <br><br>  - No customer-orientation, the letter was not answered and did not call when it arrived, that is, after the goods were pushed, nothing more needs to be done. <br><br>  - From 3 months, the phone type worked, like, normally, 3 weeks. <br><br>  These are the cakes (: Please note. <br><br>  The council was given "Our generation should always be on the alert, especially in a legal matter."
