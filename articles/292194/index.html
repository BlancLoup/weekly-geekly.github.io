And they are not quite sure whether this functionality will be really useful, or we will spend a month of development to make a ‚Äústillborn‚Äù child. <br><br><h3>  Actually, what is at stake </h3><br>  I started selling myself not so early - from the first year of university.  Since the name of my specialty sounded "commerce in metallurgy," I was eager to "fight" with great enthusiasm. <br><br>  Well, of course, I immediately ran into the ‚Äúcold‚Äù.

      What I just did not sell during my student days was business training, subscriptions to a business newspaper in a respectable publishing house, Canadian rubber for waterproofing roofs ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most interesting thing that I noticed was that <b>the</b> cold sales <b>process</b> <b>was</b> approximately the <b>same</b> : there was a sign with contacts of potential customers, where there were several columns: company name, phone, email, name of the decision maker (usually this column was empty), the result of communication, the next step. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82d/959/fc6/82d959fc6d0f464a8d516b9670b12b40.png"><br><br>  I called, voiced the essence of the question.  If the client was interested and said ‚Äúlet's consider your offer in more detail,‚Äù I wrote down his email, then manually sent a previously prepared commercial offer, substituting his full name.  The next day he called, clarified receipt and tried to "close" the deal. <br><br>  Pretty dull work, frankly.  What infuriated me most of all is to constantly redo the KP template, do a ‚Äúcopy-past‚Äù in the mail program and send the same to each new client.  It was especially stupid.  So I left it at the end of the work day. <br><br>  The last hour, when I didn‚Äôt really want to work, and it was a problem to get through to the decision makers (decision makers) - I was poisoning these letters.  It took me an <b>entire hour</b> .  If I did this during the day, it took even more time ‚Äî and the number of calls dropped. <br><br>  There were companies that had a CPM system implemented, and working out of the box very quickly (which is very expensive, as I now know).  Still, <b>I sent the letters manually</b> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/8c2/2f1/2fa8c22f196c43148a12fe49c38c6b72.png"><br><br>  A few years later, when we already had our own company, we turned to a call center for cold calling, I came across this again.  We were offered beautiful graphics, detailed statistics of calls, call records, a personal project manager - everything was very cool ... And they offered to send commercial offers by email for <b>3 rubles / pcs</b> .  And I, for some reason, suggested that for such a price <b>they also do it manually</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/fbd/181/0f7fbd181e544dcab00325a6c6abfc8c.png"><br><br>  The amount, of course, is small.  We had no more than 50 KP per day per operator, which in terms of a month is 50 * 20 = 1000 rubles.  But compared to the tariffs of other means of email marketing, the same mailchimp, it was much more expensive. <br><br>  And what if you don‚Äôt have a call center operator, but your own managers, and they, like me as a student, <b>spend 1 hour on the day of</b> their time <b>on</b> such a stupid and <b>routine operation</b> .  How much do you, as a manager, lose money because of this? <br><br><h3>  Therefore, we solved this problem </h3><br>  How? <br><br>  To the standard table (excel or docs.google), we connect our program.  It "parsits" this tablet every five minutes and finds all the lines in which the result is indicated: "KP". <br><br>  After that, it <b>automatically inserts the</b> data of this company (the name of the recipient, the email address) in a pre-prepared template <b>and sends it to the client</b> . <br><br>  That is, any client receives a commercial offer within <b>5 minutes</b> after the conversation.  Naturally, this has a positive effect on work efficiency. <br><br>  After the letter is sent, the system <b>tracks the receipt of the letter by the</b> client and its opening.  That is, if you see that your commercial client has not opened, it will be logical at the beginning of the next conversation to ask: ‚ÄúDid you manage to get acquainted with our commercial one?‚Äù. <br><br>  Another nice ‚Äúbonus‚Äù: before sending, the system <b>will check if you have written the email correctly</b> and will let you know if you made a mistake (well, you were simply told a non-existent address so that you can get rid of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c9/3a0/ab0/8c93a0ab0e714f969f1faaf4edc2ee73.png"><br><br>  This is the concept of the new functionality that we are going to introduce. <br><br>  I would like to hear if you thought about this problem when you organized your cold sales department or applied to a call center? <br><br>  Or, maybe, we invented this problem ourselves (start-ups often like to stew in their own juice) <br>  Thanks in advance for your comments and constructive criticism! <br><br>  PS If you are just starting to engage in cold sales, and you still do not have such "plates" - write - we will be happy to share. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292194/</a></p>
