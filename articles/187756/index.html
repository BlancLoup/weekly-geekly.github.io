  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel App Innovation Contest 2013 Contest. Win $ 20,000!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/intel/aic2013/">, the</a> international competition <a href="http://aic2013.intel.com/">Intel App Innovation Contest 2013</a> , or, to be more precise, its Russian part, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/intel/aic2013/">started</a> in the Habrahabr community.  From July 24 to November 20, we invite you to go from creating an idea to a Windows 8 Desktop application to its implementation.  The prize fund is considerable: $ 100,000 + additional prizes from the Russian Intel Developer Zone team.  There is something to fight for! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/077/a8a/a6f/077a8aa6f69cdfcac6ae986589c57bde.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Windows Desktop vs.  Windows store </h4><br>  Anticipating possible questions in the comments, I would like to immediately dot the i's.  Yes, in this contest we only accept desktop applications.  No, we are not ardent opponents of Windows UI.  The fact is that after the release of the new Windows 8 operating system, 2 myths were born in the programming circles: <br><ol><li>  In the desktop mode, it is impossible to implement support for all the new features of Windows 8, such as multitouch and sensors. </li><li>  Desktop application can not be published in the Windows Store, and accordingly, to earn on its sales. </li></ol><br>  We would like to debunk both myths.  Therefore, in this competition we suggest you to make sure in practice that in desktop applications you can implement support for touch gestures, sensors and a number of other functions and technologies that are not available in the Windows UI.  Publishing a desktop application in the Windows Store is also possible.

      There is an opinion that new interfaces are a necessity.  The future of touch devices, and the good old desktop sooner or later become obsolete.  Of course, users won't stop using desktop apps overnight, not everyone is ready for the revolutionary interface of Windows Store apps.  Windows 8 Desktop user applications are a pretty logical transition from previous OS to Windows UI.  A detailed comparison of the advantages of developing desktop and Windows UI applications, as well as supported technologies, can be found in the article <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/windows-8-store-vs-desktop-app-development">http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/windows-8-store-vs-desktop-app-development</a> <br><br><h4>  Briefly about the conditions of the competition </h4><br>  Competition applications are accepted on <a href="http://aic2013.csdn.net/">CSDN</a> , <a href="http://www.devworx.in/contests/intel-app-innovation-contest-2013">ThinkDigit</a> , <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/contests/AIC2013">Code Project</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/intel/aic2013/">Habrahabr</a> .  We strongly recommend sending applications through our Habr for the purpose of disinterested support for the status of the Russian community :) Good news: not only developers from Russia but also from Ukraine and Belarus can legally take part in the competition.  Even if you live in Germany, Great Britain or Israel, no one and nothing prevents you from sending an application in Russian via Habr. <br><br>  The competition itself is divided into two stages.  The first stage is preparatory - we accept only ideas.  Of all the ideas, the judges (at this stage, the Russian speakers) will choose the 125 best, whose authors go to the second stage and receive devices for development.  After receiving the device, you start developing a demo application based on the presented idea.  We collect your innovative applications and select 30 finalists who will compete for the main prizes. <br><br><h4>  $ 100,000 or one of the main motivators </h4><br>  To compete for the prize, 30 authors of the best demo applications will need to make an additional video clip in English.  This is necessary, since at this stage the panel of judges will be international, and judges who do not understand Russian or Chinese will have to understand and appreciate your great ideas. <br><br>  The author, who collected the maximum number of points on the basis of the results of the second stage and the additional task of creating a video, receives the <b>Main Prize of $ 20,000</b> .  The best apps will also be selected for the tablet, all-in-one and in each of the six contest categories. <br><br>  Total we get another 8 winners, who are <b>awarded a cash prize of $ 10,000</b> .  All 9 winners in addition to cash prizes also receive various marketing support from Intel and, of course, the honor and respect of the international developer community. <br><br><h4>  Do not bypass education - you are entitled to an additional reward. </h4><br>  This year, support for the education segment has become one of the priorities for Intel.  In the spring of this year, as part of a competition on the Intel Education Galaxy website, we received a large number of interesting ideas from experts and educators on what applications ( <a href="https://edugalaxy.intel.ru/%3Fportalid%3D24">https://edugalaxy.intel.ru/?portalid=24</a> ) are missing in their daily work. .  Perhaps some of them you can take as a basis for participation in our competition.  These ideas are already in demand in the market, so your product will not remain without users.  In addition, your application may receive an additional prize from the Intel Developer Zone and Intel Education Galaxy projects.  The authors of the best applications in 3 categories: visualization, constructors, learning through entertainment, will receive 100,000 rubles each.  or a package of advertising services for this amount, as well as marketing support for the Intel Education Galaxy project. <br><br><h4>  A motivator for a snack or 20 prizes the fastest and original </h4><br>  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is already ripening in your head, then hurry to arrange it visually - in text or graphic form.  20 authors of the best ideas who submitted the application before August 25 will receive a community award: HDD Seagate BackUp Plus.  In determining the winners, we will take into account the number of votes and comments from community members.  And in order to avoid possible cheating, we will definitely appreciate the originality of the idea itself. <br><br><h4>  Questions? </h4><br>  A lot of questions arose among ourselves in the process of preparing and localizing the competition.  Therefore, it is not surprising that even if you <a href="http://habrastorage.org/storage/stuff/special/Intel_AIC_2013.pdf">master the 30 pages of rules</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/intel/aic2013/faq/">carefully read the FAQ</a> , some points will remain incomprehensible.  We are ready to answer your question in any way convenient for you: <br><br>  On the forum: <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/aic-2013">software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/aic-2013</a> <br>  VKontakte: <a href="http://vk.com/intelsoftware">http://vk.com/intelsoftware</a> <br>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/intelsoftwareru">@intelsoftware</a> <br>  By email: <a href="">SWcontest@intel.com</a> <br>  And, of course, in the comments to this post. <br><br>  We are always in touch and will definitely support you all the way from the creation of an idea to its realization! <br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187756/</a></p>
