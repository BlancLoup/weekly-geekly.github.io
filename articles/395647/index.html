In accordance with the preliminary plans of the project managers, the start of testing is scheduled for early-mid-July, however, according to the requirements of Japanese law, the Green Ethics Committee should be given by Keio University Research Ethics Committee. <br><br>  At the stage of clinical trials, the effectiveness of the drug and its safety for the human body will be evaluated.  Studies of the newest drug, based on the substance of nicotinamide mononucleotide (nicotinamide mononucleotide, NMN), have already been tested on animals and demonstrated significant positive changes in the dynamics of the aging process.  It is reported that during testing, this drug will be administered to ten adult and healthy volunteer people. <br><br>  In the course of the experiments that have already been carried out, the research group, led by Gerontology expert Professor Shinichiro Imai from the University of Washington, was able to show that the substance NMN activates the genes responsible for the production of sirtuin protein, known for its rejuvenating effect on the body and called the ‚Äúelixir of youth‚Äù.  As shown by a series of experiments with laboratory mice conducted by a group of Professor Imai earlier, the sirtuin protein actually demonstrates the ability to push back age-related changes, manifested in a decrease in metabolism and vision.  And not only‚Ä¶

      <b>The results of the experiment with laboratory mice, more</b> <br><br>  In the course of their experiments, scientists investigated mice ‚Äúprogrammed to produce‚Äù sirtuin, while in some of the mice such overproduction occurred throughout the body, and in others only in certain tissues.  Here, scientists have come to a curious conclusion: as it turned out, in order to increase life expectancy, it is crucial that sirtuin be active in the brain area.  Interestingly, the increase in lifespan in this case was exactly the same as in normal mice hooked on a low-calorie diet.  But if the level of sirtuin in the brain increased, the mice could eat anything and anytime: their lifespan was extended anyway. <br><br>  Further studies showed that the lengthening of life was accompanied by a complex of physiological and behavioral features: the mice were more active at night (that is, when they were supposed to be active), their body temperature and the volume of oxygen consumed increased, their muscle tone improved, fell asleep faster and slept tighter.  Finally, these changes, as well as a tangible increase in the lifespan, were observed in both males and females.  According to Mr. Imai and his colleagues, the <i>longevity of females increased by 16%, in males - by 9%</i> .  If you correlate with a person's life expectancy, then, accordingly, a woman with such changes in the body may well live to be a hundred years old, and the average "minimum" for men, without much stress and diet, will reach eighty. <br><br>  Scientists also noted that in mice with a high content of sirtuin in the brain, the threshold for resistance to cancer was also higher.  As for the key issue - aging, here it is very important to note that a <i>shift in the moment of the start of the aging process</i> was recorded, but <i>its rhythm did not stretch in time</i> .  Simply put, aging itself did not slow down, but it started much later.  Subsequently, in this regard, sirtuin dubbed the "source of youth." <br><br>  The findings are only part of large-scale research, already completed by Imai and his group.  Researchers went further and tried to determine exactly which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain of mice responds to sirtuin most actively, postponing the aging process.  As a result of the search, it was found that such sites are hypothalamic dorsolateral and lateral nuclei (part of the brain that is most actively involved in regulating metabolism. The lateral hypothalamic nuclei are known to be regulators of eating behavior. neuropeptide hormones that, in turn, affect the metabolism and are involved in the regulation of the sleep and wake cycle. <br><br>  However, according to scientists, the <i>joint action of sirtuin and orexins</i> was the cause of stimulating the intense signals that the hypothalamus sends to the muscles.  These signals stimulate the physiological restructuring of muscle tissue, which changes its metabolism and slows down the aging process, manifested primarily in muscles. <br><br>  Of course, the fact of slowing down aging during the experiments was observed not only in the muscles, but also in relation to the whole physiological picture.  Thus, the Imai group provided very strong arguments that <i>the sirtuin protein and the aging process are interconnected in the most direct way</i> .  And now we need to find out whether a similar effect will be observed in relation to a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f2/178/960/1f21789604c7234c26dfcd6baaabfa36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The results of the first stage of clinical trials will allow scientists to answer the question whether the substance NMN is safe for humans.  In the absence of any side effects, researchers will be able to proceed to the main goal of the experiments: assessing whether the drug is destined to play the role of a long-awaited "elixir of youth" for humanity. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://www.the-japan-news.com/news/article/0003030620">The-japan-news.com</a></sub></i> <br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
