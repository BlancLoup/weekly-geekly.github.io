  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Update Inforza and monitoring of open tenders for digital services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  We haven't written about our main project, <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/">Inforza, for</a> quite a while (almost a year).  For a while, there was nothing much to write about - after the initial testing, we went deeper into refinements, rewrote the architecture, completed the new functionality - and it took almost eight months.  But in mid-July, we restarted already in combat mode, and last week we implemented a <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/tenders">new service for web studios and digital agencies</a> , which I wanted to tell you today. <br><br> <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/0f6/18a/7ef0f618a08a67fb992bba618b701549.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Recall for those who have already forgotten that Inforza is a b2b-exchange of applications for digital services.  Customers leave bids for the execution of a project, and agencies for the auction CPL-model can purchase them (get contact details).  Thus, for the customer, Inforza is a service of choosing the optimal agency, for studios, a new sales channel.

      So, what's interesting for the agency audience we have done in the past tense: <br><br><h4>  Launch of all major digital services verticals </h4><br>  If earlier Inforza accepted applications only for the creation of the site, then in mid-July we began to deliver applications to agencies for four more service verticals: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  contextual advertising </li><li>  Mobile Application Development </li><li>  Seo promotion </li><li>  SMM / PR </li></ul><br>  All applications are available at the <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/">agency site</a> and are divided into relevant segments.  Thus, now we are closing for the customer and agencies almost all the key areas of agency services on the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Monitoring of large public tenders </h4><br>  Just a few days ago, we launched a new service for studios / agencies - <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/tenders">monitoring open tenders</a> for digital services from major Russian companies. <br><br>  We have collected a base of the 350 largest companies in Russia, and twice a week we go through their sites and sections in which information on procurement and tenders is published, collecting the squeeze of everything related to digital: website creation and support, advertising, promotion, mobile application development , SMM, etc. Of course, we are looking at traditional sites like government procurement and other popular aggregators.  Of course, tenders with state purchases are more in the total mass than unique tenders found on official websites of non-state-owned companies, but they are the most interesting.  Thus, at the exit, we publish a complete picture of the most important major tenders that are held on the market. <br><br>  I quite often encountered in dealing with large customers such a situation - a really big tender was rolled out on the site, for example, to create a site, for several million rubles, the customer waits for the shaft of applications from agencies and a fair competition.  And one and a half cripples come.  The customer thought that the agencies were sitting on his website for days and nights waiting for news from the procurement committee.  And the agencies ... Well, they do not sit, in general, and they don‚Äôt see this tender in the eyes.  As a result, the customer has no one to choose (and he is obliged) and then he himself will be accused of unfair play and other tender joys. <br><br>  In general, <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/tenders">our monitoring service</a> - just so that such situations do not occur.  For current tenders (subscription), we take a small money - 1000 rubles.  per month, we publish updates older than a month in open access.  This is a really useful tool, and in the near future we plan to improve it - by expanding the base + of different filters, selections, etc. <br><br>  To understand the potential width of the channel - in today's update of the base, for example, 6 direct tenders from companies' sites and 28 tenders from public procurement and various tender sites were included. <br><br><h4>  Subcontract </h4><br>  In addition to all the above, we have a new category of applications for their own - subcontracting.  The section appears after authorization on the agency site.  In it, agencies place subcontract applications for other agencies.  Often there is a need to either perform some small task for which there are not enough resources (banner, text, icons) - or for a larger project for which agencies now do not have the necessary competencies (3d, augmented reality, SEO, anything else) . <br><br><h4>  How does Inforza </h4><br>  And finally, let us recall once again how Inforza works and what are its differences from traditional gates, tender platforms, and even more so, freelance exchanges: <br><br><ul><li>  Firstly, Inforza is a b2b project, the customer is not looking for freelancers, but an agency.  And we are the first project in this niche in RuNet, working in CPL mode. <br><br></li><li>  One of the important differences - we give contacts on the application in no more than 5 companies.  This means that the client will not have to dig out spam from hundreds of typical KPs, for which the studios spent less than 5 minutes of their time.  On the other hand, the agency knows that the contact did not hit a thousand competing companies - and it will work with it more effectively (after all, the potential efficiency is so much higher). <br><br></li><li>  Applications for Inforza are purchased by auction model.  This means that after the application is published, an auction is held on it - the agencies themselves choose which rate to make in order to get the customer's contacts (and how interesting the application is for them).  At the end of the auction, the contacts on the request are given to no more than 5 companies that have made the maximum bids (descending).  Thus, the system self-regulates - and the client receives feedback from the companies that were most interested in their project. <br><br></li><li>  If the bid was not bought at auction 5 times, it is archived - and it can be purchased instantly at the lowest price.  By the way, lead prices for us start at 50 rubles, which is less than the bids in contextual advertising per click on queries like ‚Äúwebsite creation‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  In spite of the fact that applications from individuals are published in our country - we are focused on b2b - and in the future the percentage of applications from private traders will decrease. </li></ul><br>  In our immediate plans for the development of Inforza, in addition to a heap of various pleasant trifles - a key update - the exchange of exchange of applications (we plan to release at the end of September), where agencies will be able to exchange applications from clients that they are not interested in or not relevant - for those that are interesting.  Stay on the line! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235183/</a></p>
