  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MGTU them. Bauman, Computer Systems and Networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I bring to your attention a note about the department "Computer Systems and Networks" (IU6) MSTU.  Bauman, which I finished three years ago.  Commented on the main subjects and the educational process in general.  He told something that is not said in the selection committee.  There is no doubt that in Baumanka there are very strong teachers, keeping up with the times, in whose lectures they are really interesting.  But, unfortunately, for the department IU6 is a rarity ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  General subjects </h4><br>  The fundamental base (mathematics, physics, theoretical foundations of electrical engineering, etc.) is given in full.  It depends on the teacher, but in general, the fundamental sciences are given at a high level. <br>  Two semesters of drawing.  I agree that the future engineer should have a basic concept of engineering graphics, but two semesters are brute force. <br>  Fundamentals of design devices.  Here, the device refers to a combination of gears and shafts.  Forcing them to do their homework according to the calculations of these shafts.  Has nothing to do with electronics and specialty.  It is not clear how this item got into the program at all. <br>  I am very pleased that there is no support for materials, materials science, and other unnecessary subjects for IT students (in MSTU, 90% of specialties are taught in mathematics). <br>  I don‚Äôt say anything about general humanitarian subjects, because the term ‚ÄúUniversity‚Äù means studying them. <br><br><h4>  Special items </h4><br><h5>  Algorithmic programming languages </h5><br>  Two semesters. <br>  First semester - Pascal.  I liked everything: structured and understandable. <br>  Second semester - C.  The teacher interfered with and with ++ in one heap, telling about cycles, functions, classes, virtual methods.  The fact that between these two languages ‚Äã‚Äãthere is a difference, said nothing.  The knowledge test is rather weak: the most difficult thing to do in the exam is to write a class A declaration code with two numeric fields, from which class B is inherited with one additional field. <br>  I consider it a big mistake to teach the basics of programming and talk about classes, but not to say anything about the basic principles of OOP and design patterns.  Other subjects that could give at least the basis of the PLO and programming culture are not provided in the curriculum. <br>  The study of classical algorithms and data structures (lists, trees, etc.) in the curriculum is also not the slightest hint.

      <br>
    <h5>  System Programming </h5><br>  Learning x86 assembler, a very useful course, because  It gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is behind each line of code in c / pascal. <br><br><h5>  Computer graphics </h5><br>  The teacher gives each drawing some flat figure (detail of the machine in the section, for example) with dimensioned dimensions.  It is necessary to write a script for the AutoCAD on AutoLisp, which will draw this figure. <br>  For comparison: in the second year of the VMS of Moscow State University, students were then asked to write pattern recognition and rendering of various scenes in directx / openGL in C ++. <br><br><h5>  Peripherals </h5><br>  1) LABA: tape drive, write a few bytes of information, read these bytes, see the signal from the magnetic head barely alive oscilloscope, which can not see anything, draw the waveform in the report and "draw conclusions" - the end point, which should be in any lab in every subject. <br>  2) at lectures I read fragments from selected last year's student essays under dictation, convinced us that we need to write down every word, because ‚ÄúBritish scientists have proved that with this approach it is better remembered‚Äù <br>  3) abstract.  The content is almost not checked, the necessary and sufficient requirements: the presence of the title page, table of contents and bibliography. <br><br><h5>  Information Security </h5><br>  1) 15 lectures in which the teacher gave, under dictation, excerpts from the legislation of the Russian Federation on commercial secrets, the creation of malicious software and other water that is being searched for in Google.  There was not a word about the security and encryption algorithms. <br>  2) Laba.  Choose an algorithm and write an encryption and decryption utility.  The similarity of the programs among students and the correctness of the work was not checked.  Only paper was translated by printing reports with the texts of the programs. <br><br><h5>  Scientific organization of engineering work </h5><br>  Half of the lectures are reading the dictates and regularly reminding them of the importance of observing them.  Especially killed a seminar in which a lecturer for an hour and a half dictated and showed examples of how to draw up a ‚Äúlist of sources of information used‚Äù at the end of a course student or homework. <br><br><h5>  Computer construction </h5><br>  1) Lectures were held at a wild pace, complex drawings and formulas were drawn at half-hour about water cooling, load calculation, etc. ... The teacher spoke 200 words per minute.  Record all unrealistic, but to understand the fragments even more difficult.  The list of recommended literature, in my opinion was too large to have time to master it for the exam for 1 semester. <br>  2) Exam.  You write the answer to the ticket, you approach the teacher, he silently reads it, then he takes the record book and puts the mark.  If a student understands what he wrote, but due to inattention in the formula, he missed a letter, then it does not matter to the teacher - minus point.  The five should be almost literally reproduce the material of the lecture.  Fortunately, the bachelor program in this subject was a test.  Only engineers passed the exam.  In my opinion, among those who did not write off, everyone got threes or lower.  The only five in the stream received a notorious Losers: because the content of the spur for this ticket was perfect. <br><br><h5>  Operating Systems </h5><br>  1) The lectures are quite interesting, mainly from the book of Tanenbaum. <br>  2) Labs were associated with Win98, for example: configuring an unattended installation of the system or studying the boot log (it was 2004). <br><br><h5>  Electronics </h5><br>  Fundamentals of semiconductor technology.  How transistors, amplifiers, generators, etc. work. Previously, this course was three semesters, then the plan changed and the course became one semester.  But the teacher did not reduce the amount of material, sent students to the books.  Questions for the exam, if memory serves, was about two hundred.  Even if you spend all your free time during the semester, you still can not manage to master. <br><br><h5>  Circuitry </h5><br>  Intermediate link between the transistor and arithmetic logic unit.  The material is read very accessible and understandable.  By the way: electronics, circuit design and the basics of building a computer are read by three different teachers. <br><br><h5>  Fundamentals of computer construction </h5><br>  1) 30 years ago, almost all blocks used delay lines that have not been used for a long time <br>  2) the exam requires a word-for-word answer, and the drawings must be isomorphic: if you came up with an "adder" more optimally than was said at the lecture - you get a deuce, because "I did not tell this, you do not know what an adder is !!! " <br>  3) a person who was developing firmware for large FPGAs went to this teacher to retake the exam several times. <br>  4) LABA: given the task to write a program for the microcontroller MK51, for example, calculating a * a + 3 * a + 5. It is conducted on the oldest stands, the program is driven into the microcontroller by means of hex-codes.  Those.  it is required not only to write a program, but to translate it according to a table from an assembler into instruction codes and enter it into memory by character.  One mistake for inattention - nothing will work and everything needs to be done anew. <br><br><h5>  Microprocessor systems </h5><br>  The material about microcontrollers is given in a structured and understandable manner.  Course projects are different for everyone, they change almost every year, and have a connection with reality.  Labs passed our stream on outdated stands, but I heard that new generations passed these labs on freshly purchased design kit-s with AVR microcontrollers, which is much more interesting and more pleasant. <br><br><h5>  Parallel computing systems </h5><br>  The idea is good to read such a course, but the implementation failed.  One had the impression that the lecturer who taught this course did not understand the subject.  I read it on the training manual, written by another person, was constantly mistaken.  The connectivity of the material was weak.  Students who were interested, figured out themselves and corrected the teacher during the lecture.  The exam grade was made up of personal sympathy and attendance.  There were people who were preparing for the exam, answered adequately, and the teacher put three, saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt correctly speak, everything is really not the case!‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Local and Global Networks </h5><br>  Here it was necessary to sign a list of visits to lectures. <br>  Those who skipped half the lectures, but learned everything, passed this exam very hard.  Even with the correct answer, the teacher shouted ‚Äúno, wrong‚Äù, and when asked to explain why, he continued ‚Äúyes, you don‚Äôt know anything at all, I will not talk about this topic‚Äù. <br>  With those who visited, it was different.  The real conversation of the teacher with the student who visited all the lectures: <br>  P: What is the speed of Fast Ethernet? <br>  S: yyyy ... I don't know <br>  P: What is the speed of Gigabit Ethernet? <br>  C: yyyy ... gigabit <br>  P: well done ... let's write, five <br><br><h5>  Corporate Networks </h5><br>  One of the few subjects where actual material is taught.  The volume is large, but this knowledge can really be useful to everyone.  It really came in handy when I set up a home network of 4 nodes, some of which had to go through a VPN with a British address. <br>  The exam has questions about how to configure various services (DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, etc.), and about the general principles of building corporate networks.  You need to answer in writing and in detail, describing each step of the settings.  Labs are interesting, you need to configure network services between several virtual machines. <br><br><h5>  Digital signal processing </h5><br>  Very interesting course.  The lecturer leads a department that deals with very interesting things and high-performance DSP-based systems. <br>  Laboratory work is carried out on modern design kit from Texas Instruments. <br><br><h4>  Bachelors State Exam </h4><br>  Writing.  Three subjects (operating systems, local area networks and circuitry).  Tickets were almost exactly the same as what was previously in the exams in these subjects (i.e., the volume of material in each subject did not decrease - in fact, three exams in one day).  Tickets issued for 10 days.  Only two people (one of them I) decided to pass this exam without cheating.  In one subject (network) I was given 3 points, because I wrote the answer in my own words, omitting things obvious to me.  The appeal put everything in its place, but there was an unpleasant aftertaste.  Those who found the correct answer in their spurs received a five. <br>  Interestingly, what did teachers expect from students when they were told about the triple exam in 10 days?  What will they take and learn, especially when in two weeks they need to defend a diploma? <br><br><h4>  On the educational process in general </h4><br>  - professors say ‚Äúwe teach you to learn, to acquire knowledge yourself,‚Äù although much of the exams boil down to the fact that you need to literally reproduce the material of the lecture.  If told in other words - you can get three. <br>  - it is better to get a deuce, because the dean's office allowed them to retake only three and fours only in exceptional cases: if in the last year you can see that a person could have a red diploma, but one triple interferes. <br>  - If you do your homework in good faith, then it takes an insane amount of time, and there is almost no time left to study something interesting.  Most of the proposed assignments and coursework do little to teach, except to go several times to the teacher and stand in line to show a draft. <br>  - As a rule, when handing over students and the homework of the teacher, the design, title page and exact observance of the guests in the text, formulas and drawings are most interesting.  GOST on the design of text documents has changed three times in the last 20 years.  Not every teacher followed the new guests, so often had to discuss with them on this topic, sometimes it was easier to do for the old guests. <br>  - the teachers are very oblique, some even with hatred, look at working students, especially if they could not attend some of his lectures or make curtains in time. <br>  - on many subjects, the present students sign in the visiting sheets.  Those who have gaps in a piece of paper (each lecturer has different ways, but an average of three or more), the teacher teaches a special purpose during the exam, even if a person has mastered two thick books on his own and answers correctly. <br>  - on most exams, no additional questions are asked, a well-written answer to a ticket question is probably 4 or 5. In other words, if the subject has not been taught, but has been well written off and made intelligent in front of the teacher, then you will get a good grade.  From the exceptions (where additional questions could drastically change the assessment) I remember only matan and the theoretical foundations of electrical engineering.  This I mean, the test of knowledge here, in my opinion, is weak.  One of the teachers of our department says "he asked additional questions earlier, but then he stopped, so as not to get upset once again." <br><br><h4>  Curiosities in the dean's office </h4><br>  - the classmate went on a two-year internship to France, after returning he had to complete his last year of study.  When he comes back from France, and comes to study in September, he will have a surprise: two years ago he went to the academy and did not return from it.  Someone confused something in the dean's office, working with papers.  In the end, he managed to recover, but at the cost of an incredible amount of nerves: to run with a pile of papers from the office to the office and to prove that it was not a camel, but the aunts were very nervous because they were torn off from solitaire. <br>  - one student had a troika in the first year, in the fourth he decided to retake it in order to receive a bachelor's degree.  Retake.  He was given a diploma with red crusts, but with a troika in the insert. <br>  - another in the middle of the third year was told that they would not be allowed to the session, because he had allegedly still not passed the exam for the first course - just some piece of paper was lost. <br>  - I understand that people are not iron and no one in the dean's office is immune from mistakes, but in my opinion, there were too many of them during our studies. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  In general, the article talks about the problems and shortcomings of the IU6 department, which, in my opinion, are much more than advantages. <br>  In no case do not want to insult Baumanka as a whole. <br>  Firstly, from conversations with students of the IU5 department, their curriculum seemed to me much more IT-intensive, besides, there is only one semester of drawing, they throw out the course of calculating shafts and gears and do not read the guests at lectures. <br>  Secondly, I do not have the slightest doubt that engineering specialties here are taught much better than IT. <br>  If I knew the truth about my department before entering, I would not go there. <br>  But it all depends on the person: someone can independently master programming while studying at a dairy college, and someone cannot take anything out of what they gave him at Moscow State University. <br>  No institution will provide a complete set of skills for good work, this is impossible: in any case, you will have to complete your education. <br>  I am not against obsolete subjects that constitute the basics, but I am convinced that the university should encourage the student to strive to gain new knowledge and experience while working, and not to put obstacles in, punishing missed lectures with a bad grade. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90355/</a></p>
