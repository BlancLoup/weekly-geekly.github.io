  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MitoQ - wonderful pills from old age, we investigate whether to take</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/6l/0v/ys6l0v4qtdt9sv7z9cjhrbccygm.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Recently, intensive studies of the mechanisms of aging are underway.  One of the current theories, which finds a lot of evidence, is that many of the mechanisms of aging are associated with oxidative stress, which is caused by mitochondrial malfunctions. <br>  Many authorities around this subject recommend, from a certain age, to take coenzyme Q10, in order to reduce tissue damage caused by these processes. </p><br><p>  At the same time, one of the theories states that if such an antioxidant is delivered directly to the mitochondria, the doses will be less, and the effect will be better ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/295207/">read the previous article for more details</a> ). </p><br><p>  And so, an antioxidant appeared on the market, which is delivered directly to the mitochondria - MitoQ.  In this article we will conduct your mini-study - whether to buy it and accept it. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In our telegram channel <a href="https://lifext.ru/tg">t.me/lifext</a> or <a href="https://vk.com/lifextru">Vkontakte,</a> we analyzed several key studies of this drug in detail.  Here is a summary review and conclusion. </p><br><p>  The goal of our research is to understand whether to start taking it.  Is it safe, does it give the effects that we are looking for (prevention of signs of aging - peppy brain and body up to 90+). </p><br><h2 id="itak-po-punktam">  So, the points: </h2><br><p>  (reservation, all articles and studies are taken only from reputable publications and sites, 90% of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">site</a> ) </p><br><p>  <strong>1. The first article, 2014</strong> , which well describes the research conducted by this drug is called ‚ÄúAnimal and human studies with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ.‚Äù <br>  It says that MitoQ has already been studied quite well and, at the time of this writing, a series of experiments on animals and people was conducted.  Based on the results of animal studies, it can be concluded that the drug can be used as protection against pathological changes in humans.  Two studies have been conducted on humans: <br>  1.1.  The first study tested the suggestion that the symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease could be alleviated.  MitoQ was given in doses of 40 mg, 80 mg, and placebo for a year.  No improvements were noticed.  The researchers themselves suggested that with the development of Parkinson's disease, damage to the neurons had already occurred and that the fate of the remaining ones was also programmed and therefore, at this stage, the drug did not work. <br>  1.2. The second study examined patients with hepatitis C. There were also three groups of 40 mg, 80 mg, and placebo.  Both groups who were given the drug showed a significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (this is good) and the drug can protect the liver from destruction in this disease. <br>  CONCLUSION: Both studies have shown that the medicine can be used for treatment and does not have serious side effects (patients in the first study took it for 1 year). </p><br><p>  <strong>2. The second article, October 2016,</strong> ‚ÄúThe mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ modulates oxidative stress, inflammation and diabetes patients‚Äù - a study of how MitoQ affects patients with type 2 diabetes.  The study found that MitoQ: <br>  2.1.  regulates inflammation <br>  2.2.  regulates oxidative stress (increased level of reactive oxygen species) <br>  2.3.  regulate the interaction of leukocytes with endothelium (the layer lining all our vessels and heart cavities, our largest organ) <br>  The connection of this article with our research is that it contains a lot of data about this medicine + in the modern world a large% of people are at risk of diabetes. <br>  The study was conducted in terms of in vitro (outside the body of patients, unlike in vivo - this is when experiments on people or animals). <br>  Extract from results: <br>  2.1.  the level of oxidative stress decreased in patients and there was no change in normal samples (good) <br>  2.2.  leukocyte interaction with endothelium improved in patients and did not change in healthy specimens (good).  Who cares, the <a href="https://goo.gl/Rjf7wf">endothelium</a> is a layer of cells lining our vessels and being our largest organ. <br>  2.3.  an anti-inflammatory effect in patients and a lack of effect in healthy samples was also recorded (good) <br>  Also, researchers note that according to this and their previous studies, they believe that mitochondrial antioxidants can regulate oxidative stress and produce positive effects for type 2 diabetes. <br>  They note that they chose MitoQ because it can be used for in vivo research (in living organisms) and it has no toxic effects. </p><br><p>  <strong>3. A third study from 2013</strong> called Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoQ) improves age-related endothelial dysfunction in mice. <br>  As a result, the study showed very optimistic results: <br>  3.1.  MitoQ has launched an age-dependent decrease in the function of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, that is, they could again expand normally <br>  3.2.  MitoQ restored the bioavailability of nitric oxide in old mice, removing the root cause of dysfunction <br>  3.3.  MitoQ improves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_ROS">mitochondrial</a> resistance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_ROS">oxidation</a> in the arteries of old mice. <br>  A note from a Lifext team researcher for those who don‚Äôt like to wait - experiments on mice do not yet mean that you need to buy MitoQ and it will have such an effect on you - very different dosages in experiments and in selling drugs. </p><br><p>  <strong>4. The August 2016 study</strong> "Long-term administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant stimulation of skeletal muscle" on how MitoQ affects on the loss of muscle mass in old mice, which correspond in age to 80 year old people.  The result was negative - oxidative stress did not decrease, DNA damage continued, muscle loss remained the same. </p><br><p>  <strong>5. The 2017 article</strong> ‚ÄúEvidence of Oxidative Stress and Secondary Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Metabolic and Non-Metabolic Disorders‚Äù examines various studies in detail and gives a conclusion: ‚ÄúThe cell has different variants of protective systems against oxidation, however, during different pathologies the system is overloaded, which leads to disruption of the cells and, as a result, organ dysfunction.  Appropriate antioxidants can play an important role in treatment, with the need to create protocols for their use, which are not yet available. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  <strong>6. About 20-30 more articles ...</strong> </p><br><h2 id="delaem-vyvody">  Draw conclusions </h2><br><ol><li>  You can see that all studies where MitoQ affects something positively are associated with any diseases. </li><li>  The manufacturer on the site sells doses of 5 mg.  and recommends taking 2 pcs.  Why is that?  I do not know, but most likely it is somehow connected with the laws that in doses of 5 mg, for example, something does not need to be registered or not responsible or something else like that.  Most likely, such a dose does not seem to work and it can be sold without research.  (I stress, I'm not sure) </li><li>  In studies, patients were usually given a dose of 40 mg.  daily. </li><li>  No study has conducted tests on healthy people with the control of many parameters. </li></ol><br><h2 id="vyvod-na-dannyy-moment">  CONCLUSION AT THIS MOMENT </h2><br><p>  Receiving MitoQ for a conditionally healthy person, in order to increase life expectancy, is not yet appropriate.  There is no understanding of how the drug acts in the long run, what doses are needed for what body mass.  If you or your loved ones are ill with something that MitoQ can potentially help, then before making a decision, I recommend conducting additional in-depth studies of the issue. </p><br><h2 id="buduschee">  Future </h2><br><p>  Research on this antioxidant is in full swing.  If Google dials search site ncbi for 2017 <a href="https://goo.gl/NJD4t7">https://goo.gl/NJD4t7</a> then we get 11 pages of results. <br>  Therefore, it is hoped that in the next year or two we will be able to reasonably understand whether it can be used for therapeutic purposes, in what doses, whether it will actually slow down aging.  Most likely, when they find out for sure, the production will become more massive and prices will fall.  Plus, the recommended dosages will be known.  (some advertising - on our telegram channel and on Geektimes there will be news about it, and in our application too) </p><br><h2 id="skoro">  Soon. </h2><br><p>  In the United States, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02597023">studies</a> registered on the state website are already underway - ‚ÄúEfficiency of oral MitoQ oral intake to improve health in middle and old age‚Äù.  The results promise in August 2018, the research itself is already in progress - it began in November 2015, the latest updates were in October 2017. </p><br><p>  So, you need to wait a bit and for now monitor the progress, how we will help you - review articles will be published on Geektimes + a continuous stream of fresh information about research on how to extend your life in the telegram <a href="https://lifext.ru/tg">t.me/lifext</a> channel <a href="https://lifext.ru/tg"><br></a>  or <a href="https://vk.com/lifextru">Vkontakte</a> </p><br><p> The Lifext ship continues its infinite voyage through the universe, all discoveries and explorations are left in our <a href="https://vk.com/lifextru">VK</a> + <a href="https://lifext.ru/tg">Telegram</a> channels. </p><br><h2 id="esche-stati-v-temu">  More related articles </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292291/">Life extension, part 1 - Brain Health</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292609/">Life extension, part 0.1 - Brain and body health over the long term</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.com/company/lifext/blog/298199/">Meditation - the ancient hacking of reality in modern times</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/295207/">Life extension, part 3 - Modern views on the aging process</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/295715/">Life extension - 4.
