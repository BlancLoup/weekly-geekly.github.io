Today we will talk about a portable wireless speaker Monoprice High Performance Bike.  As you might guess from the title, the column is designed to be attached to the handlebars of the bicycle, but nobody prohibits its use as a regular portable speaker for listening to your favorite music, because this little one is capable of an incredibly powerful sound, despite its size. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently there are not many speakers adapted for cycling on the market.  These are mainly low-quality tweeters with low power, winning customer loyalty with a bunch of various additional options from flashlight to FM radio, in general, everything is in the spirit of Chinese ‚Äúconsumer goods‚Äù.

      The developers of Monoprice approached the question of creating a Monoprice High Performance Bike column, as always, from the perspective of "sound and design, everything else is not important."  The column was made in the shape of a bicycle helmet with an expanding resonator chamber, which boosts sound and bass. <br><br>  <b>Packaging:</b> <br>  Monoprice High Performance Bike Portable Bluetooth Column with bike holder comes in a regular cardboard box with dimensions of 12x8x16 cm and a total weight of 330 g. On the front side of the box you can see the column itself through transparent soft plastic, so the potential buyer can estimate the size and have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãappearance . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dab/a7a/612/daba7a6124e9415ea1a542459c61d5c6.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Contents of delivery:</b> <br>  The kit itself includes a Monoprice Bike Bluetooth speaker, a bike mount, a 3.5 mm AUX wire and a microUSB cable for charging.  For some reason, the manufacturer did not think about the case, although for this class of column it would be an extra element that would only increase the cost. <br><br>  Cords on the quality of workmanship is quite simple.  Braid - the traditional black soft plastic.  The plug for AUX has no gold plating, which in this case has no meaning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecc/471/fc6/ecc471fc605e44aaa5645f6b7fc47baf.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Body, material and shape:</b> <br>  Now directly about the Monoprice High Performance Bike itself.  Made in the form of a bicycle helmet, in my opinion, very themed and stylish.  The size of the column is 6x9x4 cm and weighs only 120 g. <br>  Made of plastic with a shockproof, waterproof and matte surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51d/4f3/838/51d4f3838706433ea38dd41dcde95fe3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/6e3/52b/8f56e352b2a94fe9946d0230ecc8d760.jpg"><br><br>  When turning the upper part of the speaker, the resonant chamber opens.  The shell of the chamber is made of rubberized soft plastic in the form of a spring with moisture-proof properties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/28a/5d0/4fb28a5d047143d39f7118fc1aa42a38.JPG"><br><br>  On the bottom of the column there are three rubber pads to reduce vibration with the surface when listening to music, for example, if you use the column at home or in the office. <br><br>  <b>Mounting:</b> <br>  The mount is made of solid polyurethane plastic, but not rigid, which contributes to the tight clamping of the column.  The fastener is secured with a rubber gasket to avoid slipping directly on the steering wheel.  The mount itself can rotate around its axis, so you can choose a comfortable position for control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/258/763/74925876385546f3b7f31b692aa1926d.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Sound:</b> <br>  The speaker has one 40mm speaker.  Each Monoprice product has its own chip, in this column it is an additional resonator chamber (patented technology Vacuum-bass system), which increases the sound power and gives it more low frequencies.  I tested the speaker during my entire workout on the bike, I can say for sure that I heard no complaints from the sound, I didn‚Äôt even have to set the full volume.  Bass is enough, considering that during the ride I prefer to listen to music like Linkin Park or something in the genre of House. <br><br>  <i>Main settings:</i> <br><ul><li>  Frequency range: 220Hz-16kHz </li><li>  Sensitivity (sound pressure): at least 80 dB </li><li>  Power: 4 W </li><li>  Recommended temperature range: 0 to + 40 ¬∞  </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Hands-free and buttons:</b> <br>  A great idea that the developers have combined the speaker button with the activation of Bluetooth wireless.  The remaining four buttons are located on the side panels: on the one hand - volume control, on the other - reception and hang up call.  All buttons are conveniently located and easily detected, which is certainly important while driving. <br>  The Monoprice High Performance speaker Bike is equipped with a microphone and supports the HPF profile (Hands-Free Profile) for connecting to a phone and a smartphone.  To my surprise, the quality of my voice transmission turned out to be quite good, i.e.  there were no squeaks, interruptions, etc.  Stable voice, but with a slight loss of volume, judging by the recall of my interlocutor.  Given that even expensive top-end portable speakers are sinning with a weak speakerphone, the speakerphone function is implemented at a decent level in this device. <br><br>  <b>Speaker Connections and Power:</b> <br>  The speaker connects to the phone, smartphone, and any other device over the Bluetooth 3.0 wireless connection - this is one of the latest versions that supports data rates up to 24 Mbps, i.e.  This is comparable to the speed of Wi-Fi networks.  Wireless communication is stable and the range of up to 8 meters, leaving the next room, the connection is not interrupted. <br><br>  Also implemented the ability to connect any audio source that does not support Bluetooth using a cable via AUX. <br><br>  Thanks to one (but powerful dynamics), a unique design with a resonator camera and an improved version of Bluetooth 3.0, the developers were able to achieve autonomous column work for more than 8 hours, which is very worthy for such a ‚Äúcrumb‚Äù. <br><br>  Charging takes place via USB-microUSB cable for only 2-3 hours.  It will not be superfluous to remind you, and this applies to any batteries in general, in order to prolong the battery life the first three times after full discharge it is very important to charge at least 12 hours. <br><br>  <b>Price and warranty period:</b> <br>  For availability and price can be found on our website <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">link</a> <br>  On all models Monoprice manufacturer provides a warranty of 12 months. <br><br>  <b>Comparison table:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/128/268/a3112826867a4cc8956335a753a7c491.png"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  The Monoprice High Performance Bike column impressed me that, with such miniature sizes, it can produce a relatively decent sound, which cannot be said about my previous column, which I ordered from the well-known Chinese store.  I liked the design, which absolutely fit into my bike.  Also did not expect that in such a small size, you can place a sufficiently capacious battery.  I use the column not only when riding a bicycle, it is constantly with me in my backpack when traveling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/290/b21/b25290b21548452e9cd9ed0485120cbf.JPG"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367125/</a></p>
