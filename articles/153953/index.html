I think the conversation was quite interesting. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSZn4diVwWM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhj8m04yyqITZvah6wywwPL6mqDDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúI understand that this is another voice crying in the desert, but since October 10 we celebrate the day of mental health, I really want to, as a professional with great experience, tell those who want to watch this video that the policy of total prohibitions is not able to society and man to the state of mental health. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In our country there is some familiar perverted view of things: if any problem bothers us, then it should just be banned and forgotten about it.  Although in reality nothing good ever came of it.  Moreover, we lived in a totalitarian society built on prohibitions, and it would seem that we should be perfectly aware of this. <br>  I do not in any way object to the law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health development.  The whole trouble is in the following: in order for such a law to be passed, we must first adopt a single law on information that benefits the child.  We have to say, here are dear parents, there is a huge amount of information that benefits a child.  This information can be taken there somewhere, there and there.  And now, when you know where to get it, we can safely ban malicious sites on the Internet and much more too.

In order to prohibit, for example, children, as they are now trying to make access to wifi in public places, in fact, prohibit any mobile communication - first something must happen in these public places so that the child is interested and that he does not need this wifi communication in public places.  Otherwise, we again and again run into abuse. <br><br>  In our country, no one, I‚Äôm not even having power, I‚Äôm talking about the overwhelming majority of our population, in our country it is impossible to explain to anyone that it is impossible to defeat ‚Äúbad‚Äù American cinema.  For the simple reason that it is viewed, it is of interest, it is done professionally.  To win the American cinema ban is impossible.  As it seems to everyone, according to jokes published in the press: thanks to tsiferkam, set in the corner of the screen, children understand what they need to watch.  It starts at 16+ ... <br><br>  It is possible to defeat American cinema, and even malicious websites on the Internet, in only one way - by creating your own movie, which will be watched by a smaller number of young people and, by the way, the Soviet Union did it perfectly. <br><br>  To defeat harmful sites on the network, you can only create useful and interesting.  Since the modern information space can not be made sterile.  It is impossible, why do we time ourselves? .. <br><br>  I can not even imagine how many drug addicts and suicides will appear on the streets, if the grand social networks, or some Youtube will be thoughtlessly closed due to some kind of semi-deliberate reason.  Since these are the areas in which young people, stupidly and absurdly, they are trying to realize their own creative potential, and if they do it stupidly, then that means WE DIDN'T teach them THEIR DAMMIN! .. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/625/b36/662/625b36662ae2bd184882efefcc855206.jpg">  It seems that RosPotrebNadzor, the Ministry of Communications or someone else, making laws, cancels the laws of teenage psychology.  Doesn‚Äôt anyone, or a teacher with a higher education, know that the main reaction of adolescence is to hear what an adult will say and do the opposite.  So why do we provoke a whole generation? <br>  I'm just a doctor who communicates a lot with young people.  Honestly, probably since the beginning of the 90s I have not heard SO MANY conversations about emigration.  It seems that the generation of up to 30 years, there is only one thought - to leave this country to hell.  Is this what we call mental health? ... ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153953/</a></p>
