      And now, when you have verified your answers, let's summarize: <br><br>  - 3 matches.  You have a standard patterned thinking.  The vast majority of your ideas have already been implemented by someone. <br>  - 2 matches.  There is the likelihood of having creativity.  Among your ideas can come across fresh and promising. <br>  - 1 match  I am ready to buy your ideas.  Write to me! <br>  - 0 matches.  Take me to work!  I want to learn from you! <br><br>  Now, let's finally analyze some myths about ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Myth number 1.</b>  <b>Ideas are worth something.</b> <br><br>  From this myth grow the legs of the desire to sell their idea.  But what's funny, for some reason, no one allows for the thought of buying someone else's ideas. <br><br>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãin the ordinary sense of the idea does not carry.  First, the idea may arise in the mind of several people at the same time.  Secondly, the idea itself, like any other thought or piece of text, does not create any material value. <br><br>  Maybe then something worth action with this idea?  Not again.  You can vainly and fruitlessly implement the idea for at least a decade, but until you achieve a result, no one will give you money. <br><br>  So something is worth only the result of actions to implement the idea!  Or the place where ideas grow from - your head (let's hope for the best). <br><br>  So what to do with your ideas, which we do not yet know how to implement, or do not want, or do not have enough resources? <br><br>  I offer to exchange them: ‚ÄúIf you have an apple and I have an apple, and if we exchange these apples, then you and I will have one apple each.  And if you have an idea and I have an idea and we will exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. ‚Äù <br><br>  And out of a few standard ideas, a good, powerful and not banal idea can grow from you.  A successful business consists of hundreds (!) Of ideas, besides, they must be properly combined.  A good song, too, as a rule, contains several components in a precisely measured ratio.  This also applies to everything else: programs, devices, books, etc. <br><br>  <b>Myth number 2.</b>  <b>My idea is stolen.</b> <br><br>  Everything has been stolen before us. <br><br>  Since ideas are not values ‚Äã‚Äãwithout a carrier (the head that has invented or can realize it), then there is no point in talking about the theft of the idea. <br><br>  But the fact that you were the first to declare your idea can give you both moral satisfaction from the realization that you were at the forefront of progress, and a significant advantage in court during a possible ‚Äúpatent litigation‚Äù, if it comes to that. <br><br>  And considering that you have not yet implemented it (otherwise it would have been no longer an idea, but a finished product), then most likely you do not know how to do it with the resources at your disposal (time, money, connections, skills, knowledge).  It is possible that by inspiring your ideas around you, you will receive valuable feedback or help with resources, you will find like-minded people. <br><br>  <b>Myth number 3.</b>  <b>All I really need is a good idea.</b> <br><br>  My favorite myth.  Ok, go to <a href="http://eurecable.com/">eurecable.com</a> , there are currently at least two dozen excellent business ideas already posted there.  Choose any and implement.  It's free! <br><br>  Are you still here? <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  Pushkin, chicken, apple. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394115/</a></p>
