A fun experience, I tell you. <br><br>  A dream means to me that I sit, I read Habr.  Articles are all sensible, comments to them.  I stumbled upon an interesting material, read it out - do not tear it away from the screen.  And then the advertisement took to pop up before the text.  Flashing annoying, such on the cutting sites in bulk.  Scrolling the text does not help, it still creeps.  And hangs a couple of seconds - a cross appears, so that you can close it.  Here one appeared, closed, second, third ... On the nth, as it turned out, for the sixth time, I can‚Äôt close the advertisement - the cross does not appear.  I tried to finish reading the article both there and there. <br><br>  I got angry and woke up.  With the phone in hand.  He screamed, trying in vain to wake me up.  I angrily poked the ‚ÄúSnooze‚Äù button to delay the wakeup for another five minutes.  And I can postpone the alarm just five times.

      The day began to be fun and I was in a great mood all day.  In the evening I visited <a name="habracut"></a>  think.  And persistently demands that I think it. <br><br>  And the idea that it would be interesting, and most importantly - advantageous to create an advertising platform that would allow you to push advertising in a dream.  And so that if you do not pay the money, it was impossible to disconnect. <br><br>  Here the startup will immediately emerge.  The service, using which, people could order their dreams.  This is how to take, register, fill out your profile and start inventing your own dreams.  Fantasy, extreme, adult, education, travel, earnings in a dream (!) And the like.  Who is enough fantasy. <br><br>  You only need to describe your night adventures and specify the date of the show.  And that group dreams were.  And comments.  Hehe, look at yourself dreaming with your friends and then a troll climbs and yells: ‚ÄúFirstday!‚Äù.  Social network, however.  But these are all details.  Do not be distracted, back to advertising. <br><br>  This sleepy service will be nominally free.  But, of course, with advertising.  So the user is watching a dream.  Let him sleep will be about traveling, to rest.  By plane.  Here our mechanism turns on in the process, and for a long time it generates events in a dream that prevent a successful flight.  It is impossible to get tickets, the flight is delayed, the staff is rude, the plane is not operational, and there are no troubles.  And at the moment of extreme despair, when the rest is almost disrupted, an irresistible representative of a certain airline company turns up.  She immediately solves all his problems.  He gets a ticket to a great ship for the best places, away from the engines and free drinks on board. <br>  Rest saved, the flight was a success.  Then the user watches the ordered dream.  But the positive image of the airline firmly stays in the head of the beholder.  Where is it closer to the subconscious of a person, if not from a dream? <br><br>  That in the ordered dream there were no such troubles or any advertising actively influencing the dream, the user could turn it off.  For money. <br><br>  And if on trifles, then all objects of the environment appearing in a dream can be paid for by advertisers: from the car to the toothbrush. <br><br>  Here is a startup!  Success and monetization - guaranteed.  Well, we wait, while technologies will be tightened. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40795/</a></p>
