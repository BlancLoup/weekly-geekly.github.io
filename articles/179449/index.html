They are not going to provide services at all.  Work work and okay. <br><br>  Others start to bother, but they start to fence various complex catalogs of IT services, from which the customer is not only no better, but perhaps a headache is added. <br><br>  The answer is really under the nose, you just need to carefully read.

    <h4>  RTFM </h4><br>  The trouble is that the answer is not in ISO 20000 ( <a href="http://www.klubok.net/Downloads-index-req-viewdownloaddetails-lid-399.html">download</a> ), but in ISO 9000 ( <a href="http://casepress.org/iso-9000-2008-osnovny-e-polozheniya-i-slovar/">download</a> ).  Slightly different standard, but which is more general.  One could even say that ISO 20,000 is a descendant of ISO 9000 in terms of IT. <br><br>  So, if you open ISO 9000, then we can find clause 3.4.2 there, which describes the term ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù.  A product can be both a product and a service. <br><br>  And if you read a little further, to note number 2, we will see another interesting idea ... it turns out the services are also different: <br><br>  2 The service is the result of at least one action that is necessarily carried out in the interaction of the supplier (3.3.6) and the consumer (3.3.5), and, as a rule, is intangible.  The provision of a service may include, for example, the following: <br><br>  2.1.  the activity carried out on the material products supplied by the consumer (for example, repairing a faulty car); <br><br>  2.2.  activities carried out on the intangible products supplied by the consumer (for example, drawing up a statement of income required to determine the amount of tax); <br><br>  2.3.  the provision of intangible products (for example, information in the sense of knowledge transfer); <br><br>  2.4.  creating favorable conditions for consumers (for example, in hotels and restaurants). <br><br>  This at least means a different understanding principle for different IT services. <br><br><h4>  Examples </h4><br>  Consider an example of a list of IT services for an average organization: <br><br>  <b>1. Computer software</b> <br><br>  1.1.  This is a type 2.1 service.  The user has his computer (his because this is the equipment for which the employee is responsible, like a car), he can break down and if the equipment breaks, then it is subject to repair. <br><br>  1.2.  As a rule, 2-3 system administrators are involved here.  According to established customs, these guys are considered super-capable and along with computers they often get microwaves, teapots, as well as deal with e-mail, Word, Excel and other computer-related topics.  As such, there is no understanding of the product.  It may appear with the growth of the IT department. <br><br>  1.3.  Another feature.  There is usually only one process.  This is exactly the case when IT service = IT process.  Typically, this process is called "Technical Support". <br><br>  <b>2. Accounting system (financial, accounting, management, etc.)</b> <br><br>  2.1.  For example, take the service "1C Accounting 8.2 ‚Ä≥.  This is not a type 2.1 service. This is a type 2.4 service.  "Creating an enabling environment."  Yes, you can argue with this and say that it is 2.3, but then you should not be surprised when conflicts and user discontent arise. <br><br>  2.2.  Here, as a rule, software developers of various calibers are involved.  There already appears the concept of the product, in the terminology of SCRUM.  Yes, and different techniques appear type SCRUM, Agile ... <br><br>  2.3.  The techniques appear for a reason, but because this IT service already consists of many IT processes, with a light hand, you can count 4: technical support, software change, release management, project management.  Yes, not all of these processes are set, but this is a separate topic for communication. <br><br>  <b>3. SaaS type knowledge base</b> <br><br>  3.1.  This service can be attributed to paragraph 2.3. <br><br>  3.2.  Here, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the IT department is limited only by the timely extension of the subscription to the SaaS and the moderation of the knowledge base within the technical support. <br><br>  3.3.  There may be no specialists at all, because  they are all included in the cost of SaaS, and may be, but the main processes still circulate on the supplier‚Äôs side; <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Conclusions that were made after the implementation of this structure: <br>  1. IT service is not the same as IT process <br>  2. Effectively, when for each IT service there is a department and a product. <br>  3. With such a structure and with a normal ITSM application, it is very easy to see the costs and quality of any IT service. <br><br>  If there are comments, questions - welcome in comments </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179449/</a></p>
