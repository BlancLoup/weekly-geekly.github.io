It was said that the party on the occasion of the start of sales, organized by the corporation, was worth more than the revenue from the sales of these devices, and that the devices were generally removed from the stores.  As a possible reason for the unsuccessful campaign, there was a mandatory contract for Internet traffic from Verizon. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In general, there is an explanation for this - after all, smartphones were created as mobile "cloud" devices, where user information was immediately transferred to the "cloud" from Microsoft.  Such data included information from social networks, and photos from the video taken by the device owners.  It may well be that the devices were created a little out of time, because not all users understand what a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù is and why it is needed at all.  Yes, and a binding contract for communication services is also somehow not happy.

      In general, these devices, as they say, did not go, fewer than ten thousand units of smartphones were sold, which is nothing in the USA. <br><br>  Apparently, smartphones were still released a decent amount, because Microsoft is going to sell them again, along with the same company Verizon.  But this time without cloud technologies, smartphones will even be sold with the m index, which will mean the lack of basic functions of interaction with the Microsoft cloud.  There will be no Loop start menu, where information from social networks was displayed, which was constantly updated. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that these devices went on sale in May of this year, and already in June, the sale program was curtailed, and Microsoft Kin disappeared from sale.  Let's see how the new attempt by Microsoft to develop their smartphones will develop.  Personally, I really like the packaging in which these gadgets are implemented - that the first model, that the second.  And the device is nothing, both in functionality and in appearance.  Of course, the "cloud" feature was implemented a bit early - perhaps Microsoft just hurried.  But without it, the device is quite usable, so to speak. <br><br>  I wonder if there will be a large-scale marketing campaign from Microsoft this time?  Probably, if there will be, then such a campaign will be much more modest than the previous one.  Any parties with a budget of several hundred thousand dollars will definitely not be held. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.ppcgeeks.com/2010/11/11/q4-road-map-leaked-from-verizon/">ppcgeeks.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108043/</a></p>
