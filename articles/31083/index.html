    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Be creative with Scratch </h3><br>  Today, people have access, from their computers, to an incredibly large number of interactive games, stories, animations, simulations, and other types of <strong>dynamic, interactive data</strong> .  But for most, these programs are one-sided ‚Äî you can only view and click what others have done;  you cannot design and create your own piece. <br>  <strong>Scratch</strong> changes the situation, expanding the possibilities of design on a computer, making it possible to easily combine graphics, photos, sounds and music in interactive content.  With Scratch you can create a character who dances, sings and interacts with others.  Or create an image that spins, rotates and changes in response to mouse movement.  Or combine image, music, and sound effects to create a greeting card for a friend or an interactive report for a school. <br>  The name <strong>Scratch</strong> comes from <strong>scratching</strong> , a technique used by hip-hop DJs who twist vinyl records back and forth with their hands to blend music videos together.  You can do this with Scratch by mixing various types of information (graphics, photos, music, sounds) in a creative rush. <br>  Scratch is based on a <strong>graphical programming language</strong> that allows you to control the actions and interactions between different types of data.  Programming in Scratch is much easier than in traditional programming languages: in order to create a script, you simply combine graphic blocks together, like Lego blocks or puzzle pieces. <br>  After you create a project in Scratch, you can <strong>share</strong> it with others on the Scratch website, as well as share videos on YouTube or photos on Flickr.  Or you can add your Scratch project to any other web page - for example, add interactive animation to your page in MySpace or Facebook. <br><br>  You can take new ideas for your project by viewing the projects of other users on the Scratch project website.  If you like a character or a picture, just <strong>download the</strong> project and use its part on your own. <br><br>  <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/scratch/papers/Creating-with-Scratch1.pdf">http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/scratch/papers/Creating-with-Scratch1.pdf</a> <br><br><h3>  Learn with Scratch </h3><br>  What do students do when they <strong>learn</strong> how they create interactive stories, animations, games, music, and creative works with Scratch? <br>  As for abilities, they study <strong>mathematical and computational ideas</strong> , which are derived from the experience of working with Scratch.  When students create programs in Scratch, they learn basic computational techniques, such as ‚Äúrepetition‚Äù and ‚Äúconditions‚Äù.  They also improve the understanding of important mathematical concepts such as coordinates, magnitudes, and random numbers. <br><br>  In a broader sense, students learn concepts using <strong>expressive</strong> and <strong>attractive</strong> ways.  When students learn values ‚Äã‚Äãin traditional algebra classes, they usually feel a little personal connection with concepts.  But when they study values ‚Äã‚Äãin the Scratch environment, they can use them immediately in a very expressive way: to control the speed of the animation, or to calculate the points in the game they create. <br>  When students work on a project at Scratch, they also study <strong>the design process</strong> .  As a rule, a student begins with an idea, creates a working prototype, experiments with it, debugs it when it works wrong, gets feedback from others, then revises it and rework it.  This is a continuous spiral: we take an idea, create a project that will be the basis of new ideas, which will be the basis of new projects, and so on in a circle. <br>  This process combines the basic <strong>learning skills of the 21st century</strong> , which will be important for future success: to think creatively, understandably communicate, analyze systematically, effectively interact with others, iteratively review, continuously learn. <br>  Creating projects at Scratch also helps students develop a deep level of <strong>freedom</strong> in information technology.  In order to be fluent in English, Spanish or another language, you must not only learn how to read, but also how to write - in other words, how to express yourself in another language.  Also, to be free in information technology, you must learn not only the interaction with the computer, but also the creation with it. <br>  Of course, most students will not become professional programmers, as most will not become professional writers.  But <strong>learning programming</strong> will be beneficial for everyone: it will allow students to express themselves more fully and creatively, help them develop logical thinking and help them understand the work of new technologies that they meet everywhere in their daily lives. <br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/wef.pdf">Rethinking Learning in the Digital Age</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/">Partnership for 21st Century Skills</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/scratch/papers/Learning-with-Scratch.pdf">Learning with scratch</a> </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Program with Scratch </h3><br>  Most people see <strong>computer programming</strong> as a tedious, special occupation, available only to those who have good technical background.  And, in fact, traditional programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Java and C ++ are very difficult to learn. <br>  The task of <strong>Scratch</strong> , a new programming language, is to change this.  Scratch takes all the best from computing and interface design in order to make the programming process more attractive and accessible to children, teenagers and those who want to learn programming.  The main features of Scratch: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Block programming</strong> .  To create programs in Scratch, you simply combine graphic blocks together in stacks.  The blocks are made so that they can be assembled only in syntactically correct constructions, which eliminates errors.  Different data types have different forms, emphasizing incompatibility.  You can make changes to the stacks, even when the program is running, allowing you to experiment more with new ideas over and over again. </li><li>  <strong>Manipulation of data</strong> .  With Scratch, you can create programs that control and blend graphics, animation, music, and sounds.  Scratch extends the visual data management capabilities that are popular in today's culture ‚Äî for example, adding programmability similar to Photoshop filters. </li><li>  <strong>Collaboration and sharing</strong> .  The Scratch project site offers inspiration and audience: you can view other people's projects, use and modify their pictures and scripts, and add your own project.  The biggest achievement is the common environment and culture created around Scratch. </li></ul> Scratch offers a <strong>low floor</strong> (easy to start), a <strong>high ceiling</strong> (the ability to create complex projects) and <strong>wide walls</strong> (support for a large variety of prokets).  In the work on Scratch, we paid special attention to simplicity, sometimes even at the expense of functionality, for greater clarity. <br>  When students work on a project in Scratch, they have a chance to learn important <strong>computational concepts</strong> , such as repetitions, conditions, variables, data types, events and processes.  Scratch has already been used to introduce these concepts to students of different ages, from elementary school to college.  Some students switched from traditional, textual, programming languages, after being shown programming in Scratch. <br>  Scratch is based on the best of the programming language <strong>Squeak</strong> .  He was inspired by previous work on <strong>Logo</strong> and Squeak <strong>Etoys</strong> , but conceived more simple and intuitive. <br>  Scratch is an open source project, but closed to the development team.  The source code is freely available, but the application is being developed by a small team of scientists from the MIT Media Lab. <br><br>  <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/scratch/papers/Programming-with-Scratch.pdf">http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/scratch/papers/Programming-with-Scratch.pdf</a> <br><br>  Stable version at the moment: <strong>1.1</strong> .  There are versions for Windows and Mac OS X. The version for Linux is promised to be completed by the end of 2007, although it is possible to launch Scratch via Wine with limited functionality. <br>  How to run Scratch on Linux: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D275">http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=275</a> <br><hr><br><br>  Thank you <a href="http://linuxgraphics.ru/">prokoudine</a> for corrections and additions in the translation. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31083/</a></p>
