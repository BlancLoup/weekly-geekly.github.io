  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Models of reality and their role in people's lives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a model of the world, and there is a real world. <br>  As in physics, there is some phenomenon, but there are its models. <br><br>  Over time, the models are refined - we had linear additions of speeds, then it became obvious - formulas do not work at high speeds;  the theory was clarified - and the transformations became nonlinearly dependent on speeds, the speed of light entered there. <br><br>  All this happens because physicists regularly check the validity of their models on practical experiments.  Moreover, trying not to introduce flaws with their measurements and the conditions of the experiment themselves - there are even entire sections of the science on this, for example, the theory of experiment.

      However, somewhere, 95% of people do not know that in their heads the brain is doing the same thing, only the first years of life.  He studies and models the real world, laying down for himself models of phenomena, people's characters, abstract concepts, and so on, which a person then uses in his mind as a tool, perceiving the model as a reality.  Further, all his life, man does this, making up more and more complex models. <br><br>  Here are just three differences from physicists here.  The first is the ignorance of the nature of the brain.  And hence the consequent conviction that everything that a person sees, thinks and knows is the truth.  That is, a person has convinced himself (read, he has made a model for himself) that Windows is better than Linux - everything, now in his model of the world there can be only this fact.  The second difference is precisely in the refinement of the model.  People do not specify models of reality, as a rule, moreover, the brain specifically cuts out facts contradicting the model, or produces ‚Äúadapters‚Äù in the form of ‚Äúlogical explanations‚Äù in order not to disturb comfort in the perception of the world - everyone knows dislike for change, fear that ‚Äú the world will be turned upside down. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the third, the saddest thing, the difference from scientists in the following.  If physical theories are tested by many people, and people want to make them more believable, explaining all phenomena in practice, logical and so on, then each person has a model of the world.  And no one except him can change them.  And the person himself in 95% of cases does not burn with desire - because fears live in him, the fear of change, the fear of making mistakes, the fear of losing the feeling of comfort, and so on. <br><br>  And in fact, constant life with testing of what you would see as sure, constant modification and refinement of your knowledge is a sign of a healthy personality.  Many of these you see around, especially in the mirror?  No, to be honest. <br><br>  And what did this knowledge give me, and a little more evidence in favor of the fact that what is written really can really help in life? <br><br>  What gave me: <br>  - understanding that my life is the sphere of my responsibility only and the result of only my efforts.  Simply put, most of the failures are to blame myself; <br>  - by changing my way of thinking, my perception of the world, I was able to achieve success in affairs in which there was no success before (and there was no belief that something could be achieved there) - in communication with people, in work, and in other areas; <br>  - Patient attitude to other people's points of view.  Understanding that another has his own model of reality, in which he believes as a reality, makes it possible not to judge him by his own standards, but to even study somewhere - maybe he sees the world better and more accurately than I do? <br>  - ... <br>  -PROFIT !!! <br><br>  Why is this true, and how does it bother people: <br>  1. Holivary, disputes, quarrels.  People encounter another person who has a different point of view from theirs, they think that the other person is mistaken (after all, they SEE reality as it is), and ignite a desire to convince their opponent.  The same does the opponent. <br>  An example is the Avatar film, and how many people broke spears in quarrels, what is the film about.  Everyone saw his own, but he only thought that IT HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING, and when he was told the opposite - he was trying to convince everyone of the wrong. <br><br>  2. Problems in people's lives, work, personal life, and so on.  Adopting views from reality from parents (another megabed, by the way), that stars are to blame for misfortunes, circumstances, and so on, a person cannot understand that he has spoiled himself, he alone is to blame, and he needs to solve all his problems in life .  As a result - insults to the world, to people who owe something to him, women, men, and so on. <br><br>  3. Problems in communication.  People think of stereotypes in relation to many professions.  For example, that social workers are evil and wrong people.  Here, a man, clenching his teeth and ready to swear, sure of his rightness in advance and himself rudely adjusted with a sense of superiority over these people, comes to a public place and begins with a disgruntled tone of impolitely demanding something there.  A polite young employee, after 10 days of such communication, will either leave, or he will recharge himself - they expect rudeness from him, and behave like cattle, why not be rude in return - become the same as they expect from him.  Cops, salespeople, people from the village, Muscovites, Ukrainians, Caucasians, and so on - all these are people, victims of stereotypes, which in the average person cause the reaction of communication with the wrong model that is biased in their attitude towards people. <br><br>  The worst thing is that this is not taught anywhere.  Only Christian faith tries to set people‚Äôs brains right, and even then, people, as a rule, at first do not interpret the meaning of what they read at first.  Alas, alas. <br><br>  And it is used by those about whom it is not customary to speak.  Through television, and so on, models of people change easily (more precisely, people skillfully lead them to change and believe in what they are told; manipulating, to put it simply).  The fact that you need to spend a lot of money in life, that beer is useful and must be drunk to be cool;  that you need to buy the most expensive mobile phone each time;  that you only need to relax and hang out in clubs;  that work is bad, and making money honestly is ignoble;  that it is bad to live in Russia;  that respecting parents is ridiculous and unworthy of these boys;  and so on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91904/</a></p>
