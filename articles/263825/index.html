In this talk, you will play with a few basic examples.  We'll wrap with a look towards the Volt's bright future.

That the Rails approach is so cool that we don‚Äôt have a whole class of problems that unfortunate Javista tinker with.  But for some reason, Rails applications with enviable regularity turn into unsupported monsters in six months, or even less.  It turns out that we are not really us and others.  I will share the experience of switching the brain from Rails-only-mode. <br>  As soon as you stop taking for granted the default way of organizing code in Rails, great things happen.  In my case, the new roles of objects (Form objects, Services, Repositories) appeared in the code in a natural way - as solutions to specific problems, and not because of what Martin Fowler bequeathed to us.  As a result, I received a flexible (modular, if you want) code that is easy to maintain and modify. <br>  Colleagues, stop blaming the mess in the DHH code!  The year 2015 is a great time to become someone more than a programmer-on-framework. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a0/915/27a/3a091527a57951babf635c903a865f25.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Samat Galimov and Boris Goryachev</b> <br>  Meduza.io <br>  <b>MICROSERVIS AND ELIXIR FOR RAILS DEVELOPERS</b> <br>  The story goes about how we share our main rails application and create microservice architecture.  As for the year, more than 10 projects of different levels of complexity were written, and how we were guided when it started. <br>  For us, the choice of language / framework for a project is often almost more difficult than writing the project itself, and in the report we will try to explain the expediency of this or that choice (I confess in advance - in some places we have screwed up nicely). <br>  We will also tell about cases when it is better to get off the rails in advance and how to protect yourself.  At the end of the report we will try to convince you to try elixir - a beautiful young functional programming language.  For dessert, a few examples where he became for us the right tool for the job. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f05/337/d22/f05337d22aeaa689ba5d4d2b7a001123.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Andrey Deryabin</b> <br>  Timlid Evil Martians, one of the Martian centenarians <br>  <b>MICROSERVICE IN GETT: OPENING NEW DIRECTIONS AND WORKING UNDER LOADING.</b> <br>  Gett (previously known as GetTaxi), the most popular service for ordering a taxi, this year not only grew in business indicators, but also opened up new areas of activity (vertical) - for example, food delivery and work at home.  In order to meet the business requirements of growth, and especially - to be able to build new verticals on existing facilities, the Gett architects began the transfer of the service to the microservice architecture. <br>  In this Gett team helped the Martians under the leadership of Andrew.  In a short time, Gett managed to switch from monolithic architecture to the use of microservices ‚Äî in combat mode, in four countries (USA, UK, Russia, Israel).  This allowed us to significantly speed up and simplify work on the development of new directions. <br>  Instead of theoretical stories about how great it is to use microservices and why everyone supposedly must do it, Andrei will concentrate on practice and combat experience.  In the report, he will talk about the difficulties encountered in the development of microservices and ways to solve them - the implementation of service interaction (using REST API), system state versioning, change logging (COW strategy), distributed configuration (ZooKeeper), working with shared parts microservices, deployment (Chef) and testing.  Separately, Andrey will elaborate on the implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern for solving problems in the communication channel between services. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/0e1/d9e/5800e1d9ecba596d0a669265e0989a1e.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Andrey Kumanyaev</b> <br>  Developer in Coub <br>  <b>WE SEARCH WHERE AND WHY PRODUCTION APPENDIX BRAKES</b> <br>  Many of the developers of the world of Ruby on Rails are familiar with a rich set of tools for profiling an application in a development environment.  Often, work with these tools ends before / after rolling out features in production.  At first, everything can work well and quickly, well, then ... how lucky. <br>  In the report, I will talk about how it is possible in a production environment to monitor application performance indicators and catch those cases when it starts to behave differently than we would like. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d4/3a1/26d/8d43a126db719401f75b90ed4aa958df.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Kirillov</b> <br>  Developer at Evrone <br>  <b>RUBY OBJECT MAPPER: REVOLUTION</b> <br>  Ruby Object Mapper (ROM) is an experimental Ruby library for implementing the display of ‚Äúclean‚Äù Ruby objects, which allows you to use all the power of the selected data storage without any restrictions. <br>  ROM is based on several concepts different from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Ruby ORM.  I will talk about these concepts, analyze the features of the library and show you how to live without Active Record. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0d/f7c/98b/b0df7c98be8d2b9d2816f888fc99b99b.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Semyon Bagreev</b> <br>  Lead Ruby Developer at Rambler &amp; Co <br>  <b>TESTING AND ‚ÄúSOFTWARE WRITER‚Äù A YEAR LATER</b> <br>  A year ago, during the opening of RailsConf 2014, David Heinemeier Hansson shared with us his thoughts on the profession of software engineer (or ‚Äúsoftware writer‚Äù, according to his version) and on TDD.  In short, DHH spoke rather sharply in the direction of TDD, arguing that TDD breaks the design, making it unreasonably difficult to understand, while giving a false sense of confidence based on imaginary indicators (coverage, ratio, speed). <br>  I tried on the role of ‚ÄúSoftware Writer‚Äù.  Following David's advice, I tried to test the entire system, rather than individual units, focusing on integration and ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù tests.  In the process, I was faced with a lack of understanding of some colleagues and business leaders.  I had to dispel several test myths and I will share this experience with other developers. <br>  In addition, I learned a few tricks to speed up the tests, I mastered several new testing tools that I will mention in my report. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae4/6e8/8be/ae46e88be0a7cd0ef5ede0fef4706897.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Kirill Shatrov</b> <br>  Developer at Evil Martians, Capistrano and Sorcery Maintainer <br>  <b>BUILDING RAILSPERF, A TOOLKIT TO DETECT PERFORMANCE REGRESSIONSIN RUBY ON RAILS CORE</b> <br>  Using the example of the beta versions of Rails 4.2, we have seen how often performance regressions can occur in the Rails framework and how easily they can go unnoticed. <br>  The problem of performance and its regressions is becoming more acute in the Ruby community.  It pushed me and other Rails contributors to develop Rubybench, a service for searching regression for performance in Ruby and Rails. <br>  In my report, I will look at performance regressions using examples of commits from Rails, talk about building benchmarks for Ruby applications, and demonstrate Rubybench and its architecture. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f7/7f1/c10/5f77f1c10f78b93ecae7494b7c8df156.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Anna Shcherbinina</b> <br>  Lead web team at Artec Group <br>  <b>LT: CRYSTAL</b> <br>  Crystal is a language compiled into native code.  As the developers themselves say, its syntax is inspired by Ruby.  Therefore, the driving threshold for a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloper is not high, and, really, looking at the code, the question unwittingly arises: is it Crystal or Ruby?  I will tell about implementation of microservice on Crystal: similarities and differences with Ruby, pluses, minuses and use in production. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/6b4/5a3/8f36b45a38292b2d1e06ae4e5bb7ff8d.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Kirill Gorin</b> <br>  Developer at Toptal <br>  <b>LT: ACTIVE SUPPORT INSTRUMENTATION</b> <br>  Everyone uses monitoring tools for Rails applications, but not everyone knows that they work based on the tools built into Rails.  Active Support Instrumentation is one of them.  In this report I will tell you how to use it and how you can write a competitor New Relic yourself. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/789/27d/c8e/78927dc8e430de2f9395c3501f2a9cc1.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Vladimir Yartsev</b> <br>  Technical Director at Cloud Castle <br>  <b>LT: PERSONAL HEROKU ADD-ON WITH DOCKER</b> <br>  There are more than 100 ready-made microservices in the Heroku add-ons directory, but sometimes there is no suitable add-on, but I don‚Äôt want to leave Heroku. <br>  One of the solutions is Docker, which allows you to build microservice, based on the Docker Hub image.  But the support of the microservice infrastructure in this case falls on the shoulders of the developer. <br>  I'll tell you how to combine the convenience of Heroku with the flexibility of Docker, forcing microservice to behave like the Heroku addon. <br><br><br>  As you noticed, there are more reports.  This is because Russian speakers are now speaking in two parallel streams.
