RF for January-February 2011: <br><br>  <strong>January 19</strong> <br>  RU-Center completed the second stage of auctions. RF.  They openly <a href="http://za-rf.ru/node/142">write on their own resource that the cost of a domain can reach 55,000 cu</a> . <br>  As for the names themselves, these are really the most ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù domains, for example: apteka.rf, biznes.rf, erotika.rf, bar.rf, shini.rf, hospital.rf, etc.  Total 914 domains. <br>  Why are prices so high?  According to RU-Center representatives themselves, they held auctions to ensure that domains did not get to cybersquatters.  But, alas, these unscrupulous citizens were tricky at auctions and, according to the assurances of the RU-Center, wind up prices and disrupted auctions.  RU-enter made a reciprocal step and excluded them from the repeated round of bidding.  And what do we see?  55 000 USD!  Riddle, children: who winds up prices when only conscientious conscientious citizens and RU-Center are left among the participants? <br>  More than 400 domains ‚Äúfor various reasons‚Äù RU-Center promises to put up for open auctions. <br><br>  <strong>January 20th</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  RU-Center was supposed to provide the FAS with a list of documents requested by the FAS on December 16 at the first hearing on a previously opened case on violation of Law No. 135-FZ ‚ÄúOn Protection of Competition‚Äù in the process of registering domain names in the domain. Regional Network Information Center, Regional Network Information Center CJSC (RU-Center trademark), RELCOM.DELINE NETWORK LLC, Demos-Internet CJSC, Registrator CJSC, Elvis Telecom CJSC. <br>  <a href="http://katrinn.livejournal.com/64071.html">User Katrinn posted this list in her LiveJournal</a> . <br>  I want to note that the pile must be satisfied weighty.  They gathered, probably, all the New Year holidays, involving all the employees of the Moscow office :) I wonder if they had time?

      <strong>January 26</strong> <br>  A press conference is scheduled to announce the official conclusion of the commission formed by the Coordination Center to study the problems of registering domains in the zone. RF.  <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2011/01/17_a_3493450.shtml">Gazeta.ru writes about this</a> : <br>  <em>One member of the commission, State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein told Gazeta.Ru that the commission made rather tough conclusions based on the results of the work, especially regarding the corruption of some participants in the process of registering names in the ‚ÄúRFR‚Äù zone.</em>  <em>According to the commission, one of those responsible for the scandal and violations is a federal-level official, ‚Äúappointed and dismissed by decree of the Prime Minister.‚Äù</em> <br>  Everyone who is interested in the question has long been waiting for this decision.  BUT!  It should be understood that all decisions and conclusions of the commission are only of an advisory nature.  Who will undertake the execution of this decision and whether it will be undertaken is unknown.  Maybe Andrei Kolesnikov from the Coordination Center, has already shown that he is ready for decisive action.  And if not?  One hope for FAS, because  <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/tochka/741487-echo/">Igor Schegolev, Minister of Communications and Mass Media, in an interview with Ekho Moskvy, said:</a> <br>  <em>‚ÄúI want to repeat, this is not the business of the state - this is the business of public organizations.</em>  <em>Less than 1% protested.</em>  <em>Well, in general, for such an amount, despite the fact that over 40 thousand registrations were carried out over the course of several days, this is exactly when such a scandal raged in our glass of water.</em>  <em>This, I believe, is quite an acceptable indicator.</em>  <em>As for the findings, there were appeals to the FAS.</em>  <em>Probably, some claims were filed with arbitration courts.</em>  <em>Well, we will wait for the results to understand how justified it is and how much attention that was paid to these negative aspects really corresponded to the scale of the disaster. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>January 31</strong> <br>  The long-awaited decision of the FAS in the case about which I wrote above.  Strange, but I did not find any amusing rumors, speculations on this topic on the net.  Whether it is not interesting to anyone, or a high level of secrecy.  I myself think that in 10 days it is physically impossible to study all the papers requested from RU-Center.  It looks like a contrived delay, which played into the hands of someone.  But to whom? <br>  And now I want to contact you, habrovchane: who participated in the auctions?  How did they go?  Did you get your domains?  What will you do if FAS declares auctions illegal?  What do you think, RU-Center will be able to return all the money? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112372/</a></p>
