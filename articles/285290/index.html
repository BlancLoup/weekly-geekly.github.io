  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Job Description: Common Mistakes and Their Consequences</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From time to time in any company there is a need to find an employee for a vacant position. <br>  Different companies use different search methods for this: some companies search for candidates on the Internet, others through recruitment agencies, third through the stock exchange, fourth through acquaintances, fifth through advertisements in the press, sixth use internal reserves, etc.  Someone vacancy closes quickly, and someone - slowly.  I will talk about why ‚Äúslowly‚Äù in this article, citing a few of the most common mistakes that are often made by heads of departments and employees of the HR service at the stage of forming a public description of a vacancy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Requirements.</b> <br>  "We want a creative, attentive, sociable, responsible accountant." <br>  In this case, ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù and ‚Äúsociability‚Äù should be discarded from the job description.  Because for an accountant position these qualities are not needed.  Even if the boss thinks differently - he needs to explain that he will get into the accounting reporting for the tax inspection fines, and not his sociable subordinate. <br><br>  <u>Consequences:</u> "good" applicants will not respond to this vacancy.  And those who will respond, and send a summary "for good luck" - will not fit your requirements, unless of course you have them "in real life" remain the same. <br><br>  <b>2. Duties.</b> <br>  "Keeping the accounting report on the site OS, interaction with suppliers, couriers, order stationery accessories, change the water in the cooler." <br>  In this case, you need to throw out everything after the words "... with suppliers."  Work with couriers, stationery, etc.  It should not be an accountant, but an office manager or secretary.  People do not like to sit alone on two chairs, and for one salary they have double responsibility and fulfill the duties of actually two people.

      <u>Consequences:</u> ‚Äúgood‚Äù job seekers will not respond to this vacancy: firstly, in their opinion, in normal companies, the accountant is still engaged in accounting, and secondly, a successful company has money for an office manager‚Äôs salary. <br><br>  <b>3. Terms</b> <br>  "Wages from 1000 USD." <br>  First, in Russia, for a long time everyone indicates a salary in rubles: now it is not 1998, and ‚Äúcu‚Äù forces applicants to wrestle with what the rate is tied to ‚Äî the MICEX dollar, or the company's internal exchange rate (which is not specified). <br>  Secondly, if the real salary fork is 25,000 - 40,000 rubles (the employer is willing to pay so much), then you should write this way: indicating not the lower bar, but either the upper one ‚Äúup to 40,000‚Äù or ‚Äú25,000 - 40,000 rubles.‚Äù love greedy because  if they see "from 25 thousand rubles" they perceive this figure as the initial salary.  And a specialist, evaluating his work in 40 m. P., Is simply not interested in the number "25". <br><br>  <u>Consequences:</u> ‚Äúgood‚Äù job seekers will not respond to this vacancy: they know their own worth, and do not like turbidity with ‚Äúcu‚Äù The greatest harm to the search process for an employee is that the ‚Äúbad‚Äù job description pushes all people who are in active job search at the current time.  And, roughly speaking, it turns out that <b>in the first three days</b> after the vacancy is published, it will be viewed (and to no avail) by <b>as many people as later in the month</b> .  When, a week later, the employer becomes worried, ‚Äúwhy do normal people do not come?‚Äù, It will be too late to change the job description - only a few will open the job description a second time.  And you have to wait a long time.  How much - depends on a lot (time of year, lack of specialists).  In the meantime, about 4 weeks of working time will be lost due to a ‚Äústuck‚Äù job.  In what money it pours out - any head of the company can calculate. <br><br>  <b>The reasons</b> why the job description is made incorrectly. <br>  1. The desire to save on salary, and the lack of information about the real salary expectations of applicants for a particular vacancy. <br>  2. The ‚Äúno time‚Äù for the head of the department to create a job description, and he sends a raw version of the requirements to the HR-manager in haste. <br>  3. The company does not know who really needs it, due to the fact that there is no specialist who could compile a competent description. <br>  4. The head wants to see as many people as possible, and indicates too little information about the position, wanting to tell the details at the meeting.  And applicants do not want to spend time on trips it is not clear where: they already have enough invitations. <br>  5. ... maybe there are some other reasons? <br><br>  It would also be interesting to know what the article liked and what did not, what I would like to argue with. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285290/</a></p>
