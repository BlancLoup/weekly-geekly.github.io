An application can be traditional, social, mobile, or combine all these aspects and have the capabilities of working with big data. <br><br>  Bluemix provides an opportunity in a short time to create an application that has such characteristics as reducing the need for initialization (both applications and infrastructure), flexible allocation of available resources, automation of technical tasks and support for various types of workloads.  Getting started in Bluemix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot easy, although the platform is user friendly.  By understanding this, IBM helps developers.  A decision has now been made to acquaint students and their teachers in a number of universities with the platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In MGTU them.  Bauman on the basis of the Internet of Things Laboratory and the Department of Computer Systems and Networks under the guidance of Associate Professor A.Yu.  Popov conducted research and development of students to create solutions that have practical significance.  MSTU students implement their projects also in the framework of the hackathon, which is regularly conducted by the university together with IBM.  Some projects are posted on YouTube, and we can get acquainted with them.  In the course of work on the projects, APIs, services and protocols provided by IBM to universities for free under the Academic Initiative program at an academic hub (I <a href="https://ibm.onthehub.com/">BM OTH</a> ) were used.

      Student Mark Makarychev created a system for tracking the location of an object using GPS-based GPS and the LoRa network. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7CnKZQM-ns" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Similar applications are created by many.  A feature of this project is the use <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN">of LoRa</a> receiving and transmitting <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN">system</a> , which provides some advantages in terms of city accuracy in positioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a8e/eec/39e/a8eeec39e6d04e19a35c98e68f8c7c8f.png"><br><br>  Peat fires have become a constant threat and headache, sometimes literally, in many Russian cities, including Moscow.  Andrei Komarov and members of his team who participated in the hackathon developed a system for the early detection of such a fire.  How the system works and can be seen <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/KSvw/ewcbuhEfh">by reference</a> .  The same team made a remote metering system for water metering. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xzwSy4Zd_8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular.  However, it is difficult to track the delivery.  And sometimes the loss of purchase.  Students Baumanki Vladislav Shuteev and Valentin Ivanov offer a fundamentally new tracking system for mailings and goods based on the Internet of Things. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOkKC5vkX10" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A student from Kyrgyzstan, Choro Abdimanapov, studying at MSTU, became interested in the practical task of using the Internet of Things for breeding fish in a fish farm, located in the village of Tash-Doba.  The decision created by him formed the basis of his graduation project, successfully defended in June.  He himself tells about the device of the proposed system, which increases the productivity of fish farming in the <a href="https://1drv.ms/v/s!AlNR6B8ZpYzTzRjo6Sjvedf2TAQF">video</a> . <br><br>  Students of Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics, under the leadership of Professor V. I. Saenko, Department of Information Control Systems, are developing a course on teaching IBM Bluemix.  The Vindict team consisting of Anna Kanevskaya, Bogdana Gorbatenko and Vladislav Stepin created the Bug Trace resource to support users who are just starting <a href="https://bug-trace.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/about">to learn the platform</a> .  To date, the team has created and published 6 videos of the course.  <b>The first</b> is the beginning of work. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7P2teRwq3o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is dedicated to the implementation of a small project with the registration and activation of a free account, available under the program "Academic Initiative". <br><br>  <b>Lesson 2</b> contains instructions for creating the first application. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8qT3rexB8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Lesson 3</b> describes in more detail how to interact with the MySQL database as an IBM Bluemix service. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8qT3rexB8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Lesson 4</b> demonstrates an alternative way to work with IBM Bluemix via the command line. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsIJXW3KuE8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Lesson 5 is</b> about creating the simplest site. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHGI9klwJUc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Lesson 6</b> implements all the developments made in previous lessons for the development of a practically significant project - a travel agency website. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUmRSlfh_D4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We wish the work of the university successful continuation and development. <br><br>  Finally, an initiative group of IBM and university staff is working on a project of the IBM Watson cloud cognitive university.  The resource is hosted on developerWorks and aims to create a course on the study of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communitystart%3FcommunityUuid%3Dbc004137-b64a-4378-ac02-2caf59c56c2a%26ftHelpTip%3Dtrue">cognitive technologies and the Internet of things for students</a> .  Anyone can join, willing to contribute to the joint work.
