In order to assess the rapidly growing popularity of mobile applications, analysts have measured how many times a day different users use mobile applications.  It turned out that according to this parameter, players can be divided into three large groups: regular users (less than 16 times a day), super users (16-60 times a day) and mobile users (more than 60 times a day).  Compared with the same quarter of 2014 in the second quarter of the current significant addition is observed in all three categories, but the strongest growth was in the latter type of users.  Increasing more than half, their number amounted to 280 million people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d7/f84/7e3/4d7f847e3f294aa799358e82b983f4c6.jpg"><br><br>  In Flurry, it was considered as a joke that if the entire mobile population of the planet united into one country, it would have risen from eighth to fourth place in the country‚Äôs population rating over the past year.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b8/9fc/5aa/4b89fc5aa44f4df1bef9e163808993eb.jpg"><br><br>  But there were also reports in the report that were useful for representatives of the industry about the growth in popularity of specific types of applications.  Unfortunately, in this ranking, gaming applications are only in third place, although over the year users began to run games as much as twice as often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10a/09d/3c5/10a09d3c50c242639caae71b8fa9f061.jpg"><br><br><br><h3>  <b>Runet users began to spend more on content</b> </h3><br>  According to <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/07/21/601456-runet-podnyalsya-v-tsene">a study by the</a> analytic company Synovate Comcon, spending by Russian citizens on Internet content is growing, but at the same time, IAP in games is falling. In the first half of 2015, spending on content such as games, e-books, software or movies in Russia grew by 23%.  On average, each user spent 130 rubles a month, with almost half of these funds going into mobile games and applications. <br><br>  Despite all this, on the whole in the mobile market there is a decrease in the number of paying Russian players, and the observed growth was only due to the conversion of prices in the App Store and Google Play, which is associated with the weakening of the ruble against the dollar. Not so long ago, the App Store introduced new prices for purchases in the Russian store, and perhaps this will correct the situation if developers make a discount on content for Russia. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Report: Your App Store app page elements that are truly important to users.</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4f/429/eb2/a4f429eb21924acdb539c6c218210543.jpg"><br><br>  The analytics service tune.com did a little research and found out what factors in application design are really important for users in deciding whether to download or not download the app from the App Store. <br><br>  1000 American users of apple devices were surveyed and about this picture was obtained.  In my opinion, the data are rather unexpected, speculatively expected that the top of the rating will be taken by screenshots and the icon, but it turned out that the description is the most important. <br><br>  Anyone can see the <a href="http://in.tune.com/app-store-factors%3Futm_campaign%3DTUNE-Blog%26utm_source%3Dinbound%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_content%3Dapp-store-factors">full version of the article.</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Cortana on Android, free download, without SMS.</b> </h3><br>  In May, Microsoft let slip that its digital assistant Cortana will be released for iOS and Android platforms.  And already on July 17, the beta version of Cortana for Android unexpectedly leaked to the network.  Full apk, with the ability to install on the device, Karl!  When asked how it happened, the company responded that before the official release of the beta in a few weeks, it tested this beta version on a small number of users in the United States and China.  It seems that the leak was not from the employee, but from such a test user. <br><br>  It appears that OS 4.4 (kitkat) or later is required for operation.  Work will also require Microsoft accounting for cross-platform personalization.  All who can not wait to try this early and fresh version, you can find the leaked apk.  Or you can go the official way and <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2225956/Cortana-companion">register with the testers</a> .  Hmmm, strange and expected leakage, to be honest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263891/</a></p>
