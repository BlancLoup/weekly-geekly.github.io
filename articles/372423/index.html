      The project is designed for three years, and under a general agreement, IBM and SesameWorkshop will work on creating tutorials and educational platforms with the help of which it will be possible to conduct training with an individual approach.  Why are preschoolers selected?  The reason is the recommendation of specialists who believe that the brain development is most active in the first five years of a child‚Äôs life.  This stage can be considered crucial in terms of the education and development of children. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Sesame Street" has been going on for about 45 years.  During this time, the company that creates the series has accumulated vast experience in the field of education.  In particular, the experience is based on more than a thousand studies of the most optimal way of teaching children.  As for the cognitive system Watson, it has long been able to work with natural language and pattern recognition.  The experience of both companies will help create personalized learning models that will help children learn much more effectively than before.  As a cognitive system, Watson will work to improve the proposed educational activities. <br><br>  Examples of IBM and SesameWorkshop collaboration include: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Smart toys like Elmo that stimulate a child to learn by playing.  The child during the game will receive important information for learning, and use it in the game process.  Toys will adapt to the level of development of the child and interact with him accordingly to this level.  If the child already knows how to count to 20, Elmo will teach him to count to 30; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Creating educational applications that help the child to read and play using the child‚Äôs own ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù with its special words.  Using the capabilities of the Watson cognitive system, the toy will study the characteristics of the child‚Äôs response and dynamically adapt; <br>  ‚Ä¢ A school tool to help teachers use an individualized approach to students, as well as plan activities that are appropriate for certain groups of children. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lG4xBoEgZo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhG2tePhnP2Pgxr0j52iWE2AbgC3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn our opinion, the integration of education and advanced technologies is a key factor in improving the process of teaching young children in the United States and around the world.  As for the previous generation, Sesame Street used the ubiquitous presence of television to reach out to vulnerable children and give them access to some of the learning opportunities that only wealthy middle-class families had.  And it worked very well.  Today, through cooperation with IBM and Watson, we are planning to develop a new generation of adapted study guides.  Ultimately, our goal is to provide children from all socio-economic backgrounds with the opportunity for full-fledged and personalized education in the years of their personal development, ‚Äùsaid Jeffrey D. Dunn, CEO of SesameWorkshop. <br><br>  Recall that "Sesame Street" was founded in 1969.  The goal that the creators of the show set themselves is to give all children the same educational opportunities ... Today the show is popular among many families, but the ultimate goal remains the same, namely solving the educational needs of children through a powerful combination of media and Muppets.  ‚ÄúSesame Street‚Äù, in addition to its own episodes, produces numerous awareness programs aimed at the most vulnerable communities in the world. <br><br>  In the creation of the transfer is always involved a lot of specialists in various fields.  Now the company plans to invite teachers, professors, researchers, technologists, gamers, actors and media managers to cooperate.  The whole team will decide on the optimization of the existing system of preschool education. <br><br>  As Todd Rose, one of the project‚Äôs independent consultants and director of the Mind, BrainandEducation division at Harvard School of Education, said, ‚Äú... the fundamentals of children's intelligence, personality and skills are formed in the first few years of a child‚Äôs life, the most critical for development are the first five." In this case, children have completely different digestibility of materials - therefore, it is desirable to use an individual approach to children in preschool education, which will help make the learning process as effective as possible. <br><br>  How will it look like?  The system will communicate with children, revealing the level of child's intelligence and intelligence.  The knowledge base will also be determined.  The company plans to use all the collected data to create a personalized curriculum.  Finished prototypes will be evaluated by educational and technological communities - this will allow to determine the most effective approaches. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372423/</a></p>
