Littlesnake Alternative</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three-mile military topographic map of Western Russia in 1845. <br>  That is its first and correct name. <br>  This ancient topographic map of the European part of the Russian Empire, which today is called simply and unpretentiously - three. <br><br>  In RuNet, a lot has been written about her, I will note just a few points. <br>  Moments of technical. <br><br>  In the "Notes of the Military Topographical Depot" Part 10 of 1847.  under the editorship of Major-General Tuchkov on p. 24, the highest approval (of April 2, 1845) on the compilation of a military topographic map of Russia was published.  In this document, the projection parameters and three sheet sizes are indicated.  This part freely lies in RuNet in the scans of the Munich Library - anyone can read this approval. <br>  The archive of the RGVIA contains the most interesting document (I call it as a practical form of three, about 1.6 m high) with the text ‚ÄúThe Network of Meridians and Parallel Circles of the Military Topographic Map of Western Russia of 1845 ... Note: The Network of Meridians and Parallel Circles of the Military The topographic map of Western Russia, is the coordinates of the points of intersection of meridians and parallel circles in inches, respectively, the scale adopted for the map.  ie: 3 versts in 1 English inch.  The middle meridian of the map passes through the main Pulkovo Observatory.  The average card width is 52 g.  The length of the leaf from east to west is 23 inches, its width from north to south is 16.5 inches, and diagonal is 28.306 inches.  Compiled by Second Lieutenant Egorov 3rd, checked by Captain Manshikov. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the end of the 19th century, several other figures appeared in the literature - an average parallel of 54 degrees.  This figure is visible in the academic textbooks of V.V. Vitkovsky - lieutenant-general, chairman of the department of mathematical geography of the Russian Geographical Society and professor of the Academy of the General Staff.  And also in the writings of Scharngorst KV, lieutenant general, professor of geodesy and editor of maps of the General Staff.  It seems that a mistake came out from them, some of the great ones were described, and then everyone (out of deep respect) continued AshiPku.

      The projection of the three is a pseudo-conical isometric cartographic projection of Bonnet, the central meridian is Pulkovsky, the central parallel is 52 degrees.  Sheet size is 23 x 16.5 inches.  The spheroid is taken "... according to the findings of Professor Valbek from Abo, who defined (compressed) 302.78 and (the big semi-axis) 2988830,0024 ...", or how often it occurs in the "Notes of the VTD" - "For the figure of Valbek Earth taken for all the works of the Military Topographic Department ... the semi-axis = 2988853 fathoms, compression = 302.78 ". <br><br>  The publication of map sheets was planned up to 28 pillars, but with the improvement of the quality of geodetic works at the beginning of the 20th century and the material base, the creation of new sheets was stopped, because the new standard of one-verst maps (Western Border Area) went into practice.  The number of finished sheets for this time can be calculated on the Volarovich's form in 1909, indicating which sheets did not have time to do.  After the general devastation, the young Soviet state needed maps, and the creation of three (further east) continued.  In the book ‚ÄúMathematical Cartography‚Äù by V. Kavraisky of 1934, the number of sheets of three and more than 640 is indicated. At that, Mende-Gubernia‚Äôs sheets are lower in accuracy, as well as exotic places of three ‚Äî Vyatka Province, Votsk Region (Udmurtia), Nizhny Novgorod.  In the mid-193s, the three are counted as a survey map, and Gauss-Kruger is rapidly replacing it.  There are several scans of three and the marks of the conduct of hostilities during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 on the website "The feat of the people". <br><br>  Schubert <br>  FF Schubert is not the father of three.  The term "Schubert's Trekh" is the universal fallacy of our time.  The famous ten-point - yes - is connected with FF Schubert, but three (if it comes to that) should be more correctly called by the name of Major-General P..Tuchkov.  For details, see the ‚ÄúHistory of Military Cartography in Russia‚Äù by V.V. Glushkov, p.115, ‚ÄúNotes of the VTD‚Äù, part 9.10.  FF Schubert undoubtedly did a lot in geodesy and cartography in Russia, but nowhere, no one in the history of cartography in Russia has ever called a three-verse map "the three Schubert." <br><br>  Binding of three. <br>  On the site of Monetonos, a group of comrades (including myself) from January 2011 to January 2012.  We have disassembled this map on the subject of its correct binding in a rectangular coordinate system, and today I do not have the slightest doubt about the correctness of the chosen method.  All the necessary data for proper binding here in the article I indicated.  Unless it remains to create a simple table in Ehele to calculate the rectangular coordinates of the angles of three, and calculate the parameters of Molodensky for the transformation of three to other spheroids. <br><br>  Three accuracy. <br>  I understand this term as the accuracy of putting objects on the map.  For the general staff (noted in any topography textbook) 0.2 mm from the scale for all objects, and 0.1 mm for triangulation signs and landmarks.  That is, 0.2 mm for 100k = 20 m. At the same time, the maps of the general staff are created on the basis of aerial photography. <br>  The three has a metric scale of 1 cm: 126,000 meters, which is close to the 100k general staff.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sheet is three and 23 x 16.5 x 3 x 3 = 3415.5 square ver.  From the book I. Strelbitsky "Calculating the surface of the Russian Empire in its overall composition ..." 1889 we take, for example, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Tula province - 27,204.4 square meters.  That is - on three Tula province fits (theoretically) on 27,204.4: 3,415.5 = 7.96 sheets.  In the catalog of Blaramberg in 1860, the number of points read for Tula province is 403 points.  That is, about 50 points per sheet is a very average result.  Count, do not be lazy, how many villages, intersections of roads, bends of rivers, bridges and so on.  other  other  of objects is SPECIFIED on one sheet of the three and the Tula province?  I think 200-250.  Compare 200-250 objects, and 50 of them have read coordinates.  There is something to think about, right?  Taking into account the fact that the three were created on the basis of stencil shooting - a tablet, a field, a forest ... Add the conscience and the qualification of the team that conducted the shooting, and the work of the engraver (using a spik on a copper board with what accuracy can you draw a curved line?) <br>  I estimate the average accuracy of putting objects on three - 1/16 - 1/32 inches scale, that is, about 50-100 meters.  The thickness of the inner frame of three is approximately 1/16 inch.  Railways on three were applied, as a rule - schematically, read - from the ceiling. <br><br>  Binding accuracy. <br>  Krivorukov vendors bindings have come up with this term in order to dissolve the user eared for money.  "Accuracy tied three and 20 meters" - spit in the face, it does not happen.  A sheet of three, correctly transformed from Valbek to WGS, can be checked simply - connect the upper corners of three to each other in a graphic editor.  There should be a ‚Äúhump‚Äù in the center of the leaf, and the farther from the central meridian (passes between 8 and 9 pillars), the steeper the hump. <br>  The meaning of the term ‚Äúbinding accuracy‚Äù - as I understand it - is one pixel.  For both you and I are trying with such precision to put an end to the specialized software, tying the map.  That is, the binding accuracy is the same for all of us, one pixel. <br><br>  Alignment sheet. <br>  A trekh is a raster, not a vector.  Over its hundred-year history, the paper map has suffered a lot.  Regardless of storage conditions - paper tends to dry out, change its size and geometry.  Look at the Doccherer - which sometimes meet curved sheets, with different sizes of sides.  Add to this misunderstandings when scanning and so on.  Therefore, the three in the binding process must be aligned, that is, lead to a normal appearance - a rectangle of 23 x 16.5 inches.  This is easily done in the Global Mapper program, a bit of perseverance is required. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/030/88d/c9b/03088dc9b08ec7d1dde1e3c61ba7d959.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How is the colored (painted) three? <br>  In any available way, take the data of the card service - I took Yandex for Russia, Visicom for Ukraine, the 14th level.  I transform the maps of the kartservis in the projection of Bonn on Valbek, transparently gluing together with the third one, cutting off - everything. <br><br>  Three in color you can take - <br>  - cumulatively on Rutraker - enter the word "Littlesnake" on the main page in the search, and you will be taken to the tracker page with the map, <br>  - by piece on the site <a href="http://www.etomesto.ru/trehverstka-v-cvete/">Etomesto www.etomesto.ru/trehverstka-v-cvete</a> <br>  You can <a href="http://mapofilia-ru.blogspot.ru/">read</a> in my blog <a href="http://mapofilia-ru.blogspot.ru/">mapofilia-ru.blogspot.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf8/3a2/95c/cf83a295c80716a889aacb75af113620.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205310/</a></p>
