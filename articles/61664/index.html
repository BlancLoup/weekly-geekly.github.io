    <img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/6.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  The situation is not rare - if nothing serious, then you only need to pull out the disks and conjure them from the working system.  I figured that it might be necessary to rearrange the OS, and since the drives on both laptops are no longer being read, I decided not to bother with flooding images and installing from flash drives and bought this device. <br>  I really didn‚Äôt want to take a nouneym, therefore ‚ÄúTHIS‚Äù is a 3.5 ‚Äùcontainer for 2.5‚Äù SATA disks from <b>IcyBox</b> .  The company's website itself contains almost no information, all information is on <a href="http://www.raidsonic.de/en/pages/home/home.php">the</a> <b>RaidSonis website</b> .  Apparently, they have some kind of astral connection there, as well as with the well-known company <b>QNAP</b> , so I decided nevertheless) <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  It is logical to assume that there will be not so much in the box.  Actually, it is: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/1.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  - <b>IcyBox IB-267</b> device; <br>  - Two keys to open the device; <br>  - SATA cable for connection; <br>  - A set of screws for mounting; <br>  - Short instructions in 8 languages, including Russian. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  All this is hidden inside the foam material, ensuring relative safety of transportation and integrity of the piece of iron. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  For some reason I want to call the piece of iron a card reader.  But this is stupid, there are no cards here.  Hardrider?  Maybe ... but then it is assumed that the device should read all sorts of different hard drives.  However, there is not much more or less available - only 2.5 ‚Äù-inch SATA drives. <br><br>  The case is black, metal, matte.  Dimensions (L * W * H, mm) - 140 * 102 * 26, weight - 250 grams. <br>  On the front panel (the door) there is a button on the left to open the device and a key hole, and on the right is the company logo and two LEDs with unambiguous icons. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/4.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  The lock is opened by turning the key.  After turning, you need to press the white button on top - the gate opens. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  On the gate there is a small rubber tab, which, if necessary, carefully and without scratches will push the disk inside. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/5.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  If you take a closer look inside, there are two metal ‚Äúwhiskers‚Äù on top, which will press the disk to the bottom.  A little further - a small shawl controller. <br><br>  On the back side (it is made of plastic alone) there is a SATA connector and a place for regular power supply. <br><br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  As you understand, there is nothing complicated here.  I insert a disk - enters easily.  Indicator that he went to the end, will be a closing door, which later must be closed until it clicks.  Everything?  Not. <br><br>  In order to ‚Äúvibrate‚Äù inside, you need to insert and turn the key - only then the indicators will light up.  Probably such a "protection against a fool." <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/9.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  Speaking of indicators.  There are two of them - blue (power) and red (disc work).  The first is terribly bright and for some reason the light from it is quite directional - even at a distance of a meter its glow is felt.  Why did so - it is not clear, but then it will stand under the table, so it is not fatal.  Yes, and postings can be disconnected from the inside.  <b>The idea for manufacturers</b> is to make ultraviolet light-emitting diodes - it will be possible to check money and kill germs with bundles :) Oftop - once told a friend that only President's hair is used in the five thousandth denominations - he believed :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  Actually, problems with the connection and operation of the disk should not arise, everything is quite simple.  The reader does not affect the speed of the disk, here are the speed measurements. <br><br>  Direct reading graph for direct reading: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/320.png" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  The same schedule when working inside the device: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/320ib.png" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  What was - read.  A completely new disk will have to be formatted. <br><br><h3>  Advantages and disadvantages </h3><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - Build quality and materials; <br>  - Ability to "close" the disk key; <br>  - Ease of use; <br>  - Price (600-800 rubles). <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - Bright work indicator <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Both laptops are Asuses, but I'm not in a hurry to draw any conclusions - they both worked faithfully for more than one year.  One disc died irrevocably (the pancakes are not even unwound) with a bunch of various projects (my brother belongs to people who have already started making backups);  I brought my disk back to life with a few simple gestures, after which I filled the image of the working system. <br><br>  In my opinion, the bundle of this ‚Äúreader‚Äù was not prevented by any program that could show the SMART performance of the disk, as well as forcibly disconnect it - even SATA supports the ‚Äúhot‚Äù change of disks, somehow uncomfortable .  However, there are more sophisticated models that partially solve these problems. <br><br>  Someone will say - ‚Äú <i>Hah, why do we need all this at all ?!</i>  ".  In principle, yes, there is hardly any urgent need.  Everything is similar to the hot-swap feature in the NAS ‚Äî somewhere you need to turn off, unwind the case, insert the disk, turn it on.  And it can be easier - he opened the door, inserted the disk and it all worked. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8.jpg" alt="www.boomburum.ru - there is nothing interesting there)"><br><br>  So here - you can disassemble the case and connect the drive, hanging it or putting books under it.  And you can buy this device (good, the price does not bite) - insert it into a free 3.5 ‚Äùconnector instead of a prehistoric floppy and enjoy life) Cheaply and angrily.  Took with a sight for the hull <a href="http://nnm.ru/blogs/Boomburum/itogi_konkursa_ot_amdclub/">won</a> last summer from the Hiper, which is still idle.  If you want - I can make a review. <br><br>  And so - good workmanship and ease of use from a fairly well-known manufacturer, raise this device to a level above the frankly Chinese handicrafts.  If you are looking for something similar for a stationary assistant or just too lazy to get inside each time, take a closer look at <b>IcyBox</b> from <b>RaidSonic</b> - a company that specializes in working with carriers. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61664/</a></p>
