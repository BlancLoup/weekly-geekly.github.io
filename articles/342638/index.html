  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we created a new type of tariff "Turn on"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We constantly and in detail evaluate how our subscribers consume various services, and collect big-big data.  At the end of spring, following the analysis of these data, a new tariff line “Turn on!” Was launched.  In it, we went further than just offering certain sms / minutes / megabytes packages, and filled the tariffs with services depending on the use of these gigabytes.  In this post we will share interesting observations that have led us to these steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad2/f89/a26/ad2f89a261dfea35cb168a6ec436b86f.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How have tariffs evolved? </h2><br>  Package tariff plans exist since the launch of mobile networks.  Until 2007, they included minutes and SMS.  In 2007, there were bundles - package tariff plans with the inclusion of the Internet.  Just in October, it was exactly 10 years since the launch of the first bundle on the territory of the North-West region - the Lux Express tariff, where 500 MB and 500 minutes were provided for 1,200 rubles. <br><br>  Since then, the mobile Internet has taken an increasingly important place in life.  Today, 85% of young people in Russia have a smartphone.  80% of them check it as soon as they wake up.  And the use of abstract Internet goes into the use of specific mobile applications - there are already more than 2 million of them. And the number of users of social networks has already exceeded billions.

      Given the growing number of various services based on mobile Internet, the stratification of customer needs is inevitable.  He is already actively going and will continue to continue.  To ensure a 100% hit on customer needs, it is necessary to create various partnerships with companies from related markets. <br><br>  This is our mission: we connect opportunities.  And with this we understand that we have come to the conclusion that, in the direct sense of the word, we need to create a current tariff line.  So that the client could say: "This is exactly my tariff."  Old tariffs do not give such a feeling and do not allow to consume as much services as are necessary at affordable prices. <br><br><h2>  How we broke the audience </h2><br>  To develop a new tariff, from January to March we analyzed the behavior of two million subscribers with the help of big data.  The data, of course, were impersonal.  First of all, we divided two segments of mobile service users: <i>traditional</i> and <b>digital</b> subscribers. <br><br>  We will deal with the first.  Their share is about 30%.  They believe that the minimum is enough for them to communicate.  It is interesting that at least half of this group considers itself far from modern technologies.  They do not have smartphones, and they mostly use only voice communication to communicate with loved ones. <br><br>  The second category is <i>digital</i> subscribers.  More than two times more, about 70%.  For them, the mobile Internet has become everyday, and the smartphone screen is the main, first screen.  These people receive information from online media, other online resources, use online shopping, online banking, etc.  Among digital subscribers, we have identified four subgroups. <br><br><ul><li>  Active voice users.  The smartphone is used mainly for calls, and the Internet is used only to read news and check email. <br></li><li>  Minimalists - users of instant messengers.  Practically do not use voice communication, the functions of which are taken by the instant messengers. <br></li><li>  Active users of the Internet and online services.  Social networks dominate the services, but the voice communication is also important for people, they did not go to the virtual environment by 100%.  This, by the way, is the largest percentage. <br></li><li>  Premium group that uses all services - both the Internet and voice. <br></li></ul><br>  And this is how Internet scenarios are ranked by popularity among digital subscribers: <br><br><ol><li>  Social networks and email. <br></li><li>  Internet surfing, searching for information. <br></li><li>  Messengers.  Many communicate through personal messages of social networks, so WhatsApp and the company only have the third place. <br></li><li>  Video and music. <br></li><li>  Downloading content. <br></li><li>  Online shopping. <br></li><li>  Online Games. <br></li></ol><br>  And finally, a few more observations in the behavior of the audience. <br><br>  The group that speaks a lot and practically does not use Internet applications is clearly defined.  We offered such clients the tariff plan “Turn on!  Speak. <br><br>  Fans of listening to music speak less on the phone than active users of social networks.  Therefore, in the tariff line, we have provided for the product for some, and for others.  If we had made one offer, the client would have to overpay for some service that he did not need. <br><br>  Noticed another such trend.  Digital customers listen to music in services, in their playlists or friends playlists, but they prefer to turn to traditional channels, such as radio and advice from friends, to find out about new music. <br><br>  If to compare genres: music and video, then music dominates.  She is approached more often than watching movies.  For lovers of video, we have done no-limit on Youtube since November 16 within the framework of the “Turn on!  Look "and" Turn on!  Premium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edb/2b5/e12/edb2b5e12764f6bff3d015c53850f114.jpg"><br>  <i>Shooting the promo video of the "Turn on!" Line</i> <br><br><h2>  What happened </h2><br>  Following the analysis of the data, we identified six behavioral models that formed the basis of the “Turn on!” Line.  There are subscribers who write more in messengers or watch Youtube or talk, etc.  As a result, we created seven tariffs: <br><br><ul><li>  “Listen” (unlimited instant messengers and music streaming) <br></li><li>  “Communicate” (unlimited instant messengers and social networks) <br></li><li>  “Look” (unlimited instant messengers, social networks and Youtube) <br></li><li>  Write (unlimited instant messengers and SMS package included) <br></li><li>  “Speak” (unlimited instant messengers and many minutes) <br></li><li>  Premium (unlimited instant messengers, social networks, music, SMS, Youtube, large packages of everything else) <br></li></ul><br>  The results of the new approach are now visible.  If we compare the sales of tariffs "before" the new line and "after", then the picture has changed dramatically.  In our previous All Inclusive line, more than 50% were sales of a tariff with a subscription fee of about 300 rubles, and now deliberately choose more expensive tariffs for subscription fees (“Communicate”, “Listen,” “Speak”), but saturated with services, because they see In this practical use for themselves.  The share of the “Communicate”, “Listen”, “Speak” tariffs (500-600 rubles / month in Moscow and the region) accounts for more than 70% of the “Turn on!” Line. <br><br>  Creating a new successful tariff line was made possible thanks to the big data analysis and machine learning technologies, the use of which is no longer costly.  It is possible that in the near future, each subscriber will have his own tariff with personal parameters at the level of individual Internet services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342638/</a></p>
