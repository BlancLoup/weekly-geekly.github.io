We tried to collect them in this article, inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/208628">example</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Is there a black list on hh.ru of candidates and employers?</b> <br>  No, there is no blacklist.  HeadHunter does not have it and, as far as we know, other services also.  In a dispute between employers and applicants, the job site cannot take sides, so it‚Äôs up to the parties to resolve contentious issues with late applicants and visionary recruiters ‚Äî in 99% these are offenses. <br>  But there are separate locks of fraud companies (for example, trying to sell their services under the guise of selecting employees) and job seekers fraudsters who have different goals all the time, some unimaginable goals. <br><br>  <b>- Will my resume be indexed in search engines?</b> <br>  All resumes are currently not allowed for indexing in search engines, even if the visibility condition ‚Äúvisible to the whole Internet‚Äù is chosen.  It would be great to open them, but for people looking for work, this will only bring a headache (for example, it will not be removed from search engines immediately after the user's desire), so we will not do that.  As far as we know, from other job sites as well. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>- How many responses with my company will receive a vacancy programmer?</b> <br>  A medium-sized company that offers a salary slightly above market level and interesting tasks receives about 5-7 responses from applicants per week.  Of these, suitable (those that can be invited for an interview) will be half.  But in general, developers prefer that companies look for them on their own.  This means that sometimes it is worthwhile to respond if the job / vacancy has attracted - the competition will be small. <br><br>  <b>- Why employers sometimes refuse, even without looking at a resume?</b> <br>  There may be several reasons. <br>  It so happens that the right employee has already been found, and the vacancy has not yet been closed - that same human factor.  Therefore, some recruiters refuse, without looking at a resume. <br>  When responding, it is advisable to write an intelligent cover letter: short, so as not to alienate, but on business, to interest.  When there are many responses, the primary selection can be carried out by cover letter.  I didn‚Äôt like it - refusal, I liked it - they read further.  Let's leave such tactics on the conscience of those who practice it, but we must be prepared. <br><br>  <b>- How to make non-standard means resume more visible by employers?</b> <br>  Use in the text of the summary common keywords in your profession-skills that the recruiter can search for.  This concerns both the description of their experience and the filling of the field with skills.  For example, in the IT sector, the top 20 employer search queries in January-February are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/63e/bb3/dfd63ebb31b4dae48574aae40b6d6b94.png"><br><br>  Each specialization has its own set, of course, but its specialists can compose it themselves with a high degree of accuracy. <br><br>  <b>- If I have a lot of resumes on hh.ru for different tasks, will the employer be able to see them all?</b> <br>  It can, but not always. <br>  When viewing resumes on hh.ru, the employer sees the item ‚ÄúThere are still so many resumes of this candidate.‚Äù  This amount will depend on what visibility settings you have set on your resume.  If they are open to all clients of hh.ru, then the employer will see each.  If the settings are more subtle, then only those that are available to him, based on these settings, will be seen.  Therefore, if it is important for you to have different summaries for different cases and that they do not overlap, <a href="http://feedback.hh.ru/article/details/id/1897%2520%250D16">turn on</a> the visibility settings. <br><br>  <b>- Can they ban me on the job site and in what case?</b> <br>  Can  For example, you can send hundreds of responses per day with promotional messages in cover letters. <br>  But if 10 employers complain about you, saying that you are late for an interview and in general is not as experienced as you write in a resume, then you will not be banned.  This business is only yours and those employers. <br>  So if you use the site for its intended purpose, then there will never be a ban. <br><br>  <b>- If the employer turned out to be *****, how can the site help me punish him?</b> <br>  There are two options in this situation. <br>  1. On the face of a proven scheme of deception.  Here are the cases in which we will quickly prompt the company to break the relationship: <br>  - the company is not the one for whom it claims to be - registered under a false name; <br>  - the company uses the resource not to search for employees, but sends spam with its services; <br>  - the company is engaged in illegal or dubious business (for example, it is a sect, gambling is not in the permitted region, prostitution); <br>  - the company performs fraudulent operations (for example, re-issuing a pension fund); <br>  - These are MLM distributors; <br>  - Companies take money from applicants without job guarantees (for example, forward, for contacts, and not in fact from the first salary). <br>  2. In principle, he does badly with all employees, that is, he has neither conscience nor moral principles.  But it does this not for the sake of deception, but simply because business conducts it.  With such an employer, you need to solve issues with the help of the state, for example, you can start with a complaint to the labor inspectorate. <br><br>  <b>- How to make sure that my employer does not know that I am looking for a job?</b>  <b>And he will definitely not know for sure that I updated my resume if I closed access for him?</b>  <b>Do employers have workarounds?</b> <br>  When you close a resume from a company, it will not be able to see it for any money. <br>  But no one has canceled social engineering, it needs to be understood.  A company may have several hh.ru accounts for different legal entities (regional branches).  You will close from the most obvious, but you may not know about the rest.  Another option is to ask a friend-recruiter to ‚Äúpunch‚Äù some people from under his account.  But if you are trying so hard for you, then this should be nice, which means you are worth more than this company can offer. <br>  Another good option in our case is to close the resume from everyone and respond independently.  Then the resume will be automatically opened only for companies whose vacancies you responded to. <br><br>  <b>- How often can I update my resume?</b>  <b>How will this affect his appearance in search results?</b> <br>  Resume can be updated every 4 hours.  New and updated resumes are higher in employer search results.  The tactic of regular updates works well, if it is important to find a job as soon as possible, but a resume of a professional in their field will find that.  The general principles of this method work on all resources known to us in Russia.  For those who want to keep a resume in the search higher, but to go to the site every day lazy, there is an auto <a href="http://hh.ru/applicant/resume_service/renewresume">-</a> update <a href="http://hh.ru/applicant/resume_service/renewresume">service</a> . <br><br>  <b>- I want to post a resume, but I already have it filled in on another resource.</b>  <b>From which sites is import available?</b> <br>  Direct data import is only available from professional social networks Linkedin and VK, FB, G +, OK and Mail.Ru.  Recruiting sites in Russia (and in other countries too) do not allow duplicating resumes from one site to another.  But there are workarounds: upload a resume to word and upload it to hh.ru from a file.  By the way, this service has recently begun to understand the Ukrainian language :) <br><br>  <b>- If I link my account on hh.ru with Facebook (VK, G +, etc.), then employers will be able to see the link to my profile there?</b>  <b>What data from the social network will be available to companies?</b>  <b>Will information on social media binding be visible to employers?</b> <br>  Facebook and other social networks will be used by you only for authorization on the site.  No data about your profile (only if you do not specify it in the resume in the contact details) the employer does not know.  Moreover, he will not even know how you go to the site, because he only has access to a resume, which is created separately.  We do not know about other sites, we will not lie, but something tells us that this is true everywhere, because there is no sense for the joe-site to ‚Äúshoot‚Äù its applicants. <br><br>  <b>- What days and what time are job openings posted?</b>  <b>What time do employers make the most job interview invitations?</b> <br>  By the hour, the dynamics of posting vacancies lately are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/644/eb0/32e644eb07d0f97445151ee25b20d1af.png"><br><br>  It can be seen that the time for creating vacancies is very tightly tied to standard office hours in offices.  The peak of job creation falls at 10 am, and the main stream goes up to 16-17 hours. <br><br>  And by invitation and response, the picture is as follows.  For example, Moscow: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/d08/411/b2fd084111f7cf4e0671e22b01ebb80a.png"><br><br>  And Peter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ad/b24/671/2adb2467114da8396de19dcad11f053a.png"><br><br>  The St. Petersburg companies are swinging by 12-15 o'clock, and the Moscow companies make a march at 10 in the morning, and then they work exactly until 17. <br><br>  <b>- Can employers see CV comments from other companies?</b>  <b>Do employers have any resume notes, and do other employers see these marks?</b> <br>  Employers can take notes from applicants' resumes, but only recruiters from one company can see them, and then, if the author wants, notes.  Recruiters cannot make notes available to other companies, and we are not going to.  Common sense dictates that so everywhere.  Yes, job sites exist on the money of companies-employers, but such opportunities would go against common sense and business logic. <br><br>  <b>- Is there an auto-failure function on hh.ru?</b> <br>  There is no such function, and we will not do it.  At the same time, the company can customize the form of responses so that almost all the resumes of the respondent applicant can be seen immediately.  If you refuse a candidate with such settings, he will see in his office a view from this company. <br>  Other sites have no auto failures either.  However, there is a knowledge that one competitor had the function of blocking the response, if the title of the resume does not coincide with the name of the vacancy.  This was exactly before, but now there is no information about it, but who knows. <br><br>  <b>- Why do we have to specify salaries in resumes and vacancies, but not in the West?</b> <br>  In the West, too, <a href="http://www.totaljobs.com/JobSearch/JobDetails.aspx%3FJobId%3D59007513%26Keywords%3Djava%26Sort%3D4%26LTxt%3DLondon%26Radius%3D5%26distance%3D0.0%26precision%3D2">indicate</a> salary in vacancies. <br>  In general, they have a more mature labor market, which presupposes knowledge of employers and job seekers about certain wage standards, which are rarely violated.  In our country, people often ‚Äúoutbid‚Äù with large salaries, in many spheres both employers and applicants are poorly informed about standards, but what to do is cunning, and standards are not always there.  To change this situation, for example, we launched a special <a href="http://hh.ru/employer/salarystat/promo">project</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Do job sites interact with each other for the benefit of the common cause (common blacklists, directories, data formats)</b> <br>  Everyone is on its own, not even associations of Russian job sites :) But there is an international network, with a rather funny name - The Network.  It brings together the largest sites around the world: from one country - one site.  The employer can, through his local website, place a vacancy on the website of another country.  This is convenient: you open an office in China, and post jobs on <a href="http://chinahr.com/">chinahr.com</a> through the office on hh.ru. <br><br>  <b>- Does ‚Äúhh.ru‚Äù tighten up resumes and vacancies from other sources, and from which?</b> <br>  On hh.ru only ‚Äútheir own‚Äù vacancies are published, but, for example, Rabot.Mail.Ru pulls up vacancies from newspapers and magazines.  In the search clusters on the left, they are highlighted separately. <br>  As far as we know, other job sites also have only their own vacancies, even though RDV-Media (Rabota.ru) has its own Work for You newspaper, and Pronto-Moscow ( Job.ru) there is a newspaper "From hand to hand." <br>  For aggregation of vacancies from different sources there is, for example, ‚ÄúYandex.Work‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>- Is it true that few companies use the services of recruitment agencies?</b> <br>  It depends on what ‚Äúlittle‚Äù is.  Compared with the year 2000, of course, less, but not nearly as few as it may seem.  Here are the data for cities: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/091/08d/c70/09108dc7047f318e72fa2a3f5f8c8a37.png"><br>  We will be glad in the comments to help deal with what has fallen out of our sight. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217409/</a></p>
