But even in such happy moments, when gadgets and the Internet of things go to the second and third plan, you have to have a plan ‚ÄúB‚Äù, if they call and ask to connect somewhere and watch something.  Naturally, via the Internet.  Well, if the mobile operator has deployed in your locality a modern data network that satisfies the quality and speed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But my number (in the reception area) was only EDGE with dubious speed and high latency.

      I began to select a solution, it was in early 2015.  After studying the terrain, <a href="http://www.vhfdx.ru/karta-vyisot">maps of heights</a> and coverage areas of mobile operators, inspired by the experience of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/realscorp/" class="user_link">realscorp</a> from his <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/206100/">post</a> , he decided to use a bundle: parabolic reflector, 3G irradiator, 3G modem, Wi-Fi router.  It is necessary to get a complete and universal solution, sought to this.  3G target base stations were nearby (4-5 km), but were hidden by the terrain, others were very far away.  I wanted to experiment. <br><br>  <b>The starter kit collected this:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Mikrotik RB411U router, used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b52/8c1/751/b528c1751900930de3e8f112d530fc09.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Attracted the presence of a slot for a SIM card, miniPCI, miniPCIe.</i>  <i>I wanted to play with all this.</i> <br><br></li><li>  Mikrotik R52, used sold along with the router: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71b/2fc/5c3/71b2fc5c3beb51d5842a6f64f4a0a18e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>It was planned that this card will broadcast wi-fi on the site</i> <br><br></li><li>  Ericsson F3507g, used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca3/9cb/628/ca39cb628f17a8bcddc456ead53c5f9c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Took it from the <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Supported_Hardware">list of compatible equipment</a> .</i> <br><br></li><li>  A conventional power supply 12V 2A without a case, was bought in a electronics store. </li><li>  AX-2000 OFFSET, parabolic offset reflector irradiator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d10/34c/9c1/d1034c9c1a56f8186a6b3d5ee84fbdc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br></li><li>  Reflector diameter 0.6m: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/448/a6d/bb3/448a6dbb3fd904cd8ada2bf1ba4daaac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br></li><li>  Cable assembly for connecting the feed and pigtail from the modem.  N-Type (male) - N-Type (male): <i>made by myself</i> </li></ul><br>  A router with a power supply unit was packed in a Tyco hermobox, power supply 220v was brought to the connector.  The antenna and the box with the router secured on a wooden electric pole, below the wires.  Above the point on the site was not found. <br><br>  The first tests were carried out in the winter, summer residents are less - base stations are less loaded.  Signal level and network parameters looked through the Winbox utility on the PPP Info page. <br><br>  At the nearest BS brought, there is no result, the relief interferes.  After several days of adjustment, replacement of SIM cards from different operators, the signal from the Megafon BS operator was caught.  Only here the BS was not previously included in my plan because of its remoteness.  After another calculation on the height map, it turned out that this is the only option with more or less direct visibility to the BS with 3G. <br><br>  The operator is selected, the BS is selected, there is a signal (-96dbi), even the link has risen, of course, there is no normal Internet. <br><br>  <b>Bug work:</b> <br><br>  1. The signal is very weak, you may need to increase the diameter of the reflector. <br>  2. There is no way to restart the 3G miniPCIe modem on power, if you need to reset it.  RB411U does not provide power for restarting miniPCIe.  Could pokhimichit - I did not. <br>  3. I personally did not have enough Mikrotik R52 cards for stable communication with clients and routers in the territory (RB951-2n in WDS mode). <br>  4. The ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù of the base station is reflected at the signal level more than expected.  The best value was -96dbi, the worst -113dbi. <br><br>  <b>Another kit was purchased:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Mikrotik RB951G-2HnD router, used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da6/60a/3e7/da660a3e77e30faaa108a110306067fd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Two internal antennas - what you need is a USB Power Reset.</i>  <i>The hull was removed for installation in a sealed box</i> <br><br></li><li>  Modem Megaphone M150-1 (Huawei E3276), used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/822/51b/415/82251b4156313a0b7cdc01d9b3931ad6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>It has two connectors for connecting an external antenna.</i>  <i>Modem unlocked and flashed for the future</i> <br><br></li><li>  Reflector with a diameter of 130cm: <i>Waited windshield, it is steel.</i>  <i>On aluminum, as it was clamped pocket</i> </li><li>  AX-2000 OFFSET MIMO 2x2, parabolic offset reflector irradiator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34e/ff2/195/34eff2195e6c8b9d7e82af846eb7b8ed.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>To make maximum use of the capabilities of the modem</i> <br><br></li><li>  Cable assemblies are now slightly different.  N-Type (male) - SMA (male).  I had to purchase industrial manufacturing.  Pigtails are new too.  <i>A third of the second budget went on the cable, but without them nowhere</i> </li></ul><br>  Everything set in its place, connected.  Here it is the long-awaited moment of truth.  Start! <br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br><br>  1. Signal level from -89dbi to -93dbi <br>  2. The Internet is, ping 100-200ms.  Mostly 300-1000ms.  Auto adjustment of BS power is noticeable, especially in ‚Äúcountry days‚Äù. <br>  3. Now you can watch online video from a home media center in a 1.5 Mbit stream, for giving - norms.  RDP performs satisfactorily when the BS is not overloaded. <br><br>  <b>Here are some photos:</b> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246791/230f91eb"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e7/6fa/f38/5e76faf38cef25b18f16dd34a568ae01.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Somewhere there, in the distance, at a distance of 24km is the village X, the Internet is there</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246790/51446ba3"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa4/3ab/f4c/aa43abf4c833a7a52962bb3b280b8f5a.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Mount on a pole does not inspire confidence, at first glance.</i>  <i>Works without adjustment and rework for 1 year.</i>  <i>The pillar did not blow away</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246788/5248dffb"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d8/b3c/e1f/0d8b3ce1f1d6313c2734ec0ef5b60603.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>My "germobox".</i>  <i>Everything fit in a small case.</i>  <i>Despite the unstable input voltage, the power supply is alive.</i>  <i>Antennas and N-Type pigtail (female) left over from RB411U</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246786/9001bcca"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/117/a72/9b2/117a729b2a4e7eb57b29665d74494a58.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Modem works in 3G mode</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246785/02e75165"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/337/f5d/cb6/337f5dcb60c26e87581cbeb6eba7f619.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>The connectors for all the time a little oxidized, but losses have not yet been caused</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246784/3ac8c3ae"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecf/996/54e/ecf99654e0b2b373cb48f67b30f0df15.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>The plate weighs dohrena.</i>  <i>One was very difficult to install.</i>  <i>Applied a block system :-)</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246783/aa582c36"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/879/d2a/88e/879d2a88eb77b37e2a3fd34d4b0a1c4c.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Neither in the cold nor in the heat of the problems caused by extreme temperatures, was not noticed</i> <br><br> <a href="http://itmages.ru/image/view/4246782/fdd7fda3"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c51/077/ccb/c51077ccb69c6f176de371960eb71b65.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Once the system is working, it is time to optimize it.  It is necessary to optimize the monthly expenses.  The Internet is used 10 days a month, more for entertainment than for work.  I did not want to pay for packages, all the more you do not know when you need more, when less. <br><br>  <b>Cost optimization:</b> <br><br>  Caught the eye advertising Yota.  In the summer of 2015, a wave of billboards and commercials on TV reached our city.  Operator - virtual, MegaFon BS - what you need.  It is known that the most profitable unlimited - for a smartphone, it costs 250r / month.  Rate selected.  The case remains for the software "solution", or rather, for the constraints of Yota.  Unlimited tariff, but with a large number of amendments: <br><br>  1. Sim card is activated on the smartphone and, like, prescribes imei. <br>  2. Internet distribution is blocked at no extra charge. <br>  3. And the traffic, of course, is all scanned, and the ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù in the opinion of the operator is cut off. <br><br>  I will describe the solutions in two words, they are found on the Internet, the author, of course, is not me: <br><br>  1. How to change your modem's imei you can google.  As far as I know, changing imei is a crime.  I do not do it myself and do not recommend it to others; <br>  2. We have RouterOS, go IP-Firewall-Mangle, add a rule in the Postrouting link to the action Change TTL.  On a smart, as a rule, 64. <br>  <i>Now we have not a router, but a smartphone</i> ; <br>  3. We raise the encrypted VPN channel with a connection point where there is a normal channel.  The width of the channel is a little affected.  Now comes any traffic. <br><br>  Thank you for attention.  Thanks to my grandfather and family for help in alignment and testing.  Congratulations to him and all the veterans on Great Victory Day!  Of course, my wife for the support, a separate respect. <br><br>  UPD: <br><br>  <b>First set:</b> <br><ul><li>  RB411U + R52 + pigtails + antennas ~ 4500r (Avito) </li><li>  Antenna kit tricolor ~ 800r (store) </li><li>  Ericsson F3507 ~ 700r (ebay) </li><li>  Irradiator AX-2000 ~ 1200r (store) </li><li>  Power supply ~ 250r (store) </li><li>  Cables, connectors, box ~ 1500r (store) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>The second set:</b> <br><ul><li>  RB951G-2HnD ~ 2500r (on acquaintance) </li><li>  Antenna kit supral ~ 1500r (store) </li><li>  Modem E3276 ~ 500r (on acquaintance) </li><li>  Irradiator AX-2000 MIMO 2x2 ~ 1300r (shop) </li><li>  Cables, connectors, pigtails ~ 2500r (greedy store) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394007/</a></p>
