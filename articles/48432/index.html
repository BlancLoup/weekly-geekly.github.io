  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transfer website to a new domain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Gluing a domain usually occurs when it is necessary to move from one domain to another, for example, when buying a new, more beautiful address or banning one of the old search engines.  Sometimes they are glued for personal gain in order to get someone else's CY / PR, but now about the first case. <br><br>  I would like to make a reservation right away that gluing a domain is not a laborious task in itself, but rather nervous and long.  And, in my opinion, without special need it should not be done, because there will be a loss of attendance. <br><br>  But the most incorrect method of transferring a site to a new domain with minimal loss of visitors, in my opinion, will be the following: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1.</strong> <u>Domain parking as a mirror.</u>  In the same folder where the site is located, so that both sites display the same thing, but all the links inside the site should be relative, so that they do not lead from one domain to another (for example, DLE in recent versions has automatic domain pickup on static sites are also pretty easy to redo all links by mass replacement)

      Users will not even notice the first stage.  However, you can write news for regular visitors that you have a new address and it will soon become the main one in order for them to replace it in bookmarks.  If in your domain only the zone has changed, for example, from domen.info on domen.ru, then it is worthwhile to focus the attention of users on this. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> <u>Creating a robots.txt for gluing TCI.</u>  This stage also goes unnoticed by users, but rather noticeable for Yandex.  You must specify the new domain as the main mirror in the directive Host. <br><br>  An example of the contents of robots.txt, which should be put in the root of the site, can be as follows: <br><br> <code>User-agent: * <br> Disallow: <br> <br> User-agent: Yandex <br> Disallow: <br> Host: domen.ru</code> <br> <br>  You can also add the following for the Rambler, and write in support of the Rambler to change the address, there will change the address of your site in the index: <br><br> <code>User-agent: StackRambler <br> Disallow: <br> Host: domen.ru</code> <br> <br>  The lines with the User-agent indicate for robots which search engines the following entry is intended for.  In this case, Disallow does not mean a ban, but means that nothing is not prohibited, due to the lack of parameters behind it.  The Host directive is a recommendation to select a primary domain, but this does not mean that it will be the primary one. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> <u>Waiting for the Yandex Mirror.</u>  Yes, there is a miracle, when on the morning of the next day he has already walked through the sites, but more often it happens differently and his waiting is delayed for months.  At least this situation was in the summer.  In the fall, Yandex employees promised to pay attention to it and make a detour around it more regular. <br><br>  Whether the indexing robot follows the recommendations of the directive, the PIC will update the TCI on updates, and the new one will become the same as on the old site.  However, it will be possible to distinguish that on the new domain it is not real. <br><br>  If the robot follows the directive and chooses a new domain as the main domain (often this happens when you attach to a higher priority domain, for example, from domen.org.ru to domen.ru) then with several subsequent updates, the new domain will be indexed, and the old one will be dropped from the index. <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> <u>Delegation of a new domain to a hosting, not as a mirror, but as a separate site.</u>  There is an opinion that it is better to park on the same hosting and the same ip so that search engines have less doubts about your bright intentions. <br><br>  Transferring all site files to a new address, and configuring squeaks to work on it.  And on the old, the creation of such a non-complex structure in the .htaccess file for pasting PR and redirecting users to the new domain. <br><br> <code>Options +FollowSymLinks <br> RewriteEngine on <br> RewriteRule (.*) http://domen.ru/$1 [R=301,L]</code> <br> <br>  (yes, other options are possible, and there are no hosts left without mod_rewrite :) <br><br>  <strong>5.</strong> <u>Waiting for a PR update and changing links to a new address.</u>  If your site has been registered in the dmoz directory, you can write a letter to the editor of your section.  And the Yandex directory address should change automatically. <br><br>  If links were purchased in sape or similar exchanges, you should gradually purchase new ones for the new domain (although the language does not turn so many months later to call it new :), and slowly remove old links.  If you have changed links with other sites it is also better to contact partners and ask them to change the address of your site. <br><br>  Worse will not be from the fact that the links will start to lead to a new domain, and this will help bots choose the main domain for your site if you start doing this after pasting TCI. <br><br>  This knowledge was found bit by bit on the Internet on different sites, and verified by personal experience on two of its sites.  ¬© Krot </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48432/</a></p>
