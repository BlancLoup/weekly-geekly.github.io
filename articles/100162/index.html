  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moderation of applications vkontakte.ru, mail.ru, odnoklassniki.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2e/18/2e184e577184d36293c2f7a0d5410832.jpg" alt="image">  In this post I would like to share the experience of placing my application in three social networks at once, and specifically about moderation.  After all, all your months and even years of work can be thrown to the wind, if for example vkontakte.ru says that your application does not comply with the rules of placement or, for example, the color scheme does not comply with company policy (which is also quite likely).  Yes, there are risks, but what profits!  That farmer earned $ 20,000,000 for the year, you think, and a couple of months on enthusiasm, with burning eyes, write something subjectively ingenious and all the lemmings are very necessary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Vkontakte.ru </h4><br>  So your humble servant wrote, and went first to vkontakte.ru, because they do not like to give up the right of the first night, and prohibit publishing the application after it has been published in other social services.  networks of the CIS (now fortunately they have already thought better of it).  The process of adding is very simple and does not cause any questions.  In general, vkontakte.ru is adequately suited to moderation, the application was first wrapped, asked to be stitched in flash, a link to the official group.  There were no more questions - everything took about 2 weeks.  In general, moderation terms are surprising, given that vkontakte.ru has almost half of all revenues from applications.  I understand many who want to, but what prevents to hire more moderators, or to place more emphasis on post moderation. <br><br><h4>  Mail.ru </h4><br>  If vkontakte.ru thinks for a long time, but still does, then in mail.ru, when sending an application for moderation, you need to remember that you can simply forget about it.  It was the third week of waiting, and I decided to write to the support and find out if any problems may have arisen.  As it turned out, you need to remove the word mail.ru from the description and literally a couple of hours after the fix, the application appeared in the catalog.  In general, the mail.ru support service works very well, you can easily write to the API developers and very quickly get an answer or a tip, but that's another story. <br><br><h4>  dnoklassniki.ru </h4><br>  They prompted me to write this post.  Here a mixture of stupidity and bureaucracy reaches its apogee.  I am a spoiled vkontakte.ru and mail.ru, having heard that odnoklassniki.ru is opening an API for developers, I immediately rush to this virgin soil and begin to eagerly delve into how to place my application.  And then the hair on the head begins to move.  First of all, you need to place your application in a sandbox (you just need to see it, this is something written in 4 hours).  Further, having tested your application, you should ask the administration to transfer your application to the live site (continue tethering).  To do this, you need to create a task in jira, you need to ask for a login password from jira by writing an email to the support, all these steps naturally take time to total about a week.  And then the worst begins.  We give for moderation, it takes three days:

      <br>
      Moderator: please remove the general chat in the application. <br>  Me: ok, (4 days were spent on implementation, 2 days on the moderator's response) <br>  Moderator: ok, remove alcoholic drinks from gifts. <br>  I: no question (I think to myself: here is ****, I clean it during the day, I wait for two days for the moderator to answer). <br>  Moderator: OK, remove section 18+ from the app. <br>  Me: good (two days are spent on implementation, 3 days waiting for a moderator's response). <br><br>  Another week of our fruitful communication passes, the moderator gives the go-ahead, changes the status of the task and disappears.  A few days later, another person unsubscribes from the task and says that before placing the application you need to sign a contract, send scans to them, and send the original to the post office.  It takes some time to study the contract lawyer.  Sending documents, waiting.  The person next day unsubscribes, changes the status of the task and says that they are starting to plan the date of placement of the application.  Three days later, a moderator appears, writes that the requirements have changed, and your application does not correspond to them.  The result, the application did not pass moderation, all spent about a month. <br><br>  I would like to give advice to everyone, plan your business plan very carefully, if odnoklassniki.ru participate in it.  Harsh people work there. <br><br>  The application ‚ÄúReality show‚Äù, which was moderated, can be viewed <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1862073">on vkontakte.ru</a> <a href="http://my.mail.ru/cgi-bin/my/app-canvas%3Fappid%3D468421">on mail.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100162/</a></p>
