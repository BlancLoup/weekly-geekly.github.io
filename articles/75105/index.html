Day One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good evening! <br><br>  The first day of the technical conference <a href="http://msplatforma.ru/">"Platform - 2010"</a> , which takes place in Moscow, has ended.  The day was very rich and interesting, only now you can take a little breath. <br><br>  So, what makes Microsoft's IT community happy today? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I would like to note the high level of organization - everything was thought out, there were enough places, the Internet worked, the disks were distributed, and tea was drunk.  And this despite the fact that about 1500 participants arrived.

      A variety of booths, a large amount of materials, the ability to pass a certified exam for free, contests and information from partners, a football competition, xbox - this is not a complete list of what you could do during the day. <br><br>  The first thing I went to was the recording of an unofficial podcast from Microsoft, which will appear tomorrow morning.  It was very interesting to watch the podcast recording process, and, of course, to see the legendary inverted CLR book with my own eyes :-) The podcast is completely devoted to the conference and its participants. <br><br>  Now about the reports.  There were many of them and everyone could choose topics of interest for themselves. <br><br>  I was on the review of technologies and benefits of Exchange 2010, I got acquainted with SharePoint 2010. I am not familiar with these products closely, but what I heard is impressive. <br><br>  Most of all I liked the reports on Visual Studio 2010 and Microsoft StreamInsight.  In the first case, I learned more about the possibilities of using TDD, writing my own plug-ins and extensions for a C # studio, and about the correlation in the development of C # and VB.NET languages ‚Äã‚Äã(the speaker works in the <b>IDE</b> development team <b>for VB.</b> (Thanks for clarification)). <br><br>  If we talk about StreamInsight, then this is a technology that allows you to extract knowledge from relational data streams in real time.  Sounds amazing, in practice, in principle, also nothing, although it is still very damp.  From the toolkit you only need a studio, LINQ and StreamInsight, which takes about 10 MB.  Will be delivered together with SQL Server, although it has almost nothing to do with it.  I recommend to watch the recording of the report, which will soon be available on the conference website. <br><br>  The day ended with a massive drinking of beer, scientifically it was called ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù, and after all, everyone went to watch a cartoon in 3D with a goblin voice acting.  By the way, the goblin himself said a few words before the film :-). <br><br>  For now, let‚Äôs go disassemble the magazines and CDs and prepare for the sequel tomorrow. <br><br>  PS At the entrance they stuck a label on the laptop, but when it exited it was not there.  Dropped off somewhere.  But it didn‚Äôt bother the security man and they decided to check my knowledge of the color of the wallpaper on the desktop, the administrator password and the availability of shortcuts.  It is good that there was no password, the labels are standard, only the picture had to be described :-) In general, it's fun.  Tomorrow I will not take a laptop, suddenly I will forget something ... <br><br>  Upd.  There is an opportunity to watch reports online.  To do this, you can either go to the appropriate section of the conference site and watch the reports through the silverlight player in the browser.  Or using a media player at mms: //80.247.33.46/t1, where t1 is the hall number (there are 8 of them). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75105/</a></p>
