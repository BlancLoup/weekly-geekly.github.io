Special thanks to all the friends from Habr who came to visit us: I was very happy to see interested and lively faces among the mass of sophisticated journalists and bloggers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/359/e3e/65c359e3efeb99cc35fec0d9befbd9b7.jpg" alt="image">

      Under the cut, I collected a small report on the past event - a lot of photo cards inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The presentation took place within the walls of a deluxe class hotel ‚ÄúLotte Hotel‚Äù on Novinsky Boulevard.  Luxurious interior decoration and decor are perfect for a large-scale event, as we saw the launch of our long-awaited flagship Galaxy S II in sales on the Russian market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f13/00d/4b2/f1300d4b28ca5abfc0c9642ffa251251.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/c04/567/783c045670961d385fa9fa226a401029.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From 11 o'clock the flocks of guests began to pull up to our reception desk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/069/907/fa9/069907fa9eae3098e6bd34651b94d5f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By 12 o'clock, more than a hundred of diverse representatives of the glossy (and not so) press, media, as well as invited friends from social networks and communities scattered around the presentation area, where samples of new phones and tablets were exhibited.  Immediately followed by reviews and tests, discussions and comparisons of devices, which reached a peak after the official part of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/586/af5/9f0/586af59f07e941ede84e20791fb3109b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some interesting characters familiar to most of you were invited to the presentation.  We didn‚Äôt wait for one of them (the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D21_Knw7ZaJI">shock resistance</a> test of the new Galaxy Tab never took place) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/2f9/c58/4442f9c58a7ba4e6dedeeb689945535b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  but someone still honored us with his visit.  On the left is your humble servant.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c50/fda/c46/c50fdac46aa3e3aad45813452bebdc54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the beginning of the first one, all guests were gathered in the conference hall, where the main part of the event began: a presentation of the Galaxy S II and the Galaxy Tab tablets.  The first to appear on the stage was the president of the headquarters of Samsung Electronics for the CIS countries June Sang Ho.  He spoke about the hopes and expectations that the company places on flagship devices, on successes and prospects for the future.  There was mentioned the predecessor - Galaxy S, which Samsung sold around the world in the amount of 14 million units, which allowed the company to take a leading position in the mobile phone market.  Also, Mr. June voiced a curious fact: every second selling Android-based phone in Russia is a Samsung smartphone.  According to the company's management, 2011 will be truly a year of smart mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd0/c95/cc6/fd0c95cc61c878e073d65843b37ea0b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/060/dce/457060dce6d527573431d131577ddab4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After June Sang Ho, Aleksey Dorofeev, Head of Mobile Devices of Samsung Electronics Rus, spoke in more detail about the development of the smartphone and tablet PC market and about the significant contribution of Samsung Electronics to this good cause.  He noted several of the most important events and achievements that have taken place in the mobile device market and within the company over the past few years: <br><br>  - In 2010, the smartphone market grew by 60% in the world and by 160% in Russia.  Sales of Samsung smartphones over the past year increased by 3 times - by 190%. <br><br>  - In addition to the flagship Galaxy S, last year a whole line of Galaxy family smartphones was launched, the most prominent representative of which was Galaxy Ace. <br><br>  - Also in 2010, the Galaxy Tab tablet appeared, which became the sales leader in the tablet market among all competitive devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/107/d3e/c7b107d3edea95e785e4436da4b7c612.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next stage of the official part was the video review of the Galaxy S II smartphone by the well-known TV and radio host (Russia 24, Echo of Moscow) and the blogger Alexander Plyushchev.  Alexander prepared an interesting and capacious story about the characteristics and all the most interesting features, functions and features of our flagship, for which he thanks a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89c/6a6/024/89c6a6024068475f09c38c8c99ecb696.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This was followed by video messages from partners who cooperate with Samsung in filling mobile phones with content and providing them with convenient services.  Among them were: Boris Khvostichenko (product manager, Google Russia), Artem Kirakosyan (business development director at Yota Lab) and Gameloft representative. <br><br>  Boris Khvostichenko told about the popular Google services with which the Galaxy S II smartphone is equipped: voice search, navigation and translator, Artem Kirakosyan touched upon the integration of Yota Music and Yota Play services, and an unnamed Gameloft representative told about the evolution of modern games for mobile devices, noting the bestseller ‚Äú Asphalt 6: Adrenaline. "  He also noted the specially optimized game content from Gameloft, which is equipped with a new Samsung smartphone.  I had the honor to personally try it out: Gameloft provides about a dozen best-sellers, including Spiderman, Assassin's Creed, Brothers In Arms 2: Global Front, Dungeon Hunter 2, Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus and others.  All games are available in HD resolution and are truly impressive with the quality of the output. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f8/2be/de0/0f82bede07b96f4349a8316602f32e76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaa/b4a/c15/aaab4ac15ba601c2d7073d5b79eb3087.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the end of the event, the guests were shown two video reviews from a journalist and well-known blogger Anton Nosik and marketing director of the Afisha publishing house Yevgenia Galetka.  They talked about the advantages of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 8.9, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55c/5fa/c7d/55c5fac7d7f3389950cef709906bdae9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the official part, the guests returned to the lobby, where a small buffet table was held, as well as more active testing and a live overview of all the samples presented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/049/ffe/a03/049ffea0377569651f3ddda6e4129473.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caf/f00/eff/caff00eff9b0950575a84ce47ab256a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/113/c74/3d8/113c743d85cb6b68391e8ad448320075.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16e/8f0/b3a/16e8f0b3ac748f3c0d4117358529a472.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/943/19a/735/94319a7356b87fb555b42336b5e3d3c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c26/d38/ef6/c26d38ef62ee692d68a8803a06138287.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Full video from the official part of the presentation:</b> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jYBAjTlMIo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfmvfLMeVr1ewoUfBpwI1z3KrrGw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On behalf of Samsung Electronics and on my own behalf, I want to thank all Habravchan who took part in the presentation: I was very pleased to meet some of you personally.  In the future we will have many more such events, for which I will again call the most active and interested of you.
