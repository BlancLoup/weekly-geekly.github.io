      Quiet, boring, damp and dark, not like before. <br>  Yesterday I wanted to read and even started reading the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/278325/">Habr dies?</a>  in order to understand others think and write on this issue, but decided that I would pick up other people's thoughts, read it later. <br><br>  I will try to explain myself - the Internet when it was very small, and the addresses of the sites were written on business cards, - cool, <br>  when there is more information - garbage, <br>  search engines have brought a little order, then social networks, and so on and so forth. <br><br>  Now let's remember, for example, Google ten years ago, or Facebook is almost our (habrahabr) peer, and what are they now? <br><br>  It is necessary to change - of course, consistently and thoughtfully, most likely someone will say that I remembered Habr ten years ago, and someone that everything happened historically and will be right, I do not say that we stand still, but maybe we do little or not, perhaps not, or maybe not when it is needed, the main thing is that it is not late, any society is obliged to regulate itself and react to the successes and problems of its inhabitants. <br><br>  In case there is nothing to change, I tried - to improve something. <br><br>  For example, I would announce a contest for the best editor to the site, or something else. <br><br>  I tried to stir up the authorities, give them a negative rating for the lack of activity - for example, more than a year, maybe then someone can be contacted. <br><br>  I used the energy of the young and hot - I would give some weight to each of their comments and let them think that they will write or lose writing. <br><br>  I would allow not voting on fixed karma, but from the ratio of karma evaluating and estimated, respectively, the weight of the vote, and it is not terrible if I can add one hundred thousandth to the mossy Dyatka, usually it does not matter, the main thing is to be able to express my opinion, and not what is important is about the article, the commentator, or about his statement, the main lack of a sense of helplessness, cannot even thank one another, and there‚Äôs something like a spoon, and there‚Äôs nothing to pay for porridge. <br><br>  Negative voices - I would make comments, the individual not only creates a society, he also destroys him.  - if you punish someone, at least explain for what, it would ease tensions among young people <br><br>  It would not be bad to think about the rating of the article, comments, and users, I would separate them - for example, the author of the worst comment, but the best article.  or or‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I think these or - proposals will be many, how many people have so many opinions, I ask you to speak and offer, I think the UFO reads the topics and can find something useful for itself, and then the amount will turn into KAK ... honor;). <br><br>  Once again, I did not correct the article before publication and did not reread it, and I can‚Äôt see it from the side now, I wrote it as a letter to a friend, from the heart, typos and errors are possible, I will correct it myself tomorrow or in a personal. <br><br>  Good luck to all. <br>  I wanted in the heat of the time to write about auto proofreaders, checking style, etc. <br><br>  But I thought it was enough, confusion. <br><br>  I hope not violated, nor any rules. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253611/</a></p>
