In addition, the IBM Bluemix Dashboard provides capabilities for managing infrastructure elements, such as organizations and spaces, as well as user access. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ru/library/cl-bluemixfoundry/">From the point of view of IBM developers, Bluemix</a> is an opportunity to further optimize the time spent creating a cloud application.  Developers no longer have to worry about installing software or dealing with virtual machine images or hardware.  With a few mouse clicks or keys, the developer can initialize instances of his applications with the services needed to support them.

Centers usually open in regions where the community of developers, entrepreneurs, and start-ups is very active.  For example, in Bluemix Garage was opened in San Francisco, a city where many representatives of the hi-tech community live and work, and the community is constantly expanding.  This allows you to find new partners, to engage new companies in working with the cloud technologies of Bluemix. <br><br>  <b>Providing developers with access to powerful tools</b> .  Bluemix Garage centers provide developers with access to new cloud technologies and cognitive systems, such as Watson.  Thus, developers can create applications and software platforms that process a huge amount of data in seconds.  This data is generated, for example, by hundreds and thousands of IoT devices (IoT-Internet of Things, Internet of Things), including sensors, wristbands, smart phones, smart home appliances. <br><br>  <b>Training of representatives of the corporate sector principles of the startup</b> .  Here, the center's specialists demonstrate to the representatives of the business sector the opportunity to act quickly, as start-ups do, thanks to which many of them become very famous.  In addition, companies are trained to work with startups and help find partners among startups. <br><br>  <b>Creation of large technological communities</b> .  In cities where Bluemix Garage centers are located, there are many business incubators, networking groups and innovation centers.  The task of Bluemix Garage specialists is to find points of contact between all these objects and their representatives, and teach them to work together using modern technologies. <br><br>  Now IBM is actively looking for new regions, where it would be possible to open Bluemix Garage centers in order to organize the joint work of local groups of companies, startups, developers, and to ensure the joint work of the centers themselves.  Now, according to the authors of the project, such centers catalyze the creation of start-ups and hi-tech enterprises in the region where Bluemix Garage operates. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265625/</a></p>
