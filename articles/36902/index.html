  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sometimes doing business at home is better than in the office.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many entrepreneurs launching their start-ups on the Internet, start a business right from home.  Then, when he is gaining momentum, they usually rent an office, where they have to go every day.  So does the majority. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/415/de3/6b5/415de36b5d9acc8d8091d4fea7ed4081.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But Unity Stokes and Stephen Crane chose a different way - they went to work from home after a year in the office.  Their company, OrganizedWisdom (a search engine specializing in medicine), immediately after the foundation rented an office in downtown Manhattan. <br><br>  More than a year has now passed since Stokes and Crane went to work from home on their business.  And both unanimously declare that now from the house or foot!  The office times for them are gone forever.

      They sold all the unnecessary things now that were in their office, and stopped renting it.  Now everyone is working from his home.  They keep in touch with each other through IM clients like Skype and email. <br><br>  Stokes usually works directly from his apartment in West Village in Manhattan, and sometimes from a nearby cafe or park with free Wi-Fi.  Stephen thinks he can work anywhere.  Only a few things are needed: the Internet, MacBook, iPhone and his paper notebook.  That's all. <br><br>  Immediately after Stokes and Crane left the office, they began to argue how much more efficient their work from home would be.  After a year spent in this mode, they fully appreciated all the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.  First, the net savings due to the fact that they now do not need an office amounted to about 30%.  In addition, they can now hire people from anywhere in the world, not just from New York.  You can search for the best deals.  It is not necessary to spend time on the road in traffic jams in the morning and in the evening, which gives additional hours to work. <br><br>  In addition, the company saves paper and electricity.  At home, all this is used in smaller quantities than in the office.  And in general, if you look at the costs, according to JALA International, the costs per employee when using telecomputing are reduced by 30%.  This is apart from the fact that remote workers in statistics work more than their office colleagues.  In addition, according to the same JALA International, the productivity of an employee at home is 15% -20% higher than his office colleague.  In many respects, because here he is not distracted by smoke breaks, coffee and idle chatter with colleagues on non-working topics.  Indeed, after all, during working hours, we must work.  And if you also take into account the costs of each employee for gasoline, the prices for which are only increasing, it becomes clear that it will be much more profitable for him to work directly from home. <br><br>  Of course, it should be understood that in this situation the employee himself becomes the master.  It is he who should now control his working day, determining what he should do and what should not.  You need to train yourself to plan tasks and time.  This is the only way to achieve truly outstanding results. <br><br>  Well, Unity Stokes and Stephen Crane say that now they have no foot in the office.  Work at home completely suits them. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.business-opportunities.biz/">Business-Opportunities</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36902/</a></p>
