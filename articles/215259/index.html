In Ukraine, the regulatory authority in the field of communications is ‚ÄúThe National Commision, just to <i>regulate the state regulation at the link and informatization‚Äù</i> or abbreviated NKRZI <i>(‚ÄúThe National Commission for Government Regulation in the Sphere of Communication and Informatization‚Äù - NKRII)</i> . <br><br>  There are various registries on the official website, including the ‚ÄúRegister of operators and telecommunications providers‚Äù we need <i>(a link to it will be at the end of the article)</i> .  This is an .xls-file with data on enterprises - communication operators.  It contains the name, contact information, types of licensed activities, the territory of the activity.  The register is updated after each meeting of the NKRZI.  Actually, for sending, we just needed the names of the companies and their addresses.

      However, in the process of processing the document, quite specific ideas emerged about systematization of this document and the implementation of a certain statistical slice about communication operators in Ukraine. <br><br>  As of February 25, 2014  There were 3,938 entries in the registry.  One entry corresponds to one enterprise.  If an enterprise has several licenses in the field of telecom <i>(several types of services or territories of activity)</i> , then this will be simply added to the current record of the enterprise. <br><br>  Of them: <br><ul><li>  82 records of excluded businesses </li><li>  1620 entries do not have instructions on the address and territory of work and were of little use for accounting.  The data on these enterprises, most likely, were entered when the register still had a different form and did not imply specifics.  A long time ago. </li></ul><br><br>  There are 2236 records left to process. <br><br>  Although, according to the administrative division of Ukraine, the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol have a special status - I included them in the Kiev region and the Crimea, respectively - for ease of displaying data. <br><br>  In the course of information processing, the fact was noted that quite often at the same legal address there are two entries - about two different license holders.  As a rule, in order to optimize taxation, telecom operators receive a license for a legal entity and for themselves <i>(director / founder)</i> as a SPD-FL <i>(a business entity is an individual. In Russia, an Individual entrepreneur)</i> .  Also sometimes enterprises with similar names are registered, or members of the founders' family ‚Äî entrepreneurs, etc.  The absolute record is 51 companies at one address.  I will not say where. <br><br>  The following table shows the distribution of telecom operators in the regions of Ukraine.  It takes into account only those companies that operate only in this territorial area.  The companies that work in the region as a whole or only in some city / district are reflected separately. <br><br><h4>  Local telecom operators and providers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/448/1d5/df5/4481d5df54d52ab9d8e1083b8a981120.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>For reference:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Ltd. - Limited Liability Company </li><li>  PE - Private enterprise </li><li>  SPD - Business entity - individual </li><li>  JSC - Joint-stock company </li><li>  GP and KP - State enterprises and Municipal enterprises </li><li>  Others - concerns, command societies, additional liability companies </li></ul><br><br>  Just at this table the map is constructed at the beginning of the article. <br><br>  State enterprises are a block of enterprises, which, as a rule, have a connection, are not their main activity, but they need to fulfill their current production tasks - factories, ports, mines, power generating companies, educational institutions and others. <br><br>  There are 66 more companies that operate throughout the country, as well as a fairly large number of companies operating in two or more areas at once.  Information about them somewhat blurred the overall picture - because the data is divided into two tables.  In the table below, ‚Äú+1‚Äù was added for each region if an ‚Äúadjacent‚Äù company works in it.  If an enterprise covers two areas, then in two areas it will be ‚Äú+1‚Äù.  If 10 areas at once - then in 10 areas "+1".  Most likely, it will be more correct. <br><br><h4>  General picture of telecom operators and providers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fda/ef1/e25/fdaef1e25dc424de09b8c31eb0e83c1d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>"Area" - meaning - companies that work only in this area</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Related" - companies that operate in several areas</i> <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The overlay of information on the number of telecom operators and providers on the map of Ukraine showed that the ‚Äúdensity‚Äù of telecom enterprises is much higher in the eastern part of Ukraine.  Subjectively, this can be attributed to the fact that the density of population and buildings is higher in the eastern regions - therefore, there is a greater need for the Internet per square kilometer.  This stimulates the market and leads to increased competition. <br><br>  Russia also has its own Roskomnadzor registry ( <a href="http://rkn.gov.ru/opendata/7705846236-LicComm/">http://rkn.gov.ru/opendata/7705846236-LicComm/</a> ) - it contains less information, but is sufficient for analysis.  But that's another story. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Link to the "Register of operators, telecommunications providers" of Ukraine:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://nkrzi.gov.ua/index.php%3Fr%3Dsite/index%26pg%3D84%26language%3Duk">http://nkrzi.gov.ua/index.php?r=site/index&amp;pg=84&amp;language=uk</a> </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215259/</a></p>
