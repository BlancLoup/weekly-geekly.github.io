The current flagship iRobot Roomba 980, Neato Connected and the upcoming Dyson 360 Eye have the ability to synchronize with Android and iOS.  The Samsung POWERBot VR9000 model with the VR20H9050UW index that came to us (this is important) does not have such an opportunity, but this does not mean that Samsung has decided to stay away from the trend for now.  It's just that the VR9000 is not one vacuum cleaner, but a family of robot vacuum cleaners and, according to information from the Korean website Samsung ([ <a href="http://www.samsung.com/sec/consumer/living-appliances/vacuumcleaners/powerbot/VR20H9052WW">1</a> ], [ <a href="http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201503/20150316172132469/00_DJ68-00736A.pdf">2</a> ]), the model with the POWERBot VR9000 index has a VR20J9250U WiFi.  Will she get to our edges?  It is not yet known, but in the Samsung Smart Home application the corresponding functionality is incorporated and it is unlikely to go anywhere. <br><br>  You will notice that the ability to synchronize with a smartphone in a robot vacuum cleaner is not the most important thing and you will be right.  Therefore, we will try to abstract from this point and share real-world experience of using the POWERBot VR9000 VR20H9050UW, objectively assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the robot that fell into our hands - from the quality of cleaning and the effectiveness of navigation to the appearance and various trifles that emerged during the long test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94f/dcf/7f5/94fdcf7f574642cbb16ecb13ca382f2c.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br>  Dimensions: 37.8 √ó 13.5 √ó 36.2 cm. <br>  Power: 70 watts. <br>  Battery: Li-ion 21.6V (84Wh) <br>  Battery life: 60 minutes. <br>  Charging time: 160 minutes <br>  The speed of movement - 32 centimeters per minute. <br>  Maximum noise level: 76 dB. <br>  Weight: 4.8 kg

      The first thing I want to touch is the appearance of the Samsung POWERBot VR9000 VR20H9050UW (hereinafter, for convenience, we will use just the VR9000), because it really differs from machines with the shape of a flattened cylinder, which has already become traditional for this class of devices.  Yes, Samsung itself had previously sinned with a cylindrical design (for its robots of the Navibot family), but the VR9000 resembles a high-tech-hot-rod modification of the design of the Neato Botvac 85 oval halves. Although, no, Botvac 85 was still monolithic, but There is a visual segmentation, as in bulldozers, - ‚Äúbody‚Äù separately, ‚Äúbucket‚Äù separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d4/c5e/dd5/4d4c5edd5d994fcca826f1abd838cc11.JPG"><br><br>  Nevertheless, this is ‚ÄúHi-tech‚Äù because it looks modern and even futuristic.  And the ‚Äúhot rod‚Äù - because many of the most famous ‚Äúhot‚Äù modifications of the ‚Äúroadster‚Äù included a slider engine sticking out of a special cutout in the hood.  The VR9000 "engine" in the form of, in fact, the inverter engine Digital Inverter and the garbage container as much as 700 ml, just pops out.  And from the point of view of practicality, this is perhaps a minus.  After all, under the furniture with the height of the legs below his own, VR9000 will not be able to call.  But it looks really impressive.  Plus, Samsung reports that in comparison with its previous solution, the Smart Tango Automatic Vacuum Cleaner VR10F71UCAC, the VR9000 engine (30 Watts) makes it possible to achieve a 20-fold superior suction power.  About how it affected the quality of cleaning, a little later, but for now about the container. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/4b1/f37/d0a4b1f3755d473da68d043cb472cbf9.JPG"><br><br>  Of all the vacuum cleaner robots we tried, emptying the VR9000 container is the easiest and quickest.  The robot does not need to be removed from charging, just snap the container off its back, remove the side cover and you can shake it out.  The container itself has an intricate shape, since the vacuum cleaner design has a cyclone filter, the main task of which is to tear the collected dirt from the main air flow in time and send it to the container, and not to the fine filter.  As a conclusion, the filter is not clogged longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/af2/72e/76baf272e5ef4b83b9c7c22c7d35f8eb.JPG"><br><br>  On the back of the robot there is a camera eye, a small screen and a block of touch buttons for quick launch or return to base.  Using the camera, the robot builds a three-dimensional map of the room, taking into account the observed obstacles and relies on it during navigation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d56/8e8/a2e/d568e8a2e9d2491f9c447d2e58b0ccbb.JPG"><br><br>  The wheels are large, 105 mm in diameter, rubber, can be lifted to a good half of its height, covered outside with a plastic casing and decorative plates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/da6/5e3/25dda65e33b0475383b6d31d91b67562.JPG"><br><br>  Enough to crawl from one type of surface to another <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac7/253/1a7/ac72531a70bc4e5dbf8cd6ecfee967b1.JPG"><br><br>  On the belly of the robot is a single brush with a width of as much as 31 cm. A brush is precisely a brush, with a pile in two rows, softer and more rigid.  Does hair wound on her?  In the photo just below the brush after two months of home use in a family in which long hair is the norm.  The answer is yes, but not as much as it could.  Most of the hair is still in the trash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/432/689/3ad4326891ef4e3e8b2ac47e33b26655.JPG"><br><br>  Motorized brush.  How fast it turns - the vacuum cleaner determines, depending on the type of coating on which it stands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab9/5bc/e1f/ab95bce1f3d04f268ebf3acffedca3a9.JPG"><br><br>  Also on the abdomen of the robot you can see the on-off button and a pair of auxiliary wheels.  The robot is equipped with a sensor and the edge of the surface - so as not to fall accidentally from the stairs.  What is missing?  Side brushes.  More precisely, the side brush.  The second is definitely not needed, since the role of the side brush is working with baseboards, and if the robot is equipped with one on one side, that is the side it should turn to the wall along which the cleaning leads.  Does this mean that the VR9000 does not keep the baseboards clean?  Yes sir.  But, at the same time, he does not wind the tulle and curtains on this very brush, as the robots, equipped with it, do.  No one promises that by purchasing a robotic vacuum cleaner, you will forever forget about self-cleaning in your home, all robots are created to maintain cleanliness, therefore you will have to watch the baseboards personally. <br><br>  The distance from the brush to the edges of the body of the robot is 2.5 cm and 4 cm in front - just such a distance in front of the walls and impassable obstacles of the walls will remain uncleared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/923/43d/cd1/92343dcd17d54fddbd63ccd2687ddd15.JPG"><br><br>  Of all the robots that passed through our hands earlier, the most ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù was without a doubt the Neato Botvac 85 - excellent navigation, an adequate response to obstacles and, as a conclusion, making the shortest and fastest route to cleanliness in the house.  After the test, Botvac 85 was taken from us immediately, and it is not yet possible to compare it with the VR9000 head-on.  However, reviewing our video with the test of Botvac 85 and other robots, and comparing the refreshed impressions with the live work of the VR9000, we can safely say that Samsung did an excellent job on the intelligence of their car. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPBzju_Bd2c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgEZ05QFYAZvp07gCoC1i_FnrV3hA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>That same video.</i>  <i>There is also a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/240819/">text</a> version on Geektimes.</i> <br><br>  The robot builds a map of the room using the eye-camera, plus it has additional sensors and sensors for effective navigation.  Further, it is smoothly zigzagged across the entire accessible area, it does not climb on insurmountable sills.  Thick wires do not reel.  But charging from tablets and phones is better not to scatter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e3/18b/48a/5e318b48ac9541b897d5e70ca3f6ea09.JPG"><br><br>  If after cleaning there are dirty places, they can be marked with the help of a remote-laser pointer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/524/362/e9e/524362e9e760424185efe8a334c9ab22.JPG"><br><br>  It is much more convenient and easier than intercepting manual control and steer the robot itself until everything dirty becomes clean.  Pointer is, by the way, one of the unique distinctive features of VR9000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78e/8f1/efa/78e8f1efa43941a486c046e0d8127e35.JPG"><br><br>  The tendency to move chairs and other light furniture behind the robot is not noticed.  If it can drop under the bottom - calls in.  If can not, bypasses around the edges.  However, he doesn‚Äôt see the obstacles below himself until he collides with them, so it‚Äôs better to protect cat's bowls and bowls, as well as the favorite ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù places of pets with a complete virtual wall.  Check-in for charging is also quite indicative test.  And the VR9000 turned out to be the first robot, of all we tested, absolutely not ‚Äústupid‚Äù when performing this maneuver.  Just drives up to the charge and gets up.  It does not even try to drive off a meter or spin on the spot, which sometimes annoys its fellow manufacturers from other manufacturers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tKcZvOoR4g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh0cgC38D9dMh52Ku3-bku_7zqFtQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>One example of recording VR9000 behavior when cleaning a room from YouTube.</i> <br><br>  Otherwise, the quality of cleaning for the robot vacuum cleaner is excellent.  As mentioned above, almost all collected hair is not wound on a brush, but is in a garbage container.  Carpets with medium and small long nap are cleaned without problems.  As far as we know, a long thick thick pile is not given to any robot vacuum cleaner - it is impassable for them.  If we are wrong, correct in the comments.  As for tiles, laminate, parquet and other ‚Äúsimple‚Äù types of coating, their quality is clean without any complaints.  Depending on the type of pollutant, up to 100% is collected.  Overall, the quality of cleaning is excellent, the VR9000 does an excellent job with its main task, and shows a result comparable to that of the best vacuum cleaning robots we tested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/430/b9a/e13430b9ac23430aaf21edfe1d086ad9.JPG"><br><br>  One of the biggest tests prepared for home appliances and electronics is testing by children.  Children crush.  With cheerful smiles on their faces and perky laughter.  During the test, our copy of the VR9000 was filled with mugs of unfinished, cooled tea and numerous punches and all sorts of toys.  But, the main entertainment of the child was to put the handles on the vacuum cleaner and, having driven away, roll it away until some obstacle took up the blow of the racing car.  It is still a good idea to press all the virtual buttons on the device with the frenzy of a young hacker trying to either program the work schedule more interesting, or getting to the secret mode, turning the VR9000 into a Bumblebee transformer robot - the vacuum cleaner only obediently knocks and cheats.  without showing signs of discontent with such a disrespectful appeal to the miracle of South Korean thought. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65c/7fc/4be/65c7fc4be64144509b312bbe51bf14d8.JPG"><br><br>  In fact, at the first launch-two, the child reacted with caution, then the vacuum cleaner became interesting and gradually turned into a kind of favorite toy or even a pet friend.  Yes, the theme of children is inseparable from the theme of pets.  And here everything is very individual.  In our experience, some cats are robots indifferent.  Some play with them and can even sleep on them and ride.  But, by default, count on the same reaction as on a regular vacuum cleaner.  If the animal is afraid of the usual vacuum cleaner - and the robot vacuum cleaner for it will be the main enemy - a small evil hissing turtle.  And the VR9000 is not at all silent (76 dB), like all vacuum cleaning robots.  But plus it is possible to bring Silence-mode in which it becomes somewhat quieter.  And even longer runs on one charge - not an hour, but already a hundred minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/26e/4c4/19526e4c4cc04fdeb68c54b48b744dd6.JPG"><br>  <i>From this perspective, it looks more like a concept car, rather than a hot rod.</i> <br><br>  There was only one unanswered question - the price question.  On the day of the preparation of this text, the robot Samsung VR20H9050UW is available in four stores in Moscow with a price of 53,415 rubles.  up to 77,750 rubles.  Price abroad - $ 799.  For this money, he offers a powerful motor with a guarantee of ten years (the vacuum cleaner itself has a one-year warranty), a far from useless ‚Äúlaser pointer‚Äù function in the console, and perhaps the best appearance.  If you want a top-class device and you want it to also look appropriate, the VR9000 is your choice.  Similarly, in the case of a gift - a person far from the topic may not immediately appreciate the full value of the same iRobot Roomba 980 (reviewed already on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272604/">geektimes</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DygOJy4OPOdg">youtube</a> ), simply because almost all cheap Chinese robots look plus or minus as well.  Botvac 85 is different, but its design is an amateur, even if it does not detract from its merits.  But the VR9000 donated by you will not make you doubt that it is one of the coolest vacuum cleaning robots on the market.  And even in the search engine for this will not have to climb.  Samsung designers do not eat their bread for nothing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390643/</a></p>
