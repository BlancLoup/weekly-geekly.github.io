  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samara: IT clusters and crushed strawberries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few words about the Internet marathon in Samara (for details, see the <a href="http://www.internetmarafon.ru/regions/pfo/samara/2008-07-03/release/">press release</a> ), which was held in the framework of the II Interregional Economic Forum "Samara Initiative: Cluster Policy - the Basis of the Innovative Development of the National Economy". <br><br>  Here are the main conclusions that could be made in the region: <br><br><ul><li>  There is no Internet business in its pure form in the region (only Internet service is represented). </li><li>  Investments in the region will go in the near future and the theme of the IT cluster will ‚Äúsound‚Äù, if only because the authorities need it.  (what is an IT cluster and what will I eat with it later) </li><li>  The Forum is traditionally present local business elite and the bureaucratic elite.  With which you can and should build relationships. </li><li>  From year to year many ‚Äúbig‚Äù Muscovites come to the Forum (Demos, TTK, Microsoft, VneshEconomBank, ministries, etc.). </li><li>  The format of the forum is such that the conference is not the main thing, the main thing is the backstage communication and parties: the motor ship format of the round tables and the unforgettable ‚ÄúGovernor‚Äôs Reception‚Äù. </li></ul>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing that the Samara Region encounters is the roads: narrow ones, one lane each way, broken, with wagons and trailers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1fb/639/92b/1fb63992b84eeafc7f3cceae9648bc46.jpg"><br><br>  Where there are trucks and one lane - the national sport ‚Äúdeparture to the oncoming lane‚Äù will certainly be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02f/ee5/554/02fee555471c5ff445d2045a292ca5db.jpg"><br><br>  On the way from the airport to the Volzhsky Utes pension ( <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D113815907934578592931.0004525daa993377d16f3%26ll%3D53.357928,49.567566%26spn%3D0.363903,1.203003%26z%3D10">see on the map</a> ), which took 3 hours (or more than 200 km), I counted 5 accidents, not counting minor ones, like the one when the truck, crossing the oncoming lane and opening the ditch with tires, froze with rumpled cabin at the trees of the forest belt. <br><br>  Most of all I remember the autotrailer, which froze exactly in the middle of the road.  Its front end was flattened flat, and patches of green track suit stuck out of the wreckage of the cabin.  And the whole cabin seemed to have been poured with several buckets of crushed strawberries.  Another truck, as if turned into a liquid, scattered into large droplets that were randomly poured over the asphalt. <br><br>  After 20 minutes I saw the engine (only one engine!) From dozens.  After 100 meters - a lake of purple petroleum oil covering the whole road.  A fire truck stood alone on the side of the road.  A fireman was smoking on his haunches near her, another idly included a switch on watering asphalt ... Neither the rest of the dozens, the injured, nor the police ... no one else. <br><br>  The most unpleasant place is the dam.  Here the road from 2-3 close to each side is compressed to one.  The queue stretches for several kilometers.  The driver, nimblely advancing on an opposite, spoke with gusto about how his brother worked as a diver, strengthening the concrete of the dam, built back in the 30s.  From concrete, in addition to immured jerseys, bones swam in infinite volumes. <br><br>  Photos of the berth at the boarding house: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccf/3d8/bdb/ccf3d8bdb78f966b2b5e1ba162bbb855.jpg"><br><br>  View of the Volga in the evening: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e0/d27/5e2/3e0d275e29268c17b49c6234bb931521.jpg"><br><br>  As a matter of fact, the <a href="http://www.forum.economy.samregion.ru/">forum</a> was devoted to cluster policy, the development of concrete steps to introduce a cluster approach in the development of the economy both in individual regions and in the whole of Russia.  At the same time, cluster policy is considered as an effective tool for supporting national business in global competition. <br><br>  The importance of the chosen topic was confirmed in a speech by the President of the Russian Federation at a meeting of the State Council in February 2008 on the development strategy of Russia until 2020.  Among the main priorities is the increase in the rate of innovation development of the national economy.  The innovation system will be formed on the basis of cooperation and interaction of state and private institutions, openness of the dialogue between business and government, and effective regional policy. <br><br>  What is a cluster and what it is eaten with can be read <a href="http://www.cluster-center.ru/about1.html">here</a> or <a href="http://belisa.org.by/ru/izd/other/Gr2005/r33_gr2005.html">here</a> .  The whole story with clusters that aim to increase the innovativeness of the regional and national economies is similar to the question from the 20th century history textbook: in 1929 the article ‚ÄúWhy Scientists are Silent‚Äù was published.  Guys, why do you think they are silent?  Well, why, because half of them were shot, others in sharashkas, others in emigration.  This is the result of domestic policy. <br><br>  And now the state is struggling with itself.  I think that the topics of the forum would be better to do: <br>  1. Reducing the tax press and restoring order in the tax field.  At least simplify your VAT calculations. <br>  2. Optimization of all kinds of inspections, from tax, to SES and firefighters. <br>  3. Notifying registration of a small business. <br>  4. Curb raiding, the success of which rarely goes without an administrative resource. <br>  5. State support of a number of industries. <br><br>  If the state takes less care of (or in other words, milked) a business, then the ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù will create all the necessary innovations, including  in the regions. <br><br>  Reviews on the sidelines disappointing: <br>  ‚ÄúThe President mentioned something else in his speech.  and in general, the president said, the region responded "is".  but they can't do without a pointer? ‚Äù <br>  - ‚ÄúIf something is done, it means someone needs it.  Most likely, under the fashionable clusters there is a desire of the state to curb a number of "free" sectors of the economy like IT, and shove them into structures similar to the Soviet ministries. " <br>  - "... I heard that the federal government does not really support this event ..." <br><br>  However, the governor‚Äôs reception filled out all the debates on the forum and whispers on the sidelines. <br><br>  Musical group: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/295/eef/a0e/295eefa0e04fab7c67b7535a9bfe5b53.jpg"><br><br>  Heated and very colorful faces of civil servants and business representatives: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/210/65d/f6a/21065df6a2c9def18c52c1efbba190ee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa1/1ef/b86/aa11efb86ea3e7542406d751ddf044ce.jpg"><br><br>  The next day, the main events were held in the pavilion of negotiations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f0/012/84c/3f001284c9a4e84301b90cce42a727d7.jpg"><br><br>  On the pavilion's balcony: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/855/298/8f4/8552988f4c21f4ac54a33214a37c177c.jpg"><br><br>  Inside before the meetings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86d/24b/233/86d24b233d9a4abba29e6ab67a58bea9.jpg"><br><br>  Meeting Room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1b/555/b8b/d1b555b8b3e2c7ab63153655883924f4.jpg"><br><br>  My report was devoted to improving the quality of Internet resources in regional markets.  <a href="http://dmalin.livejournal.com/14562.html">Excerpts from the report see here</a> . <br><br>  Road back.  70 km on the steppe area to the highway M5.
