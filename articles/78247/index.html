And boiling ... <br>  History in 5 days <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Day One</b> - a letter to the support ‚ÄúI ask you to issue me your most expensive VIP fare‚Äù <br>  <b>Support answer</b> : the VIP fare is not connected automatically, but by hosting decision, if the account will create an increased load <br>  <b>Solution:</b> TP taken on 5 GIG, anlim sites, database and traffic (last pinned, but keep silent) <br>  <b>Second day:</b> 65 sites are transferred to the account, 30 of them are run-in, 5 are exposed to DNS Best-hoster.ru <br>  <b>The third day:</b> 5 sites started working at Best-hoster.ru, of which the most ‚Äúshipping‚Äù - the site on Joomla is 100 unique people per day, the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù - 10 <br>  <b>The fourth day</b> - night, 00.00 Moscow time - account is blocked.  No letter to the client, a complete vacuum of information. <br>  It is clear that all DNS were returned back, the morning reconciliation of SAPA showed that on all 5 sites the links were in error. <br>  <b>The fifth day</b> - after 9 (nine) hours (!!!) finally deigned to answer the support.  And he said the reason for blocking the account "server overload" (and said that at first they would consult and transfer to VIP) The answer "I do not believe" was given logies, from which it followed that the overload created the easiest website.  And most likely it was a hack-attack of a brute force attempt to select a password (the URL that created the "overload" indicated the entrance to the admin panel of the site) overloads.  And now quite well continues his life.  And does not create overloads <br>  The evening recount of the sap brought the links back to service - i.e.  there were no losses at Sapa, except for 12 hours of work on hacking up sites on Best-hoster.ru and nerve cells, it seemed there was no loss. <br>  And if all 65 sites were launched? <br>  What, because of an external attack on a single site Best-hoster.ru, blocks all 65? <br>  Cool tradition, is not it? <br>  <b>But that's not all - the position of the technical support turned out to be the most deaf.</b>  Not a single proposal to address the situation, such as this is not our business.  I had to go with a number of offers.  Of all (and there were many of them peaceful too), Best-hoster.ru chose this - money-back. <br>  But I allowed the backup to be merged (well, at least now I have all 65 sites in one archive) - I will find hosting with cPanel and fill them in one fell swoop.  <b>The last kick from Best-hoster.ru ... it was this that inspired the writing of this protest note - when the money back was squeezed, the loot ... 27% of the amount paid in as payment.</b> <br>  So let Best-hoster.ru choke on this money - and I will tell everyone to know - if your satellites carry a coin - do not go to Best-hoster.ru, if you need these money <br>  Best-hoster.ru lokit accounts indiscriminately ignoring the preliminary desire of the client to have an account with increased load data and composted the brain after that ... <br><br>  <b>After analyzing the situation, I came to a funny conclusion ...</b> 1. BEST HOSTER lacks a physical address and any phones for quick communication.  2. The practice of complete failure of BEST HOSTER to support and assist in critical situations.  3. The 100% failure to ensure the security of hosting clients is underlined.  5. Extremely low level of professional training in the BEST HOSTER support service 4. Immediate and complete closure of BEST HOSTER client accounts.  It should be surprising in its simplicity, the output ... phishing programs, other malware can be targeted by the hands of employees of this fraudulent resource for criminal purposes.  Note that as soon as their tricks, for example with phishing, these imaginary hosters are opened, they simply hang up problems on the client and merge without explanation closing the ignited account.  There can be no other reasons for such a hasty and instant account drain.  For any normal business, the interests of the client are important, but for BEST HOSTER, the client is only a means of covering up criminal acts ... We draw conclusions and try not to fall for the scammers anymore </div>
