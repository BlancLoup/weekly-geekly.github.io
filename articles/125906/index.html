  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TOP 7 - for 7 days. Marketing iPad apps on the Apple Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will start not with the methods of promotion, but with the preparation, which is no less important than the promotion and promotion of the application itself.  At once I will make a reservation that I cite as an example only paid applications and the Russian Apple Store. <br><br><img src="http://alphabet.stylemix.net/apples_image.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You just can not imagine how important the icon is 72 * 72 pixels, which is located in the program catalog.  I believe that it is better to have an attractive icon and screenshots, but the limited functionality of the application itself than the fancy functionality of the application and the nondescript icon.  A user who wanders through the AppStore, in search of something, can be attracted only by an icon and nothing more.  Make a very noticeable icon to stand out from the background with others (fewer small details), let it be contrasting colors with a bright frame or a beautiful illustration, also do not forget about the HD icon if your application is for iPad.  For an example, look at the picture with the apple and the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/russian-alphabet-hd/id451728838%3Fl%3Dru%26mt%3D8">screenshots</a> - that's what I'm talking about. <br><br>  After the user is interested in the icon and he has visited the product itself, a large-sized icon and screenshots immediately catches the eye.  I think this is one of the key points, if the user did not like the screenshots, he will not go into details, such as: description, iOS requirements, size, etc.  Only after that the user begins to view the details of the product itself.  At this stage, the description of the product becomes important, try to indicate all the advantages of your application in 214 characters.

      Before publishing an application on the AppStore, be sure to work on the following: keywords, sections (main and additional), try to specify all sections that are suitable for your application, do not save on sections, because in additional sections there is a chance to get into New &amp; Noteworthy. <br><br>  Before starting my marketing activity I read many articles, there was even such a <a href="http://touchdev.ru/documents/440">‚ÄúMarketing for mobile applications: 50 ways to promote an application under the iPhone‚Äù</a> , after reading for a long time I laughed at some points.  A couple of good reviews were published on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/63845/">‚ÄúPromotion of the program in the Apple Store, on the example of a completely specific application‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/77984/">‚ÄúHow to increase the rating of free programs in the AppStore‚Äù</a> .  Gathering everything together and testing on my application, I can draw the following specific conclusions: <br><br>  1. The publication of press releases on thematic sites.  This method has proven to be the most effective.  Type in Google a ‚Äúreview of iPad (or iPhone) applications‚Äù or ‚Äúcatalog of iPad (or iPhone) applications‚Äù, list yourself a list of sites, contact the site administrators and send them an overview of your application, including links to screenshots and itunes.  Since many people ask for promotional codes, you must be very thrifty with promotional codes, do not give more than three, this is quite enough, although many people ask for five, you remember only 50 of them. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://www.prgage.com/">PR Gage service</a> , showed itself from the best side.  I ordered the cheapest package, which costs only $ 39. <br><br>  3. Banners on thematic sites.  Almost all more or less visited sites have a link for advertisers with a price list, if not, then ask for prices for a monthly banner placement.  Many resources indicate unrealistic prices, but believe me that there are sites with a normal 15-20K traffic, at which the cost of a monthly banner placement will cost from 4,000 to 6,000 rubles, which is quite acceptable. <br><br>  4. If you have pages on social networks (facebook, vKontakte, twitter, etc.) be sure to give a link to your application.  Maybe this way of promotion is weaker than the three above, but believe that in this sector there is not much advertising, for example, I asked my friend to post a link to my application on facebook, and he has 4000 friends.  I am sure that this has a certain effect for the development of the application. <br><br>  5. Be sure to try the <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/">iPhone</a> resource, however, at the time of writing this article, the server generated 500 errors.  Try directly contacting Arthur (administrator) and ask to view your application. <br><br>  6. Regarding the review on Youtube and the application site itself, I‚Äôm not saying anymore, these are taken for granted things that must be done before the launch of the application itself. <br><br>  All of the above methods have helped us to break out in the TOP 7 most downloaded applications on the Russian AppStore.  Remember that marketing should be carried out immediately after your application has fallen into the main catalog of the AppStore, if you linger even for one day, then everything will be more expensive and longer.  Personally for myself I made a small conclusion that if the application does not pay for itself during the first month of publication, then the probability that it will pay for itself in the next month is very small. <br><br>  Yes, one more small piece of advice, it‚Äôs better to post the publication date later, no one knows how much your application will be moderated. <br><br>  Next time I will write how long it lasted in TOP 10, and what methods of promotion were used additionally (there are a couple of ideas, we will try). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125906/</a></p>
