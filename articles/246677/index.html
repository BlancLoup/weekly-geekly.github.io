This method is often used in retail to increase sales, and the success of many video games is based on neuromarketing, even the principles of R. Cialdini, which are known to every marketer, have much in common with the neuromarketing postulates.  <b>How about understanding this concept in more detail</b> ? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the definitions. <br><br>  <b>Neuromarketing</b> (section of neuroeconomics) is the art of applying cognitive attitudes, emotional and sensomotor responses in marketing, to determine the most effective ways of influencing a person. <br>  In other words, those who are well skilled in neuromarketing techniques can build advertising campaigns and predict their results with a high degree of accuracy.  It should be noted that in their research, neuromarketing specialists widely use different equipment (electroencephalographs, tomographs, galvanometers, tachistoscopes, etc.). <br>  In fact, the work of marketers, armed with neuromarketing data, aims to form cognitive distortions (i.e., change the initial point of view until it is realized and becomes a clear position of a person).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b31/5bf/8c5/b315bf8c536e44d7bf17dbd08a92f501.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Digital marketing</b> is a means of communication between the seller and the buyer, based on the use of digital communication channels (Internet, TV, mobile phone, etc.), involving two-way interaction.  It can have two forms: push (the content is delivered regardless of the person‚Äôs desire) and pull (the consumer himself searches for content).  A distinctive feature of digital marketing is that users / consumers can engage in dialogue with those who promote the product / service, almost in real time.  This is due to the fact that the communication channels have become much more than 5 more, and even more so 10 years ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd2/aca/1b9/fd2aca1b9744482aa672c17da54505a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Psychology</b> (meaning sales psychology) is the multi-component art of making deals based on working with the needs of the consumer and the ability to overcome his objections. <br><br>  When we talk about modern neuromarketing, we must bear in mind that it includes the following components: <br><br><ul><li>  from the classic psychology of sales (because the fears, objections and prejudices of the customers remained the same as they were many years ago); </li><li>  from modern digital marketing, which has become a link between the seller and the buyer (after all, personal sales, face to face, are happening today to a significant extent less than before, and this must be remembered). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Why neuromarketing + digital marketing?</b> <br><br>  The modern world market is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and the task of everyone who is somehow interested in sales is to understand how to build the communication process in a new society, which can also be called informational.  We can say that the usual marketing concepts (sales, product, etc.) have been replaced by a new one - communication.  It says that any marketing decision should be analyzed from the point of view of what communication with the consumer will be, built on its basis (by the way, <b>M.Yu. Ryumin</b> spoke about it in his 2000s, and today his conclusions and assumptions are only confirmed). <br><br>  And, simply because it is neuromarketing that makes it possible to understand how a person makes a purchasing decision, today one cannot do without it.  At the same time, the data will be the most objective, because unconscious reactions are being studied.  And digital marketing in modern realities is an ideal tool.  It is digital marketing that will convey what you wanted to say to your consumer.  It is valuable that with this kind of communication you can achieve a minimal distortion of the original message. <br><br>  <b>How to adapt neuromarketing to online sales?</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that neuromarketing and its effectiveness are talked about a lot, its implementation in the online sales process in some cases is very problematic, because instead of affecting hearing, smell, touch (kinesthetic), there is an impact on visual perception.  It is easy to guess that effective work on the Internet can only be conducted with visual and auditory channels. <br><br>  Consequently, it is necessary to get as many means of interaction with customers as possible at this level into your arsenal; in addition, it is important to give the site interactivity.  In this case, you can not do without videos, messages about promotions, updates, etc., time counters, contact collection forms. <br><br>  <b>What do buyers on the Web usually fear and how to deal with it?</b> <br><br>  First of all, the buyer has a fear of making the first purchase in an unfamiliar place (it doesn't matter if it is a vacuum cleaner or a software license payment).  So: <br><br><ul><li>  using neuromarketing, find out what causes trust and use it on the website;  As a rule, they attract attention and inspire confidence in photos of people, and at the same time positive people; </li><li>  with the help of sales psychology, it is possible to understand the client‚Äôs objection - imaginary or still true (this is possible with the help of leading the client to answers to questions that do not directly incline to purchase, but encourage him to express the most valuable thing - his opinion, and then you just have to interpret received data); </li><li>  Using digital marketing tools, inform the user that the site can and should be trusted. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e0/ec2/e22/9e0ec2e2212843fabf662fa7608c4b97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It‚Äôs not so easy <b>to buy something that is technically difficult</b> (and the product can be difficult for a particular person).  Your task is to prevent a situation when a client, while studying a product, feels like a kindergarden, seated at the wheel of a fighter. <br><br>  Here, several fears merge together, which can be revealed by knowing the psychology of sales: <br><br><ul><li>  What if <i>it</i> doesn‚Äôt work as it‚Äôs written in the ad, and I‚Äôm throwing money away for nothing, and the seller laughs at my stupidity? </li><li>  And if I can not set <i>it</i> up as it should? </li></ul><br><br>  Using digital marketing tools, it is necessary to clarify that everything works this way (for example, show a video, create step-by-step instructions with screenshots, you can offer a free trial version, but for a limited period) and make sure that the person has adapted to his purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7e/9f8/34f/c7e9f834f65b4a0f94b6486f6a25bb1a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Fear of the price</b> .  A good knowledge of sales psychology shows that this objection quite often turns out to be both true and imaginary.  To overcome it, the price must be justified.  For example, using these digital marketing tools: <br><br><ul><li>  demonstration on the video of the characteristics of the product / service or an implicit comparison with a competitor (can, again, be performed with the help of video, charts, etc.); </li><li>  a clear and detailed description of the components of the price or the possibility to save (this can be realized, for example, using infographics). </li></ul><br><br>  Ideally, it‚Äôs worthwhile to offer several price options (this, of course, is not always possible, but in some cases, Mini account owners eventually become users of the Premium version). <br><br>  Available <b>negative experience</b> .  This is one of the most difficult to work reasons for refusing purchases.  And here it is not so important who was wrong - the seller or the buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/bc6/95f/ff9bc695f64e40ec889c2d530b6e7efe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sales psychology asserts that one should admit one‚Äôs mistake (real or apparent) in such a way as to save one‚Äôs ‚Äúface‚Äù and not accuse the buyer of stupidity.  By the way, the misstep effect is still working! <br><br>  If you really goof off on a massive scale, then you can tell the site visitors about it with a pop-up window or mailing.  Notify users that work has been done on the bugs, and you now know how and what needs to be changed to achieve an excellent result. <br><br>  <b>Satiety</b>  Another difficult moment.  If everything that is on the market has already been tried, and your proposal is not radically different - try to create some kind of legend or, to be much more effective, to attract opinion leaders.  Only from the industry to which your target audience belongs.  They can put in a few words about digital media about you by chance - but those who need it will be remembered! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e1/dc8/ee5/9e1dc8ee53db410aade8d6e5503ba543.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Emotional rejection</b> .  Depending on the preferences of your potential and real customers, you need to understand what exactly can cause them misunderstanding, irritation, bewilderment.  So, before using digital marketing tools, you need to test them and test them again!  Who knows, maybe your target audience is deafened by characters with glasses or overly creative personalities (or techies). <br><br>  Use the obtained data, building communication so as to be on the same wavelength with a potential client. <br><br>  Here and not do without neuromarketing.  Otherwise, how will you know what voice timbre and speed of speech your potential clients prefer, and what colors do they favor? <br><br>  Advertising in which frankly unsuccessful characters are used is destructive.  For example, when you embed a video instruction on your website, it is worth considering whether people prefer to be approached by a man or a woman?  Do research and create content that will bring you emotional acceptance. <br><br>  To be continued! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246677/</a></p>
