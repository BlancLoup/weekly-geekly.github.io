  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SchoolZhizni.ru - social network of journalists and critics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The history of Internet projects, as well as the history of any undertakings is unique.  However, at the same time, it is quite often possible to find quite funny analogies.  So the story of the project <a href="http://shkolazhizni.ru/">‚ÄúShkolaZhizni.ru‚Äù</a> resembles a Russian fairy tale, where the hero of the story was 30 years and 3 years old lying on the stove, and then suddenly jumped up and began to actively do something. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The project itself began in the time immemorial of the ‚Äúdot-com crash‚Äù era in the first half of 2000.  There was then a simple mailing list and quite calmly "lay on the stove," that is, continued to remain a mailing for more than five years.  But at the beginning of this year, something happened (apparently the stars came together) and the newsletter found its website, as well as three authors who constantly write for it instead of one.  On a freshly installed project forum, an audience of active readers began to form who were discussing new issues of the newsletter, and finally, an archive began to form on the site, which had not been done before. <br><br>  However, this was not enough.  In April 2006, <a href="http://shkolazhizni.ru/">‚ÄúSchoolLife.ru‚Äù</a> increases the frequency of publication of articles and somewhat clarifies its genre.  Since then, it has been called a "question and answer log."  And from the end of May this year, the project suddenly unfolds 360 degrees and presents its new face - a social network for journalists, writers and critics.  From this point on, anyone can become the author of the magazine and at the same time the user of the social network. <br><br>  Further history develops rapidly.  During the summer months, hundreds of new users are registered in <a href="http://shkolazhizni.ru/">‚ÄúSchoolZhiznia.ru‚Äù</a> , the site acquires more and more features of the modern Web2.0 project - a tagging system and tag cloud appear, a hierarchy of user statuses is formed, each participant gets his blog and at the same time steadily grows the quantity and quality of articles created by this unusual online edition.  Among the authors there are more and more famous bloggers, psychologists, journalists, writers.  The project participants are more and more actively involved in the discussion of each other‚Äôs articles, making their recommendations and proposals for modifying and improving the articles of their colleagues.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And, finally, the latest innovation for today is to give authors the opportunity to post on their pages not only ‚Äúformatted‚Äù articles for the magazine, but also any own literary works in any genre.  Thus, each project participant had the opportunity to form a portfolio on his page and receive comments and considerations of his colleagues not only on articles for <a href="http://shkolazhizni.ru/">SchoolZhiz.ru</a> , but also on his other works. <br><br>  And finally, the figures characterizing the project today (23.10.2006): <br>  The average number of visitors to <a href="http://shkolazhizni.ru/">the SchoolLife.ru</a> website per day is <b>2500-3500</b> people. <br>  The number of mailing subscribers is <b>64655</b> <br>  Registered authors: <b>1291</b> <br><br>  The development continues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4574/</a></p>
