Next is a translation of an article from an MailChimp employee named Chris. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once upon a time, in one of the very old releases, we added a feature called ‚Äúanswering machine‚Äù.  After nearly a million campaigns, where more than 700 million emails were sent in total, it‚Äôs time for a massive update.  This is more than just a rebranding: we have thoroughly revised the method of automated mailing, although we have retained the features characteristic of MailChimp. <br><br>  92 thousand of our customers use automatic messages.  With their help, you can carry out various marketing techniques: to attract potential customers, to train readers, to notify about the appearance of goods in stock, etc.

      Several years ago we ourselves experimented in this area, providing a wider choice to those who received our letters.  In addition, we learned from our customers, asked them questions and conducted extensive research to understand how to improve this function. <br><br>  We are proud to present you "Automation" - an upgraded program with a single interface.  "Automation" is a work with a lot of letters, simple and effective management of workflows (using several automation scripts), advanced management of the time of sending.  We invite you to a brief tour of the main functions of "Automation". <br><br>  <b>Mailing Scripts</b> <br><br>  There are many reasons for sending <a href="http://witget.com/blog/uvelichenie-prodazh-internet-magazina-5-etapov-sozdaniya-sovershennoj-email-rassylki/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D16-11">automatic messages to your subscribers</a> .  Taking into account the main ones, we have developed the Workflows feature.  Greeting a new subscriber, creating a training series of letters, even congratulations on a holiday - all this allows you to attract customers more effectively.  For eCommerce360 users, we have added scripts to send automatic emails in response to certain purchases.  For more information on creating scripts, refer to our Knowledge Base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/ac8/c3e/a70ac8c3eef24c10b58cb2ea4c4bf52a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Time management</b> <br><br>  One of the most remarkable features is the ability to control the time of sending your automatic emails.  You can set up an instant dispatch in response to one or another action - subscription, purchase, following the link.  This allows you to automatically and permanently provide the reader with relevant material.  Despite the unpredictability of these actions, the program will always track them for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/0d0/eb4/0390d0eb4d87433db6930549a6ce0a27.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Automatic advanced settings allow you to send a letter at any time of the day, to assign the exact time or time period.  Various options will ensure the delivery of the letter at the most advantageous time for you.  For more information on automatic distribution settings, refer to the Knowledge Base of the service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0e/6db/da8/b0e6dbda8837445d9e9bd6e19e569617.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Segmentation and reach</b> <br><br>  As the company grows and its marketing needs grow, the reach of automation grows with you.  Create your own rules with our segmentation tool.  Develop your own scenarios using specific criteria, list segmentation, a different number of steps in each group. <br><br>  Identify recipients by location, amount of purchases, or other criteria specific to your business.  Interested?  Try the "Find Similar Subscribers" feature from our research team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/023/227/836023227bd549469da5bc7d5fd9f009.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Detailed reporting</b> <br><br>  Automation uses a single interface to manage all your emails.  Distribute the messages in the correct order and set the send interval between them.  You can track the movement of a separate series of letters, as well as examine summary information about the status of your campaign as a whole.  The ability to view a separate send queue has been added to increase the transparency of the process.  The built-in accounting system tracks conversion and attraction, so if necessary, you can quickly make the necessary changes (the link contains information on <a href="http://witget.com/blog/4-sposoba-uvelichit-fidbek-s-pomoshhyu-e-mail-rassylki/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D16-11">what these changes can be in order to increase the feedback</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/072/aa5/cb0/072aa5cb03cc412ca16b619480d9ca57.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>To be continued</b> <br><br>  Work on "Automation" is fast and confident steps.  Our goal is to provide the client with a powerful and flexible marketing automation system in the style of MailChimp.  We consider that we have completed the task perfectly, however, we are planning further development of this platform.  We intend to conduct new research and make Automation even more useful for you. <br><br>  Successes and high conversion to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363029/</a></p>
