The demand for authenticity, quality and factual quoting has not disappeared, but it is difficult to make friends with data verification methodologies with mainstream news in an era when even serious publications are chasing clickbate.  The news of politics, economics, sports and other fields, eaten away by shortcomings, is beginning to annoy, rather than attract attention.  Formed information vacuum, which can fill the news of science.  Manipulating scientific data is not as interesting as facts in economics and politics.  Science is supported by an excellent reputation of sources - for example, there is no doubt about the credibility of the journal Nature or the accuracy of the database of biotechnological information PubMed. </p><br><p>  Nevertheless, there is often a filter between the source of scientific data and the reader, which is responsible for the quality of publications - a journalist.  You can get rid of the interlayer only if you immediately receive information from scientists.  So you can do if you subscribe to the authors of interest to you.  They are in social networks, but the information is not structured there, but the channels with video content, both personal and collected by ordinary people, are a valuable source of adapted data. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="matematika">  Maths </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLXgHnjNQP7u5vjTSpdceJ-swDCFmMZLDX">Savvateev Alexey Vladimirovich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JqhxxuWVkg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  One of the most famous popularizers of mathematics in Russia.  The link to the channel you will find 85 lectures of Savvateev, but this is only part of his rich heritage.  Here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL3edaHWrurAs8hRPEF-CzFQSaS1_VAISw">there</a> are 55 videos about game theory, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLSl-Hc01KsrEMq7DiQPecJRpVD64AM4Ee">here there</a> are 30 more short videos about various topics, and countless more videos on various channels, among which we will mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLqBfxn8OBMGpeF81icMB-x4hjuRaFXzXI">12 lectures</a> on mathematics for children. </p><br><p>  Alexey Vladimirovich is interesting not because he is a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences and an expert in the field of game theory, although this is important.  His presentation of the material is interesting, he is able to interest the child, and then switch to a listener who has studied the course of mathematical analysis.  He leads the ‚ÄúMathematics for the Humanities‚Äù and can convey the most difficult things in simple language to any listener.  Moreover, it is difficult even to establish some kind of framework in his lectures - here he, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBdzJDXwlxEs">tells</a> why he was given the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLIxkLc10wqUZvPfL22tq-Rs6CBmc9pY-t">Mikhailov Roman Valerievich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqAf5lOJZew" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Roman Mikhailov - Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, leading researcher at St. Petersburg State University, professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences, winner of the Russian Academy of Sciences award for young scientists, winner of the Moscow Mathematical Society and von Neumann scholarships at Princeton, author of more than 60 scientific papers and monographs.  As a hobby indicates dancing, juggling, the study of ornaments and oriental languages. </p><br><p>  One of the most unusual (one might even say eccentric) mathematicians of Russia.  Mikhailov‚Äôs lecture can overload your consciousness ... and then reload and fill with new knowledge not only in the field of mathematics, but also in the cosmological understanding of being.  He tells about homology and homotopy algebra, K-theory, theory of groups and group rings, category theory.  In lectures, he often uses nontrivial metaphors (for example, caution, shock content), explaining complex mathematical laws. </p><br><h2 id="fizika">  Physics </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLWM6c4vO1KRwG1reyd1HaXZ7MIM5RvoNG">Semikhatov Alexey Mikhailovich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5T7q633BnY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Although Semikhatov defended his doctoral thesis on the topic "Conformal and topological field theories and integrable systems," but his lectures cover a large number of popular topics that are understandable to students without special training.  Explains complex notions of phenomena that are ‚Äúheard‚Äù - the theory of strings, Higgs boson, black holes, gravitational waves, and so on. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLEjMyeTXfbs8ml9WhkhxrboxWCOmPRgCb">Akhmedov Emil Tofikovich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rg5Xrbn9zW8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Leading Researcher at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics named after A.I.

Suffice it to say that since 2011, Drobyshevsky, together with scientific journalist Alexander Sokolov, is developing the well-known portal <a href="http://antropogenez.ru/">Antropogenesis.ru</a> .  The scientist himself, naturally, is engaged in anthropology.

In general, regalia can be listed for a very long time.  The main reason why these lectures should be watched is a very good presentation of scientific achievements, history of life and evolution, answers to riddles of evolutionary biology of humans and other living beings. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9C0KBgAYamWho0CfM7_yA/videos">Chernigovskaya Tatyana Vladimirovna</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2FyA5eiUQI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Doctor of Philology, Doctor of Biological Sciences, a scientist in the field of neuroscience and psycholinguistics, as well as the theory of consciousness.

<h2 id="biofizika">  Biophysics </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLL8vGJwLO40-ZQ_WhPRNYOzzUZwQMWW0D">Shnol Simon El'evich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFYAEJ8dEWs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Biophysicist, historian of Soviet and Russian science, professor of the Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Physics, MSU, former head.  Doctor of Biological Sciences, author of over 200 scientific papers and several books on the history of science, was a laboratory of physical biochemistry of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences. </p><br><p>  He tells about biological systems, the theory of evolution, cosmophysical correlations of biological and physicochemical processes, the history of science.  Honored Soros Professor.  Member of the editorial board of the journal "Nature". </p><br><p>  There are several lecture playlists - for example, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLs4MrcPpk8djvYrgNgfsvbLbbZZYYeh5c">also this one</a> .  Unfortunately, the new video has not been laid out for a long time, but this is the only example in this collection. </p><br><h2 id="himiya">  Chemistry </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLXjYPjDRKDj7_nPrR6naO1jiwSZCh8KR8">Oganov Artem Romaevich</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tDIscuI2kY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Artem Organov is a chemist, physicist, theorist-crystallographer, mineralologist, materials scientist, creator of computer-aided design techniques for new materials and prediction of crystal structures.  With such a baggage of knowledge, lectures could touch any topic, but the most interesting thing happens when Organs talks about chemistry. </p><br><p>  Modern chemistry is inseparably connected with the creation of new materials - and in this topic Oganov is able to literally ‚Äúignite‚Äù the listener, talking about the revolution in materials science, the design of new materials and chemical phenomena that go beyond the usual university courses. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Far from all popularizing scientists got into the review.  Not everyone has their own channel with the lectures posted and not everyone, unfortunately, the listeners made their own channel on their own.  Someone posted a lot of video excerpts, but in fragmented form, but somewhere just the author is more represented in articles than in the video.  The review did not include popular channels that popularize science, as well as scientific journalists - all of them are already well known and have been mentioned more than once in various selections.  If, in your opinion, a scientist is suitable for the selection criteria, but was not mentioned - write about him in the comments. </p></div>
