  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attacked by the App Store: many iTunes accounts are hacked</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A mysterious app store developer for the App Store hacked iTunes user accounts and donated their own apps on their behalf, and so successfully that they brought them to the top.  Imagine 40 out of 50 applications of the American top from the category of books were added by the same developer, Thuat Nguyen.  This <a href="http://www.alexbrie.com/archives/205">was noticed by</a> two third-party developers.  And what is most surprising is not the result of the machinations with the App Store itself, but the consequence of the real number of purchases of these applications.  But, from hacked accounts. <br><br><img src="http://thenextweb.com/apple/files/2010/07/Picture-10531-499x346.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a word, Twitter strongly stirred up such events, especially as some users of ill-fated accounts talk about amounts up to $ 200, which turned out to be written off from their accounts as payment for applications that they were not going to buy.  Recent posts are already talking about a case where more than $ 600 was spent. <br><br><img src="http://thenextweb.com/apple/files/2010/07/Picture-1049-500x278.png" alt="image">

      On the other hand, the hero-developer leaves very original comments to his own applications, in order to dilute the negative reviews: <br><br><img src="http://thenextweb.com/apple/files/2010/07/Picture-1050-500x279.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This situation reigned in the App Store in the section of books as of July 4: <br><br><img src="http://thenextweb.com/apple/files/2010/07/Picture-1051-500x515.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The link to the support and to the website of the company lead to the same Home.com page.  Also, Google cannot clearly answer who this Thuat Nguyen is or what company it represents. <br><br>  So, one developer dominates the section, the rest are undeservedly pushed into the shadows, users are robbed - all this is not the best way affects the reputation of Apple, Apparently, the company still has many explanations. <br><br>  What kind of images could applications appear in tops (manga of dubious quality) is not clear from whom (because the link to the fake site), with a missing description?  This is despite the fact that applications are confirmed within a few weeks and can be rejected with the slightest mistake.  But what is even more challenging is how user accounts were broken in, and the users themselves were robbed. <br><br>  <b>What should be done.</b> <br><br>  Check your purchases, remove your bank card from iTunes and change your password. <br><br>  Some additions on the topic that have appeared over time: <br><br>  - As it became known, applications were bought not only from one Thuat Nguyen.  This raises even more concerns. <br>  - If earlier messages were coming only from American users, now the British are signaling about hacking their accounts. <br>  - Affected users prepare collective claims. <br>  - At this point, the books are removed, but the confusion continues. <br><br>  <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/07/04/appstore-hack-itunes/">Here</a> are some facts and news on the topic. <br><br>  via <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/07/04/app-store-hacked/">thenextweb.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98326/</a></p>
