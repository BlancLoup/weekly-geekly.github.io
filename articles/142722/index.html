  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copyright - the reason for the dominance of pop culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A recent introduction to the book ‚ÄúImagine that there is no copyright.  As well as reflections on the transnational corporations that control cultural assets ‚Äùby Jost Smirs and Marejk van Skendel prompted little observation that I wanted to share. <br><br>  Pop culture or mass culture - a culture that prevails among the general population.  Various notions can be put into this concept, including certain musical groups, books, films, etc. But the most important aspect is that pop culture is a cultural product that sells well.  Also, this term is associated by many with a certain level of primitivism, an appeal to the basic instincts of a person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By contrasting popular culture with an example of classical art or art house, one can observe a difference in the complexity of perception.  The blockbusters themselves carry the viewer along an uncomplicated story, carefully guarding against spiritual injuries and leading to a virtually unchanged happy end.  Many "other" works of cinema require thoughtful viewing.  This movie is almost incompatible with popcorn or chatter in the back row of the cinema. <br><br>  But the most important thing for this observation is that the main mass of pop culture is concentrated on the tops of several charts and ratings.  With all its diversity, pop culture stimulates unification and favoritism among consumers.  For the year produced a huge number of movies, books and music.  In this case, on all channels of broadcasting, we see constant faces and hear constant voices.  The reasons why new performers find it difficult to break through are rarely associated with talent - it is often enough in full.  Most often, "star applicants" for their modest results blame the lack of luck or money.  Luck and money.  Why is modern art subject to them?

      This phenomenon, everyone can select a complex of reasons at their discretion.  I, by virtue of my profession, want to draw attention to the role of the copyright protection system in this process. <br><br>  The existing system of distribution of intellectual property is based on the principle of "everything is prohibited."  The owner of the rights has an absolute at the disposal of its own product of intellectual activity.  At the same time, the distribution industry is still largely based on the activities of intermediaries, for example, the so-called  majors in music.  These companies buy the rights to the product and then operate with constantly charged royalties.  They are a kind of analogue of a medieval merchant who has a monopoly on rare goods. <br><br>  Now look at the logic of sales.  Obviously, the seller is easier to sell the same product, if the demand for it does not fall.  There is no need to provide a variety of products, if People havala.  It is profitable to accustom the consumer to a single product or type of goods by marketing the product, infiltrating all segments of society with it.  To date, this is expressed by the word "promotion".  Further, the logic of sales promotion makes more actively move to the most massive sales.  And the easier it is to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù the product, the more massive it is.  Hence the total shift of mass culture into entertainment.  From here and multi-million fees of mass performers, when other, seemingly recognized talents, are doomed to lack of money.  A simple well-sold product is most beneficial to intermediaries, because  provides maximum profits with minimum effort. <br><br>  Imagine that if the suppliers of grocery stores had the opportunity to sell one buckwheat to the buyer, teaching the consumer to it, displacing all other products.  No need to spend efforts on the withdrawal of new products, invent complex recipes, contact with perishable products.  Buckwheat!  Widespread buckwheat with payment for each swallowed grain (and for some - twice).  In the market of intellectual property suppliers managed to subjugate the market.  The consumer and in other areas has long consumed what he is told, but in the field of art it is more obvious.  And somehow more offensive. <br><br>  For a more complete analysis of the situation, it is necessary to consider examples that show the presence of an alternative mechanism.  In memory of the first pop Peter Nalich with his Internet hit, which brought the artist without additional promotion in the list of the most recognizable Russian pop stars.  The Internet has provided a direct connection of the author with the audience without intermediaries and the same direct response, expressed in the popularity of concerts, clips, albums.  However, in the midst of traditional pop culture, this team immediately became widespread with all the ensuing consequences.  But his example shows that direct contact between the author and the public, without intermediaries, serves cultural diversity. <br><br>  The Internet is capable of becoming a direct communication channel that minimizes the impact on the intermediary market.  In this case, the authors need to learn how to use it.  Not a ban, but services to attract consumers and stimulate their desire to pay for the goods should become a modern tool for the authors.  Then the consumer will indeed be able to choose, and the author can count on an adequate assessment of his talent.  Otherwise, freedom will remain only a mythological image and a slogan of modern blockbusters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142722/</a></p>
