Having registered, I got into the list of participants and began to prepare.  This is a story about how the event took place, who participated in it, what they represented, etc.  Immediately make a reservation that I first participated in such an event, so everything was "in wonder." <br><br>  Under the cat there are a lot of photos, descriptions of the submitted "hacks" (projects made by participants during the hackathon), links to source codes and video presentations of projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two days before the event, a private group was created on Facebook, where all registered participants were invited so that they could meet, form teams, ask questions to Facebook developers (who were also present in the group and willingly answered all questions).  Many precisely then formed their teams. 
      <br>

      <br>
      The first quest for the participants, even before the start of the event, was suddenly to overcome geographical cretinism: for those who had never been to Digital October (hereafter, simply the <i>center</i> ), finding it in the streets of Bersenevskaya Embankment was not at all easy.  In addition, there were no pointers. <br><br>  After overcoming this first task, at the entrance to the center we were met by pretty girls with lists of participants.  Calling the name we received "pass" - the usual stamp on hand.  In the very center, upon arrival, all participants were immediately offered to sit comfortably (one could sit in any of the halls) and have a snack.  During the entire time of the hackathon, it was possible to eat and drink deliciously: a variety of completely different foods for every taste, drinks, snacks (a la chips, sweets, hamburgers) are absolutely free and in any quantity (enough for everyone and still have left). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a2/70b/006/7a270b0060ea18cd8b0e22598f3e7949.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  At 10:30, everyone was called to the conference room and started the event with reports of Facebook developers and partners of the event.  The event was led by Simon Cross, a leading developer from London. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1d/f5d/a3e/b1df5da3ee5f6532c931de815daf5bce.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  It is worth noting that the organizers of the event took care of those who understand English poorly: you could ask for a special earphone and listen to the simultaneous translation of all the reports.  Similarly, all the English-speaking participants of the hackathon (Facebook developers, partners, Mark Zuckerberg himself) listened to the simultaneous translation of Russian speakers. <br><br>  In the first part of the event, Facebook representatives told about how the network is developing now, how many users it has (955 million active users per month, more than 500 million users every day).  The moderator in every possible way emphasized the importance of the hackathon for the social network itself: all Facebook innovations were originally invented and invented on the hackathons.  For example, Facebook Timeline was invented by 7 developers on a hackathon that took place inside the company. <br><br>  Then came the stories about the Open Graph, Graph API, the development of mobile applications for Facebook, all of them you can watch with simultaneous translation (dubbing) <a href="http://digitaloctober.ru/events/facebook_developer_hack_v_moskve">on the Digital October website</a> (I strongly advise). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c2/023/22c/6c202322c6a649cb60989c1825b30680.jpg" width="700"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/556/d46/7f7556d465f9095a8837669344428d74.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  After the reports of Facebook developers, the reports of the hackathon partners went.  They are services <a href="http://deezer.com/">Deezer</a> , <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> , <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> and <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> . <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Photos</a> .  When the time came to dinner, Simon summed up the reports, listed the directions in which we (the hackathon participants) should try to think of something, and in which we definitely shouldn‚Äôt do anything.  Simultaneously with lunch, the most important stage of the event began: in 6 hours it was necessary to invent and create a useful application / service that would use the Facebook API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b7/b54/d77/3b7b54d775f33abdd69239f3abe4b80e.jpg" width="700"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d24/c94/324/d24c943241531a646c5ba10a2d5ab2ce.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  As you can see from the photos, almost all the participants worked for MacBooks.  ‚ÄúNot poppies‚Äù were very few (out of about 200 participants). <br><br>  All days before the event and the whole day in the process of the hackathon there was a complete intrigue as to whether Mark Zuckerberg himself would come to the hackathon.  Facebook representatives diligently avoided answering this question.  And here comes the evening, it's time to register your hacks for the jury and present projects to the public.  We are going to the conference hall again, Simon thanks us for participating and says that now we will start watching the resulting hacks.  Suddenly, he stops and asks, ‚ÄúCan we first meet one guy?‚Äù After these words, Mark Zuckerberg appears on the scene. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41e/fa2/776/41efa2776f1232002d3b90d09fad20cd.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  Mark, as I expected, was a good-natured, smiling, simple guy.  Once again, he thanked us for participating, urged us to more actively develop applications and services that use all the features of Facebook, because this is access to an almost billion-strong audience, which is many times more than all local social networks. <br><br>  After the welcome speech ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbKeG_6vzw9k">video in English</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR5Qjkvk322Q">with translation</a> ), Mark joined the jury, which, in addition to Mark himself and Facebook developers, included: <br><br>  <b>Jacob Sadchikov</b> - founder of the Quintura search engine <br>  <b>Igor Matsanyuk</b> - founder of the game developer IT Territory, which later became part of Mail.ru Group, former vice-president of Mail.ru Group, investor of more than 35 projects, among which the most famous is Game Insight <br>  <b>Jovan Savovich</b> - the founder of dirty.ru and Leprer blogs <br>  <b>Ilya Zubarev</b> - senior partner of venture fund Runa Capital, founder of Rolsen, Acronis, Parallels <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/282/9a7/25f/2829a725f0336c3a7f866405ecc842cc.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  After the presentation of the jury, the hacks began directly.  In just 6 hours of the hackathon, 34 hacks were developed.  Each participant needed to tell for 2 minutes what his hack was for, how he was useful, what features Facebook uses.  It was possible to present their achievements both in English and in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b44/523/877/b445238774dec50ccfc478b013bdc37a.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Presented khaki </h4><br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> video links lead directly to the video of the hack presentation from the event.</i>  <i>I give descriptions of all the hacks as I understood them, based on the presentations.</i> <br><br>  <b>ZeroRPG</b> <br>  <a href="http://fquest.node42.org/">link to the game</a> <br>  <a href="https://github.com/klen/fquest">source</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR5Qjkvk322Q">presentation video</a> <br><br>  A game where no action is required, it‚Äôs enough to create a character and then he does everything himself.

Kolobok rolls through the virtual country, gradually slowing down the movement.  From time to time he encounters photos of your friends on his way, which is why he accelerates his movement (depending on your friend‚Äôs rating in the game, acceleration may be of different strengths). <br><br>  <b>Go we go</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR5Qjkvk322Q">presentation video</a> <br><br>  Mobile application + application in the social network.

You can respond to coming notifications about upcoming concerts by inviting friends (from the app). <br><br>  Winners in different nominations received Facebook Credits worth $ 250 + AppleTV.  The main winner, but BoostMate deservedly turned out to be, got Facebook Credits for $ 250 and a new iPad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec1/99b/66d/ec199b66dd1aed86dd9ad5b5d501890e.jpg" width="700"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5Qjkvk322Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJFLvNATjg4pl0gvxHQpnDq6awYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS: thanks to everyone who is involved in organizing this event!  It's hard for me to judge, because this is the first time I've been participating in this, but in my opinion everything went just perfect.  The only negative point: the hackathon took place on the same day as the Yandex Yet Another Conference, which made many potentially strong participants unable to participate. <br><br>  PPS: want to fix / add something - write in a personal. <br><br>  PPPS: Photo and video taken from the <a href="http://digitaloctober.ru/events/facebook_developer_hack_v_moskve">Digital October</a> site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153565/</a></p>
