  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Google Kills Organic Search</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google won the war of search engines due to the best at the time of "organic" search in the world.  Since then, the company began one interesting process - now organic results are gradually disappearing from the pages of search results, slowly giving way to products that bring Google more profit. <br><br><h4>  13% </h4><br>  This is the real percentage of "utility" - the size of the space reserved for the results of organic search for the query "auto mechanic".  At least, that's how I see everything in front of me when I am logged into my account and sit in the Tutorspree office (Note: here and hereafter, all assessments are made on the approximate number of pixels occupied in relation to the rest of the space. Many places on the page are made ‚ÄúEmpty‚Äù for the sake of usability and design - I don‚Äôt touch on the practicality of this issue, but include them in the calculations of the common space). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68f/fe4/614/68ffe4614e70cd14a8070e2fde42e0c8.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am sitting behind a 13-inch Macbook Air, the browser window size is set to ‚ÄúActual Size‚Äù.  And I only see that the rest of the page is occupied by different Google products.  Adwords ate almost 29% of the page, Google Map - a map built specifically for local results - another 7%.  You can also add a navigation bar with Google+ notifications here - it takes up 14% of the screen.

      The best result of regular, organic produce?  Wikipedia.  The next two?  Links to Yelp, a rival of Google in the search for services in the local market (however, Yelp <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1345016/000120677413000790/yelp_10k.htm">admits</a> that, despite some competition between companies, they rely most heavily on organic traffic from Google). <br><br><h4>  7% </h4><br>  This is the result of the useful results I received on the latest version of Google search in terms of organic results for the search query ‚ÄúItalian restaurant‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d92/8d0/bbe/d928d0bbe243654a991fd927d4ac1892.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Local, ‚Äúlocal‚Äù search is no longer just a search that you would like to see - this is the search that Google needs.  Most of the company's new products are associated with local search - for example, a carousel, which is filled with results from Zagat and Google+.  It takes up to 30% of free space on the page, and does it in such a nonchalantly-free manner that it is very difficult to ignore.  Organic issuance results are simply buried under the yoke of the navigation panel (14%), carousels (30%), AdWords (9%), google maps (15%) and Zagat (4%). <br><br>  The remaining 7% is all that remains for those who have been told since childhood that a well-structured page will help to be at the top of the search results. <br><br><h4>  0% </h4><br>  I take out my iPhone and google the phrase "Italian food".  And what do I see?  If I consider that I am in New York, then zero (yes, 0) organic results.  I see only half a page ads and a link to Zagat - a rating system of reviews owned by Google.  I try to scroll the screen - and then I see the map, and then - again the results of the local search ... After four scrolls, I finally get what I was looking for from the very beginning - the usual issue, consisting of organic search results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bc/654/c95/8bc654c9538580d2521ad17fde68e186.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Search = Mobile = Local </h4><br>  Everyone knows that mobile devices are the future of search.  In a <a href="http://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/the-new-multi-screen-world-study_research-studies.pdf">presentation</a> from August 2012, Google noted that approximately 63% of all searches begin with the phone (the figure is based on research, and not on global usage statistics).  Combine this idea with the <a href="http://screenwerk.com/2012/10/01/google-50-of-mobile-search-is-local/">statement</a> that 50% of mobile search is a local search, and you will get the basis for a further Google development strategy. <br><br>  Google continues to refine its search engine, and it's great - but now the search is at the mercy of other company products.  If you, God forbid, step into its territory - beware, you are under the gun.  Your chances of getting to the top of the issuance are plummeting. <br><br>  The worst thing is that if you sell your services or products over the Internet, then regardless of whether you belong to a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù business, or trying to compete with Google, the company still sees you as a competitor.  The search terms ‚Äúcamera‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy a shirt‚Äù will lead to approximately the same result - a screen full of offers from different Google products, and a decreasing number of real results from day to day. <br><br>  Yes, this ‚Äúplayground‚Äù belongs to Google - and now you have to pay if you want to play it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185284/</a></p>
