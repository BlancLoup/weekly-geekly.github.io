But, you must admit that every day, several times, sweep the filler around the tray and determine by smell that it is time to change it - a bit annoying.  And if the cat is not alone at home?  Then all concerns increase proportionally. <br><br>  For many years I was worried about the organization of cat litter.  Everyone was thinking how to make his life easier (the question of abandoning cats in the house was not discussed).  Teach cats to the trays with the mesh, to the trays without the mesh, to the toilet with a shelf and so on.  All these were half measures.

      After buying an apartment in a new building, I decided to provide a separate toilet for cats (we have three) and somehow automate the process.  Around the era of computerization, and cats dig in the filler!  Repair contributed to this, it was possible to immediately bring communications. <br><br>  The search for solutions on the Internet led to the purchase of an automatic toilet by an Austrian company, whose advertising convinced me of the correctness of the chosen direction.  The toilet connected to the plumbing and sewage system, the flush was automatic after the cat left the toilet. <br>  I paid for the toilet, the power supply and the key fob for setting up the toilet functions - more than 17 thousand rubles.  The money was big, but the end justified the means. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The toilet had a training tray, which was placed in its bowl and a filler was poured into it.  The cats understood where they needed to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and it was time to remove the tray. <br><br>  It was the last day of euphoria, and support calls started.  Omitting all the subtleties and peripetia of this period, I will say only one thing - the tray is very, very, very far from its advertising.  He worked so poorly that it was just a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù!  Immediately became very sorry for 17 thousand and those costs that went to the supply of communications. <br><br>  When I realized that I had fallen, I got a dilemma: ‚ÄúWho is to blame and what to do?‚Äù Running and proving something to someone is unpromising.  I decided to correct the situation myself. <br><br>  The result of two years of work was the current model of the toilet, which is free from the shortcomings of the prototype.  The toilet is fully automatic, allowing interference with its management via the Internet.  The toilet has a new flushing principle, the priority of which is fixed on 03.04.2019 in the ROSPATENT.  The toilet determines the appearance of the cat in the bowl, and monitors its movement throughout the process.  After the cat left the tray - paused.  If the cat is no longer in the zone of visibility of the sensor, it begins flushing.  If the sensor sees the cat before the flush, the pause is repeated.  Flush is performed with a small jet pressure.  Washout can be single, double, etc., to better clean the bowl.  The duration of the flush is set by the time relay.  After the end of the flush, the toilet goes into standby mode.  Further process repeats.  Possible (in the presence of Wi-Fi in the house), washed over the Internet using a smartphone.  If, at the time of control from the smartphone, there is a cat in the toilet bowl, then external control will be blocked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ld/yq/f3/ldyqf38ppaousvxjzpqzfrv26u8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The toilet detected movement, lights turned on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b4/53/d2/b453d2beazqs44h0njwu-ufuugi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Countdown pause time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5i/ei/ez/5ieiez-ibv5o9wg0yxceuoosuei.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Start flush. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9j/jb/w_/9jjbw_gskqc4qmdghbsjschv218.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Flush <br><br>  P / S. <br>  After actively commenting on the community, I seriously thought about making a toilet for Maine-Coon.  I ordered a large tray - more than half a meter in length.  And continuously twisted in my head: "How to wash such a volume and not to splurge on the bills for water?".  Today a solution was found!  The solution complements the patent ‚ÄúMethod of flushing an automatic cat litter‚Äù and has the prospect of a new application for an invention.  For this reason, I cannot divulge the essence of the idea, nor will it be noticeable when demonstrating the work of the toilet, but, intuition tells me that the effect will be noticeable!  Hands are already scratching, and accessories are coming! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450096/</a></p>
