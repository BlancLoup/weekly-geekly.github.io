      SoundBlaster Recon3D USB external sound card has <br>  multiplatform entity.  You can not connect this miracle device <br>  only to your PC, but also to the XBox or PlayStation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06f/d71/db6/06fd71db6091905cb94d9a5e129a7333.jpg"><br>  The sound card has a THX and Scout Mode switch. <br>  It is assumed that the scout mode will help in three-dimensional games more precisely. <br>  receive information about where the action takes place and where the sound comes from. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f17/fed/df8/f17feddf8aab09fbbfd3d0d287db6385.jpg"><br>  The front panel has two audio jacks for connecting <br>  wired headphones and microphone.  If for some reason you don‚Äôt <br>  I want to use wireless headphones, you can connect the usual. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46c/eb6/2d5/46ceb62d55b8eb219a2146882a770eb4.jpg"><br>  If Omega 3D will be used on the main <br>  purpose, on the back of the sound card there is a special slot <br>  for the transmitter where the special module is installed.  Besides, <br>  on the back there is a microUSB connector, through which the sound card <br>  communicates with computer and optical input for external source <br>  sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c7/274/974/9c72749748d48b2b7632bc6f24bfe9ca.jpg"><br><br>  Microphone volume adjustment is carried out by a switch from the right <br>  side of the external sound card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa2/b8b/365/fa2b8b365e75bba108ce9251440559a1.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone is ‚Äúunfastened‚Äù from the headset, and if the main goal is to listen <br>  music, it‚Äôs not necessary to interfere with yourself, just turn it off <br>  3.5 mm jack.  The reverse procedure takes exactly five seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aac/a36/a66/aaca36a66653166314de6a940aaf1f16.jpg"><br><br>  This is not a separate headphone cable at all, but an accessory for <br>  connect to your Xbox 360 joystick. You can use it to control <br>  volume and mute the microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45e/55f/16f/45e55f16fe3a8a53329260d5b828420e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/803/d30/abc/803d30abc11bbff182cc786bd7eebd74.jpg"><br><br>  Connection jacks are on the left earpiece.  For not very tight <br>  the adjacent rubber plug hides the microUSB connector for charging and <br>  3.5 mm jack for connecting an accessory for the Xbox 360. Slightly closer to <br>  front surface microphone jack.  Charging <br>  is carried out through the supplied cable.  It is worth noting two very <br>  important facts: first, the headset can be used in the process <br>  recharging, secondly, a fully charged headset works in <br>  for 7-8 hours, which is very important during long nightly gatherings for <br>  by computer.  And even if the headphones "sat down", do not look for a battery, but <br>  you can just connect a microUSB cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ac/21b/083/0ac21b08367eabe8b1586bd2972d8232.jpg"><br><br>  Optical cable for connecting a sound card to an external source <br>  sound is attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9a/e37/08c/e9ae3708c62f53cfbe9f2581f5728a35.jpg"><br><br>  When turned on, the outer surfaces have a nice blue <br>  backlight.  The panels are glossy and bear the Sound Blaster logo. <br>  It is difficult to say how this affects the one who sits in the headphones, but with <br>  the parties immediately see that the person does not hear others =). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e48/edc/455/e48edc45579763bc763518477b47fc4b.jpg"><br><br>  The headband is very light and comfortable, height adjustable and has <br>  Special padding at the top for soft contact with the head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31e/7cc/16d/31e7cc16de566692bf21cde9338e2187.jpg"><br><br>  Under leather ear cushions hidden 50 mm speakers.  The skin is very soft and <br>  pleasantly adjacent to the head.  Ear Pads are removed easily, but to put them on. <br>  The task back is not trivial, so do not remove it unnecessarily. <habracut><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/590/d4d/a0e/590d4da0e496562328bf497ba7504d82.jpg"><br><br>  On the left "ear" there was a place for control buttons.  There is a button <br>  on, equipped with a power indicator and charge.  When the headset <br>  on - the indicator is lit in blue, the discharged battery is indicated <br>  flashing red light, and the charging process is constantly accompanied <br>  burning red light. <br>  The volume buttons are pressed gently, the step of changing the volume <br>  small and have the ability to exactly get exactly the power of sound <br>  which will be comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c6/249/0a9/6c62490a9511514de28ad4254bf7f409.jpg"><br><br>  Headset connection is very simple.  After turning on the headphones you need <br>  Click the Connect button on the sound card.  Within a few seconds <br>  device pairing will be performed. <br><br>  In order to feel the fullness of the sound, you need to put the software <br>  software from Creative, although Windows 7 does the job <br>  playback using standard drivers. <br><br>  The software part is rich in settings, yet it is a top product. <br>  The first tab is THX TruStudio PRO.  Here you can manage the settings <br>  Surround sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56a/51a/797/56a51a797c2c7a70b3d0d36f79e57538.jpg"><br>  CrystalVoice allows you to configure the microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bb/b24/4e4/5bbb244e47e421db738be937048d172e.jpg"><br>  The configuration of the headphones does not require much effort. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4b/8cd/e8a/b4b8cde8a7d34bf4681a869bca913f8f.jpg"><br>  For watching movies, you can customize the decoding of DOLBY Digital <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/757/ef9/1cf/757ef91cf9b57b52df8f541d36ccbc39.jpg"><br>  Mixer settings are not rich, but sufficient. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fb/c4f/4fe/5fbc4f4fe30935615e88c9831b262938.jpg"><br>  The equalizer has 10 bands and a level control.  In memory laid 10 <br>  presets most frequently used by users. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e0/9d1/9cf/1e09d19cf5b55a7013cfc5ad28a76ac5.jpg"><br>  Profile can be exported to the device itself and when connected to <br>  do not reconfigure the headset to another computer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/018/9a0/d54/0189a0d54dfd4b7f6461d0476e7b39d8.jpg"><br><br>  Instead of a conclusion. <br>  The headset personally causes only positive emotions in me.  I got <br>  all that was required of me from the headphones.  I got mobility at work <br>  at the table, I got mobility and sound quality when talking on <br>  Skype  When playing in shooters, the scout mode didn‚Äôt impress me much, but this <br>  easily compensated by correct thx setting.  Long working time <br>  Headphone is also a positive feature.  External sound card included <br>  allows you to experiment a bit with the sound configuration, i, <br>  For example, I connected the speakers through it, and compared to the integrated <br>  On the motherboard, the microcircuit received a quality sound not <br>  only in headphones (surprising, yes?).  Of the shortcomings, I note only <br>  no headphones stand, it would be convenient to hang them on a beautiful <br>  stand.  For almost 9000 rubles, who ask for <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/299172/">Creative Sound</a> <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/299172/"><br></a>  <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/299172/">Blaster Recon3D Omega Wireless</a> in our retail, you can <br>  require. <br>  Shl.  These are the coolest headphones that I had to listen to. <br>  ZZY.  I did not hear Monster Beats by Dr.Dre sing. <br></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149856/</a></p>
