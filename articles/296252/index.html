      Performances can be exciting and terrifying at the same time.  A good performance can develop your business, and a bad one can lead to the loss of customers, not to mention reputation. <br><br>  The stakes are high and he constantly needs to develop his skills.  But what needs to be done to get a guaranteed result? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several key features that allow your presentation to become more efficient, which must be completed during the preparation stage of the presentation. <br><br>  We asked Christine Clifford, sales expert and author, ‚ÄúClose the deal: Turning contacts into your company's paying customers, product or services‚Äù to tell you about these features. <br><br><h5>  # 1 Tell your story with images, not text </h5><br>  Studies have shown that people perceive images better than text, especially during presentations.  If you want your presentation to be attractive and memorable, focus on the visual component. <br><br>  Clifford recommends speaking only on business and, instead of a monologue, with slides teeming with bulleted lists, show photographs illustrating various aspects of the presentation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRemember, people don't want to filter everything you say,‚Äù says Christine.  "When I speak, I almost do not use text, mostly images." <br><br><h5>  # 2 Less detail </h5><br>  Deep immersion in details can cause boredom and drowsiness, especially for those who are interested only in the main advantages.  To familiarize the audience with the offer / product / service, use large photos of the benefits. <br><br>  After you have established contact with the audience, you will face the task of delivering the details and cost to the audience, based on the information base that you prepared earlier.  Go to the details only after making sure that the basic information was accepted, and, moreover, positively. <br><br><h5>  # 3 Keep eye contact </h5><br>  It is vital to maintain eye contact with everyone in the audience.  This allows all viewers to feel involved in the process and to understand what you are saying.  Eye contact also helps increase your credibility and set up relationships for a positive end to your presentation. <br><br>  But what if there are 200 people in the hall?  ‚ÄúIn this case,‚Äú scan the horizon, ‚Äùrecommends Christine.  ‚ÄúEvery viewer has the feeling that you are looking into his eyes.‚Äù <br><br>  What do you think about virtual performances?  If possible, use services where you can see the viewer. <br><br><h5>  # 4 Thoughts are material </h5><br>  On the night before the performance, when you mentally pass through the scenario, you cannot think about how the buyer will crush your key features or how you will ‚Äúhang on‚Äù for a long time during the presentation. <br><br>  Clifford says that it is important to present a positive result in your head, for everyone, both for you and the audience.  Imagine how you conducted a successful presentation, and your product helps to solve real problems. <br><br>  When you clearly understand how everything should look, from the point of view of each participant, you can prepare a script that helps everyone achieve a positive result. <br><br><h5>  # 5 Be emotional </h5><br>  Emotions and your energy is what turns a dark presentation into a bright event.  Hold your own circus show with such enthusiasm that your customers (viewers) could not refuse you. <br><br><h5>  # 6 Practice and develop constantly </h5><br>  Practice before a small audience before each performance.  Ask your test audience to ask you the most difficult and inconvenient questions, until you can respond to any attack in your direction. <br><br>  In addition to rehearsing, you should work out every aspect of your presentation as best you can.  Having studied the question in advance, you can come up with an answer to any question from the audience.  But it is much more important that you give not just an answer, but a decision. <br><br>  Studying the issue will also allow you to better understand what your audience really cares about and turn your presentation into a constructive conversation.  Your words and actions will be highly appreciated when you speak the case and propose the solutions they need. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296252/</a></p>
