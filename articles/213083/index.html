  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash Transitions and Personal Transitions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Imagine that we live in a world of cryptography, e-commerce and free economic relations.  We use electronic means of payments, where in the basket and wallet operations performs a calculator, where microscopic amounts and huge funds are spent in numerous transactions without any problems for a negligible amount of time, with automatic accounting of taxes, fees and deductions, where we are used to shopping in electronic supermarkets and delivery to the threshold by one touch of the phone screen or mouse click.  And so, in our beautiful, convenient and debugged world of electronic payments, built on the principles of security and cryptography, with all its inherent technologies and way of thinking, soaked with mother's milk, comes a weird and strange mechanism that, as the media say, only anarchists, conspirators and criminals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You wake up in the morning, pour a cup of coffee or tea, turn on your favorite <i>informational announcer</i> and hear the news - from today the governments of the largest world countries include in the circulation a payment system based on paper in official sources called ‚Äúbanknotes‚Äù or ‚Äúbanknotes‚Äù.  Here, for example, the image of the unit of measurement of paper currency - <i>the</i> United States <i>dollar</i> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dc/def/105/7dcdef105253383f7d4bf16427622d97.jpg"><br><br>  So what we have.  A plan has just been announced for the governments of the leading world states to provide citizens with the opportunity to carry with them some of their financial well-being and to make an anonymous exchange among themselves through small pieces of colored paper with national and Masonic symbols printed on them, as well as the numbers and <i>denominations of bills</i> - which , will display the amount of wealth represented by this piece of paper.  If, of course, the <i>banknote is</i> not a fake, but this is a separate topic for conversation, about which just below.  Formally, these paper sheets are the <i>debt notes of the</i> Central Bank of each of the states, but this technical side of the matter is too complicated to fully disclose it in a few words in our example, and all that needs to be said now is that there is a lot of confusion around the topic of <i>cash.</i> quite indicative and typical for describing the level of complexity and unfriendliness of the new system to its users.

Also, you need to know that this very <i>cash</i> differs from country to country and is not repayable beyond national borders. <br><br>  For generations of people who grew up surrounded by calculators and computers, it will be a surprise that all <i>banknotes</i> have a fixed denomination of a small value, which requires users to keep with them a considerable amount of these papers, the denominations of which must be folded in mind and then counted manually to complete the transaction , as a result of which the settlement takes place, and some of the funds are returned in the form of <i>delivery</i> (the complicated process of returning a part of the money transferred to the payer) in other <i>denominations</i> already in smaller denominations.  Do not worry if this sounds frighteningly difficult, the editors at first also had problems understanding this technology, which, as it turned out, is completely unprepared for use by the average consumer, at least in its current form. <br><br>  Mike Smith, head of the Employee Training Department at the Corporation, said: ‚ÄúI cannot imagine the rapid training of tens of thousands of our employees to the new means of payment in the form of <i>cash</i> , confirmation of the authenticity of <i>bills</i> and, of course, teach them to <i>hand over the change</i> without making mistakes.  All this will require the massive introduction of special cash accounting tools and automatic machines for <i>issuing change</i> , the so-called <i>cash registers,</i> and here, of course, one cannot ignore the millions of budgets for the entire training cycle of employees and the introduction of these manual accounting systems, but in the end all this will only lead to creating queues and delays for consumers.  In addition, we will need to adopt new procedures for security and create an armed security unit to prevent theft of physical money from shops, banks or during transportation.  At the moment, I see no way to accept cash in our firm under these conditions. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/724/735/113/7247351136cd646c0c86e6d71ac41cb6.jpg"><br><br>  The launch of <i>cash has</i> provoked an immediate reaction from law enforcement agencies around the world, unanimously condemning this step. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCash payment is a completely anonymous technology, and it is absolutely impossible to track it.  This is a weapon of mass destruction, launched against law enforcement agencies, ‚Äùsays Mike Smith, who recently took the post of Director of Law Enforcement.  ‚ÄúCash is an ideal payment mechanism for criminals, drug cartels, and terrorists; they are used by groups covering prostitution and money laundering.  We still do not know exactly how to deal with this technology, and whether it will be possible at all, but we are already expecting a new generation of super-criminals, which is about to appear due to the dark, shadowy possibilities of this paper technology, thanks to which criminals can practice their own illegal operations leaving no trace and with complete impunity. " <br><br>  Further, another participant in the interview, Head Bank Governor Mike Smith, continues the started topic: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of any reason why a law-abiding citizen would need to use the technology of <i>cash</i> .  Our analysts believe that in order to use the technology of <i>banknotes</i> an urgent introduction of a license is required for individuals and enterprises who plan to use <i>cash</i> for settlements, the so-called <i>financial license</i> .  This license should provide an opportunity for legal circulation of cash only to proxies who will conduct a detailed, controlled verification <i>cash accounting system</i> , and such a license will help maintain order in the country and ensure security from criminal intent. ‚Äù <br><br>  Many analysts also have doubts about the protection against the fake of so-called <i>banknotes</i> .  ‚ÄúUltimately, with all the measures taken by states against counterfeiting their <i>bills</i> - such as special inks, visible only in certain areas of the spectrum, special types of materials used for printing <i>banknotes</i> , plastic and magnetic inserts - do not forget that these are just pieces paper.  We are fully prepared that individual criminal groups or even fraud states will print fake money to disrupt the economy of their opponents, ‚Äùsaid Mike Smith, Lead Analyst at the Journal of Analytics.  "At the same time, we are confident that <i>cash</i> will be used in legal transactions in the real world with huge discounts, given the likely risk of receiving counterfeit <i>banknotes</i> , and there is no doubt that <i>cash</i> is a huge step back in the current system of finance from modern cryptography to the antediluvian century "- he continued. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/ee1/177/b3eee11774b5f4a7b3d7c0904446db53.jpg"><br><br>  This fact is difficult to imagine, but know that the so-called <i>cash</i> works absolutely without any consumer protection.  If your <i>banknotes are</i> stolen or lost, then say goodbye to them forever - they can not be returned. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI cannot understand why there is no such authority in the system where I could call and recover my <i>cash</i> if I lose it,‚Äù says City Businessman Mike Smith, ‚ÄúWhat kind of idiotic savings and payment systems that cannot save transactions and transfer records between owners? ‚Äù <br><br>  Moreover, it seems in this entire paper system there is generally no mechanism for authenticating users making payments or transfers, let alone one that meets all modern security standards.  As soon as someone has physical control over your <i>bills</i> - he has the ability to use them as you please, there is no way to cancel the transaction, stop the transfer or at least determine who committed the theft. <br><br>  Even the simple destruction of a <i>banknote</i> , which, as you remember, just a piece of paper - leads to losses.  According to the Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, <i>crippled banknotes</i> , that is, those that are damaged by more than 51%, should be sent by mail to the bureau for special investigation, which will determine whether the <i>banknotes</i> will be replaced with new ones or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a14/5ff/18c/a145ff18c2334e4b7252e0e5245c90a9.jpg"><br><br>  It has been established that the recommended <i>Physical Wallets</i> have serious security flaws, but <i>cash</i> supporters refute these concerns by the fact that various equipment manufacturers such as the <i>Tailoring</i> <i>Company</i> or the <i>Cutting Company will</i> soon release updated and corrected <i>Physical Paper Wallets</i> made of leather and suede.  These wallets, or as they are called - <i>wallets</i> , are designed for storing <i>banknotes</i> and should fit in a trouser pocket or bag. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter your <i>banknotes are</i> safely placed in your <i>Firm Tailoring</i> wallet and securely fixed in your pants pocket, there is almost no possibility of their theft or loss, and the threat of destruction is minimized, provided you use the front, recommended research pocket for trousers most secure, ‚Äùsays Mike Smith, Vice President, Communications <i>Firm Tailoring</i> LLC. <br><br>  Some early followers of paper technology report that <i>wallets</i> have security problems.  ‚ÄúA couple of weeks ago I was in Bangkok and I forgot my <i>wallet</i> in a bar,‚Äù says Mike Smith, a tourist.  ‚ÄúWhen I came back for him the next morning, the <i>wallet</i> was in place, but all the <i>cash</i> from it simply disappeared!‚Äù We contacted the <i>wallet</i> supplier <i>Firm Tailoring</i> to find out the specifics of this attack, but the spokesman declined to comment on the basis of ‚Äúconfidentiality of financial customer issues. " <br><br>  But what to say, even criminals are not insured against problems and risks of <i>cash.</i>  The notorious ‚ÄúSilk Road‚Äù is one of the illegal marketplaces illegally organized on the outskirts of almost every city for sale of controlled substances, where sellers and customers leave their <i>wallets</i> on which their names, full of <i>banknotes</i> , are clearly imprinted in an anonymous <i>fundraising box</i> , with the help of which the exchange of <i>cash</i> for substances takes place - and so this ‚ÄúSilk Road‚Äù was mysteriously closed last week, citing the ‚Äútheft of a part of money due to an error in the process of so-called  <i>I have</i> envelopes with <i>bills</i> . "  However, technical experts believe that the following is most likely to happen: glue applied to the envelope was applied in violation of procedures, and in connection with this closure, experts remind that <i>bills</i> , in simple terms, contain not only public but also private key , and notice that giving your private key to the use of anonymous criminal elements may not be the best idea in terms of the security of your funds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/594/4a2/e875944a2e2cb13e584169ff92abb519.jpg"><br><br>  The most unusual limitation in the new technology of <i>cash</i> will be, perhaps, the fact that a transaction can only occur between operators not more than 892 mm apart, or, in other words, a <i>transaction at arm's length</i> as aptly and colorfully dubbed it <i>liberal financiers</i> , and this as a result leads to the fact that to complete the transaction, both participants in the process, simply speaking, people need to be in one place and manually transfer the necessary amount. <br><br>  This requirement from traditionalists is considered a fatal flaw in the new technology of <i>banknotes</i> . <br><br>  So, for example, Mike Smith, President of the Retail Bank, says: ‚ÄúA form of payment that cannot be used remotely cannot be used for e-commerce, in mobile devices, in an automated trading system and cannot be programmed ‚Äî in the end it does not have rights considered as a payment system in general.  I admit that <i>cash transfer</i> is an interesting experience, an unforgettable experience, one might even say, a form of performing art or a transcendent act, but this system itself cannot be used in actual conditions in the banking industry, finance and commerce. <br><br>  In addition, given the connection of <i>cash</i> and criminal activity, we will refuse to provide banking services and stop servicing the accounts of any client who uses <i>cash</i> in business or personal payments.  This is the only way to guarantee our compatibility with regulatory obligations set by the state in the field of financial control. ‚Äù <br><br>  It should be noted that if you try to use the cash of one state in another country - it will be categorically rejected.  In order for you to be able to use cash in full force while traveling, you will have to proceed to a special <i>cash exchange point</i> , which is usually tied to an airport, train station, or bank, and only works at a specific time of day, and only there you will be able to exchange the <i>cash of</i> your country for the <i>cash of the</i> one where you came to visit.  These so-called <i>exchange offices</i> take high interest for such an exchange, usually 2-3% of each operation, which means that the tourist will have to lose about 5% of <i>cash</i> for one trip only to cover the costs of currency exchange, prohibitively high for action, which, in essence, is an elementary mathematical operation of division or multiplication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b43/462/0a3/b434620a314fc62443cb946854da4642.jpg"><br><br>  Economists are amazed that the legislative initiative ignored their serious objections and accepted <i>cash</i> at the official level.  The key political tool of any Central Bank is to use positive and negative interest rates to manage economic growth.  It seems that when using <i>cash</i> , this tool will no longer be available. <br><br>  Mike Smith, Leading Economic Newspaper Browser says: ‚ÄúThe most sad day for macroeconomics has come.  If <i>cash</i> enters into circulation in sufficient quantities, this will significantly reduce the level of control over the levers of the state economy by providing depositors with a mechanism for choosing interest rates, which ultimately leads to the fact that negative interest rates will have to be abandoned, because no one will choose them.  And taking into account the fact that this process will complicate the prevention of possible crises and, of course, reduce tax levies, it is necessary to consider it in a strictly negative sense. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61c/b60/0c3/61cb600c3bc161bffad34c7599e21ca3.jpg"><br><br>  Environmentalists are also concerned about the impact of <i>cash</i> on the environment.  ‚ÄúYou might think that in 2014 we already abandoned the use of pesticides and the unreasonable use of fresh water in production, but this is not true - on cotton farms in the production cycle of materials for the manufacture of <i>banknotes</i> this is still the norm, as there is cutting scaffolding for clearing fields, cotton processing with hazardous chemicals, and then printing houses print the resulting paper with poisonous paint; after that, the received <i>banknotes</i> are transported using fossil  fuel, and all this only so that we can see the physical embodiment of the "ten" and "twenty", which can be presented in electronic form with little or no cost.  But when will we finally learn? ‚Äù, Mike Smith, recently appointed to the post of Executive Director of the Environmental Organization, is outraged. <br><br>  Ministry of Health officials also warn that <i>cash</i> can be an excellent vector for disease transmission.  ‚ÄúWe recently tested several <i>bills</i> in our laboratories, and found that each <i>bill has</i> an average of 20 times more bacteria than a seat in a private restroom,‚Äù said Mike Smith, Vice President for Research at the Clinic.  ‚ÄúOur advice is that people, if possible, should avoid contact with <i>cash</i> , and use it only when absolutely necessary.  Children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons should not handle <i>cash</i> in any circumstances. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f1/5c4/197/1f15c419702616773fdee6c0443bf554.jpg"><br><br>  Proponents of <i>cash</i> believe that this technology will eventually be very widespread and accepted around the world, and will allow for ‚Äúface-to-face transactions with the presence effect‚Äù of an average level ‚Äî not micro payments, but not mega-deals, while making invulnerable to power outages or the Internet, and as a result, humanity will enter a new era of more ‚Äúhumane‚Äù commerce. <br><br>  In this publication, we try to be open and objective towards the new technology, but still, at the moment, it is difficult for us to see positive user scenarios for cash.  , ,     <i> </i>         ,   ‚Äî    .            ,          ,     <i></i> , <i></i>  <i> </i>           . <br><br>                  ,  ,   ,            .     <i></i>          ,    ,  ,     ,      ,    ‚Äî             ,    . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c8/300/08d/3c830008d8e77c7c41fa3656900b252c.jpg"><br><br>    ,             ,           .
