Smart people on the forums said that this happened to all sites that are not present in the Yandex.Catalog. <br><br>  Oops, we thought, it seems we are being provoked to a bribe, since we filed an application for free placement for a long time, but, naturally, we didn‚Äôt get anywhere.  We all understand that there are a lot of applications and Yandex cannot consider everything, as a result we decided to pay, because our customers suffer from this, who have been waiting for months for their website created in our system to be indexed, and Yandex is all the same search engine 1 in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  The application was made and sent, then there was a correspondence proposed to readers under the cut, which killed us in the faith in a bright, open and fair Internet, this is how one official, subjectively, decides the fate of the sites at will.  Disgusting, as in real life. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

More than 100 enterprises and more than 250 goods and services are added daily on the site.  The site users leave positive reviews about the site (http://ruprom.net/testimonials), the project is actively developing.  At the moment (according to my data) this is the only such project on which the Yandex Maps service is integrated (http://stroilik.ruprom.net/contacts). <br><br>  What are your criteria for the end of the period ‚ÄúThe site is in the content phase‚Äù? <br><br>  Thanks in advance for your reply. <br><br>  Fedor Kvakin <br>  ___________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  December 17, 2008 16:37 user Platon Streltsov wrote: <br><br>  Dear Fedor Kvakin! <br><br>  When analyzing the site, the editors found that it represented not thousands of goods and services, companies, tenders, but dozens, and not for the whole of Russia, but only for several large cities.

In addition, the section appeared on the site recently. <br><br>  The number of site pages indexed by search engines is about 50 thousand.  It simply could not be if the site were posted dozens of offers of goods and services and dozens of companies. <br><br>  Pages indexed by search engines: <br>  <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3Drhost%253D">yandex.ru/yandsearch?text=rhost%3D</a> "net.ruprom" | rhost% 3D "net.ruprom. *" &amp; pag = u &amp; lr = 187 (51 thousand pages) <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/search%3Frlz%3D1C1GGLS_enUA291UA303%26aq%3Df%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8%26q%3Dsite">www.google.com.ua/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_enUA291UA303&amp;aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site</a> : ruprom.net (48 thousand pages) <br><br>  Fedor Kvakin <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  Dear Fedor Kvakin! <br><br>  From the examples you cited, it is clearly visible that the rubricator is unevenly filled: goods, services and companies are presented not from all of Russia and not from all the CIS countries, but only from large cities, and the lion's share of information falls on Moscow.  As I already wrote, so far we are not ready to recommend ruprom.net in its current form to users. <br><br>  - <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Plato Streltsov <br>  Content manager <br>  ************* <br>  Yandex Company <br>  Tel .: +7 (495) 739-70-00 ext.  3112 <br>  Fax: +7 (495) 739-70-70 <br>  <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> <br>  ************* <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  Good afternoon, Plato. <br><br>  Our site is aimed at users from Russia, so there is an overwhelming majority of companies and products from Russia, and not CIS countries and other world.  In the initial application it was stated: ‚ÄúRussian business portal‚Äù. <br><br>  As for the regions of Russia.  The situation is natural, as it displays the current distribution of Internet users in Russia. <br><br>  If we take the statistics of the Russian Internet (for example, <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/ru/regions.html">www.liveinternet.ru/stat/ru/regions.html</a> , as fairly representative), then the distribution of users by region is as follows: <br>  Moscow 41.3% <br>  St. Petersburg 12.4% <br>  Yekaterinburg 3.8% <br>  Novosibirsk 2.6% <br>  Krasnodar 2.1% <br>  Perm 1.8% <br>  Vladivostok 1.8% <br>  ... <br><br>  Thus, on any Russian Internet site most of the information will be from Moscow.  This is proved by your catalog (http://yaca.yandex.ru/yca/geo/Russia/) - Sites in the heading: 61918, Moscow and region: 30296. That is, in your catalog the lion's share (half) of sites falls on Moscow and the region.  The situation is similar to our site <a href="http://ruprom.net/">ruprom.net</a> . <br><br>  Information content of the site. <br>  It seems to us that the site <a href="http://ruprom.net/">ruprom.net</a> may be more relevant for recommending users than many similar sites from your catalog. <br><br>  A few examples below, and I'm sure you can find a lot more: <br>  Heading catalog "Business / Production and Delivery / Universal" (http://yaca.yandex.ru/yca/cat/Business/Production/General/) <br><br>  Site number 5 in the category <a href="http://www.oborudka.ru/">www.oborudka.ru</a> <br>  The section ‚ÄúEnterprises‚Äù (http://www.oborudka.ru/firms.php) - presented 7 (seven) companies <br>  Section "Bulletin Board" (http://www.oborudka.ru/board.php) - 65 (sixty-five) announcements are presented <br>  The ‚ÄúTenders‚Äù section (http://www.oborudka.ru/tenders.php) - 1 (one) tender has been submitted <br><br>  Site number 9 under <a href="http://www.rtu.ru/">www.rtu.ru</a> <br>  The site contains 10,000 ads (less than our products and services).  In addition, on the advertisement page (http://www.rtu.ru/m_20030623193336) 7 banners and blocks of contextual advertising.  It seems to me that this is a website for making money on advertising, and not for people, as Yandex calls to do. <br><br>  Site number 22 in the <a href="http://comincity.com/">comincity.com</a> category <br>  No link on the site is working, the home page is shown all the time.  Only the sales links at the bottom of the page work.  Attendance - 40 visitors per day.  I think this site is not very useful to people. <br><br>  Website ‚Ññ54 in the category <a href="http://www.tpl.ru/">www.tpl.ru</a> <br>  Companies on the site: 314. Probably the lion‚Äôs share from Moscow. <br><br>  I hope for your common sense. <br><br>  Fedor Kvakin <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  Dear Fedor Kvakin! <br><br>  Sorry, but our decision will be reviewed only when the volume <br>  information on the site will increase significantly. <br><br>  Your site information will be transferred to the Directory Support Service.  Her <br>  carefully analyze and take individual measures for each <br>  of them.  However, I must draw your attention to the fact that the presence <br>  This or that resource is not a precedent for editors to <br>  placed in the directory similar sites. <br><br>  - Respectfully, <br>  Plato Streltsov <br>  Content manager <br>  ************* <br>  Yandex Company <br>  Tel .: +7 (495) 739-70-00 ext.  3112 <br>  Fax: +7 (495) 739-70-70 <br>  <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> <br>  ************* <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  What is ‚Äúsubstantially increased‚Äù? <br>  Is there a metric of this concept?  We would like to know what is ‚Äúessential‚Äù for you. <br><br>  Fedor Kvakin <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  Dear Fedor Kvakin! <br><br>  We do not have strict quantitative information content.  If a <br>  use one of your examples <br>  (http://ruprom.net/pc6-home-appliances.html), it is clear that the stated on <br>  On this page, regional and subject headings are filled with <br>  uneven - somewhere there are more than 600 sentences, somewhere - very few units (and the latter prevail).  Editors regard <br>  similar situations as a quality flaw. <br><br>  - Respectfully, <br>  Plato Streltsov <br>  Content manager <br>  ************* <br>  Yandex Company <br>  Tel .: +7 (495) 739-70-00 ext.  3112 <br>  Fax: +7 (495) 739-70-70 <br>  <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> <br>  ************* <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  But regional headings appear automatically when a product is specified by a company from the corresponding region.  Consequently, there will always be many regional offers with several products. <br>  These are not pre-defined regions that are gradually being filled.  This is a kind of filter. <br><br>  In addition, it seems that if the site did not have a breakdown by region (as on most other sites), the moderators would not pay attention to it. <br><br>  Who can I contact except for you on this issue?  Give the phone. <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  Dear Fedor Kvakin! <br><br>  You can write a letter to support@catalog.yandex.ru.  Messages to <br>  This address is considered including the catalog manual. <br><br>  - Respectfully, <br>  Plato Streltsov <br>  Content manager <br>  ************* <br>  Yandex Company <br>  Tel .: +7 (495) 739-70-00 ext.  3112 <br>  Fax: +7 (495) 739-70-70 <br>  <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> <br>  ************* <br>  __________________________________________________________________________ <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Thanks to those who read this entertaining correspondence, we hope that you drew the same conclusions as us, namely. <br>  - We were denied for a subjective reason, ‚Äúuneven filling of the rubricator‚Äù. <br>  - On the question of quantitative measures, the answer was that it was their discretion and it was not discussed. <br>  - On the examples of sites in the catalog with an order of magnitude more ‚Äúunevenly filled rubrics‚Äù, the correct answer was given, in principle, that this is not a reason to add us, but we still have a question why the rules are not one for all?  This is a noncompetitive struggle. <br>  - Hitting a Yandex.Catalog is a non-deterministic process with an obviously unknown result, and the money here, unlike real life, does not help, it all depends on the mood of Platonov. <br><br>  And it seemed to me that in the United States or in Europe one could be sued for a company for court, since <br><ul><li>  Yandex monopolist in the search market </li><li>  The presence of the site in Yandex.Catalog gives preferences in the search </li><li>  There are no clear criteria for getting into the directory sites like neashie </li></ul><br><br>  Why am I writing this?  I like Yandex, and I want it to bring order to their services, and I also want good sites to be users, and bad ones, because this is the point of the search engine?  And the user must decide which site is good and which is not, and not the Platons of Streltsov, small clerks from Yandex. <br><br>  <b>UPD Both of our main sites were cataloged for free.</b>  <b>Thanks Yandex.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49431/</a></p>
