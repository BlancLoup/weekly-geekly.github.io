    <h4>  Book structure: </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe authors and O'Reilly Media have made every effort to illuminate the development of PL / SQL as fully as possible.  The sixth edition of the book describes the tools and capabilities of PL / SQL for Oracle12c Release 1;  This version will be considered a "reference".  However, where appropriate, the book will mention other features that appeared in earlier versions (or are only available in them).  A list of the main characteristics of different versions is given in the ‚ÄúHistory of PL / SQL‚Äù section in Chapter 1. The PL / SQL language has come a long way since the release of version 1.0 for Oracle 6. The book also made major changes to PL / SQL innovations and added new material. <br><br>  The main change in the sixth edition is a detailed description of all of the new PL / SQL features in Oracle Database 12c Release 1. A summary of these innovations is given in Chapter 1 with links to chapters in which these innovations are discussed in detail.  I (the author) are very pleased with the results of my work and I hope that you will be satisfied with them too.  The book contains more information than any of the previous editions, but it seems to me that we managed to maintain a sense of humor and a conversational style of presentation, thanks to which, as I was informed by readers over the past years, this book was easy to read, understandable and useful. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  About the content: </h4><br>  The sixth edition of the book consists of six parts. <br><br>  Part I. "PL / SQL Programming".  Chapter 1 starts from the beginning: how did SQL appear?  What is it for?  The following is a brief overview of the main features of PL / SQL.  Chapter 2 is structured so that you can start programming at once: it contains clear and simple instructions for executing PL / SQL code in the SQL * Plus development environment and some other common environments. Chapter 3 describes the basics of the PL / SQL language: what are operators, what is the structure of the block, how to create comments, etc. <br><br>  Part II.  "Structure of the program PL / SQL".  Chapters 4‚Äì6 deal with conditional (IF and CASE) and sequential (GOTO and NULL) command control instructions;  loops and the CONTINUE statement, which appeared in Oracle11;  exception handling tools in PL / SQL.  This part of the book teaches you how to make blocks of code that meet the complex requirements of your applications. <br><br>  Part III.  "Working with data in PL / SQL".  Almost any program you write will handle data that is often local to a PL / SQL procedure or function.  Chapters 7‚Äì13 are devoted to various types of program data that are defined directly in PL / SQL: numbers, strings, dates, timestamps, records, and collections.  You will learn about the new Oracle11g data types (SIMPLE_INTEGER, SIMPLE_FLOAT and SIMPLE_DOUBLE), as well as many of the types for working with binary data, date and time entered in other versions.  In addition, we describe the built-in functions provided by Oracle to perform various data operations. <br><br>  Part IV.  "SQL and PL / SQL".  Chapters 14‚Äì16 discuss one of the central aspects of PL / SQL programming: connecting to a database made from SQL code.  From these, you will learn how to update, insert, merge, and delete database tables;  how to query information from a database for processing in PL / SQL programs and how to dynamically execute SQL instructions using NDS (Native Dynamic SQL). <br><br>  Part V. "Creating PL / SQL Applications."  In this part of the book, everything that was mentioned earlier is brought together.  Starting to study it, you will already know how to declare variables and how to work with them, learn the most important principles of error handling and building loops.  Chapters 17‚Äì22 discuss the largest structural elements of applications: procedures, functions, triggers, and packages, as well as the organization of input and output information in PL / SQL applications.  Chapter 20 also discusses the management of PL / SQL code, its testing, debugging, and dependency management;  It also provides an overview of the hot plug mechanism introduced in Oracle11g Release 2. Chapter 21 focuses on using various tools and techniques to achieve optimal performance in PL / SQL programs.  Chapter 22 describes the PL / SQL I / O, from DBMS_OUTPUT (display) and UTL_FILE (reading and writing files) to UTL_MAIL (sending email) and UTL_HTTP (receiving data from web pages). <br><br>  Part VI.  "Special features of PL / SQL."  The PL / SQL language, which is so powerful and rich, contains a lot of functional capabilities and structural elements that are not used in everyday work, but allow you to solve problems as simply and efficiently as possible that would be very difficult to cope with in other ways.  Chapter 23 describes the security issues we face when creating PL / SQL programs.  Chapter 24 covers the PL / SQL architecture, including memory usage.  Chapter 25 contains useful material for developers who need to address the challenges of globalization and localization in their applications.  Chapter 26 contains an introductory course on Oracle object-oriented features (object types and views). <br><br>  Appendices A ‚Äì B contain information on regular expression syntax, number formats, and dates. The chapters on the execution of Java and C code from PL / SQL applications that were included in the fourth edition of the publication were moved to the book‚Äôs website. <br><br><h4>  What topics are not covered: </h4><br>  Even in the thickest book you can not tell everything.  Oracl is a huge and complex system, and we consider only the main features of the PL / SQL language.  The following are topics that are not included in the scope of our publication and therefore only superficially <br>  are mentioned from time to time. <br><br>  SQL language.  It is assumed that the reader already knows the SQL language and can write SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, and DELETE statements. <br><br>  Oracle database administration.  Database administrators will learn a lot of useful and interesting things from this book - in particular, they will learn how to write PL / SQL programs for creating and maintaining databases.  However, we did not have the opportunity to talk about the nuances of the data definition language (DDL) included in Oracle SQL. <br><br>  Optimization of applications and databases.  The optimization topic is also considered only superficially, although chapter 21 discusses many of the techniques and tools that will be useful to you in optimizing the performance of your PL / SQL programs. <br><br>  Oracle Application Development Technologies, PL / SQL Independent.  The book does not even try to demonstrate building applications using tools such as Oracle Forms Developer, despite the fact that they also use the PL / SQL language.  I decided to concentrate on the fundamental possibilities of the language and on those operations that can be performed in databases with its help.  However, much of the material in the book also applies to using PL / SQL in Forms Developer and Reports Developer. <br><br>  More information can be found <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/bestsellery-oreilly/product/oracle-plsql-dlya-professionalov-6-e-izd">on the website</a> .
