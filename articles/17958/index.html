  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea - Crowdsourcing AI Creation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I‚Äôve become increasingly convinced that humankind has come up against its ceiling, and further development in the framework of simple division of labor is impossible - only with the help of crowdsourcing, when thousands and millions of people will work on one task, it‚Äôs possible to create revolutionary technologies, and not extensive development old ones.  The other day I thought about creating AI. <br>  There are many letters under the cut and quite a crazy idea. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  A small disclaimer - I am not a specialist in neurocybernetics and neurophysiology - this is how I came across a couple of times in the past. <br>  Of course, the ideal way to create an AI would be to move the psychomatrix as in the wonderful novel by Loskutov ‚ÄúMegabyte‚Äù or in Vasilyev's ‚ÄúHot Start‚Äù.  But, unfortunately, it still remains beautiful fiction, real prerequisites do not even come close.  It remains to rely on the good old code. <br>  We will try to very generally present the birth and development of a person in the form of a program.  Even at the stage of embryonic development, the basic routines of the human body are initialized, the OS is loaded and the main system libraries are loaded, the brain gets access to 5 ports, on which information is constantly received.  So our new-born robot must have a body capable of giving away 5 streams of information and accepting low-level commands to reduce Mys.  Such robots practically exist now. <br>  Next, a person is loading additional libraries - instincts and reflexes - sucking boobs, blinking eyes, breathing, swallowing, and so on.  Write them too special problems will not be. <br>  And then the difficult process of learning begins - the fact that psychologists, psychiatrists and neurocybernetics have been researching for a dozen years, and are still incredibly far from complete understanding.  Although something is clear.  Imagine the human mind as a program.  During wakefulness, the brain writes a code with meaningless variables ‚Äúfor-s‚Äù, ‚Äúfor-s‚Äù and other non-optimal constructions on the fly and where it is necessary, the accumulated information is stored in dynamic memory.  And while the person is sleeping, the brain optimizes the code by creating ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, so that instead of, for example, following instructions like ‚Äúput one finger there, then the other there‚Äù, the brain performs Guitar-&gt; Play-&gt; Track1, where the Guitar inherits Item-&gt; Musical Instrument and Play - Action-&gt; Manipulation;  information is stored in the database, and unnecessary - is archived. <br>  Now about the <b>essence of the idea</b> .  A web application is created that has 2 main modules. <br>  The first is the <b>cataloging and folksonization module</b> .  Roughly speaking, it is necessary that the gender of Wikipedia be folksonomicized and lined up in a hierarchical scheme of classes that will be used when creating AI.  I have seen some projects that do something similar - users enter what can be done with a given object.  In our case, it is necessary to cover all significant objects that exist in nature - and their billions. <br>  The second is the <b>module of the code itself</b> .  Users are offered at the mercy of verified objects, if there is already a ready-made parent class.  During the ‚Äúday‚Äù period, which lasts, say, a week, users quickly write a non-optimal code on their machines, after which, during the ‚Äúnight,‚Äù users optimize the code, creating classes and objects, during the ‚Äúnight‚Äù period.  Further, all information is distributed by the database and the cycle repeats. <br>  Now about the <b>hierarchy</b> .  Initially, a dozen or two ‚ÄúGods‚Äù are recruited into the state, who in turn recruit ‚ÄúProphets‚Äù in both directions, and during the initialization period they create the core of the system, the main classes that other users can later use.  After the opening of the project, anyone can connect as a user and start performing tasks as soon as he copes with his task at least in general, receives the verification of the prophet, takes a step up and can supervise other users. <br>  <b>Business component of the project</b> .  I think there is no doubt that the working AI will make a revolution, not inferior to the Industrial Revolution and will transfer humanity to the next stage of development.  A joint stock company with a par value of a voting stock is being created, roughly speaking, e- <sup>10</sup> kopecks.  Investors keep a blocking package, the rest is distributed between users in accordance with their position in the hierarchy.  Gods and prophets have very significant shares, ordinary users are insignificant.  If the project completes successfully, capitalization grows millions of times.  Since users have the majority of shares, investors cannot implement any transfer scheme in their favor without taking it to a vote, where it will be rejected. <br>  I am writing in frispich, because it‚Äôs not even close to a business plan, but just thinking about it - is it possible? <br></div>
