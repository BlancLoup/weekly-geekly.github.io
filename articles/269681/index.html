Our plan is simple: 7 days of intensive training in programming and communication with experts from leading IT corporations in Russia and the world.  Absolutely free and without leaving your computer. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholding a conference was not accidental: in the course of working with the listeners, we saw a real need to expand practical knowledge.  As a result, we found the best speakers and chose an accessible online format for everyone.  What we learned from the audience for whom the conference will be useful and some teasers - under the cut. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/418/6a9/18c/4186a918c4694d34af86252f4901633a.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modern IT-projects have formed a request for high-quality new specialists, who combine a thorough knowledge of their specialization and knowledge of related technical and management tools.

    <ul><li>  If the developer owns the basics of the industry for which he creates software, it becomes more obvious to him the profile of using the program, which simplifies the process of development and testing. <br><br></li><li>  If a developer creates an application (mobile, desktop, web), it is important for him to know how to promote this offer on the market and fit into the competitive environment.  This is especially true of small startups, when several people are forced to perform the functions of the whole company. <br><br></li><li>  The manager, who is responsible for the commercial part of the project, should also have at least a general understanding of the development and creation of the product, understand how the program is working and testing, how much time it takes to prepare a release or introduce a new feature.  Then he will be able to easily convey the benefits to the consumer of course, and within the company there will never be a phrase: ‚ÄúWell, add a SWOT analysis module, it's just a couple of days.‚Äù <br><br></li><li>  Finally, understanding the interconnection of all business and business processes of a company significantly accelerates development, market entry and simplifies the work of the service department. </li></ul><br>  These requirements force specialists to receive additional education, beginners - to pump skills, and students - to develop their own practical skills, which are so lacking in high school.  Unfortunately, among the flow of information, it is sometimes difficult to choose the most necessary and it takes more time to search for material than to master it.  Our 7-day knowledge marathon will help you learn something new, decide on the development vector and touch the professions of the new future: information security, web &amp; mobile programming, 3D modeling, augmented reality, cloud computing, Big Data, robotics, online &amp; multichannel retail. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">Who and why Geek Week 2015 will be useful?</font> </h2><br>  <b>Novice developers.</b>  If you are taking the first steps in programming or you have a good theoretical base, but little practice, you will have intensive online training for creating websites and mobile applications from the best teachers at geekbrains.ru.  There will be a couple of interesting webinars about employment and the start of an IT career. <br><br>  <b>Middle-developers are</b> guaranteed professional development in their pure form - you will hear a lot of useful information from experts from Yandex, Kaspersky, Google, etc.  (more than 20 speakers).  The reports are divided by topics and do not take very much time, you can watch or listen to a webinar, almost without being distracted from work.  Although to ensure that you do not get carried away and do not plunge headlong into communication with experts, we can not. <br><br>  <b>Managers of commercial services of companies and startups.</b>  You do not fully understand what the developers are doing and why their faces are strained when you ask to fasten a small chip for the client?  Just look at their world from the inside, and you will understand how to create a product.  Immersion in the development gives a unique experience, thanks to which PR and marketing become not a simple description of the functional or beautiful words about efficiency, but informing customers about the real benefits of the product.  Of course, the conference will discuss the themes of promoting and positioning IT solutions - do not deny yourself the source of ideas and knowledge.  By the way, you can also look at your work through the eyes of a developer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">How will all this work?</font> </h2><br>  The entire conference consists of many webinars on various topics for up to an hour.  Lectures are held sequentially, so each participant, given time and desire, will be able to participate in all sessions.  For the most interested, but very busy will be recorded.  Subjects of webinars include programming, language acquisition, design, commercial solutions, and even employment.  Such a spread is primarily due to the fact that in modern companies development, design and commerce work in one direction - striving to meet the needs of the client and respond to his requests in a timely manner. <br><br>  In addition, throughout the seven days of the conference there will be two free training courses. <br><br><ol><li>  <b><i>‚ÄúPHP.</i></b>  <b><i>Fast start".</i></b>  Using the example of creating a blog in PHP, the teacher Yuri Zhayvoronok will reveal the general architecture of the web site, talk about the work with authorization, the database, templates. <br><br></li><li>  <b><i>‚ÄúAndroid for beginners.</i></b>  <b><i>Creating a game "Eat green circles" "</i></b> .  General mobilization is already here - there are over 5 billion active mobile devices in the world.  Mobile applications have captured business, science, medicine, sports, entertainment, and so on ... Lecturer Igor Dolgov will talk about the basics of Android programming and help you create a simple game yourself. </li></ol><br>  In general, if we were asked to draw a tag cloud for our conference, it would look something like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/a8e/454/bf3a8e454d5b41599250f13590fd29e2.png" width="600"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">A little about the experts through the experts themselves</font> </h2><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a6/c75/c78/9a6c75c7853540df93019a312ca68399.jpg" align="left" width="165">  <b>The main principles of user-friendly interfaces.</b> <br><br>  <i>Creating good user interfaces is an easy task.</i>  <i>Need to</i> <i><br></i>  <i>only learn a few basic principles with which you can</i> <i><br></i>  <i>radically improve the quality of their products in the eyes of users.</i>  <i>Exactly</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I would like to share these principles.</i> <br><br><br clear="all"></blockquote><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/953/19d/162/95319d1623654977afd374cdfb7e4bf4.jpg" align="left" width="165">  <b>The fascinating world of programming.</b> <br><br>  <i>Programming covers all areas of our life - from obvious mobile applications and websites, to such interesting areas as generative art and parametric architecture.</i>  <i>I will talk about how you can easily and fascinatingly learn programming, drawing more and more complex fractal images with the help of a turtle, as well as other interesting areas of programming - creating interactive installations using Kinect, programming electronic microcontrollers and studying Twitter‚Äôs real mood of time.</i> <br><br clear="all"></blockquote><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/7c6/2cb/6d07c62cb4174e53afc25db04648821c.jpg" align="left" width="165">  <b>Master class for Team Leaders project management.</b> <br><br>  <i>I will share with you the principles of teamwork, role distribution and effective interaction.</i>  <i>I will touch on the basic principles and techniques of project management.</i>  <i>You will hear about how to set tasks and monitor the achievement of goals, as well as learn about the most common problems of project management and how to solve them.</i> <br><br clear="all"></blockquote><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f8/f48/d6d/8f8f48d6d57248deb9a0b3a863e5b7eb.jpg" align="left" width="165">  <b>World of robots.</b>  <b>View of a visionary.</b> <br><br>  <i>We live in an age of innovation and the latest technology.</i>  <i>3D printers and laser engravers will soon appear in every home.
