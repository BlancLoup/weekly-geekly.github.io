  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My experience of finding a part-time job, or how a student can live on one scholarship</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  I‚Äôve been reading Megamind for a long time and finally decided to write something myself, but since there is no experience in investment and high technologies, this publication is my personal experience of searching for part-time jobs on the Internet.  It all started with the decision to monetize the hobby - design, and then it began ... </p><br><p>  Students always have a hard time financially, especially if they study full-time.  At that age, asking for money from parents is already a shame, and working at night is difficult. </p><br><p>  I study at the faculty of design.  The first thoughts about a side job came to me not so long ago.  I wanted to get more independence and make money before the summer holidays.  The first thing I did was buy a newspaper.  And there is one Oriflame for all phone numbers, and network marketing.  But still went to a few interviews from which there was no sense. </p><br><p>  Then a great idea came to me - to work on a specialty on the Internet.  Now it seems obvious, before I did not delve into this question, so I did not know about the exchanges and other services.  I'll tell you only about the most interesting resources in my opinion, where I managed to work and get some kind of experience. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://youdo.com/">https://youdo.com</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Yuda is a thoughtful and convenient site.  After passing the verification, I rather quickly received the first task.  But to leave requests for the project you have to pay.  Money, though not large, but the probability that the performer will choose a novice without experience and feedback is also not great. </p><br><p>  Here I made a logo for a landscape design site.  Worked one evening and received 600 rubles.  The feeling was very pleasant.  Then it seemed to me that I had experienced the secret knowledge of how to make money from the air. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://kabanchik.ua/">http://kabanchik.ua</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Next was "Kabanchik", working with him now.  Tasks appear often, getting a job is not very difficult.  Here I occasionally carry out orders for the development of logos, packaging design and other similar tasks.  Prices are different, from 50 to 500 UAH and above.  Commission site for each work done 10%.  Also there is a complete check of the data of new performers.  For customers, this is an additional confidence in the employee, but for the performers - unnecessary trouble. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://zrobyt.com.ua/">https://zrobyt.com.ua</a> </li></ul><br><p>  This is a young service, but its advantage in free use.  Here I participated in two projects - I developed banners for the site and flyers.  Agreed with customers outside the service, calculated directly.  No fees were paid for this.  How fashionable now to say - here you can earn money without investment. </p><br><p>  I learn about new projects through email notifications.  As written in the rules of the site: the system itself selects the appropriate performers and sends them suggestions to work on a new task.  This weakens competition, unlike other exchanges, where a ‚Äúcompetition for one seat‚Äù is 20-40 people, sometimes even more.  While the service has not become mega-popular as described above, it is possible to pull out orders with little effort, for beginners, but the lot is about building and repairs. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://freelance.com/">http://freelance.com</a> </li></ul><br><p>  I had a little experience in the English-language resource.  Registration is quick and easy, but there are few new projects in my area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise.  Many employers are not against finding a person for long-term cooperation.  The cost of work from $ 100 for logos, more complex projects are estimated much higher.  So far I have only once managed to get the task of developing a logo.  It was an interesting experience, especially when dealing with the customer.  The calculation took place without the participation of the site, so it was possible to agree on payment on a Visa or WebMoney card.  But the probability of fraud is high, so you need to be careful. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://freelancehunt.com/">https://freelancehunt.com</a> </li></ul><br><p>  There is always work on this exchange.  For money, it is rated much lower than the previous one, although the result is the same logos, photos and booklets.  But no language barrier.  The service does not charge monthly payment, access is open to absolutely all projects, the number of bets is unlimited.  You can work through a secure transaction ("Safe"), payment of 9% of the project budget.  When withdrawing money to the card, additional money is withdrawn from 0.8 to 2% of the budget, plus 10-20 UAH.  It is a little sad that commissions eat up a decent part of the amount earned. </p><br><p>  In fact, now sites for freelancers like mushrooms after rain.  Each offers its own advantages and chips.  She told only about the most interesting in my opinion.  They give me a more or less stable income. </p><br><p>  After graduation, I do not plan to go to freelancing, but as an additional income and experience I will continue to visit here.  During my work on the stock exchanges, I gained many useful acquaintances, I heard a lot of warm words and thanks, it really fed faith in myself.  I also understood the most important thing - the amount of the fee directly depends on the professionalism and time spent on self-education.  If you have the desire to earn their labor, knowledge or skills, then pay attention to these sites.  I hope my experience will be useful for someone. </p><br><p>  If the article was interesting, write in the comments, this is not the whole list, if you are interested, I can still tell you about the experience with Quork and the exchange for copywriters.  I ask for tips on improvement, I hope not my last article. </p></div>
