"Cooperate" - perhaps this is not the word that can describe their relationship now.  Yes, of course, everyone suggested some changes.  These changes could well be an exchange of specialists, the development of the Nokia Booklet line, in the end, would it make a couple of smartphones on Windows Mobile!  However, the worst fears have become a reality ... The words of Stephen Elop and Steve Ballmer that Microsoft and Nokia enter into a ‚ÄúStrategic Collaboration‚Äù means that Windows will become the main operating system on all Nokia smartphones.  And later, after some adjustments to the platform, and on regular Nokia phones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Congratulations Microsoft </h5>

      Well, Microsoft grabbed a big piece of the smartphone market pie.  Filling the desktop market with their products, they decided to take up the mobile PC market.  Microsoft‚Äôs mobile operating system market share is declining from year to year.  In April 2009, this share was 25%, a year later it dropped to 12%.  Now their share is about 3% (in some sources 5%).  On October 11, 2010, Microsoft decided to "shut down the shop" called Windows Mobile by renaming it Windows Phone.  The decision was quite ambitious.  At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMicrosoft talked about Windows Phone 7 Series, which is equipped with Xbox Live and Zune integration.  The interface ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù was quite nice and moreover - convenient.  Yes, this is very good, a new interface, a new platform, but what is missing, don't you think?  Namely, there are not enough devices on this platform.  No, I do not argue with the fact that HTC is a progressive, competitive player in the smartphone market, but they will never reach the level of Nokia.  Consequently, there are several exits.  The first;  arrange a total advertising campaign for your product and thereby attract manufacturing giants to your camp.  The second;  Launch your revolutionary device on the market, as Apple did.  Third;  Spend a lot of money on cooperation, marketing, "sweet gifts" for another large manufacturer.  The choice, in my opinion, was obvious to them.  What did Microsoft get?  Of course, there are huge opportunities to implement their system on devices of a company that has vast experience, great opportunities and of course the largest number of clients around the world. <br><br><h5>  Nokia ... Connecting People </h5><br><br>  What did Nokia get in this ‚Äústrategic partnership‚Äù?  Actually, nothing substantial.  Of course, everyone understands that Nokia just took it and began to cooperate with Microsoft.  Without large sums there just wasn‚Äôt.  But after all, Nokia had something that could continue to bring a large income without Microsoft investments.  These are their Symbian, Maemo and MeeGo systems.  And most importantly they had and have a name.  The name of a company that produces really good devices.  Yes, there are many competitors such as Google and Apple.  But Nokia every year releases more and more innovative innovations, take the same N8 with its Symbian ^ 3.  In the end, Nokia decided that Symbian is nice, but there is Microsoft, Windows.  So why should we strain !?  Let's buy a ready-made solution, since there is money.  What they did. <br><br><h5>  Data </h5><br><br>  Nokia lost their promising OVI Store in favor of the Marketplace.  Then, of course, Symbian in favor of Windows Phone 7. Translating MeeGo's OS into an experimental category.  Microsoft, in turn, gained access to the mapping resources of OVI Maps, and installing them as basic maps on all of its services.  Promoting your search engine Bing, this means that on all future Nokia smartphones, the search service Bing will be the default.  Integration of Microsoft adCenter into all future devices.  Nokia‚Äôs billions in earnings for every copy of Windows Phone. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br><br>  Due to the fact that Symbian will no longer exist, thousands of Nokia office employees have left their jobs, because the system they worked on for almost 10 years will disappear from the mobile OS market in a few years.  Starting from April 1, 2011, about 8,000 people will be subject to major changes in Nokia.  will be restructured into new areas of development, refinement and adaptation of Microsoft products.  However, no one knows what exactly will happen in April 2011, because not everyone will agree to develop products with which they did not know before and had no idea about their structure.  One thing is for sure - the only company that does not lose anything here is Microsoft, for it is an excellent opportunity to go to a huge market, which they have been trying to conquer for many years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113882/</a></p>
