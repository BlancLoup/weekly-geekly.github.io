In this post we will touch on the principles of working with respect to a new solution for Russia on the SAP platform and talk about a couple of already implemented projects with ready results. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3e/a59/de5/c3ea59de591ae142f6ed4a9523c576c7.jpg"></div>  <a href="">A source</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, in 2012, Ariba acquired SAP.  And for good reason.  At the core of the Ariba product family is the Ariba Network, a global business network that demonstrates high growth dynamics and has already ‚Äútaken root‚Äù in Russia.  More than 2.5 million companies are registered with the Ariba Network, and each year 50 billion dollars of payments pass through it.  Agree, a curious asset to work internationally?  However, we, the specialists of <a href="http://www.norbit.ru/">NORBIT</a> , as a Russian integrator, which is part of the LANIT group and makes a great contribution to its first position in the authoritative ratings of the IT services market (by the way, <a href="https://www.lanit.ru/press/archive/17677/">here are the results of the latest IDC research</a> ), it was more interesting to understand what SAP Ariba may be useful in our country. <br><br><h2>  Procurement problem </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fa/f06/2fc/1faf062fc2bb6345458a1015400aa776.jpg"></div>  <a href="">A source</a>

      <br>
      In Russia, the field of procurement is one of the most regulated in the world.  At the legislative level, there are constantly changes and additions to the regulatory framework that relate to government procurement and procurement of companies with state participation.  Therefore, it is necessary to constantly update business processes and change interaction with internal and external information systems.  As you understand, this requires significant labor and financial costs. <br><br>  The costs are significant.  After analyzing the published plans of various organizations for the development and maintenance of procurement processes, we came to the conclusion that large companies spend from a few million to several tens of millions of rubles a year, and some more than 100 million rubles to support procurement activities.  And this is not counting the additional costs of maintaining a staff of specialists providing support. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Main cost areas:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  development and improvement of systems that automate procurement activities; </li><li>  development or refinement of its own electronic platforms; </li><li>  procurement of various services and services necessary for the organization of procurement activities (supplier verification services, interaction with third-party electronic platforms, interaction with electronic document exchange operators, services of procurement information aggregators, etc.); </li><li>  attraction of specialized organizations for procurement; </li><li>  training of own staff in the field of procurement. </li></ul></div></div><br>  But the biggest problem is that precious time is wasted, and prompt response to a changing situation becomes impossible.  As a result, companies are held hostage to complex budgeting cycles, vendor selection procedures, and documentation requirements (GOST), even if the individual solution functions and optimizations are refined.  The current emphasis on maintaining the operational contour in many respects makes it difficult to concentrate on solving other pressing problems, and in this context, SAP Ariba can be a very useful solution for changing the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z9/zc/k8/z9zck8clxte6kk3qihwnprscbpi.png"></div><br>  The dynamics of business processes in the system allows for the modernization of the procurement procedure, including solving the actual needs of the procurement department: <br><br><ul><li>  transition to a unified procurement strategy, </li><li>  cost reduction through automation, </li><li>  Maintain the relevance and accuracy of data </li><li>  search and rapid qualification of suppliers </li><li>  increase operational efficiency </li><li>  training in the workplace. </li></ul><br>  In Russian companies, paper circulation continues to prevail, at best, intermediate documents are sent by mail, and the final documents are scanned and placed in the document management system. <br><br>  Because of this, there is a need to develop or implement a ready-made single tool for procurement management and its integration with various IT systems of the company - from ERP and accounting to warehouse and logistics.  And often it turns out that you need to change the entire chain of data transfer and approvals.  After all, if you simply present a typical procurement process, it will look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/616/8c1/c9c/6168c1c9c947b6be843b6cbc4a81bdd5.png"></div><br>  As you can see, the work with documentation repeatedly goes from one department to another, several coordination cycles are carried out, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is not always formalized, and an attempt to implement an IT solution that combines all the processes related to procurement in its current form turns into real hell.  It would be much easier to create a scheme that does not require multiple transfer of documents to each other and a lot of approvals - so that the IT tool regulates all processes and helps to conduct procurement with greater efficiency. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd3/3c4/9df/cd33c49df575823f7db210de7e3261ef.png"></div><br>  The same problem arises for Russian companies when interacting with counterparties.  For this, various solutions for organizing interaction with suppliers are usually developed, and then over the years: integration with electronic platforms, development of supplier portals, connection to market places, interaction with electronic information exchange operators, and so on.  Instead, using the SAP Ariba Network eliminates intermediaries, reduces the cost of integration and maintenance of complex processes of interaction with suppliers, as well as form a single information space for interaction between all participants in the process, both internal and external. <br><br><h2>  Should I reinvent the wheel? </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f2/9b8/25c/7f29b825cd9965567973e3b5d64570f7.jpg"></div>  <a href="">A source</a> <br><br>  SAP Ariba contains templates that other companies have already managed to run into.  The system is constantly enriched by new approaches to procurement for companies of various sizes and industry sector, which participants retain as sets of business rules.  In other words, SAP Ariba allows you to conduct purchases in accordance with existing regulations, but taking into account the positive experience with other organizations in procurement, as well as automate the processes of tendering and invoicing.  As an example of the already established procurement practices, below is a typical structure of a company with a centralized procurement management system based on Ariba. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9eb/e25/39d/9ebe2539d12aece0888f0fda2355e63b.png"></div><br>  Plus, there is no need to integrate anything here - all interfaces are already implemented, and coordination processes are supported within the system.  For example, one fairly large financial group faced problems in concluding contracts.  Historically, the organization has developed the practice of different approaches to working with contracts. As a result, their number reached 240 types, and the cycle of concluding each new agreement began to take several months.  At the same time, the company currently has over 6,000 clients and over 25,000 active contracts requiring administration. <br><br>  Based on SAP Ariba, we were able to gradually move to standard contracts, as well as create a single registry and transfer all contract data to it.  In fact, only one solution module was used to resolve the issue - SAP Ariba Contract Management.  Together with the formation of model contracts and data migration, its implementation took only 5 months.  A year later, 55% of the contracts in the company became typical, for them 6 universal approval schemes were created, and the time for concluding contracts on average was reduced by 32%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cd/73c/7cb/4cd73c7cbadfe3ce9e9ca4839811d071.png"></div><br>  Another case in point is a large transport company with more than 6,000 employees, including regional offices.  As the organization grows, the lack of a unified digital procurement scheme has led to an increase in the cost of servicing orders and invoices (of which there were about 250,000 and 420,000 per year).  To solve the problems of this customer, four components have already been used - Ariba Supplier Management, Ariba P2P with integration into the ERP system, Ariba Sourcing and Ariba Spend Visibility. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfc/3cd/aa0/cfc3cdaa0e2caf721889888f9453e347.png"></div><br>  The implementation of the entire system took 6 months, during which the company received a ready-made solution for electronic procurement and optimization of work with counterparties.  In total, 350 users were connected to the system, and the results were as follows: costs decreased by 8.5% in the first year of operation, the number of suppliers decreased by 14%, the time of purchase decreased by 48%, and the efficiency of employees increased by 40%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/a3f/b84/a1ca3fb84b616ba709b9e50c0847bbfb.jpg"></div>  <a href="">A source</a> <br><br>  If it is substantive to speak about the implemented modules, they solve the following tasks at the customer. <br><br><ul><li>  Ariba Supplier Management allows you to manage customer relationships and was implemented in 3 months. </li><li>  Ariba P2P, which provides direct interaction with counterparties through the Ariba Network, has been implemented in 4.5 months, including integration with the ERP system used by the customer. </li><li>  Ariba Sourcing is a solution that helps to find new suppliers, and its implementation took 2.5 months. </li><li> Analytical module Spend Visibility just became a key element to reduce costs, as it allowed to track all the costs of the company in relation to the interaction with various suppliers.  Its integration into the company's infrastructure took 3 months. </li></ul><br><h2>  Interesting potential </h2><br>  Following the results of projects already implemented and being implemented, we found an interesting feature of SAP Ariba.  This system allows you to quickly optimize the processes of procurement management, while offering a number of additional "buns" that could not be introduced by companies, but are very useful in practice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/508/3fb/ff0/5083fbff0f24d5d72d558fdf9d52df0a.png"></div><br>  First, Ariba opens access to international procurement processes and allows suppliers to offer their services to companies in regions that they have not even thought about.  In turn, Russian companies can find new, but at the same time already proven suppliers, for example, in China, and conclude more lucrative contracts. <br><br>  Secondly, Ariba allows you to assess the risks that may arise from problems with suppliers.  The intelligent system analyzes data from more than a hundred thousand sources and informs you that some of your suppliers have encountered a problem.  In particular, you can instantly stop purchases from him so that a serious problem does not affect your company. <br><br>  Third, automatic contract preparation tools help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements depending on the region in which the company operates, and also issue invoices in accordance with the rules of local tax authorities.  The system of notifications and reminders already created by the developers informs about the necessary actions of all participants in the coordination and auditors, reducing the time required for bureaucratic procedures. <br><br>  The fourth thing we noted is that this is a ready process of a phased transition from paper documentation to electronic contracts, and then to the introduction of so-called ‚Äúintellectual contracts‚Äù.  At the same time, it is possible to work with a variety of electronic signature service providers, including Russian ones, in full compliance with the requirements of the FSB and other regulators. <br><br>  Finally, the fifth plus is the ability to extend the functions of Ariba based on the SAP Cloud Platform.  Thanks to the SAP cloud platform, the system can be adapted to almost any specificity, and without becoming dependent on the particular company that is implementing the revision.  And a business-oriented process administration system already built into the solution allows you to customize and implement business processes without the involvement of IT specialists. <br><br>  At the same time, given that SAP Ariba solutions have recently been introduced in the Russian market, there are areas in which the functionality of SAP Ariba may require additional adaptation in Russian companies to the requirements of regulatory documents.  The system will have to be refined when organizing a legally significant document circulation with regard to the requirements of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Electronic Digital Signature‚Äù and connecting to the operator of the exchange of electronic documents.  Also, Ariba will have to ‚Äúscrew up‚Äù services for collecting information on suppliers that take into account Russian practice (data from the Incorporation, information from the Federal Tax Service, registries of unscrupulous suppliers, etc.). <br><br>  However, the system has quite a lot of interesting features. If a respected Habr audience wants to know how risk management processes, information transfer, integration and other architecture elements are successful in the world and a fairly new solution for Russia, we will tell about them in the following posts <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our company open vacancies, join!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.norbit.ru/karera/vakansii/konsultant-sap-wms-ewm-sap-msk/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dpost">SAP WMS / EWM Consultant</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.norbit.ru/karera/vakansii/rukovoditel-proektov-terrasoft-bpm-online-crm-msk/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dpost">Project Manager Terrasoft bpm'online</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.norbit.ru/karera/vakansii/rukovoditel-gruppy-razrabotki-team-lead-net-msk-crm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dpost">Development Team Leader / Team-lead .NET</a> </li></ul></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422811/</a></p>
