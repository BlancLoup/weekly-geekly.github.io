You climbed over the wall and became a dream team!  - Yevgeny Viktorovich spoke enthusiastically.  - From now on, you will never work like before!  Only together, shoulder to shoulder, despite the difficulties and hardships! <br><br>  The enthusiasm of the owner has not yet passed on to the managers gathered in the hotel restaurant.  After overcoming the wall, people were tired, crushed by some.  Some furiously cleaned their clothes, jackets and trousers, fouled over with dust in three hours. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut the wall is only the beginning!‚Äù  - the owner continued.  - After all, we need not only a large, friendly team, but also a good, warm, sincere relationship between all of you.  We can not let personal relationships take place, so - please! <a name="habracut"></a>

      And the owner pointed to the tables.  Unlike previous visits to this restaurant, today the tables were not random, but in two long rows, like at a wedding.  But the main difference was the spoons and forks, which ... It was not. <br><br>  People, taking the owner's gesture as an invitation, began to slowly move toward the tables. <br><br>  - Wait!  Shouted Yevgeny Viktorovich.  ‚ÄúNoticing anything?‚Äù  There are no spoons, how are you going to eat? <br><br>  People stopped - stupidly, like a herd of cows at the click of a shepherd‚Äôs whip.  Nobody asked, did not say, even the facial expressions have not changed.  Just stopped and waited for what will happen next. <br><br>  - And I'll give you spoons now!  - said Yevgeny Viktorovich and went to the wall. <br><br>  A large black bag, about a meter high, tied with tape, stood against the wall.  Some time the owner fumbled, opening the package and, finally, took out the spoons.  Very unusual. <br><br>  First of all, their length was amazing - about a meter.  Looking closer, Sergey realized that the spoons are the most common, just attached to wooden sticks with thin steel wire. <br><br>  - Please, please, friends!  - shouted the owner.  - Disassemble spoons! <br><br>  A simple team was executed quickly - everyone came up and took a spoon.  Began to examine them, twirl in their hands, try for strength wire connection. <br><br>  - Now that's what.  - continued Yevgeny Viktorovich.  - Ksenia, where is the list? <br><br>  A young pretty girl, an office manager, quickly jumped to the owner, rummaged in her bottomless bag and took out a folded paper in half.  I gave Evgeny Viktorovich, and took my place in the crowd. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI sense something amiss ...‚Äù Sergey said softly, twirling the spoon in his hands.  After thinking for a few more seconds, he said louder.  - Evgeny Viktorovich, can I not eat lunch?  I never dine at all, I have this mode. <br><br>  - What?  - the owner was surprised.  - What is the mode? <br><br>  - Well, lunch is evil, all the forces of the body are distracted by digestion, and work efficiency drops sharply.  I will not be able to be helpful in the afternoon if I have lunch. <br><br>  - And what, we now also hunger sit?  - Marina entered.  - Since the body‚Äôs forces are distracted ... <br><br>  - No, this only concerns me.  - Sergey answered.  - Well, really, I do not want. <br><br>  - It is necessary, Sergey.  - firmly said the owner.  - This is not a simple lunch, but team building.  All objections are not accepted.  If this is a big problem, eat at least a salad. <br><br>  - Didn't Ksenia cook him?  - Sergei asked anxiously.  Tatyana, who was standing nearby, imperceptibly nudged him with his elbow under the ribs. <br><br>  - Hmm, what's the difference?  - Evgeny Viktorovich frowned.  - But not at all, everyone cooked in a restaurant. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThough thanks to that ...‚Äù muttered Sergey. <br><br>  - So, well, everything?  - asked the owner, referring to the crowd.  - No one else on the diet, with an ulcer or enuresis? <br><br>  Silence answered no. <br><br>  - So.  - Evgeny Viktorovich unfolded the sheet.  - Lining up in two ranks, opposite each other.  But not in a chaotic manner, but as I say, so that pairs are formed.  The first pair is Sergey and Marina. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBliiiin ...‚Äù Sergey moaned.  - Why Marina? <br><br>  - Because you are like a cat with a dog.  - smiled Yevgeny Viktorovich.  - And after this dinner you will be like ... A cat with a cat. <br><br>  Sergey foolishly, shuffling with his feet, stood in front of Marina, who smiled slyly and gently, but playfully said: ‚ÄúMeow, my cat!‚Äù.  Sergey hastily turned away. <br><br>  Evgeny Viktorovich read the entire list, and the crowd assiduously lined up as it should. <br><br>  - So!  - clapped hands joyful owner.  - I want you to take care of each other today, as mothers do with their children, or elderly, grandparents who love each other.  You will feed each other with a spoon. <br><br>  The owner was silent, looking from one leader to another.  When I stopped at the end of the rank, and did not see any reaction, I continued. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to feed from a spoon, so it‚Äôs not very interesting.‚Äù  But to feed with a meter spoon, sitting on the other side of the table - this is a real concern, which forces you to exert all your strength, to invest your soul in what you are doing.  The rules are simple.  One eats, the other feeds.  The one who eats cannot touch anything with his hands - neither the spoon, nor the plates, nor the table.  Clear? <br><br>  Silence answered again that everything was clear. <br><br>  - Well, then I ask to the table!  Determine the sequence yourself.  First one of the pair eats, then the second. <br><br>  People began to sit down.  The first few minutes, no one dared to start feeding, just looking at each other.  But, when the pause became awkward, they began to eat. <br><br>  More precisely, not to eat, but to feed, i.e.  perform an active action.  They scooped up the salad and tried to get into his partner‚Äôs open mouth.  It was problematic to do this - the spoon is long, shaking, the food falls on the table and clothes.  The first pig faces appeared - who were hit with a spoon on the cheek, someone in the forehead, someone even pecked at the salad. <br><br>  Gradually, everyone understood that it was necessary to change the active principle - to move it from the nursing to the eater.  Scoop scoop food, lift and hold as smooth as possible, without trying to get into the mouth.  And the eater just grabs a spoon with his mouth, like a mountain ash bird from a tree. <br><br>  Now the process went faster and safer.  Although, the spectacle, of course, was disgusting - wide-open mouths, in which language, teeth and caries could be seen.  But, as in the game with the wall, people were already no difference - if only it would end quickly. <br><br>  Lunch consisted of three dishes - salad, soup and mashed potatoes with a chop.  With the salad coped quickly - it was securely fastened already dried mayonnaise.  The longest were messing with the soup - no matter how hard you try, he always spilled on the tablecloth. <br><br>  When it came to the second, immediately there were a lot of vegetarians who refused to cutlets.  At the same time, and from mashed potatoes - it was, as in Turkish and Egyptian hotels, not from a potato, but from a package.  Of course, they refused not because of the taste. <br><br>  - A compote, too, scoop a spoon?  - Sergey asked when he fed Marina everything that was on the table.  - And with the bread of difficulty ... <br><br>  - I do not eat bread!  - Marina said, chewing a cutlet. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIndeed ...‚Äù Evgeny Viktorovich frowned, walking along the tables and not taking part in the dinner.  - Ok, I will make you a favor - you can take compote with hand and drink. <br><br>  - Not, but let's spoon!  - Sergey smiled.  - This is such a challenge will be! <br><br>  - Well, whatever you want.  - the owner shrugged.  - Let's each couple decide how to deal with compote. <br><br>  - Our couple decided to take compote hands.  - strictly said Marina.  ‚ÄúSo the blouse should not be washed from the beets ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Boring you.  - Sergey bummed.  - Shoot, shoot so ... <br><br>  - shot out already.  - Marina delighted.  - You have a week left. <br><br>  When the dinner ended, there was a queue to the toilet - everyone wanted to wash.  Sergey did not get up in line - he managed with napkins from the table. <br><br>  - Sergei.  - rang out from behind. <br><br>  - BUT?  - turned Sergey.  - Who is calling me? <br><br>  Olga was behind.  During lunch, she sat in the corner of the hall, and ate with a regular spoon, in splendid isolation. <br><br>  - Let's go talk.  Now is just a break. <br><br>  - And I am ... <br><br>  - Come on, do not extinguish.  - Olga took Sergei by the sleeve and led to the side.  - Do not eat. <br><br>  Sergey obeyed.  We left the restaurant, wandered through the corridors, and finally stopped at the hotel lobby.  There was no one except the girls at the reception desk in the lobby, so you could have a quiet conversation.  Sergey sat on the sofa, Olga took the place opposite.  Between them stood a small coffee table with a glass top. <br><br>  - So, let's be friends immediately.  - Olga began.  - We will talk like an IT person with an IT person. <br><br>  - Are you an IT specialist?  - Sergey frowned.  - I thought a business coach. <br><br>  - Come on "you", ok?  It's easier and faster. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, business.‚Äù  Are you an IT person? <br><br>  - Yes.  I work in a company ... (here Olga said the name known to the entire Russian IT community). <br><br>  ‚ÄúOh, fuck up ...‚Äù Sergei was genuinely surprised.  - My personal mail you have been spinning for fifteen years ... <br><br>  - Say the address, read.  - smiled Olga. <br><br>  - Not ... And you ... Ie.  who are you there? <br><br>  - In general, I enter the board of directors.  Position will not be called, it is not so important. <br><br>  - And how did you get to Chelyabinsk? <br><br>  - Nick said, they recommended him to me at the MBA.  I read the course there.  So met.  Invited to facilitate and moderate your strategic session. <br><br>  - What to do? <br><br>  - Facilitate.  Just do not say you did not hear that.  Scrum, edgyl, no? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI know that, but the fascists ... How? <br><br>  - Facilitate.  - Olga pronounced slowly.  - To facilitate, organize, simplify the work of the team so that it quickly reaches its goals. <br><br>  - So you have us here, facilitated? <br><br>  - Yes.  I also do this in the company - and I am facilitating myself, and teaching others - scrum masters. <br><br>  Sergey stopped talking, then, for no reason at all, he smiled broadly. <br><br>  - What?  - Olga asked. <br><br>  - Yes, I remembered the anecdote ... - said Sergey, and smiled even wider.  - You are more careful with these words in Chelyabinsk. <br><br>  - Why?  Severe Chelyabinsk men?  They can not be facilitated? <br><br>  - Yes, so I ... Okay. <br><br>  - What a joke? <br><br>  - Terribly vulgar, I will not tell. <br><br>  - Yes EPT ... Come on, just hint. <br><br>  - Okay.  The battlefield, the heaps of defeated enemies, stands on the hill Ilya of Murom.  Holds the palm of the visor, looks around the neighborhood - isn‚Äôt where else the enemy hid?  Here he sees - someone runs in small steps, slouching, skinny.  That dohlyak run up to Ilya of Murom.  Who will you be?  - asks Ilya.  Slouchy answers - I am a journalist, can I have an interview?  Ilya asks - what to take?  Well, the interview ... - replied the journalist.  Ilya stares at him intently, looks from head to toe, then he says - face what, what word he invented ... Well, on, suck. <br><br>  Olga laughed so loudly that scared the girls with the reception.  Sergey even turned red. <br><br>  - Ok, I will consider, for the future.  - She said, laughing.  - Chelyabinsk men will not facilitate, but they will not understand that way, they will still drag them to the cave and make them ... Well, you understand. <br>  Sergey was embarrassed silent. <br><br>  - And you yourself - local?  Also, severe Chelyabinsk man? <br><br>  - No, I'm even harsher. <br><br>  - Why?  Where are you from? <br><br>  - From where wolves are afraid to shit.  From the Kurgan region. <br><br>  - Where is it?  Wait, Kurgan region ... <br><br>  - That's it, better not to know.  Never go there if you want to live. <br><br>  - What's wrong there? <br><br>  - It is easier to list what is there - the fingers of one hand will suffice. <br><br>  - Well, all the same ... <br><br>  - Uranium mines, the dumping of chemical weapons, the river Techa, still fenced with barbed wire. <br><br>  - What a river?  Why fenced? <br><br>  - Radioactive waste was drained into it after the Mayak accident.  Bakhnulo in the Chelyabinsk region, and all the yummy went to Kurgan. <br><br>  - A, clear. <br><br>  - Well, in the appendage - the almost complete absence of industry, killed agriculture and universal drunkenness. <br><br>  - And what good? <br><br>  - Nature.  Where there are no mines and chemical weapons.  There is no industry, so nobody pollutes anything.  Wild, primitive beauty.  When I go there by car, I always meet roe deer.  In Chelyabinsk never seen.  Okay, enough about me.  What did you want to discuss? <br><br>  - Oh, yes ... - Olga roused herself, gathered herself and continued.  - Why are you so related to team building?  Well, excluding facilitation.  Okay, there your men are harsh, production workers and the like, but what about you, IT specialist, should understand how important and effective this is? <br><br>  - So I understand.  As far as it is not important and ineffective.  These games work only for idiots who, due to their limited nature, cannot distinguish between reality and fiction. <br><br>  - Explain ... <br><br>  - Hello, social schizophrenia ... I heard such a phrase? <br><br>  - Somewhere yes ... Where is it from? <br><br>  - There was one, Mr. Freeman.  In one of the videos he told about how people behave differently, depending on the situation.  Well, like at work - on the hind legs, in a cafe with friends - merrily and with puffed-up cheeks, and at home - sleep, snore, fart, and drool.  Well, the type here at home, in his bed, they are really real. <br><br>  - It will be necessary to reconsider ... Well, and what from this? <br><br>  - And the fact that social schizophrenia is not only evil, but also good.  It works like the self-defense of a person against any heresy, like your games.  The ordinary schizophrenic is considered sick because he does not distinguish between reality and illusion, and the social one even distinguishes it very much.  And this is good. <br><br>  - Why? <br><br>  - Because otherwise he would come to work, and began to crawl through the walls, or feed everyone with a meter spoon.  Everyone understands - it's just a game.  Well, like little kids.  Do you remember such a word - make-believe? <br><br>  - Of course. <br><br>  - Adults forget this word, but its essence is not.  Came home - you are one person, real.  You eat, you wash the floors, you go to the store, you walk with the children.  Came to work - you're a different person.  Everything that moved you at home does not work at work, because work is such a game.  If you play correctly, you will pay money.  If it is absolutely correct, yes with cheats, or career steroids, then the salary will grow. <br><br>  - With what?  Career steroids?  What is this? <br><br>  - There is such a book on the Internet.  Honor, interesting.  Although, you're on the board of directors, you probably don‚Äôt need to. <br><br>  - Right now, wait, I'll write it down.  - Olga took the phone and scribbled something there.  - Ok, and the games here and? <br><br>  - And this is another personality social schizophrenic.  In the morning we sat and pretended that we were inventing a strategy for the development of the enterprise.  This is one game.  Then they began to crawl through the wall - this is another game.  Now they fed each other with meter-spoons - again a game.  Three individuals went through each, three avatars. <br><br>  - That is, they are separate, so it turns out? <br><br>  - Well yes.  There is some kind of diffusion, of course - something flows from person to person, from role to role, but in general they are isolated.  Otherwise, a person will go crazy if he starts making presentations with a projector at home, scrubs floors at work, and sits down to shit during the game. <br><br>  - You have metaphors ... - Olga smiled. <br><br>  - Yes, I know ... But so, it seems, it comes better. <br><br>  - Well, yes ... So, it was all in vain?  Today, in a sense?  Diffusion will not happen? <br><br>  - Of course not.  No one will ever rush to apply the methods and experience gained in the game, somewhere in his workplace.  Work - separately, the game - separately.  Well, I do not know ... Boxers are professional.  In the ring, they blizzard each other, blood flies, and after the fight they smile, hug, wish good luck in the next battles.  In a fight they no longer climb ... Well, except for some, what is his name there ... <br><br>  - I understood about whom you.  Sounds, of course, convincingly, but somehow ... <br><br>  - You can check. <br><br>  - How?  - Olga has quickened. <br><br>  - Right now ... - Sergey pulled his phone out of his pocket.  ‚ÄúThey climbed over the wall, fed each other ‚Äî all are now friends and brothers, right? <br><br>  - As planned - yes. <br><br>  - Here we check.  We have corporate chat in vatsap, now I will open ... Here, look. <br><br>  - What to watch? <br><br>  - See, there are no unread messages?  For the purity of the experiment. <br><br>  - Well, everyone is resting. <br><br>  - OK, we will not interfere.  So ... through the bottle try. <br><br>  - In terms of?  Will we drink? <br><br>  - Not.  Wait a minute. <br><br>  Sergey turned the Watsup, and opened in the browser some page filled with different colored diagrams, multi-colored tables and inscriptions. <br><br>  - What?  - Olga leaned forward through the table and stared at Sergey's smartphone. <br><br>  - Bottle.  Well, the type of company performance in real time. <br><br>  - Our? <br><br>  - In the sense of yours? <br><br>  - Well, this is our service?  XXX companies? <br><br>  - No, not yours. <br><br>  - Whose?  Yyy?  (Olga pronounced the name of another very famous Russian IT company). <br><br>  - No, it's samopal.  Wait, don't distract. <br><br>  - Can I see it too?  - Olga did not let up. <br><br>  - Well, sit, look, I'm not driving you away ... <br><br>  - No, on my smartphone.  Wait ... - Olga took her bag, rummaged in it and took out a tablet with an apple.  - Give a link, I'll look at the tablet. <br><br>  - There is confidential information. <br><br>  - Dig my tomatoes, I need your information ... <br><br>  - But, nevertheless ... Is there chrome? <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  - Run in incognito. <br><br>  When Olga launched the browser, Sergey took it in his hands, hammered the address, login, password and, waiting for the appearance of graphs and tables, gave it to Olga. <br><br>  - Actually, yes, it's even more interesting.  I'll make a change now, you'll see them right away. <br><br>  - Yes, yes, come on.  - Olga said, without lifting her head from the tablet. <br><br>  Sergey opened another tab in the browser, went into some console, rummaged, opened the document and began to correct the numbers. <br><br>  - What are you doing?  - without looking, Olga asked. <br><br>  - The numbers here are taken directly from the coach, and get into it from the enterprise information systems.  The frequency of exchange is 10 minutes.  I see that the exchange has just passed, so the next one is in 10 minutes.  I fixed some numbers right in the coach, see? <br><br>  - The data is updated written ... So what ... Oh, everything turned red. <br><br>  - Yes.  It was yellow and green - well, like everything is normal or on the verge, and now - red, i.e.  everything is bad.  Well, not everyone is straight, but some internal processes.  Now let's wait. <br><br>  Sergey blocked the smartphone, and put it on the coffee table.  Olga looked up from the tablet, and stared at Sergei with interest, sometimes looking at the smartphone. <br>  Two or three minutes passed in complete silence, when Sergei's smartphone suddenly vibrated, and the LED blinked with a white Watsup signal. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, it started ...‚Äù said Sergey, picked up a smartphone, unlocked and opened the watsup. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Take a seat closer, read. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Olga walked around the table and flopped down on the sofa next to Sergey. He digged into the settings of the smartphone, found the option to automatically turn off the display, switched to the "never" mode, and put the device on the table. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Contents chatki quickly replenished. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aleksey: Marina, what is again at the OTC for the problem? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marina: What is the problem? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aleksey: Look in the bottle. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marina: Alexey, I myself will figure out what and where to watch me. Speak straight. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexey: The Prophecy Check. Again, the details hung on the Quality Department, and in the evening shipment. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marina: Nothing is stuck anywhere, enough to slander me! We got it already! OTC is the most disciplined service, always respecting the deadlines!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry: Tell someone else ... They are disciplined. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marina: You forgot to ask. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexey: Yes, Dmitry, you would keep your mouth shut. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry: Why should I be silent? I almost lost a client because of this OTC last month. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene: So, stop the bazaar! Marina, I demand to immediately deal with the problems in the Quality Department. Delay in shipments is not allowed. I will not almond, the measures will be the most stringent! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suddenly, Sergei leaned forward, picked up a smartphone and started typing a message. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sergey: Friends, let's be kinder! The problem at the Quality Control Department is just another wall through which we need to climb!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marina: Sorry, of course, Evgeny Viktorovich, but I am tired of unreasonable claims! I am ready to incur punishment if OTC is really guilty of something, but I will not allow anyone to talk to myself in such a tone! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry: What a tone you deserve, so they talk to you. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexey: Dmitry, that's enough, do not wipe up like a jackal. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry: Jackal, you say? Well, come to me again ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene: MARINA !!! IT'S SHIPPING !!!
