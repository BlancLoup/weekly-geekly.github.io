Let's look at the numbers: they are always more objective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that catches the eye (the interactive table is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UinCu8oNYDD8wWmfOKQnlCczcny-08tIP1_1UG5aKbY/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">here</a> and the general view is below) is that most of the projects are devoted to the development of the blockchain infrastructure: the sample can be increased, but the situation will not change much.  In this case, the most profitable in terms of initial investments is Ether, i.e.  platform, which itself generates ICO: for the average man it looks prosaic - a pyramid.  The more ICO is carried out, the more ETH rises in price, the more it rises in price - the more people spend ICO.  However, whether it is so or not - the question is subjective.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-4/dg/qz/-4dgqzhmzyq6itsjftbp9jtjyu0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the graph it can be seen even better: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/i5/jk/vqi5jke1z1vzz8h7ynfdlneiyni.png"><br><br>  At the same time, it is possible to single out a number of interesting patterns, for example, the team and I study ICO with different capitalization (see below): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/he/qg/i2/heqgi2m8c5zavwcf9ytrzzy0apa.png"><br><br>  And, if we move beyond profitability, because  for "investors", the picture of the format "one out of ten" is a normal phenomenon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w9/wy/do/w9wydozlu5sv2hqe5cade8g1ja0.png"><br><br>  But the grain is not buried in beautiful figures, but on road maps: we will begin to study them today. <br><br>  <b>Judge for yourself:</b> <br><br>  <b>SONM</b> : <b>10/21/17</b> this, one of the most well-known Russian-speaking teams of blockchain startups, has changed (!) Its roadmap.  But the project is declared as Supercomputer Organized by Network Mining!  RoadMap was previously published <a href="https://golos.io/ru--kriptovalyuta/%40m0rte/sonm-podrobnaya-dorozhnaya-karta">on the social media blockchain. Voice by an</a> enthusiast: I give it a link and give it.  <a href="https://golos.io/ru--kriptovalyuty/%40aleco/icorating-opublikoval-svoi-otchet-po-ico-sonm">ICOrating once reviewed the</a> SONM and assigned the project a Stable + rating.  And with all this, a change in the roadmap, which, according to the team, is due to the fact that ‚Äúthe SONM roadmap describes the company's project plans and can be adjusted to reflect changes in the process.  In a previously published ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù (published) in white paper SONM, development processes were considered ... The main features of the previous version and the reasons for its rewriting are the following: [previous version] was not use-oriented.  The description given was focused on technical details, not on determining what the user can do with the system and what use cases or functions available to the user will be in each version ... It presented promises for specific, but rather low-level functions. ‚Äù- yet nothing but bewilderment does not cause. <br><br>  It turns out that instead of clarifying the functionality for the user - in fact - another criterion was changed: temporary.  This is especially strange, given the fact that the team still doesn‚Äôt know how to eliminate most of the technical difficulties associated with building a Global Supercomputer: starting from long pings and ending with data synchronization.  Or know?  Then the question is <a href="https://blog.sonm.io/sonm-monthly-report-october-2017-d9626dd5ba00">why in the blog</a> I personally see a full turn in the strategy and development tactics, but I do not see any specifics?  It turns out that the team, like so many at the ICO, hastily concocted a ‚Äúproduct vision,‚Äù and now it is trying to find an excuse in the truth that ‚Äúthe product should be for the user‚Äù, as if it was not obvious in the second ten twenty first century. <br><br>  However, this is also a subjective question.  The objective reality is that the roadmap has been replaced, but there has not been a product either. <br><br>  <b>ZrCoin</b> .  This is a project from the real sector: the whole plant, by the way!  I will say right away that I will have a separate and large report on it, but today I will note the following: <br><br>  The company has an office in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqTY6gQko5ko">China</a> , perhaps the most important thing when it comes to building innovative production.  Meanwhile, the ransom is due to begin in March 2018: but only 09/21/17 ‚ÄúZrCoin company signed a general contract no. -04/17-Ust for the construction of the facility dated 09/21/2017.  An advance payment of 19,500,022 rubles was made. ‚Äù  At the same time <a href="https://zrcoin.io/newsitem/30">nobody wanted to provide a</a> link to the contract.  Apparently, not necessary.  And most importantly: construction, construction, and I personally don‚Äôt understand the sales market at all: by the way, I recommend looking through <a href="https://zrcoin.io/newsitem/29">photo reports ‚Äúfor ZrCoin‚Äù</a> - you will be surprised how many they are not identified. <br><br>  In general, there is a persistent feeling (and, I hope, in a separate report I can convey to everyone) that ZrCoin is still engaged in PR, and not in creating its own product: there are more conferences on the site than verifiable papers.  And this can be critical for a whole stratum of the economy, which is called the <b>tokenization of the real sector of the economy</b> . <br><br>  <b>Starta</b> .  Perhaps the last project to be considered today: ‚ÄúAt the present time, on the recommendation of several major Asian exchanges, the Cross Coin and Starta Accelerator teams have suspended the processes associated with listing on other sites until the situation has been fully clarified‚Äù.  This is not a fun, but understandable start.  But this is not important. <br><br>  One of the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">oldest crypto forums</a> overflowed with questions about repurchase.  If you look at <a href="https://startaico.com/">investment</a> projects, you can find quite a few controversial ones (I especially don‚Äôt like the Cindicator).  However, here again - a place for personal reasons.  For now, let's leave them aside. <br><br>  Much more concerned about the thesis that: ‚Äúthe company undertakes to send all net profit to the redemption of tokens at the market price‚Äù.  Only one question: "when?".  News does not give any <a href="http://www.startaaccelerator.com/news">clear picture</a> .  Similarly with the <a href="https://startaico.com/faq">FAQ</a> . <br><br>  So, to summarize, we get the following: in the ICO they try to apply the old, but not good, scheme of the ‚Äúgreater fool‚Äù, which, of course, works, but nothing good promises the industry.  In addition, the bet is made mainly on 1 out of 10 and while the ‚Äúnumber of shots‚Äù is greater - nobody cares where the market is heading.  Finally, the projects themselves on the hype not only make no promises, but they also manage to change the requirements for their own development on the go, causing this to be supposedly ‚Äúdynamic market demands‚Äù: and more and more it does not look like a business, more and more often it resembles a completely different phenomenon . <br><br>  <b>However, I think you already guessed without me, which one?</b> <br><br>  In general, now the market is filled with speculators (who, without the right to do so, call themselves investors), for which only beautiful growth charts are important, and not the essence of the phenomena.  Say, dear ETH, that rises in price solely because of the rise of ICO, a tenth of which is cracked in this case, actually contradicts the main function of Ethereum supercomputer - launching applications.  But who cares?  Dear gas - evil, which no one feels.  In the extreme case - there is a classic. <br><br>  The same situation is with the ICO: no one asks for the execution of direct functions from the project.  The main thing is to make investments in the initial placement of tokens be repaid.  It is desirable - gave 2-10 X.  And that's all. <br><br>  On the other side of the scale - government regulation, which still does not understand that simply taking and prohibiting will not work.  Not the level, not the approach.  But in any case, the blockchain-enthusiasts community is perhaps those who will suffer most from the current hype (a): we were given a multifaceted and unique tool.  All that while we could - to distribute it into the hands of usurers.  This is reminiscent of the purchase for glass beads of hectares of land from the Indians by the colonialists of America. <br><br>  I would very much like this publication, as well as a number of others (easy to find in a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/menaskop/">file</a> ) to convey to those to whom the world of crypto is not just money, light and reckless, but also a much more significant process, that today it is necessary to introduce new <b>protocols ...</b> first of all on a decentralized basis and the desire for a gradual transition into the world, even more interesting - distributed. <br><br>  For this you need a little bit: the desire to create and create, i.e.  the development of their own, efficient projects in spite of and in spite of the market, as well as the creation of micro-communities, for which not only technology will be important, but also society, which with its help can really become better. <br><br>  In the meantime - we buy IT for the sake of IT or its value.  This is completely contrary to the principles of the White Book Bitcoin, which, recall, was born as a counterbalance to the crisis of 2008: today scams, objective and subjective, the ‚Äúclassical‚Äù (read - outdated) approach to ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù, permanent ‚Äúplugs‚Äù (read - inflation) evaluating ICO as an instrument of exceptionally easy and cheap money leads us to an inevitable collapse that can undermine the most important thing - ideology. <br><br>  So far - everything: in continuation, if the material is in demand, I will try to tell separately about these and other projects, as well as continue the general description of the ICO market, which is already ready for a meeting with institutional investors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341732/</a></p>
