  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quality assurance management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear readers, first of all, the article is intended to look at what we all do every day, through the eyes of development, through the eyes of management and of course to try to reconsider the approach to traditional project management, applicable at all stages of testing. <br>  So, let's begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Goals and objectives </h4><br>  The most important thing, without knowing where to go, there is no sense in going.  No, of course you can apply all the knowledge you have and arrange a huge number of tests that do not determine the goal, but simply compel testing, for the sake of testing.  The key aspect in this case is that at the stage of forming the design specification, the QA department is often disconnected from this process, which subsequently causes a lot of misunderstanding, both from the customer and from the QA side.  Goals-education in this case will be a higher priority than the task. <br><br><h4>  2. Risks </h4><br>  The most difficult part, as practice shows, even applying all the calculations that can be done, to avoid the error is simply impossible.  You can add at least another 100% to the current LOE, but you should always leave a little more, in order to have time to screw the last screw.  Calculation of risks, your main task.  The solution to this problem is already engaged in the 2nd school. <br><br>  2.1.  He interprets the postulates of the ‚Äúcut-off‚Äù period, forcing the team to work at the maximum and allowing them to ‚Äúcut off‚Äù the husk which inhibits the process at all stages. <br>  2.2.  He talks about laying the maximum LOE in order to take into account everything that one can and should not miss a single comma. <br>  There is certainly an opportunity to find something that is average, which, as a rule, is what QA Lead's are doing.  Anyway, just choose you.

    <h4>  3. Do not litter the mind by working out </h4><br>  Yes Yes exactly.  Development, programming, creation at the instrumental level will only narrow the range of your review by a set of class functions, variable declarations, etc. <br>  Your strategic view will only be saluted by the possibilities of implementation, you will no longer see the project as a whole, how it works, how the procedure calls interact, which will only distract you from the overall picture.  Your Task is reduced to think, together with the development, and not as a development.  Of course, completely alienated from the development to anything, because  Do not forget that you and the ‚Äúcreators‚Äù are part of the same process and the success of the project depends on the implementation of what you are testing or what you manage.  However, I urge you to ‚Äúfly up‚Äù more often over a project and look at what is happening in general. <br><br><h4>  4. Be universal </h4><br>  In everything, in general in everything.  You thereby expand your horizons.  You will begin to see something that you have not seen before.  This is guaranteed to give you an advantage in front of you + will always provide an opportunity at any stage of the project to connect to any non-functioning or ill-functioning element and to make amendments to make it truly effective, so rationally functional as you yourself would like.  Learn: to program (but not fanatically), auto-testing technologies, functional and non-functional testing methods, control the system at various stages in various conditions, learn what you can learn, learn to work with all types of OS, thus you can see problems all plans, learn to lead - at all stages, learn to be friends with your staff, but do not forget that you are responsible for them. <br><br><h4>  5. Plan </h4><br>  We are all taught this, Time Managment is an amazing tool.  But, do not forget that you are one so smart.  Your team (if there is one) may simply not be able to do this, or moreover, not even know how to do it.  Learn to plan in such a way that you would achieve a result, but not to the detriment of team interaction.  Find out who has how many children, when they have birthdays, what is the situation in the family (unless of course your team consists of more than 10 people). <br>  By not doing this, you doom yourself to UNKNOWN, for those surprises that during the show of the final product will come out only to you sideways.  Plan in such a way that they would not need to think about how to please the work and yourself, this is your task and you have been appointed, not only to effectively conduct the project, learn to correctly allocate time, not to the detriment of the team that later will write about you. . <br><br><h4>  6. Manage and complete </h4><br>  Drop mentality and thinking, be absolute.  With good management staff, never shun the work that you recently left.  Sometimes you need to "go to the shop."  Finish the unfinished, finish the unfinished, the end result depends on you. <br><br><h4>  7. Work </h4><br>  Do not forget why you are on the project.  Good personnel management and good management will do their work, you will relax.  Keep yourself in shape, be aware of the latest events and your project will never lose.  Be all in teamwork, let your team entrust you with it, let it say that it was a mistake without fear of the tyrant, and knowing that you will immediately find a rational way out of the situation, because everyone is wrong.  Let the team share with you success, he is waiting for your praise and attention.  Be serious and funny.  Your team is your labors. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125607/</a></p>
