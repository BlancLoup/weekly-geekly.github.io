    <a name="habracut"></a>  Robot Pashka is a friend and assistant student.  Pashka studies only four and five because he knows his schedule and does not miss pairs.  Here is his site - <a href="http://robotpashka.ru/">robotpashka.ru</a> <br><br><h5>  Project Overview </h5><br>  Our project is a database of online university timetables.  In addition to the fact that you can simply view your schedule on the site, you can subscribe to the schedule of your study group and be aware of all changes.  When changing the schedule, notifications are automatically sent to all students of the group using email, Vkontakte messages and mobile push-notifications. <br><br>  Thus, the project allows you to stay up to date with your schedule, monitor its changes (for example, ‚Äústep change‚Äù) and directly influence the content yourself. <br><br>  Our global idea is to increase the efficiency of education, and we began by solving only one urgent problem - the lack of a unified platform of timetables.  Today, there is even the term " <i>EdTech</i> ", denoting similar IT projects aimed at improving the conditions of education. <br><br>  Now the work system looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab6/eca/f1d/ab6ecaf1d175d468d17b4490a916c5f7.jpg" alt="  " title="Scheme of the project"><br><br><h5>  A bit of history </h5><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a service has been visiting me for a long time: often, when I came home from work in the evening, I had to call friends and find out which couple tomorrow or what week number is now?  So I thought that it would be much more convenient to access the electronic schedule (for example, at night it is already difficult to contact someone from the students, while the site is always available). <br><br>  So, having discussed all aspects with the team, we set about implementing.  The launch of the test site took place on April Fools' Day - April 1, 2013.  Testing took place in my <i>alma mater</i> - Samara State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering (SGASU). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bb/7d5/1dd/8bb7d51dd61971f6184da2f92b4b0662.jpg" alt="The first site of the Robot Pasha"><br><br>  Initially, the site had a very simple functionality, which was limited to: a directory of universities, schedules of study groups, an email subscription to changes in the schedule and the text form of the error message. <br><br>  Rights for those who can make changes to the timetables are established directly by the university: depending on the chosen scheme, editors can be university staff, headmen or all students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/183/446/b4a/183446b4ade1dded4938302f318f4d64.png" alt="Example of online schedule on the site"><br><br>  For a month and a half of work, while the students had not yet gone on holidays, many feedback and advice was received on how to improve the system.  We realized that the project is still raw and set to work. <br><br>  On September 1, 2013, <s>for some reason, on Sunday</s> , we <s>gathered the entire staff in the office to</s> launch a new version of the site, added a number of new features, the key of which was a quick search for our group and the online schedule of teachers. <br><br>  October 1 (exactly to the half year of Pasha) we released the Vkontakte app (thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/eluninm/" class="user_link">eluninm</a> ).  The application is an iframe (in which the site works) with a number of improvements, such as user authorization, subscription using the VC user id, inviting friends, post to the wall.  Notifications themselves were issued in the form of messages "Changes have occurred in your schedule!", Which come from Robot Pashki. <br><br>  On October 25, the application was added to the Vkontakte catalog.  For the first 2 days, the application was installed by 2000 people.  This was where our ‚Äúwiki-catalog‚Äù, the catalog of cities, universities, faculties, etc., came in handy, to which anyone can add an entry, and it will be immediately visible on the site.  During the day hundreds of cities were added, among which were such ‚Äúcities‚Äù as Russia and Belarus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13d/d1f/e3f/13dd1fe3fc2b8f98a42bca1df9a52d6a.jpg" alt="An open editor is available for everyone to fill."><br><br>  We realized that we are not coping with the current composition of the schedule manually on the site, so on November 8 open online editor was released.  The editor, previously available only to our employees, registered elders and university staff, has become publicly available.  Now anyone can fill out their schedule.  Depending on the scheme chosen by the university, the schedule immediately becomes available on the site or comes in for moderation, after which it also becomes available on the site, in mobile applications and in VK.  This solution is convenient for everyone: students do not need to wait for our editors to get to the schedule of their group;  we now have the opportunity to concentrate on the support and technical development of the project. <br><br>  Today, January 20, we launched the long-awaited iPhone and Android applications.  Now the main request of our users is fulfilled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/864/386/318/864386318c2e7810fcacff787677cdd3.jpg" alt="Mobile applications"><br><br>  How good are the applications, judging you.  We set ourselves 2 tasks for the near future: <br><br>  1) Make a normal mobile version of the site that will work with other mobile devices, including tablets; <br>  2) Refine mobile applications based on user feedback. <br><br><h5>  Participation in the project </h5><br>  If you are a student, teacher or university employee, we will be very interested to hear your opinions, advice and ideas on the development of the project.  You can also add a schedule for your group or faculty, and join testing mobile apps and Vkontakte apps.  We are happy to talk with university administrators about the possibility of integrating the system through an API.  Participation in the project, of course, is free. <br><br>  You can contact us via <a href="http://vk.com/robotpashkaclub">the Vkontakte group</a> , we will be happy to talk! <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  Now the system works in dozens of universities throughout the country (from Kaliningrad to Krasnoyarsk).  The system is used by thousands of students.  Every day we receive dozens of reviews, schedules and updates to them.  We constantly communicate with students, staff and heads of universities, all together we share experience and develop, this is perhaps the most interesting part of our project. <br><br>  Thank you all so much for your support! <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213967/</a></p>
