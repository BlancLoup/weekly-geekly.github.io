  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Musicians 2.0 - Indaba Music</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.indabamusic.com/images/css/logo2.jpg?1178408583">  Probably a lot of people thought about creating music.  Gather a band, play some kind of rock in the garage, not for money, but for the soul, and just enjoy life.  But in our world, self-realization is very dependent on life circumstances, and even if in childhood parents did manage to slip out of music school, this still does not mean that you will be able to realize your potential.  After all, for the group you need to find a guitarist, bassist, vocalist, keyboard player, drummer, and of course the composer.  People who share your views on music, and who have free time for rehearsals.  And of course, in the creation of music you need to invest. <br><br>  The logical solution to all the difficulties associated with musical creativity is to use the Internet to search for musicians, record music, mix, etc.  I will try to talk about the service, which completely satisfies all the needs for collective music creation via the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wanted to write music on the computer for a long time.  And however, even without having a musical education, I quickly became comfortable in musical notation, then in musical editors and the process started.  But problems started when I wanted to write music with two friends, it became very difficult to synchronize our versions and make edits.  And if we suppose that a comrade from another city wanted to join us, then it was completely unrealistic to get ready for a rehearsal. <br><br>  Most of my wishes about a civilized service for writing music via the Internet, are implemented in a startup <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a> .  As the authors say, this service is made by "musicians for musicians," and I can not disagree with them.

      Registration happens as usual, only you have to specify your style of music, skills, favorite performers and some other details among other things.  So you become a member of the music community.  You have your own blog, you can contact other musicians, search for like-minded people. <br><br>  But besides the creation of a social network for musicians, the service provides a convenient mechanism for working together on compositions, called sessions.  If you want to offer participants a joint work on a track, you create a session.  You can create it empty, or attach a ready preview file, where you can hear the main theme of your composition.  If you did everything right, other people will soon find your session, and if they like your idea, they will want to join.  And although the service provides the opportunity to hire musicians for money, most of them still play for fun.  For example, when I created the first test session with my own, far from the best work, soon she was interested in one, and then another, guitarist.  What was my surprise when it turned out that one of them plays the guitar for 28 years, and conducts his own courses about playing the guitar (although he said that my composition seemed complicated to him =)), and the other finished the conservatory in Moneral, his guitar experience is 35 years.  Could I in real life get acquainted with such people, and with something to interest them?  Probably not earlier than in 30 years =). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/399/113/67e/39911367ee0b2dfa911cd0906c03be08.jpg" alt="Multi-track sound editor"><br><br>  A session is not only a place where musicians gather, and throw off their blanks.  The service provides a full multi-sound audio editor for mixing audio.  Thus, the process of recording a song is as follows: all the members of the group record their own games in their home studio, and upload them to the site.  And with the help of a multi-track editor, a ready-made composition is formed.  By the way, up to 250 MB of disk space for your files, and the opportunity to simultaneously participate in five sessions, is issued free of charge. <br><br>  I hope that my article has interested all amateur musicians, and maybe even professionals.  Of course, I would very much like as many people as possible to join this service, as long as the community is entirely English-speaking and mostly from the States and Canada.  Therefore, it would be nice to see compatriots there.  In general, come in, socialize, and let's finally create music in the style of 2.0! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8076/</a></p>
