  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Direct 10 questions to ask your Advertising Agency</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Studies by British scientists show that the lion‚Äôs share of Advertising Agencies, regardless of ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù, image and other paper regalia, sooner or later forget about building universal happiness (simpler: customer welfare) and come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs time to think about the device personal happiness (easier: how to fill your pocket). <br><br>  In practice, this desire results in a frankly weak customization of advertising campaigns, gross errors in the selection of words and other shortcomings.  And why only these people drink coffee at Yandex seminars?  It is excusable if it is done from ignorance, but some admit them quite consciously, for the purpose of ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù spending, of the advertising budget. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everything possible and impossible is being done to finally confuse the advertiser, to lock him in on his far-fetched exclusivity and not make it clear what is being done and what for. <br><br>  In the end, the embittered and disoriented Advertiser, having nothing to spend on money, except for regular losses, begins to realize that he was put on an advertising needle.

      What is the problem, why are there no calls, why does attracting one customer cost so much?  And in general, take away these beautiful graphics from me and give a clear answer to a simple question - what is the money that my honest work, taken away from the state, is spent on? <br><br>  To avoid such annoying incidents, it is recommended after concluding a contract with an advertising agency, setting up advertising campaigns, after a test period exploring carefully study the work done and, if necessary, ask your ‚Äúpersonal manager‚Äù 10 tricky questions ... <br><br>  The lack of answers to which should make you think about the meaning of life, and about advertising life - in particular. <br><br>  1. Why did I sign an agreement with one company, and in the interface I see the name of a completely different company in the interface with small letters?  Outsourcing.  Who is responsible for possible financial losses due to such, incomprehensible to the mere mortal, the castling? <br><br>  2. How do you explain the fact that part of a large number of purchased keywords are lumped together (in one announcement), although common sense and logic suggest that keywords should be grouped, even better - to make a separate announcement for each request? <br><br>  3. In connection with what in the ad text is not used key requests?  It is well known that when a request matches, Yandex Direct identifies such words as ‚Äúbold‚Äù in the text, thereby increasing the visibility of the ad and, as a result, increasing the CTR and effectiveness of the advertising campaign. <br><br>  4. How do you explain the display of our ads throughout the country, if we provide services only in Moscow? <br><br>  5. Who will indemnify losses associated with impressions and, respectively, clicks from, for example, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug or the Republic of Sakha, or Yakutia? <br><br>  6. Why aren't explicit and not very negative words indicated?  At the cost of any mental effort you were able to achieve such marketing heights?  What is the noble purpose of the announcement being broadcast on request ‚Äúrequest + abstract‚Äù (options: review, forum, articles, repair, spare parts, details, continue the list ...)?  You do not need to have the gift of Nostradamus to understand that the person who is searching for this query is none other than a diligent high school student who knows the world.  But he, alas, is not our client. <br><br>  7. Who will compensate for losses due to completely useless clicks in the name of raising the educational level of the younger generation - with zero conversion and, sadly, at our expense? <br><br>  8. Who prevented from making a duplicate campaign for YAN, with lower rates, if you, as a certified agency, are well aware that there are quite a lot of sites, the cost per click of which is not worth a penny?  You put in the YAN 50% of the cost of a click in the search?  Well, then another question at the third grade level. <br><br>  9. Why did nobody bother to ask the advertiser what percentage of the cost of a click on a search is he willing to pay on YAN sites?  I also need to show ads at night, who will be able to change rates after work with their hands, and return them back in the morning? <br><br>  10. Do you know about the possibility of using operators in Yandex Direct? <br><br>  If you have not received a clear answer to at least one of the above questions, then you should think about and draw conclusions about the Gold Medal ‚ÄúCertified Partner‚Äù (Commercial, beautiful diplomas in frames, thanks from customers, high missions, reviews and other nonsense), which proudly flaunts on the main page of your advertising agency.  The probability that the ‚Äúking is naked‚Äù is extremely high. <br><br>  And at the end <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a84/01a/f01/a8401af01e439d0241d959f523aaa521.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Ya.Direkt.</i>  <i>Canvas.</i>  <i>Butter.</i>  <i>"Suicide in First Special Placement for 9.99"</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95961/</a></p>
