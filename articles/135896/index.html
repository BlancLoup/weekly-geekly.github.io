    <h4>  about the project </h4><br>  To rent a good apartment in Moscow, you need to become a search specialist, study all the nuances, set up a lot of filters on different sites and regularly check them - not everyone has the time and desire to do it.  ‚ÄúAnd from our window‚Äù takes care of finding suitable options: on Cyan, boards without agents, LJ communities and all other sources.  Our moderators (as a rule, girls from different parts of Russia) sit on these sites all day and be the first to notice all the latest relevant announcements, and then contact the customer - by mail, Skype or SMS.  The client remains to go round the options and remove the one you like. <br><br>  The three best apartments of the day on the main page of the site are selected by the same moderators, using a cool, comfortable admin panel.  If a good and inexpensive apartment in the center appears at TSIAN, it will definitely get on our website.  This is not only a useful feature for tenants, but also a good mechanism for attracting new customers. <br><br>  To provide legal support, we are friends with a good, proven lawyer who helps resolve difficult situations, and also travels with clients for transactions to verify documents. <br><br>  The project was launched in spring 2010, since then the concept has been revised several times, and in the end the most suitable model has been chosen.  About how the service has changed and developed, I told at the "404th festival - 2010": <a href="http://video.yandex.ru/users/miripiruni/view/5">video.yandex.ru/users/miripiruni/view/5</a> <br><br>  If you still doubt the usefulness of these services, here are some feedback from our customers. <br><br>  Kirill Grishanin ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">@rnbpart</a> ): <blockquote>  I used this service in November 2010.  I had a very difficult ‚Äúpoint‚Äù search.  Despite this, I received at least one ad every day.  Less than 2 weeks later, my problem with finding an apartment was solved.  Without the guys, I would rather open my veins, than I could move. </blockquote><br><br>  Kostya Ivanov ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">@phenix_h_k</a> ): <blockquote>  Excellent service when you need to find an apartment for specific parameters and there is no time to shovel 5-6 sites. <br><br>  - Quick search for suitable options <br>  - Responsive managers, you feel that a person is working with you, not a robot <br>  - Fast feedback.  Online corresponded and corrected the proposed options <br><br>  Thanks you. </blockquote><br><br>  Rinat Menyashev: <blockquote>  We recently moved to a new apartment at Park Kultury.  We removed a treshka with large separate rooms for 45 thousand rubles / month, which is (at least) 5000 rubles / month below the market.  This is not luck, but the painstaking work of the <a href="http://aiznashegookna.ru/">aiznashegookna.ru</a> service, which has helped us find this treasure. <br><br>  Therefore, I highly recommend it to everyone.  If someone will look for an apartment in Moscow, keep in mind - the service reduces the time costs of searching and reduces the monthly payment. </blockquote><br><br>  Andrey Bronin: <blockquote>  I really liked the attitude towards customers.  I formulated the task of selecting an apartment from Yekaterinburg and I picked up enough options so that I would watch the apartments almost continuously for three days after my arrival.  Despite the fact that I knew little about the geography of Moscow and did not formulate the task very well, the guys quickly responded and changed the selection criteria.  In general, I really liked it.  Thank! </blockquote><br><br>  Pavel Popov ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">@schmooser</a> ): <br><blockquote>  Great service!  Within a couple of hours after the establishment of the application offered a dozen suitable options.  Then the selection criteria changed - no problem picked up other options.  In total, about 5-8 new apartments appeared per day, while I only found 1-2 apartments with a manual search. <br><br>  As a result, we stopped at the option proposed on the second day, after 5 days we signed the contract.  Thank you very much, I recommend it to everyone! </blockquote><br><br>  Andrey Grigoriev ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">@eigrad</a> ): <br><blockquote>  Great service.  Cheap apartment in the right place was found for a day. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Why am I breaking up with the project </h4><br>  I am an interface designer and information designer.  I also rent an apartment in Moscow, but this is not my main activity.  For quality work, the project requires attention and time: communication with customers, tracking new sources, training and controlling moderators, development and promotion.  And on my mind only sites, interfaces, infographics and master classes. <br><br>  I am looking for a person who is ready to dive into the topic, understand the problems of tenants and devote themselves to their solution.  As an option, a team that is already working in this area and will be able to use my work.  If such a person is found, he will not only benefit the tenants, but also provide himself with a good stable income. <br><br><h4>  Conditions </h4><br>  It is important for me that the project falls into good hands: to interested, active and purposeful people.  From those who wish, I am waiting for a letter with a short story about myself and about your plans for the development of the project.  With the candidates you like, we will continue to communicate offline. <br><br>  Additional advantages to write about: <br>  - Experience in the development and promotion of Internet projects (one‚Äôs own or others‚Äôs); <br>  - acquaintance with the Moscow rental market; <br>  - living in Moscow in a rented apartment, experience of communication with realtors; <br>  - availability of free money for promotion and other small expenses; <br>  - SP or another officially registered legal entity.  person for doing business; <br>  - willingness to pay a nominal amount for the project, confirming the seriousness of your intentions. <br><br>  All these conditions are optional, but will be a good addition to the "burning" eyes. <br><br>  Send your questions and suggestions to Tania Misyutina: mail@infotanka.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135896/</a></p>
