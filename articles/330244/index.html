These fees will be charged after the current Greenlight system is replaced with Steam Direct.  The fee will be refundable and, in principle, for developers, almost nothing changes, because in the current system the size of the refund for publishing the game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/219820/Steam_Greenlight_Submission_Fee/">is the same</a> . <br><br>  According to Valve representatives, the decision was not so simple, the team members proposed to change the size of contributions, and the amounts from $ 100 to $ 5000 were considered (no, zero is not superfluous here).  After discussion, it was decided to stop at $ 500, but the opinion of the community itself was decisive - Valve listened to it and decided not to change the fee to allow developers to publish their games without any problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúOur internal discussion led to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãraising the amount of the contribution to $ 500, but conversations in the community led to the fact that we decided to make the contribution as small as possible,‚Äù the statement says.

      It was decided to replace the Steam Greenlight system in February, in order for developers to have a more direct and simple way to publish their games.  Actually, Valve's intentions are reflected in the very name of the new service - Steam Direct.  To work, you need to register, after which make money, as mentioned above.  "We will ask new developers to work with documents, having passed the verification procedure and adding tax information, it all looks like opening a bank account," explained in Valve in February. <br><br>  After all the formalities have been completed and the payment for the game has been made (when publishing a new title, the fee will have to be paid again), the developer can begin the adding procedure.  However, so far there is no information on how the developer can get his refundable fee back, although Valve representatives <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/want-to-get-a-game-on-steam-100-is-all-you-need/">told</a> one of the online media that the developer will receive money to achieve a sales level of $ 1000.  The company‚Äôs blog has no information yet. <br><br>  It is worth noting that not only the game publishing algorithm changes, but also the Steam curator system.  Valve employees say that they are no longer quite sure that they can "represent the interests of the entire diversity of users." <br><br>  Now users can take part in the selection of games on Steam, and the players can search among them those who will represent their interests.  Valve also decided to limit the curators ‚Äôauthority:‚Äú We decided to leave the curators ‚Äôactivities strictly by choice: the curators‚Äô comments can affect the operation of the algorithm only for those players who openly declared their desire to subscribe to these curators ‚Äù. <br><br>  At the same time <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299262/Valve_will_charge_devs_100_to_publish_games_through_Steam_Direct.php">, the</a> kind of content to which the curators can put their hands on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299262/Valve_will_charge_devs_100_to_publish_games_through_Steam_Direct.php">expands</a> .  They are allowed to provide additional information to players who are thinking about buying the game.  Also in Valve modified tools that allow curators easier to manage their recommendations.  The curators have also made the task easier when displaying content for other platforms, including YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/6f9/9ee/8066f99ee11b017731cafdd20b17007d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They got the opportunity to create a personal list of games.  According to Valve, this will allow curators to provide specific advice on how to purchase games for the current sale.  Also, they will be able to make lists of games that offer the opportunity to track the evolution of game design, games of a specific developer, or other interesting nuances. <br><br>  Valve promises that work is already underway to create a system that makes it easier for the game creators to find curators.  In the past (and now) this is such an easy task, but in the near future, after the appearance of the new system, more reviews will appear on Steam, which are written by curators who like the new items and their study.  As an auxiliary tool, it is proposed to provide curators with a greater visibility on the store pages.  For example, if a user of the system subscribed to the curator, then you can see his comments on the new page margins. <br><br>  In the future, Valve promises to gradually refine and improve Steam Direct.  The new system simplifies the task of finding games, showing those that should appeal to a particular player.  Greater importance is attached to individual interests.  The creators of Steam Direct are asked to immediately report problems as soon as they appear, so that they can fix them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330244/</a></p>
