This is actually a good question, because there are several options, all have their pros and cons ... Besides, podcasts and conversations are more often more interesting and lively, and Skype or other voip telephony is often the only communication option. <br><br>  There are two options for recording skype conversations.  We will consider them separately. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>...</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
    <h4>  <strong>First option.</strong>  <strong>Record Skype skype in one track.</strong> </h4><br>  What happens in this case?  Everything that you hear in the conversation will go into the recording.  It is written on the air of your conversation with all the ensuing consequences. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  ease - by pressing the "record" button, and then "stop" you will get an almost ready podcast </li><li>  simplicity - no need to mess with installation </li><li>  in the case of an interview or just a guest on the air, this option is most acceptable - your guest will not need to do anything except talk in Skype </li><li>  security - by running such a recording on both sides, you will be twice as safe from force majeure and the loss of a podcast </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The sound quality will not be higher than the quality of the conversation in Skype, and this is usually lower than the studio </li><li>  all artifacts, ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and other sound problems during a conversation will go into the recording and it will be very difficult or impossible to correctly remove them </li><li>  it will be difficult to process the sound, since both your track and the other person‚Äôs track will be in one file, i.e.  it will not be possible to apply any effect only to the voice of one person </li></ul><br><img src="http://skypetips.internetvisitation.org/image-files/Radio%20Shack%2017-855.jpg">  In turn, this recording method is divided into two options - iron and soft.  On the iron point, I will not, because  I have no experience in this matter.  In <a href="http://rpod.ru/wiki/rpc/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582_skype_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D1%258E">this article,</a> you can read on this topic, or - there is such a device - "Wireless Phone Recording Controller Part No.17-855", with its help, your Skype conversation can be recorded on any device, even a simple tape recorder.  The thing, in my humble opinion, is very inconvenient, so let's look at much simpler software solutions. <br><br>  All you need is one small utility, usually launched before the call.  Here you can choose between many.  Take for example <strong><a href="http://www.easyvoiprecorder.com/">EasyVoipRecorder</a></strong> .  In addition to Skype, it can record conversations on GTalk, 12Voip, MSN, VoipVise ... you know, the list is actually very wide, about 95% of all Voip traffic in the world is subject to this small program. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd6/c4a/c7b/cd6c4ac7b644206baa72dc8832c15769.jpg"><br>  Probably because of this, it is not free.  $ 19.99 symbolic coins will need to pay for the possibility of using this software. <br><br>  Or here - <strong><a href="http://www.skyperec.com/index.htm">Skype MX Recorder</a></strong> .  There is a standard and professional version, the difference in the number of supported communication protocols.  Trial works for 30 days.  Monstrous simple and convenient to use. <br><br>  Other similar programs: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://all-streaming-media.com/record-video-stream/Pamela-record-Skype-phone-calls-SkypeCasts-Skype-Video-calls-Chats.htm"><strong>Pamela</strong></a> </li><li>  <a href="http://all-streaming-media.com/record-audio-stream/FreeCorder-easy-to-use-sound-capturing-program-especially-handy-for-recording-Skype-and-other-VoIP-calls.htm"><strong>Freecorder 2</strong></a> </li><li>  <strong><a href="http://www.abyssmedia.com/">iSound</a></strong> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.powergramo.com/"><strong>PowerGramo for Skype</strong></a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.prettymay.net/"><strong>Pretty may</strong></a> </li><li>  <strong><a href="http://www.skylook.biz/">Skylook</a></strong> </li><li>  <strong><a href="http://www.highcriteria.com/">Total recorder</a></strong> </li></ul><br>  The <strong><a href="http://www.topshareware.com/VanRecord-download-9544.htm">VanRecord</a></strong> program is <strong><a href="http://www.topshareware.com/VanRecord-download-9544.htm">committed</a></strong> to recording everything that is played on your computer.  That is, it will easily record the track of your interlocutor.  In turn, you will record your track in the usual way in Audacity or any other recording program, you will end up with two separate tracks.  This method removes one point at a time from both the pros and cons of recording ether, so decide for yourself.  And the program, by the way, is free. <br><br>  There is another way - connecting a special plug-in to Skype.  There are also several of them, I will tell you about two.  One paid, called <strong><a href="http://www.callburner.com/">CallBurner</a></strong> , and costs as much as 45 Euro!  In my opinion, rip-off, but if you are still interested, try.  The second is free, called the <a href="http://callgraph.in/index.php"><strong>Call Graph</strong></a> plugin, it looks even nicer :) The plugin was made with the expectation of minimal distraction from the conversation, the calls are recorded automatically, the user is only shown a small pop-up window. <br><img src="http://callgraph.in/images/record-start-notify.png"><br>  How this wonderful plugin works can be seen on the official <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAbaXbaDssxk">video</a> . <br><br>  Well, and in order to feel completely satisfied, I‚Äôll also provide a list of similar programs for the Mac platform: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/"><strong>Call recorder</strong></a> </li><li>  <strong><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio hijack</a></strong> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/nicecast/"><strong>Nicecast</strong></a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/"><strong>WireTap Pro</strong></a> </li><li>  <strong>GarageBand</strong> using <strong><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11333">LineIn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/14067">Soundflower</a></strong> .  <a href="http://www.360east.com/%3Fp%3D133">It</a> explains how to do this. </li></ul><br>  <strong>...</strong> <br><br><h4>  <strong>Option two.</strong>  <strong>Record each of the participants in the conversation on your track.</strong> </h4><br>  In this case, each skype-conversation participant launches an audio editor or recording program and records his or her own voice. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  the quality of the final podcast is much higher than in the previous version </li><li>  ease of installation - the track of each of the participants can be easily edited separately </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  each of the interlocutors should take care of the recording program and file </li><li>  one person must do a lot of processing work or at least installation </li></ul><br>  It‚Äôs not possible to paint a lot here, because  the method is very simple in execution.  Just start any recording program or audio editor (Audacity will do), tell all your interlocutors to do the same, click the Record button and start the conversation.  It is not necessary to press the button at the same time to everyone, it does not really matter when installing. <br><img title="audition_multitrack" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/audition_multitrack.jpg" width="500" height="283"><br>  Yes, by the way, I do not recommend writing heavy programs like Adobe Audition for recording.  I ran into one problem - if you work actively with a hard disk or in a browser, such a heavy program can insert artifacts into a file.  If you listen to the first paired releases of Radio-U, you will hear rare ‚Äúglitches‚Äù, repeaters or half-second dips in my track.  After that, I began to record exclusively in light Audacity. <br><br>  Good luck in collective podcasts! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/06/zapis-skype-besedy">Original on Podkastim.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26593/</a></p>
