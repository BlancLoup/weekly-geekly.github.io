On October 1, the President of Russia held a meeting of the Security Council at which possible measures to protect the information space of Russia were discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bd/656/395/1bd6563959e44062add41e1a02596f09.jpg"><br><br>  Two weeks later, the press service of the Ministry of Defense announced that in the Russian strategic missile forces, or the Strategic Missile Forces, SOPKA units would be formed in the near future, which stands for ‚ÄúSystems for the detection and prevention of computer attacks.‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a>

      The military personnel of the special units will receive the latest complexes of the computer attack detection system, information-technical influence on the automated combat command and control system. <br>  It is reported that new units are being created in military units, both with mobile missile systems and mine launchers. <br><br>  Why the strategic rocket forces have their own anti-hacker units is explained extensively, since it is known that the automated combat control system of the Strategic Missile Forces (the one with the nuclear briefcase and the red button) is completely isolated and has no connection to the Internet.  That is, according to the former chief of staff of the Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel-General Retired Viktor Esin, who was approached by Kommersant for expert judgment, the possibility that hackers can influence it is completely excluded.  Currently undergoing modernization, says Esin.  The channels are duplicated through space and are reliably protected by special protocols and encryption methods, so hackers cannot get them, the colonel general says. <br><br>  However, no one has canceled the human factor, said Igor Korotchenko, a military expert and editor-in-chief of the National Defense magazine, although the Strategic Missile Forces system is not connected to the Internet, there are computers with access to the World Wide Web in parts.  Therefore, the possibility that a virus can be carried by a specific person - an officer, shift officer, for example, is not excluded, Korotchenko says, recalling the case of former Major of the Strategic Missile Forces Dudnik, who tried to transfer secret information about the Siberian missile units to the CIA.  And this is precisely the main threat to the Strategic Missile Forces control and communication system.  Detection and elimination of such threats is the main task of SOPKA units, Korotchenko says. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/884/ce4/05d/884ce405d14d4d7d86a35c84b52d30b1.jpg"><br><br>  The second important task is to enhance document security and information transfer.  This is often done using ordinary computers, but on which certain security systems and blocking systems are installed.  We are talking about countering the technical means of reconnaissance of the enemy by eliminating the blocking of the radio channel, searching for and neutralizing the software and hardware tabs. <br><br>  The official version from the representative of the press service and information department of the Russian Defense Ministry, Colonel Igor Yegorov, reads as follows: ‚ÄúThe armed forces are switching to digital weapons and troops control technologies, actively introducing electronic document management.  In this regard, the Strategic Missile Forces are taking preventive measures to improve information security - SOPKA units are being created to ensure sustainable military command and control of troops in the conditions of information and technical influence. ‚ÄùThe full conversion of the Strategic Missile Forces to digital technologies is planned for 2020. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241708/</a></p>
