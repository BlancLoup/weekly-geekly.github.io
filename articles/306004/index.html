  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I Received a Code Signing Certificate from Comodo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I decided to share my difficult experience of obtaining a certificate for signing applications on Windows. <br><br>  Once I wondered about this issue in order to increase the confidence of potential customers in their programs.  I rummaged through the Internet and found Comodo, a more or less affordable company, whose certificates can be bought for only $ 75 a year.  I read casually the pitfalls that it is necessary to submit an application and receive a certificate on the same computer, on the same browser, and so on, connected with the installation and use of the certificate.  For some reason, I forgot about reading the process itself. <br><br>  The price of $ 75 I found on <a href="http://author.tucows.com/">Tucows</a> , while on the Russian and Kazakhstan sites offered about $ 110 a year.  As always, without having read what is written in small print, he cheerfully pressed the buy button, entered the card details and paid for the order.  After that, I receive a letter in the mail that the purchase is made, we congratulate you, you are so well done, but we will not refund you the money.  That is, if anything, then you will remain without your blood.  Well, well, I thought that this could happen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the same day, I received a letter from Comodo - the order was confirmed, the process of checking my company began, which may take two working days.  The next day, again, the letter - and so, we could not collect information about your company on the Internet.  Send us any documents confirming the existence of your company.  I sent a scanned passport, ID and certificate of IP.  To which I receive an answer (again, the next day) - you have an individual order, so you must pass the so-called face-to-face check.  And immediately, in the first letter, it was impossible for me to say this?

      Well, I follow the link (by the way, who wants to read, here it is) and download the instructions for this very check.  The check, in fact, may not be so hard, but you will have to tinker. <br><br>  Looking for notarized copies: <br>  1) driver's license or passport; <br>  2) any financial document with your name - an extract from the bank for six months, or a credit or debit card; <br>  3) any non-financial document, again with your name - birth certificate, subpoena, or utility bill; <br>  4) completed application template (downloaded from the same link), where your signature should be, as well as notary data, filled in by him, his signature and stamp. <br><br>  It seems to be nothing complicated, and therefore, taking the right, birth certificate and credit card, I fun went to the notary.  But there I was in for an unpleasant surprise, you see, the notary is a servile person and it turns out that he has no right to certify this kind of free format statements.  At least in our case in Kazakhstan.  This is a taaaaaam abroad, they can certify anything, she explained to me, and here we can only certify powers of attorney, but documents with stamps.  In order to somehow justify my coming to a notary, I nevertheless made certified copies of my rights and birth certificates. <br><br>  When I reached the house, I attached copies, and explained the situation - they say so and so, our notaries can not certify your paper, I can attach copies of anything, you want a passport, you want an extract, you want to give an address certificate from our e-government, where it will be black my address and telephone number are written in white, let's assure anything.  I was answered rather succinctly - either face-to-face, or submit DUNS - this is the international organization number on <a href="http://dnb.com/">dnb.com</a> .  The answer was sent again the next day, in general, they responded to all the letters a day, or even two, no one there with you, as with a dear and beloved customer, not lisping. <br><br>  I took heart a little, because I once read on the Internet that getting a DUNS number is easy.  I <a href="http://dnb.com/">switch</a> to <a href="http://dnb.com/">Dnb.com</a> and try to register, quickly enter all my data, but when I get to the ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù field, I find that I can‚Äôt choose anything except the USA.  In other words, registration on the site Dnb disappears. <br><br>  I tried to search for information on the Internet, and going to <a href="http://dnb.ru/">Dnb.ru</a> , I found one very unpleasant news for myself, namely, ‚Äúthe procedure for obtaining DUNS¬Æ numbers has changed on September 1, 2015, the DUNS¬Æ number is no longer issued for free.‚Äù  And the cost now amounts to no less than a little more than 12,000 rubles.  Then I was completely depressed - I did not expect to pay such a price for the certificate. <br><br>  Phoned several other notaries - they all said the same thing, we have no right and that's it.  I puzzled for a couple of days, what to do, I was already thinking of drawing a notary stamp in photoshop (although I am a law-abiding citizen).  But after surfing the Internet, I came across a post where it was said that even if you send documents to Comodo, they can ultimately request a notary license or even call him personally. <br><br>  I decided for myself that it would be better for me to return my $ 75, to dock 35 and buy a certificate through one of our offices.  I wrote to Comodo that I want to get my money back, to which they replied to me - yes, no problem, dear, contact Tucows.com, because you paid there.  With this I was completely desperate, more than 10 days had passed, but I did not receive a certificate, I can‚Äôt prove my existence, and I don‚Äôt want to return the money either. <br><br>  But following the wise proverb about hope, I again started to google about getting a DUNS number, and, oh, a miracle!  Somehow I came across the <a href="http://fedgov.dnb.com/webforms">Fedgov</a> website, where anyone can check information about their company.  If it is not there, then add it completely free and legally!  Not quite believing in success, I entered my data, it took only 10 minutes, after which I received a letter in the mail that the request was accepted and will be processed within 7 days.  And after another 2 hours, a notification was received in the mail about the successful assignment of a DUNS number.  I went to Dnb.com and, to my great joy, I found information about my company.  No supporting documents, no copies, nothing at all. <br><br>  Without delay, I sent a letter to Comodo with my number.  In response, a letter arrived, where they asked me to change the phone number and bring the name of the company in line with Dnb.com.  I did this and unsubscribed Comodo, they replied that everything is fine, the number is received, wait.  I, that this is all - my ordeal ended. <br><br>  But alas!  The tech support was silent for more than a day, and then I gave out - sorry, but the phone number you provided does not affect Dnb.com, please indicate the link from Dnb.com where you could find the phone number.  And on Dnb.com really nothing but the address is not reflected in the search.  I had to write in support of Dnb.com, who in turn, by tradition the next day, redirected me to Dnb.ru technical support.  There the girl (thanks to her so much) explained that the ‚ÄúPhone number‚Äù field is not provided for at Dnb.com, and it‚Äôs better to look for your DUNS number on <a href="http://upik.de/">Upik.de.</a>  I found myself on this site, and sent a link with search results to Comodo. <br><br>  Finally, Comodo also organized a phone number check.  They sent me a link in the letter, when I clicked on, I got to the page where I had to press the ‚ÄúCallback‚Äù button.  Immediately they called me, and the robot reported a 6-digit PIN code, which I had to enter on the page in the same place.  That's all.  The checks are over, and after 3 hours I received a link to download the certificate. <br><br>  The whole process took two weeks, plus some of my nerves.  Therefore, before buying a certificate from Comodo, register yourself with Dun &amp; Bradstreet.  In all this bedlam, I am still tormented by the question - why?  Why is it all needed Comodo, why do such troubles for their customers, if right there, they ask for a DUNS number that you can get in 10 minutes without confirming anything at all?  I could not see in this a drop of logic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306004/</a></p>
