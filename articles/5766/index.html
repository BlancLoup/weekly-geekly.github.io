  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pirates Remedy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Police groped for the pirate's weak spot - it is increasingly checking software in companies and departments.  Since the confiscation of computers with suspicious software for such users is fraught with stopping the entire case, many of them rushed to buy licensed software. <br><br>  Police and prosecutors stepped up checks on the legality of computer programs used by Russian companies and departments.  The Legal Agency with the Non-for-profit partnership of software vendors, which conducts an examination of the legality of software (software) at the request of the prosecutor's office, is literally overwhelmed with computers seized from users.  The deputy director of the partnership, Anna Lavrinova, told Vedomosti about this. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the director of the Chelyabinsk Textile Mill, Vladimir Kalinichenko, the management of the plant has been paralyzed for more than a month after the staff of the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of the Kurchatovsky District of Chelyabinsk seized eight computers on February 20.  He says that the ATC department reported about the pirate origin of these programs on February 15, and on February 20, the day of the inspection, he paid the bill for the purchase of licenses from an authorized Microsoft dealer, but the prosecutors did not stop it.  The investigator of the Kurchatov district prosecutor‚Äôs office, Dmitry Basalgin, told Vedomosti that the prosecutor‚Äôs office opened a criminal case under Part 2 of Art.  146 of the Criminal Code ‚ÄúIllegal use of objects of copyright, committed on a large scale‚Äù.

      A similar check was carried out by the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bashkiria and investigators of the local prosecutor‚Äôs office recently in the Ufa branch of the insurance company Capital LK, Vsevolod Terentyev, financial director of the company, confirmed to Vedomosti  According to him, the programs on the company's computers turned out to be unlicensed, although the insurers entered into an agreement with a supplier about purchasing computers with pre-installed licensed software.  Terentyev said that the prosecutor‚Äôs office opened a criminal case against the supplier, and the computers that were later returned to the insurance company would serve as material evidence. <br><br>  In March, police and prosecutors conducted mass inspections of insurers, Iolanta Prantskevichienƒó, a legal consultant to the Alliance of Business Software Manufacturers (BSA), which united the world's largest computer software developers, told Vedomosti earlier.  And Vladimir Ionkin, the deputy head of the Rosstrakhnadzor, promised that his department would check the legality of software of insurers by itself, because the removal of computers by the police threatens the financial stability of insurance companies. <br><br>  According to one of the Ufa businessmen, law enforcement agencies were engaged not only by insurers - computers were recently confiscated and the property of one of the city travel agencies was arrested.  Search for counterfeit programs is hardly particularly difficult - according to IDC, in 2006 the average level of piracy among companies in Russia was 71%, including in the food industry - 80%, in design and advertising - 76%, in design and production - 74%, and the most disciplined industries were oil and gas - 66%, as well as banks and insurers - 60%. <br><br>  Police activity has led to an increase in revenue for program developers.  Sales of licensed Windows and Office in Russia have risen sharply over the past month, acknowledges Microsoft PR manager Kira Kiryukhina.  Director of Business Development at Ultra Elecronics Sergey Suvorov says that now in Russia it is not easy to find Vista, the latest version of Windows.  ‚ÄúSoftware orders from enterprises and government agencies have risen sharply in our softkey.ru store since the beginning of the year,‚Äù said Felix Muchnik, CEO of Softkey, ‚Äúand by their structure it is obvious that companies are conducting an inventory of software legality on computers and purchasing additional licenses. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2007/03/26/122921">Vedomosti</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5766/</a></p>
