  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Casual Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever wondered why some things have become so?  How to create a washable sleeve in a roll of toilet paper?  Why began to make other covers in packs for juice? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f48/c75/7d0/f48c757d07ec435eb9e5a4f5149ea1bf.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a>  In this article, problems will be considered, for the solution of which the theory of solving inventive problems is ideally suited (or maybe not).  They do not claim to be valuable, but at one time made me think about them. <br><br>  In short, TRIZ is a theory for solving <s>almost all</s> technical problems, which is based on several simple techniques.  The only problem is to see them. <br>  I recommend to read and read more about the author and the theory itself <a href="http://www.altshuller.ru/">here.</a>

      In the meantime, we will continue immediately with the tasks.  So that you yourself can think about the task, the solutions are hidden in the spoilers. <br><br><h2>  Hatch shape </h2><br>  Let's start with a simple at first glance question: Why is the manhole round? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Decision</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  What is the problem with the hatch and its cover?  To prevent the cover from falling into the sewers accidentally. The circle is the only figure where any segment through its center is of the same length, which means that the hatch cannot be thrown into the hole of the same shape (the rectangular hatch is possible like other figures). </div></div><br><h2>  Rinse sleeve in toilet roll </h2><br>  For a long time, the sleeve from the roll was a cardboard tube, which meant a clear need to throw it in the trash.  Not the longest action, but still distracting and a bit annoying.  So how to simplify the system? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Solution</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The problem with the sleeve is that it must remain solid until the roll ends.  And then that with it will no longer matter.  The sleeve should be, so that there is something to wind the roll on and at the same time it should not be, so that there is no need to throw it away separately.  Or throw it away, but immediately to the toilet.  And there, under the influence of the environment, the sleeve softens.  So there was a flush sleeve in the toilet in a roll of toilet paper. <br></div></div><br><h2>  Covers in packs for juice </h2><br>  When there is very little juice left in the package, a small portion of it gets stuck in the bag and you need to cut a corner to get to the liquid.  How to get rid of it? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The most obvious and already implemented method is to either install the package lid at an angle, or change the top of the package so that the juice and other liquid cannot get stuck in the corners of the package. <br></div></div><br><h2>  The safest swimming pool for people who can't swim </h2><br>  Everyone wants to swim, but not everyone is ready to go to the pools with shallow bottoms, especially with friends who know how to swim.  We need to make sure that both are as comfortable as possible in the same pool. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">One solution</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  One of the solutions implemented is to copy the usual sea beach: at the beginning of the water a little, going further it gets to the throat (which is enough for those who can not swim), and if you swim far away, then the bottom is no longer visible. </div></div><br><h2>  Tire holes </h2><br>  It is necessary to find an inexpensive express method for detecting air leakages in a car tire. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hint solution</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Alternative questions (this problem is as understandable (PEP)): <br><br><ul><li>  How to find a tire leak </li><li>  How to predict the possible location of a tire leak </li><li>  How to find a way to self-leakage in a tire </li></ul><br>  The first option is clearer than the original one, since it is more specific.  The more specific the problem is, the easier it is to solve it. </div></div><br><h2>  Marriage at the tube of toothpaste factory </h2><br>  Sometimes at the factory, some toothpaste tubes remain empty.  Such a marriage is rare, but can greatly harm the company.  Then they invented a special device that shines through tubes and weighs them, but it cost too much and was noisy.  The guard was very disturbed by the noise and he did <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Following</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We use what we have: since empty tubes are much lighter filled, they could easily be blown away by the wind.  He installed a fan next to the conveyor, which blew the defective tubes into the box and saved the company a substantial part of the money. <br></div></div><br><h2>  How to brand jewelry bracelet, consisting of many links?  How to brand the whole bracelet? </h2><br>  On the one hand, putting a stamp on each link is a solution, but it requires too much time.  But on the other hand, you can brand the entire bracelet entirely, putting a full-length stamp on it - then there will be a stamp on each link. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Another solution</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Another option would be to simplify the first method - to brand each link separately.  If you solve the problem with speed, then this will be another optimal solution.  What needs to be done with each link?  Solder!  So, if you make a special composition of the spikes, then it will be difficult to fake it, which means that you can prove the authenticity of the bracelet in this way. </div></div><br><h2>  Ladders for palm trees </h2><br>  In one of the countries, the following problem arose: many palm trees grow on the territory from which sugar can be made.  The problem is that the juice for this must be taken at the very top of the palm tree.  How then to reach the top? <br><br>  It seems that the answer is simple: in order to reach the high places, people have come up with stairs!  You can certainly use them ... but to put them to all the palm trees or to transfer from one to another quite a costly and tedious task. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Solution with explanation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Then we try in a different way: we have a tree to climb.  Is it possible to combine a palm tree and a ladder?  This suggests making the stairs on the palm tree itself.  You can implement this idea by cutting protrusions on it. <br><br>  The only problem is that the tree will die from so many notches at once.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúladder‚Äù on a tree has only one drawback - you cannot immediately make all the projections. <br>  This is where the issue of time comes into force: if you leave several notches once a month, the tree will not die from this.  In the end, it will be possible to get to the very top of the tree with the help of a ladder in itself. <br><br>  Sometimes to solve a problem you need to consider the process of its appearance. </div></div><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Many problems and tasks can be translated into TRIZ.  Sometimes it can help and push on really good solutions, so you shouldn‚Äôt give up at least an independent acquaintance with this theory. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af7/912/27d/af791227d0734e5798b99282dffaf0e0.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314332/</a></p>
