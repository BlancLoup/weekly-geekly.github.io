In this post I would like to describe a little what was at the conference, as well as show some of its parts from the inside (in the photo) <br>  Under the cut a lot of pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Yandex.Browser </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa0/4cf/675/aa04cf675fbb5d3fe75bd457a25b9e8a.jpg"></a>  (on a larger click, if small, tell me where you can put the originals, and then habrastorage squeezes) <br>  The browser initially seemed another clone.  However, as soon as they started talking about functions, I changed my mind. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      From the functions I paid attention to these points: <br><ul><li>  Turbo, that is, there is a hybrid of chromium and opera. </li><li>  Hints - for example, you can type in the query ‚Äúweather in Moscow‚Äù, ‚Äútime ..‚Äù or a question in a line and the browser will poll the relevant services.  And also you can enter for example a mail and instead of going to the search you will immediately go to mail.ru (an example from the presentation) </li><li>  Built-in buttons - now you do not need to look for the contacts button on the site, it will always be on top next to the address. </li><li>  Dynamic metro-like icons on the table.  We get a certain analogue of the deceased Google service with widgets on the main one. </li><li>  Dynamic dictionary - highlight the word, see the description.  The same with the translation. </li></ul><br>  For a start, not bad, because  This is the first client, where not just replaced the icon, but added compression, and integration into services to the fullest. <br><br><h4>  Yandex.Store </h4><br>  1. Missed a piece when photographing.  Yandex showed that the android is leading the mobile OS market in Russia. <br><br>  2 <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92a/31b/c4d/92a31bc4d5bebcc3a3e7e0f8219a7957.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. I wonder where they took such statistics, because many do not change the default search engine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e6/d33/0ef/9e6d330efd1bcbb8a14e4a8007dd6292.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4. Yandex has in its arsenal a large number of applications created for mobile platforms. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/120/1c0/132/1201c0132106af54899b909626039579.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  5. Over the year, the audience of Yandex users on OS Android has grown 4 times. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d83/c2a/e91/d83c2ae91974342ff8f93f1651fc036f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  6. In my opinion, Yandex.Taxi appeared not so long ago.  The service is useful and we expect it to grow. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06c/8a5/d23/06c8a5d231fbce88381a23896b6e70b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  7. Existing Yandex ecosystem on Android devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14c/a1b/584/14ca1b58463a903dc97d8c334c0a7f87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  8. Yandex represents Yandex.Store which will allow you to conveniently interact with the existing ecosystem.  For example, it is more convenient to pay for purchases from Yandex.Koshelka or pay from a mobile account, which is important in the Russian reality, when not many have a bank card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb4/9d7/4d5/bb49d74d5d0d384e5dca5758f1f813da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  9. Appearance of new Yandex.Stora <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e77/358/8db/e773588db62167d482ec6bb0ff07a448.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I want to add that I watched the Store on the stand.  At the moment, the version does not know how to work with the position of the screen - only the book.  The speed is not bad, although it is difficult to judge - Wifi worked poorly. <br><br>  It looks like an old Android Market.  Above there is a carousel from popular applications.  When scrolling, they smoothly flow like jelly.  But the functionality, at first consideration, is still poor. <br><br>  10. Honestly - I listened to the description of this slide, and did not understand its essence. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/410/d2c/c51/410d2cc51f6c3613d61031a866ca07c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  eleven. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc6/e4d/338/cc6e4d33803d8c6d195c7d592459df90.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8e/dae/63f/d8edae63faccb28e5498decc7d3f2643.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  12. MegaFon will have its own version with brand design. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b8/324/9a8/5b83249a8a917b885a4901764060b7a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  13. Store will open by the end of 2012, but now you can place your applications.  At the moment the placement of applications is free.  But then it is possible with the purpose of screening garbage, will introduce a fee for registration.  So I recommend to quickly take the place of the developer for the future.  For work there are additional API and favorable conditions for generating income. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/def/2b0/147/def2b0147b3d0b0e4dea4a8d90b33b9c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc2/75d/ddb/fc275dddb3e2adc36e83b3e27440bbdf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f37/4b2/d0e/f374b2d0e93fe0698413ed92af887cad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  14. And finally. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/ef2/b5c/ae7ef2b5cb73a10b7849016947426cd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/016/6b4/4440166b426ca5f4c85d0ef9c7948e7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/064/eae/074/064eae0749d1ffa0f4b4ec083b52f36a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The appearance of the stand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/563/ea3/839563ea3ca1cf75c562c2f21768722c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Impression </h4><br>  The performances were much better and more interesting than last year.  However, the organization let us down. <br><br>  During lunch and coffee break in the hall there were few tables and places of issue.  And the hall itself was small.  As a result, we had to stand in line for 15 minutes, and by that time everything would be taken apart.  And the food was worse. <br>  The most unpleasant thing was at the end - beer-party.  Last year, the organizers took care of those who do not drink: they distributed beer, juice and canap√©s.  It was possible to eat canap√©s with juice.  In the same year, incomprehensible taste of rusks and cold cutlet, plus beer.  And it turned out that people took food in one line, beer in another (it took under 30 minutes), and then they tried to eat it all standing up.  there were no free tables. <br><br>  Also, at the very beginning, the ribbons for the badge ran out - really it was impossible to calculate the number of enrollees?  Also the halls were too small - people crowded in the aisle and sat on the stairs.  In some rooms the sound was too quietly tuned - sometimes it wasn‚Äôt disassembled.  I consider the ideal hall to be the first - many places, good sound and large projectors screens. <br><br>  By the way, here's the catch of things: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/9f5/94e/dd29f594ee77b44cce054cf78a8fb205.jpg" alt="image">  (the phone is not included in the catch. I wanted to show that the wipers belong to mobile devices, the wipers stick very well to the back of the case and are easily removed. I took it off, wiped it, put it on - the magic thing) <br><br>  And of course not without a robot. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bda/44d/caf/bda44dcafb1445964df4194508dc899b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I apologize for not very high-quality photos.  But I think the information will be useful. <br>  In which hub, by the way, can you move with low karma to make it more relevant to the topic? <br><br>  I was asked to add a video from the closing.  (beer-party, performance of The Jumping Cats) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wgmU0TthoM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3QkteFmd-2gaamwR8klugwfsSDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/headfore/" class="user_link">HeadFore</a> noticed that when you enter "Google" it still goes into the search.  Replaced in the article an example of the original, I did not think that Yandex will not register here the association. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153065/</a></p>
