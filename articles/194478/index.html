I had to fly through Rostov and get from Rostov by train with the working class.  But when the camp began, I never regretted the time spent on the road.  The opening was unnoticed, as should be the opening of events.  And everyone went their tracks.  I stayed on the process track.  I could probably do the engineering track myself.  The track began with a fun "seating".  It was very difficult to decide between "smart" and "beautiful" - a physicator and a generator of ideas.  As a result, at each table as part of each team, there was one facilitator and an idea generator. <br>  The first exercise was the presentation.  It was necessary to interview a neighbor.  Ask the name, surname, company and three facts about the person, and then present it to the team.  A similar exercise was at Induction training at AT Consulting. <br><br><h5>  Marshmallow challenge </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa8/2e7/6e0/fa82e76e03cea2d5eebd1c1cc218f28a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After dating - immediately into battle.  Known in narrow circles marshmellow challenge was new to me.  The essence of the marshmellow challenge is that the team must build a tower of several macoronones, scotch, strings and marshmallows, so that it would be higher than the other teams and stand as long as possible.  It was difficult to convince the team to try and build a small tower first, as early as possible, and then improve it.  The fact that it was necessary to do just that coach and told after the challenge.  The guys from my team tried to read when measuring the height of the tower, but they failed. <br><br><h5>  Scrum simulation </h5><br><br>  Product Owner talks about Martians: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/eb8/507/bf8eb85073ecfd56eab9c6e33f26d42a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then, after the break, we went over to the scram simulation.  The theory I publish, it is full of the Internet.  The team chose product ovner and scrum masters.  We chose the project we will work on.  Brochure on the Martian Earth Leisure Advertising.  Began to generate backlog.  No matter how hard I tried to convince the team that at the next stage our fantasies would have to be drawn to us, no one listened to me.  What kind of fun began when they began to perform their tasks and draw brochures.  The counselor had to make everyone show their products to the audience.  So it would be more fun.  In general, it is not the first time that I participate in the scram simulation once I even conducted my own training.  And I do not leave the feeling that the simulation must be done somehow differently.  Although the main problems of communication team, it is excellent highlights. <br><br><h5>  Business Model Canvas </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fd/cc4/363/9fdcc4363fe922af33a1106f5e284598.jpg" alt="image"><br>  What liked AgileCamp, so this is the minimum theory and maximum practice.  It is through a practical exercise and you need to carry the agile to the masses, which ScrumTrek successfully does.  After lunch, it came to the Business Model Canvas.  Actually that was the most interesting and useful for me in this camp.  We also selected a product.  This time it was a mobile application for movie lovers.  It was a good idea to glue items with stickers on sheets of flipchart.  When we did the Business Model Canvas on a blackboard for a distance learning project, we really lacked this life hacking.  For the rest, unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find out anything new about the Business Model Canvas, since my expectations for ScrumTrek were somewhat overstated.  Again, during this full-length exercise, the problem of communication in the team arose.  Although this time there were several moments when the team listened to me carefully on some issues.  I really did not understand how to repeat this experience in the future. <br><br><h5>  Story Mapping Persons </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b70/f49/a8e/b70f49a8e4c46243296c8ec31df898ff.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From the BMC, we gradually moved to the persona.  Again, my expectations turned out to be somewhat high and exactly the same thing we did with the guys at one time for a distance learning project.  By the end of the day, obviously, everyone was tired and the process was somewhat sluggish.  As a result, we have got the person with whom we will continue to work literally now. <br><br>  In addition to the camp exercises themselves, I came to recharge my batteries and systematize some knowledge in the field.  And also come up with a concept for changing the processes in the company in which I am currently working.  Both goals successfully achieved. <br><br>  PS: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rpilin/media_set%3Fset%3Da.10201882395842458.1073741826.1260380992%26type%3D1">photos from camp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194478/</a></p>
