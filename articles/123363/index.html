For more than six months, answering the questions of my friends, I try to say what is now, what services you can already use and why all this is necessary.  And I was always amazed, well, why no one can normally convey the information to the main consumer of these services (to me, to you, to us). <br><br>  And I understand the enormous PR budgets of the entire e-initiative, but I don‚Äôt understand why no one can do one simple thing for these huge budgets: think like a consumer and check everything for yourself.  In general, I decided that we need to make a project that solves this problem.  And since I am a journalist by training, since I am engaged in eGov, since I am also a consumer, I can constructively implement a media platform: <a href="http://ru-egov.ru/"><b>eGov Live: everything about e-government in the Russian Federation</b></a>

Good words of inaction.  Well?  That is, on the basis of this promise, we are not at all interested in the fact that those systems where billions from the budget are allocated work for US.  Recently laid out Volkova about cloud democracy.  Logically, yes?  And wait for our new project soon.  BUT!  I do not like the words DEMOCRACY, if the demos (we are with you) are not in the subject at all.  I would call it less politicized: crowdsourcing efficiency.  Yes, that's so difficult in English, but in the case and in fact. <br><br>  In general, in all countries of the world, the most important factor for the development of eGov is the environment, the active involvement of the population in development, the discussion of services and projects.  But the bottom line is that as long as each of us does not understand what is the benefit, plus an electronic or mobile government, what changes it, nothing like this will happen.  And even the phrases about the fact that it will help reduce the bureaucratic apparatus, that the need for face-to-face communication with officials will disappear, that you can monitor the promises of public servants - these are just words.  I propose to move from the words, in fact, to the case.  For eGov and so is implemented.  The question is that if we are not in the process, then this is all done in half. <br><br>  The site is still hanging plug - <a href="http://ru-egov.ru/">ru-egov.ru</a> <br>  Our FaceBook Page - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/eGov-Live/335051485956">eGovLive</a> <br>  Our Twitter - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/eGov-Live/335051485956">@eGov_Live</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123363/</a></p>
