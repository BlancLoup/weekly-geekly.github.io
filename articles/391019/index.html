The claims of the right holders were related to the fact that the programs produced and sold by SlySoft made it possible to bypass the copy protection of various formats, including games and videos for CD, DVD and BluRay. <br><br>  The site on the slysoft.com domain has ceased to function - however, on February 29, the project suddenly <a href="http://www.myce.com/news/slysoft-now-called-redfox-moves-to-belize-78735/">surfaced</a> in a new place and under a new name.  Now the company is called RedFox and works on the <a href="https://forum.redfox.bz/">redfox.bz</a> domain (bz is a first-level domain owned by the state of Belize).

      So far, the site only has a forum that has been completely transferred from the old site, and domain registration data is hidden using PrivacyProtect.org services so that it is impossible to determine its owner. <br><br>  Company SlySoft its founder, the former owner of the casino, Giancarlo Bettini, began with the purchase of a license for the program CloneCD.  This program, sponsored by the Elaborate Bytes team, was a very powerful tool to bypass the then popular copy protections, including Safedisc and SecuROM.  The CloneCD, CloneDVD and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnyDVD">AnyDVD</a> software suite allows you to successfully copy (for example, to create backup copies) data drives. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company has repeatedly experienced pressure from copyright holders.  In 2011, she was dragged into an AACS-LA court, licensing AACS protection, but the case ended in nothing.  In 2014, SlySoft, registered on the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, was accused of violating the copyright laws of this country.  With the owner charged a fine of $ 11,000. <br><br>  One of the leading developers of the company, known in the forums under the name of James, <a href="http://www.myce.com/news/anydvd-lead-developer-doesnt-rule-out-he-will-crack-aacs-2-0-78721/">did not rule out the possibility of</a> hacking a new protection.  Apparently, the developers will continue to work on the program AnyDVD, - perhaps under a different name. <br><br>  Regarding the hacking of new-format disks, James refused to make plans for the future, because he does not have either a disk or the necessary player to test them for strength, or documentation on this format, and therefore, he will have to reverse-engineer for hacking. <br><br>  One of the difficulties of the program in the future is the need to install only signed drivers in Windows 10.  Since the work of AnyDVD depends heavily on the driver, they will have to send it to Microsoft for a signature - and there is a possibility that it will not be signed due to bad reputation. <br><br>  James himself proposed an unorthodox solution to the problem: he wrote that he sees the AnyDVD version written for the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and decrypting the disks is the task of a ‚Äúdecryption box‚Äù running under the control of a single-board device.  This box could be connected to a computer via USB or Ethernet.  True, he himself admits that this is a rather bold idea, and it is unclear whether users will like it and whether it will be implemented at all. <br><br>  It is not yet known whether RedFox will continue to work on SlySoft products, and in what form - according to James, the former owner of SlySoft is under pressure from the authorities in Antigua, and besides, he should be left to the development team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391019/</a></p>
