Today we will try.  There were ups and downs, very often went by trial and error, but any experience is invaluable, so we‚Äôll share it with you, who can be useful.  We will not write smart, and already become commonplace tips on SEO, Adwords, etc., we will try to be as specific as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d7/506/477/8d7506477b25e5498cf3e2ec946b63ce.jpg"><br><br>  So, <b>squeeze out the main methods of attracting new users</b> and strengthening the loyalty of existing ones, which successfully work for our project to this day: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Distribution of press releases </h5><br>  Issue press releases about important updates and new versions of <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">TeamLab</a> .  The submit occurs both on paid resources and on free ones.  Here are a few resources, the result of posting which is palpable.  We take into account such factors as the popularity and specificity of the resource, the number of reposts, good results in search engines, traffic to our site, feedback:

      in Russian: <br>  <a href="http://b2blogger.com/">http://b2blogger.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://ain.ua/">http://ain.ua/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.livebusiness.ru/">http://www.livebusiness.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/">http://msug.vn.ua</a> <br>  <a href="http://f1cd.ru/">http://f1cd.ru</a> <br><br>  in English: <br>  <a href="http://www.dwpub.com/">http://www.dwpub.com</a> - 70 GBP <br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com/">http://www.prweb.com</a> - cost of accommodation varies from $ 89 to $ 369, but the result is palpable <br>  <a href="http://www.widepr.com/">http://www.widepr.com</a> is an example of a free but effective resource. <br><br><h5>  Email newsletter </h5><br>  Mass mailing to users.  Despite the ambiguous attitude towards email marketing, we consider this a convenient and operational way to notify about all updates.  We do not spam to no avail and, of course, provide an opportunity to quickly unsubscribe. <br><br><h5>  Social network activity </h5><br>  It is not only about the omnipresent FaceBook and its Russian counterpart VC, but also a number of resources of a more narrow focus.  So, among business communities, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIN</a> can be distinguished, the majority of users of which are not hiding under their nicknames (ala ‚ÄúBagheera 812‚Äù), but have quite detailed profiles describing their service record and professional interests.  Thus, by maintaining the group and answering questions in the q / a section of the community, you not only receive traffic, but also very valuable information from industry professionals and the possibility of establishing new business contacts.  So, for example, in the absence of experience promoting a project in the countries of South America, members of the mass media and marketing specialists of the respective countries provided invaluable assistance. <br><br>  The basic rule that we follow when working with social networks is regular updates on the page or in a group of companies and operational feedback.  If a user has contacted us via Facebook or VC with questions about the service, we do not send him to tech support, but try to find out right on the spot in a timely manner.  We arrange, of course, contests in which we play a subscription to our Extra services.  There are also thematic contests dedicated to a holiday (love hockey for Valentine's Day, for example) and ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù in the style of ‚ÄúWrite why you love TeamLab‚Äù.  In addition, we regularly conduct particularly thorough monitoring of all social networks for the purpose of mentioning TeamLab by ordinary users, answering questions, comments, suggestions, helping to make the right choice.  Not to ignore any mention helps us service <a href="http://socialmention.com/">http://socialmention.com</a> <br><br>  We can not forget the now popular placement of paid posts in social networks.  Among Russian services, such services are offered: <br>  <a href="http://smiar.ru/">http://smiar.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.prospero.ru/">http://www.prospero.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.twite.ru/">http://www.twite.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://socialtools.ru/">http://socialtools.ru</a> <br><br>  Among foreign ones, you can highlight <a href="http://buysellads.com/buy/allsites/by/tweets">http://buysellads.com</a> (offers quality accounts with clear targeting) and <a href="http://fiverr.com/categories/social-marketing">http://fiverr.com</a> Moreover, the latter can realize literally all your fantasies for promotion, starting from creating video tutorials and ending with messages, written on the cappuccino foam. <br><br><h5>  News social sites </h5><br>  Stable traffic can provide links to news social sites links to news / review / comparison of your project.  Most popular sites: <br><br>  Multidirectional topics <br>  <a href="http://digg.com/">http://digg.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">http://www.delicious.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">http://www.stumbleupon.com</a> and its Russian counterpart <a href="http://surfingbird.ru/">http://surfingbird.ru</a> <br><br>  IT oriented <br>  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">http://news.ycombinator.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dzone.com/">http://www.dzone.com</a> <br><br>  As our practice shows, Stumbleupon and Surfing bird give the most lasting effect due to the orientation of resources, primarily on the subject matter of the published material, and not the date of its placement, while other resources give priority to the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù news. <br><br><h5>  Work with Q / A services </h5><br>  Initially, we were active in almost all known ‚Äúquestion-answer‚Äù resources.  Practice, or rather Google Analytics, shows that there are very few ‚Äúgeneral replies‚Äù about ‚Äúeverything in the world‚Äù, but <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> is famous as a more serious community, which could only be reached by one invite : this resource provides us with stable traffic, and most of all from the USA.  As for the IT communities, in our case many users come from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> . <br>  In addition to specialized q / a services, you should not forget that many sites with IT (or business) topics have forums.  So, the answer to one question in the French <a href="http://www.commentcamarche.net/">http://www.commentcamarche.net</a> back in 2010 brings a large number of stable visits to the French version of TeamLab to this day. <br><br><h5>  About blogs, my blogs ... </h5><br>  Placing articles and reviews on blogs can be both a huge success and a completely empty sound, so when choosing this type of resources, you must carefully study the audience and the nature of the published materials. <br>  From the infinitely huge blogosphere can be identified those who publish custom posts and those who can send guest, provided that they are not of an advertising nature and will be useful to readers of the blog.  If everything is clear with the first ones, it‚Äôs just a wallet, then writing guest posts takes much more time and effort.  In this case, the blogger / editor of the magazine has the full right to refuse publication if he did not like it. <br>  Our strategy in this direction is to write thematic reviews of tools useful to the blog audience.  It can be as 10 open source systems for project management, and an overview of useful services for the effective operation of small businesses.  At the same time, often the guest free post really gave more transitions than a review for 60-80 bucks. <br><br>  Examples of successful free guest posts in rating blogs: <br><br>  in Russian <br>  <a href="http://maulnet.ru/archives/18077">10 free business process management applications</a> on <a href="http://maulnet.ru/">Maulnet</a> <br>  <a href="http://blog.dimok.ru/7-sistem-upravleniya-proektami-dlya-nebolshoj-komandy">7 project management systems for a small team</a> on <a href="http://blog.dimok.ru/">BlogDimka</a> <br><br>  in English <br>  <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/top-7-collaboration-software-tools-for-successful-freelancers/">Top 7 Collaboration Software Tools for Successful Freelancers</a> on <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">FreelanceFolder</a> <br>  <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/product-reviews/open-source-project-management-tools/">Top 10 Open Source Project Management Apps for Freelancers</a> on <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">Freelanceswitch</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.famousbloggers.net/most-popular-online-project-management-solutions.html">10 Most Popular Online Project Management Solutions</a> at <a href="http://www.famousbloggers.net/">FamousBloggers</a> <br><br><h5>  Thematic directories and directories </h5><br>  Of all their many, we list only those that bring us high traffic: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.alternativeto.net/">www.alternativeto.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://freecode.com/">http://freecode.com</a> (formerly freshmeat) - cross-platform software directory <br>  <a href="http://www.getapp.com/">http://www.getapp.com</a> - directory for business software <br>  <a href="http://www.cnet.com/">http://www.cnet.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.appappeal.com/">http://www.appappeal.com</a> - directory for web applications <br><br>  That's probably all for today, we hope, the <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">TeamLab</a> experience will be useful for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142851/</a></p>
