  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evenings and weekends are cheaper.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When a new advertiser comes to contextual advertising, he, as a rule, is guided by standard ideas about the time of activity of potential buyers on the Web - and, of course, adjusts the display of advertising for business hours.  An additional argument in favor of such settings is the time of the services of the advertiser.  He fears that the user who saw the advertisement in the evening or on weekends will click on it, but will not call back during business hours.  And the money paid for the transition to the ad, will be spent in vain. <br><br>  How do Web users actually show activity? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Analytical center "Runner" conducted a study of the behavior of network users and advertisers of the service, as a result of which data were collected on the display of advertisements, clicks and dynamics of the average rate for three weeks.

    <h4>  Weekdays </h4><br>  Peak user activity really falls in the middle of the working day.  At five in the evening, workers begin to leave their offices, and activity falls.  By eight o'clock they get home - activity begins to slowly grow: <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b1.jpg"><br><br>  On the network, the decrease in activity is significantly lower than on the search engine. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b2.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the degree of interest of web users to advertising (this is how one can interpret the usual CTR) fluctuates insignificantly throughout the day. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b3.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the fact that the majority of advertisers restrict the broadcast of advertising only working hours, this leads to the following consequences: <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b4.jpg"><br><br>  Advertising campaigns, according to the settings, are activated in the morning on a schedule.  Some of them, in addition to time constraints, also have daily budget constraints.  From 11 to 13 hours the heat of the auction struggle reaches its maximum.  And then budget constraints work, and rates start to fall smoothly.  The autotrade system, which in the period of activity tries to keep ads at the highest positions, raising rates to the set limits, in the absence of competition, lowers rates, saving advertisers budgets.  At 6 pm, the rates drop sharply, as the activity of many campaigns ends, and the further decline in rates continues.  At midnight, the rates increase slightly in comparison with the last hours of the day.  This is due to the activation of unlimited campaigns that stopped before midnight due to the limited daily spending limit. <br><br>  A similar picture of the behavior of bets is observed on the affiliate network, with the exception of the daily surge.  It is slightly weaker than on search. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b5.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Weekend </h4><br>  The search engine audience does not disappear at the weekend, on the contrary, it actively uses the Internet.  The final picture of the weekend partly similar to the everyday.  But in the evening there is no decline in activity, on the contrary, it is growing. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b6.jpg"><br><br>  In the contextual network, the situation is similar: <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b7.jpg"><br><br>  The contextual network is affected by daily budget constraints that increase the cost of night-time clicks.  Bids during the day does not become significantly lower, but the cost of a click still remains cheaper than on a search. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Average rates </h4><br>  On Monday, competition among advertisers is increasing - many of them have replenished campaign budgets.  On Sunday, the rates are quite low: weekly budgets have already been spent, replenishment will be only at the beginning of the week.  And some of the campaigns are just turned off for the weekend. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b9.jpg"><br><br>  On the contextual network, the rates for switching to weekends are, on average, also significantly lower. <br><br><img src="http://invites.ru/habr/b10.jpg"><br><br>  The practical recommendations of the above are as follows.  Significantly reduce the cost of attracting customers can broadcast advertising in the evening and on weekends.  The conversion rate for customers who clicked at this time will be slightly lower than the corresponding ratio for working time.  But at the same time, the rates for the transition will significantly fall.  As a result, the cost of attracting the end customer will decrease.  And if an online ordering system is organized on the advertiser's site, then simply stop broadcasting advertising on weekdays and weekends.  The main thing is to ‚Äúland‚Äù the client on the correct pages, without forcing him to wander endlessly around the site in search of the necessary information. <br><br>  If for the company it is important to broadcast advertising during working hours, then here you can play for a fall.  It is enough to pay attention to the time interval from 14 to 17 hours.  It is during this period that the peak of requests from network users falls, and the response to advertising (CTR) is consistently high.  But the rates from two o'clock are beginning to fall, as many advertisers have daily budgets have ended.  Therefore, having delayed the start of broadcasting ads, you can advertise during hours of audience activity much cheaper than competitors. <br><br>  You can view the full version of the study on the Runner website in the <a href="http://begun.ru/begun/research/">Research</a> section. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39559/</a></p>
