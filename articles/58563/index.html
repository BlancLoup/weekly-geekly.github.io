I was even once advised to make for a portfolio in general free or fake.  And there are all sorts of clever people who advise in general to paint fences or to go as a salesman for those who want, but for the time being, do not know how to design-draw. <br><br>  I will not lie, I also vehemently advised to buy pictures from stocks, and not to steal.  (It took root after Megatrening at Payas)

      I think that I have passed the path of a beginner and I think that if more people met who really suggest I would have reached my level much earlier. <br><br>  <b>And so, I would like to give advice, my own advice, which is not postulates, axioms and other indisputable.</b>  <b>This, in part, is the experience of strong designers and people who can motivate, tried by me and brought me results.</b> <br><br>  1. <i>Find like-minded people.</i> <br>  For example, designforum.ru or work where at the beginning they train a specialist who will work there.  But you do not have to immediately go to makepizdato.ru, strong designers have gathered there and they simply will not help the novice, moreover - after such comments, the fighting spirit will simply fall.  And the designer should not fall anything). <br><br>  In short, we choose a community according to our level, but do not forget that only you will understand that you are being "zaplyusyvayut" there must be to look for something more difficult. <br>  <i>Sit on the spot - to get everything the same</i> , but we are not satisfied with this. <br><br>  2. <i>Understand the point</i> <br>  How?  Prompts.  Open Photoshop, zoom in on the maximum and put the smallest dot ... see the square?  That's all these consist of! <br>  I understood this only when I started using SvishMax (analogue Flash) - there is not such a choice of tools and more often you draw primitives. <br>  Many items are just a combination of primitives and simple combinations. <br><br>  3. <i>Realism is optional</i> <br>  You do not need to study academic drawing, optics, physics.  You can just watch the nature.  For example, look at the reflections from the pipe when you go to the subway.  And even without this, you can draw nicely, here's an example of a plum ... in my opinion, pretty? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d06/4a1/f4b/d064a1f4b6dcf759c7b22a6e7fa657c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4. <i>Practice, practice and some theory</i> <br>  Stupidly copy, take a picture of an apple and draw, then take a crumpled ticket from your pocket, put it down and copy again. <br>  I am now moving in the ratio of 5-6 practices for one kind of new effect (if he jerked me and I consider it necessary for me in general). <br>  Although, of course, for a start, it is still necessary a little and theory (light, shadow, etc.) <br><br>  5. <i>PR</i> <br>  PageRank ... joked) <br>  A PR is needed.  And the web designer needs to learn the breast and crest from the very beginning.  On this depends not only your fame among designers, but also the rating among customers.  Yes, and the ability to present themselves beautifully is directly proportional to the ability to sell a product. <br><br>  6. <i>Good source</i> <br>  Do you draw or draw something?  Do not be lazy and spend 5 minutes on the selection of the right - it will save 30 minutes to process or draw in the future. <br>  Try it, just try it yourself, don't make a conclusion right away. <br><br>  7. <i>Score on (empty) positive komenty</i> <br>  ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuper!‚Äù - this is good, of course, and it means that you have passed the first step.  It must be remembered that the best is the enemy of the good, which means that it is necessary not to relax the bread and at least be proud and cool, but still continue to grow over yourself. <br><br>  8. <i>Designer must dream</i> <br>  Dreaming about money, fame, the girl of a beautiful girlfriend, girlfriend, universal recognition, that he will be a superhero. <br>  Dreams often help to get out of depression, to hammer on the bluntness of power, or just to focus on achieving results. <br><br>  9. <i>Understanding that it is possible to become the head of a firm, team</i> <br>  It is necessary to understand not only in Photoshop, but to be interested in the world.  We need to communicate with people, meet, attract big masses and find more friends and acquaintances. <br><br>  10. <i>Try to guide, just try.</i> <br>  This is generally an invaluable experience.  Project management, communication with the customer, self-organization ... The sooner you try to make a paid order, the better and more active your development will be.  Do not delay, there is something to sell - try to sell.  Are you afraid of dishonoring?) Well this is the Internet - almost everything is anonymous, you can then score on a freelance account and create a new one.  Do not be afraid. <br><br>  11. <i>Dumping is not evil, if in moderation.</i> <br>  It is NOT worth learning all your life in the hope that afterwards you will break the bank, go to the bank with a little. <br>  Better start with distant acquaintances, they will hardly beat you if you delay the project for a week, but they will also strain you in contrast to close people. <br><br>  12. <i>3-4 works - and set the bar higher</i> <br>  Even if you do an inexpensive job, do it at 120%.  Those.  do better than you paid for it.  Over time, it will pay off. <br><br>  13. <b>On this lucky number and decide</b> <br>  So far I have done these 12 steps, if it helps someone, in time I will write what I decided and what I am doing next. <br><br>  <a href="http://deadlyshadoff.livejournal.com/">my LiveJournal</a> <br>  <a href="http://activerise.com.ua/">my project</a> <br><br>  UPD: 14 <i>Properly write the text, otherwise you can enter the minus)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58563/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58563/</a></p>
