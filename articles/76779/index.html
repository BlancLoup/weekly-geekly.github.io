  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Project Initiation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any project inevitably goes through an initiation stage. <br><br>  This is actually the very moment when people get the idea.  Usually this is an idea in the form of ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we do something like ... and make a lot of money out of it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about ... but they say a lot of money there and I want it.‚Äù  However, sometimes the project starts with a clear understanding of what needs to be done (albeit in general terms), why it is being done and what specific results need to be achieved in the end.  Such launch conditions are paradise for the project.  Of course, paradise does not happen every time and not for everyone.  Sometimes it takes work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initialization is important because it is at this stage that the criteria for project success are formed.  And if you do not track down - whether their customer understood and acknowledged, the project can be safely designated as ‚Äúanother hemorrhoids‚Äù. <br><br>  So, father and brother Malchish-Kibalchish disappeared in unsuccessful projects:

      - Hey, get up!  - shouted the rider.  - Trouble came, from where it was not expected.  The damned burzhuin attacked us because of the Black Mountains. <br>  Again the bullets are whistling, the shells are again being torn.  Our detachments fight with burzhinami, and messengers rush to call the distant <br>  Red Army. <br>  So the red star horseman said these alarming words and sped away.  But Father Malchish went to the wall, took off his rifle ... <br><br>  Dad went with the tinker, in general, nowhere.  Well, shells are torn, well messengers rush, and so what.  What does the rider need?  Dad's entry into "our troops" or emergency evacuation?  Or maybe just need to get up and do not sleep, pray for the messengers?  It is not clear.  As a result, the father Malchish ingloriously disappears from the story.  A similar fate awaits his older brother. <br><br>  And only the cherished words ‚ÄúIf only we can stand the night and the day hold out‚Äù lead to the fact that the rebels were able to realize the plan and keep the burzhuins in place until the main forces arrived. <br><br>  In commercial projects - the same picture.  While there is no clear understanding of the goal - there will be nothing.  And before taking a rifle from the wall, tossing the bag and putting on a cartridge belt - it would be nice to understand what should be at the end.  Otherwise, the money and the strength of your project will be spent absolutely in vain. <br><br>  In my experience, the main risk here is unhealthy greed: when an expensive project is looming, you close your eyes to something as ‚Äúobvious‚Äù.  Moreover, every project that has spent at least a couple of projects understands that nothing obvious happens in principle. <br><br>  Well, of course, at the start of the project it is important not to promise the customer a flying carpet for 2 days and 15 kopecks.  Even with a thousand reservations that the estimates are preliminary, people remember them and perceive them as final. <br><br>  If all the conditions are met: you know what to do, you have dragged out the customer‚Äôs criterion of project success, and he still wants to do something with you ‚Äî go ahead, proceed to the design. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76779/</a></p>
