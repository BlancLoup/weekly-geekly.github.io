Also, the organizers promise that all the most spectacular and exciting moments of football matches will be available in bulk form. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Having successfully tested the ground in the January match between Arsenal and Manchester United, this summer 3D TV decided to make a really large-scale invasion of the stadiums, taking advantage of the international championship in South Africa as an excuse.  Five out of ten stadiums where football matches will be held in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth will be equipped with all necessary television equipment for sports 3D broadcasts so that the most interesting matches of the final tournament will be available to viewers in bulk form. <br><br>  These matches, as well as the opening of the championship and the award ceremony, will be shown on giant 3D screens installed in seven major cities of the world - Berlin, London, Mexico City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome and Sydney.  The rights to the 3D-broadcast of the games were bought by the American television network ESPN and the Spanish Sogecable, the Swiss company Aruna Media AG will show the three-dimensional football competitions in cinemas.

    <h4>  A bit of background </h4><br>  For several years now, leading sports channels have been broadcasting in HD - the same Sky Corporation has a special HD channel Sky specializing in high definition broadcasts.  The domestic satellite provider NTV + also has several sports HD channels in its subscription.  Now, a new channel Sky Sky, which began broadcasting in April of this year, has become available to viewers in Europe.  Sky 3D is supported by regular HD tuners, that is, Sky HD subscribers have to purchase only 3D TVs - the list of supported devices includes models from Sony, Samsung, LG and Panasonic. <br><br>  In our country and the near abroad, as we have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/91592/">written</a> , this possibility is provided by the company <a href="http://www.platformahd.ru/">Platform HD</a> , which, in addition to broadcasting conventional HD channels, also began selling equipment to watch its channel with 3D content.  Samsung in this project is a supplier of equipment for home users - 3D-TVs and glasses for them. <br><br><h4>  Technical points </h4><br>  Separately, I would like to note the fact that there are two options for viewing 3D content using our company's equipment: it is either to buy a regular TV with HD format and a suitable scanning frequency, or to buy a TV with built-in 3D image transfer function, which allows you to add volume even to a regular picture, due to the built-in processor specially designed for this purpose. <br><br>  In the first version, viewing 3D-video will be possible only in a ready-made form, that is, either from a player / flash drive, or from a satellite channel, or from services such as youtube or vimeo, on which it is already possible to download and process 3D videos ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/93672/">link</a> ). <br><br>  In the second version, the same football broadcasts can be converted into 3D in real time, and enjoy the effect obtained online.  According to the developers of the company, this mode was specially honed at sports broadcasts, where the TV processor can process the incoming stream in the most qualitative and accurate way.  By the way, at the moment this is the only opportunity to watch football in 3D-format simultaneously with other fans, as the organizers of the 3D broadcast from the 2010 World Cup have not been able to resolve the issue of live broadcasts. <br><br><h4>  Interesting Facts </h4><br>  ESPN, the largest sports channel in the United States, has entered into agreements with three major advertisers, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Sony and Disney Pixar, to show 3D advertising during the broadcast of matches.  For the all-American sports channel ESPN, the upcoming commercials will be the largest commercial ad placement in 3D. <br><br>  ESPN says that for advertisers, three-dimensional advertising opens previously unattainable opportunities for interaction with the audience.  However, the prices for such advertising are appropriate: depending on the match, they range from 500 thousand dollars to 1 million dollars, which is 30-40% more than for ordinary advertising. <br><br>  In Russia, 3D advertising is also not lagging behind, the traffic police, as part of the Last Last, social campaign, whose main goal is to warn drivers of the danger of going into the oncoming lane, was ordered a video advertisement of 3D advertising, which has no analogs in Russia It was.  It will be shown in cinemas before showing 3D films, which is logical.  I want to believe that the money spent on this innovative project will benefit. <br><br>  It is also known that after the shooting is completed, realistic games for the consoles will be created on the basis of three-dimensional models.  Representatives of the organizers say that the technical details of the broadcasting details are underway. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97168/</a></p>
