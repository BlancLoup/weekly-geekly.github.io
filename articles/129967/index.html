  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Revenue from advertising in social networks: $ 5.4 billion in 2011, $ 10 billion in 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://mediatarget.in/some/habr/071011/attention.png"><br><br>  According to analysts of eMarketer, the global profit from advertising in social networks will reach 5.54 billion dollars in 2011 - and will double by 2013. The calculation was compiled by eMarketer based on a number of popular social networks, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. <br>  Half the advertising revenue on social networks this year ($ 2.74 billion) is in the United States.  Not surprisingly, most of the amount is due to Facebook, which, according to experts' expectations, will save more than $ 3.8 billion in 2011 thanks to advertising, viewed by a huge audience of 800 million members of the network. <br>  Earnings are steadily growing, and eMarketer data suggests that in the next few years there will be major sources of advertising revenue not only in the United States, but also in other countries.  By 2013, profits in other countries will amount to 51.9% of the total amount, which is estimated at $ 10 billion.  In the US, in the same year, social networks will receive almost $ 5 billion from advertising. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Revenues from advertising in social networks increased by 50% in 2010 and, according to preliminary estimates, will increase by 55.6% this year.  Growth rates, however, will fall to 45% in 2012 and to 25.2% in 2013. <br><img src="http://mediatarget.in/some/habr/071011/emar.png"><br>  It is known that Twitter increased advertising revenue constantly.  Now, this network is likely to receive even more profits due to the new ‚Äúself-service‚Äù for advertisers.  For the first time, eMarketer analysts are predicting profits for LinkedIn, a professional network that has recently offered new, social advertising formats that are in many ways similar to Facebook ads. <br>  According to eMarketer, LinkedIn will have 3% of global advertising revenue on social networks this year, which will amount to $ 140.8 million.  For two years, the site has increased its advertising revenue more than three times, but analysts predict a gradual decline in growth rates.  Advertising revenue will increase by 79% in 2011, but will decrease to 44% in 2012 (reaching $ 200 million) and to 24.3% in 2013 ($ 250 million). <br>  However, LinkedIn registers two new network members every second, and the total number of registered people reaches 120 million, so this social network is still a popular advertising platform where an advertiser can easily attract consumers. <br>  In the global digital advertising market, 8.8% of the profits in the United States and 6.9% of the world profits are from social networks.  By 2013, revenues from advertising in social networks will amount to 11.7% of the profits from online advertising in the United States and 9.4% of world profits. <br>  Of course, there is a factor not mentioned in the eMarketer report - analysts did not take into account the possibility of introducing completely new advertising formats and their potential impact on profit growth in subsequent years.  So, for example, a few weeks ago Gokul Rajaram, Facebook's production director for advertising, admitted in the TechCrunch Disrupt project that their network is considering the possibility of introducing AdSense service for advertisers on Facebook. <br><img src="http://mediatarget.in/some/habr/071011/emarketr.png"></div>
