  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imperfect ego</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <font color="#666">Dedicated to lovers of holivars and victims of trolls</font> <br><br>  Once a teacher and a student sit on a bench and contemplate.  Suddenly a man approaches them and says: <br>  - From these queens already have nowhere to go.  What hatched, old goat, I'm talking to you.  Who of you fucks someone? <br>  The student says: <br>  - Teacher, this person insulted you.  I can kill him with one blow, if you allow. <br>  - It is not necessary. <br>  ‚ÄúDidn't you be angry with his rudeness?‚Äù <br>  - Not at all. <br>  - How do you do it.  Do you use the power of detachment? <br>  ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt do anything to keep calm.‚Äù  This happens by itself and it does not even have to learn for a long time. <br>  - But how? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Tell me, are we fagots with you? <br>  - No, teacher. <br>  ‚ÄúThat means what this person says is not true.‚Äù  So? <br>  - So, teacher. <br>  - So, you and I are not fagots.  Well, what is there to be angry? <br>  - But if it were true? <br>  - If it were true, and we were fagots, then this person would be right.  I again find no reason to be angry. <br>  - Strange, but I always came into a rage, but now I can not explain why this was happening.  And what if this person really thinks ... <br>  - What this person thinks about is not important at all.  If it will be easier for you, I can tell you that he doesn‚Äôt even think about what he is talking about.  He is simply open to the effects of certain creatures, and answers them, that's all.  It hurts you because your imperfect ego responds to the vibrations that its stinging ego has radiated.  If you succumb to this influence, and as you could see, it is completely unreasonable, even from a mental point of view, then there comes a resonance of vibrations that can turn into a fight.  If his angry vibrations fly through you, leaving no trace, then the resonance does not work and they, if they do not find where to go, go back to where they came from.  See, this man is already gone.  In relation to him, my actions, or rather my inaction, were so cruel because I did not accept what he sent me.  Most likely he will have to deal with it himself.  But it will be easier for him, because you took half on you and you, too, will have to be cleansed of this poison.  For this, I will give you a mantra.  Repeat it whenever you are overwhelmed by extraneous thoughts, or lack the strength not to identify yourself with your body or life.  This will help you gain transparency.  The more transparent you become, the more light will be able to penetrate you, and the less dirt will linger in you.  Remember this great truth: <br><br>  I do not have this body <br>  I am not this life <br>  I do not have this thought.
