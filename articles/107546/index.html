As well as those who helped us with the development of the service and added annotations, a cover, a genre to their own and other people's books. <br>  Thanks to them, we have become even better and understood in which direction to develop <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What was done in 3 months. </h3>

      1. Added links to Wikipedia for books and authors. <br><br>  If you open a book page, you can see the wikipedia logo for most books and authors.  How to automate the addition of links to Wikipedia using api was described in the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/104480/">Connecting Wikipedia to the site</a> <br><br>  2. Made it possible, at will, to first add one book instead of two. <br><br>  As practice has shown, it is determined which 2 books are the best - not very easy.  To make it easier to determine your two best books, try to answer the following questions: <br><ol><li>  Which two books had the greatest impact on my life? </li><li>  The first 2 books I recommend reading? </li><li>  What 2 books do I want to reread? </li><li>  Write on the sheet a list of books (one in each line) - the first two will be the best. </li><li>  Make a list of books and gradually cross out those that are worse.  2 last will be the best. </li></ol><br>  3. Added sorting books: <br><ul><li>  by name </li><li>  by the number of readers who consider the book the best </li><li>  by date of addition </li><li>  by the number of additions of the book to favorites </li></ul><br>  4. Changed the appearance of the main page.  Previously 10 books were published that readers consider to be the best.  As the rating of books grew proportionally and the main page did not change, we decided to display the last 5 added books and the last 5 comments. <br><br>  5. Added a search for readers. <br><br>  6. Added internal mail for dating and chat <br><br>  7. Removed duplicates.  Thanks to everyone who reported them. <br><br><h3>  What we have learned for ourselves </h3><br><br>  1. Content on multilingual sites should be divided by language.  When launching Russian books, there were comments in the Ukrainian language; the Russian-speaking part of the sevis avatars of users led to the Ukrainian part of the site.  Post almost zaminusovali.  Thanks to systray, a critical bug was fixed on time. <br><br>  2. Of the 2,000 people who added the book, only one was a spammer and two added abracadabra.  1 bad person per 1000 confirms once again that there are wonderful people around. <br><br>  3. Thanks to the service I learned about books and read Bodo Schaefer <a href="http://ru.two-books.net/books/863-%25D0%259F%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5-%2528%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2529.html">‚ÄúThe Way to Financial Independence‚Äù</a> , Robin Sharma <a href="http://ru.two-books.net/books/1023-%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%2528%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%2529.html">‚ÄúThe Monk, who sold his Ferrari‚Äù</a> .
