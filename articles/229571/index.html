  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World of Tanks Blitz: Toy Toy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before I talk about the impressions of the game World of Tanks Blitz, I can not refrain from a small introduction. <br><br>  On the third day, they wrote to me from the press service of Wargaming.net and strictly asked why there had been no publications about World of Tanks game in PC World magazine for a long time.  I replied carefully that there were no reasons to be found.  The game is interesting, we love it.  But this is not a reason to write about it at least once a month.  It is necessary to allocate for other good products of the area. <br><br>  In response, I was no less strictly indicated that the reason can always be found.  For example, write about how Wargaming.net stands for patriotism and restoration of historical values.

When a company starts talking to journalists about patriotism, they subconsciously feel bad.  Indeed, as far as we know, Wargaming is first of all not about patriotism, but about money.  And about the money rather big.  It is not for programmers with birch kvass that programmers work, and even PR people are rumored to have a bit more banal motivation than the opportunity to drive on the cherished Type 59 tank. <br><br>  And when a good profitable business begins to appeal to the patriotism of journalists, which should be expressed in the number of publications on Wargaming ... I think there is some flaw in this logic.  And, taking this opportunity, I suggest that the PR service of the company give me and the Type 59 tank as a gift to everyone who plus this post.  From a sense of patriotism, of course. <br><br>  And now about, in fact, the main character of the article.  World of Tanks Blitz is a new brainchild of Wargaming.net, working on iPad tablets with iOS version not lower than 7.0.  This, of course, is not very fair with respect to the owners of Apple computers, who for the sake of their favorite game are forced to install the godless ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù.  They were waiting for the Belarusians to turn their eyes on OS X after the Xbox version, but in Wargaming they decided to start working on iOS.  The decision is undoubtedly correct: there are now more ipads in the hands of the population than powerful enough to launch World of Tanks "poppies".  And competitors are not asleep.  Last year the game Tank Domination, voiced by Dmitry Puchkov AKA Goblin, was released.  I tried it, then tried it again, and erased it.  No, the game itself is quite beautiful, and the voice acting pleases.  However, in terms of ease of management, it lagged behind the real ‚ÄúTanks‚Äù on the computer for a couple of centuries.  And somehow did not want to relearn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/590/18d/c4b/59018dc4bcca62264b9ddc700eae958f.jpg"><br>  <i>Looking at this screen, I envy myself - all tanks, piles of silver and gold ... Alas, this is a special account for reviews, and soon it will turn into a pumpkin</i> <br><br>  And now - the product from the original developers.  Files downloaded during installation are 665 MB, which is modest by now.  When you start, you can log in as a Game Center user, or you can enter your login from the large ‚ÄúTanks‚Äù.  The latter, however, is rather useless, because neither the tanks already earned nor the available gaming money on the tablet will not migrate. <br><br>  The developers promised to transfer to the mobile version the maximum possible from the full game.  I see that they tried to do it, but computers are still more powerful than tablets, plus it was impossible to focus only on the owners of the newest iPad Air and mini with a Retina screen.  Therefore, the graphics in Blitz conditionally correspond only to the minimum settings in the computer version.  The visible zone is small, the textures are unpretentious, of the objects being destroyed - the cat cried.  You try out of habit to demolish a clay hut on the desert map of El-Alamein, and she discovers reinforced concrete hardness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a9/20e/f7c/8a920ef7cd6af805568c9cda0f86aa33.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40f/7c0/bb8/40f7c0bb8562253cec5695e22f5c8965.jpg"><br><br>  The maximum number of participants in the battle is seven, but in the case of top tanks of the 9-10 level, which the players have so far, only three or four cars can get to the battle.  And wait for the distribution will have quite a long time - up to one and a half minutes.  When the card is already loaded, the waiting time for the start of the battle is reduced from 25 seconds in the version on the computer to 5. And this, of course, is very humane towards the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e75/e74/b48/e75e74b48c0a04f7a173908fc9d80e12.jpg"><br>  <i>As you can see, the majority of users ride while on free machines of the first level, but many have already been pumped up to the second</i> <br><br>  Game mode is one - capture the base.  Cards are small, hide and get lost on them is simply impossible.  For this reason, there are no hated by many "art" - only classic tanks and PT-ACS. <br><br>  In the current version, combat vehicles are available only in three countries - the USSR, Germany and the USA.  There is no doubt that the rest will soon add, although the differences in the mobile version are much less pronounced than in the full version.  That is, outwardly, yes, but given the much less flexible control of serious cars, it is simply impossible to squeeze all their virtues. <br><br>  Theoretically, everything is fine with management.  Drawn joystick under the left hand, camera control and shooting under the right hand.  The latter is duplicated for the left finger, which is logical and convenient.  But in practice, the finger slides along the surface of the screen is not so smooth and fast as a good mouse on a special pad.  That tank does not go where it should be, and until you turn around - you are already crashing down.  Then the camera will ride off in an incomprehensible direction, and the enemies of this will also be very happy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e5/9bf/bad/8e59bfbad89c8d78497ef23d7bbf71e4.jpg"><br>  <i>Space on the screen is still not enough, and sometimes the indicators overlap the main picture</i> <br><br>  Compared with the same Tank Domination - more convenient, no doubt.  But still the management does not reach a full-fledged game.  Blitz, however, tries to help - and she can bring the gun herself, and the hit counts when, in fact, you missed slightly.  Even areas of the enemy tank, where you have a chance to penetrate armor - and they will highlight.  But as a result, the game seems to be trying to seem THIS MOST, but in reality it is fundamentally different.  And therefore the question arises - for whom is it made? <br><br>  Mature "tank" dismiss immediately.  If you have a powerful enough computer and you like to play World of Tanks on it, Blitz can not even be installed.  Leave the feeling of a fake Christmas tree toy, which is similar to the real, but not happy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/027/9ef/4140279ef8b3379556c77db6521b04ea.jpg"><br>  <i>In the chat, people habitually gather in platoons, although it‚Äôs not very clear why</i> <br><br>  If there is no computer (this happens more and more often), or you have a Mac that you don‚Äôt want to defile by installing Windows, you can, of course, deliver Blitz.  From scratch, without many years of experience battles with a mouse and keyboard, you may like it and even take it away in jest.  I have known living people who have experienced continuous delight for more than a week.  An important advantage of the game is that it is not only free, but not too brazenly pulling money out of the player.  That is, of course, if you pay extra, it will be even more fun, but also so good. <br><br>  Those who plan to take World of Tanks with them will be disappointed: just like the game, the progenitress, Blitz needs a continuous connection to the Internet.  The speed is not critical, megabit is enough, but the stability is very important.  For this reason, I did not manage to play on 3G: it seems to be connected normally, ping is within reason, but once the package is lost, the game starts to get fun.  So, playing on the IS-3, I suddenly noticed that the gun was shooting at him almost in bursts, without requiring time to reload.  Then, however, it turned out that there was no damage from her.  And when the game was able to connect to the server again, it turned out that I was burned long ago.  Probably, sometimes it is still possible to play on 3G, but I personally could not get away from WiFi with any of the mobile operators. <br><br>  The overall impression of the game is contradictory.  Personally, I don‚Äôt like it very much, because there is a big powerful computer with a widescreen monitor Philips (aspect ratio 21: 9), and the tablet version with its many simplifications cannot compete with World of Tanks at maximum graphics settings (by the way, why in WoT to so far have not added support for monitors 21: 9 - a mystery to me. I have to pick the registry) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/362/5ad/b833625ade9a9a49ac68b95e5cca35ac.jpg"><br>  <i>In the built-in store, everything is ready for the arrival of buyers.</i> <br><br>  But the release of Blitz will allow Wargaming.net to recruit thousands more, hundreds of thousands of new adepts that she could not reach before.  So the new millions of dollars in birch sap will rush to the cashier of a patriotically oriented company. <br><br>  PS The game will work on the iPhone, but I would not even advised to put it there.  And the tanks can not see, and control is absolutely impossible.  At least, the average male hand.  Therefore, take the iPad - and bend down little by little. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/229571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/229571/</a></p>
