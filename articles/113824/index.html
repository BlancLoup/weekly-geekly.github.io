Thousands of applications fall into it every day, green rivers of crisp paper flow into the pockets of developers (and Apple), and hundreds of new programmers and companies are registered in the iOS developer program.  The growing popularity of the iOS platform has pushed us to the idea - why not write your own application for the iPhone?  By the way, our application is completely free :) <br><br>  We will not dwell on all the twists and turns of developing an application within the team, but our experience of registering a company in the Apple developer program may be useful.  We will write out the whole process in detail, in steps and with pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Becoming an Apple Developer </h4><br>  We go immediately to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">developer.apple.com/programs/ios</a> page.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0f724959/9b4ffff6/02619318/8b08fdc4.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, they will ask us whether we want to join the program as an already registered Apple developer or as a newbie?  We are newcomers, so choose the item ‚ÄúNew Apple Developer‚Äù with the ability to create a new Apple ID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e1cb5e40/3fd12267/e10a2192/0387b01f.jpg"><br><br>  On the next screen, the key question is whether we are a company or a developer.  Feel free to choose "Company" and prepare for the worst. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/91f93d2e/9600ca02/4ea0b78d/a16d0a4f.jpg"><br><br>  They ask us quite a lot of personal and even intimate information - from the first name to the address of the place of work and the telephone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/df5a03bd/34620c93/1cdcb509/932bce57.jpg"><br><br>  Next we will be offered to choose the categories of applications that we want to develop, which market we are targeting and which platform we are going to develop (iOS, Mac OS X or Safari), how many years we have been developing and (looking intently) will ask if we side-by-side applications ... in terms of other mobile platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/71cc105f/f42a1b07/c995abd2/c5c4b8f8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ca8dee63/4ed02bd1/8fb3b126/021fc73f.jpg"><br><br>  The last steps are to put a bird under a license agreement (I agree, I confirm, I do not object, entirely and completely for) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/99f787cf/b97ae3d3/b3c5bc12/3a4983c3.jpg"><br><br>  and enter the confirmation code that will come to the e-mail specified at the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/733524c4/3fe7d84f/5efeae8f/82ab548d.jpg"><br><br>  Congratulations!  Now you are the honorable Apple Developer!  One of the thousands ... but what a! <br><br><h4>  Company registration in iOS Developer Program </h4><br>  In order to register a company in the iOS Developer Program, Apple needs to know the name, address and phone number of the company, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/353e081d/5d4d1dc3/d8141879/1d33762c.jpg"><br><br>  and the contact details of the person responsible for registering with the iOS Developer Program and having all the necessary authority to do this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/13cc67a9/5335a332/294371fb/d93a69b8.jpg"><br><br>  Choose the iOS Developer Program, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/73796e37/be8e1fae/aa952d5c/b67ea6bb.jpg"><br><br>  we confirm on a separate screen all entered information <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/314128ae/56475fec/d46f87c8/eb2d22c3.jpg"><br><br>  and waiting for confirmation from Apple.  Usually, the application takes about a day.  After confirming the application, you will need to agree with the Apple license agreement and pay (finally!) Participation in the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/112d3d87/19d32c2d/4146c1b4/b2b125d3.jpg"><br><br>  Since the Apple Store is not yet observed in Russia, the only method of payment is to fill out a special form (with intimate data about one of your bank cards, with which Apple will collect as much as $ 99) with greedy hands.  We have released a virtual bank card for this form with a limit of $ 100.  The completed form must be sent to Apple.  About a day later you will receive a confirmation of the withdrawal of funds. <br><br><h4>  We prove our existence and train conversational English </h4><br>  It would seem - everything?  Not!  Now you have to prove that you are not a camel. <br>  Apple must make sure that your company really exists completely officially, for which you must take an extract from the Unified State Register of Companies with information about your company, translate it into English and send it to Apple ... correctly, by fax.  With the phone, company name and number of your application, drawn on a separate piece of paper.  At the same time - an important detail!  - the name of your company in the translated statement must EXACTLY coincide with the stated when registering the company in the iOS Developer Program.  Have patience - Apple bureaucrats start to review the documents sent in about a week, and any dark spot on one of the pages will entail a polite letter asking you to send <b>it all</b> over again.  And wait again. <br><br>  Then Apple will call you to make sure that you exist at all.  And in English will report that - ISU-ISP-URA!  - the documents are OK and you have been granted access to the itunesconnect.apple.com developer portal.  On this portal, you can send your application for review, view daily downloads statistics, fill in the account details, to which Apple will have to credit the earned money, set their own version of the EULA ... <br><br>  By the way, about checking the application.  The guys are trying fairly fairly and even Russian applications are checked with all care.  The first time, our application was rejected because they could not log in to the Elbe (in the mobile application you can only work - so far you need to register via the web application).  The second time, when we already gave a test login and password - the application was approved. <br><br><h4>  AND? </h4><br>  What will happen next?  And then we need to raise our application in the Business category as high as possible and monitor downloads.  And also continue to work on the functionality.  Well, do not forget once a year to send over the hill $ 99 for using the store with the famous name AppStore. <br>  Successful registrations to you! <br><br>  By the way, I forgot :) Here is a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417000917%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1">link to our application.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113824/</a></p>
