  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sviaz-Expocomm 2009, national operating system and parental control</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently received a free invitation to the <a href="http://www.sviaz-expocomm.ru/">Sviaz-Expocomm 2009</a> international exhibition.  It will be held from May 12 to May 15 in Moscow and this is a problem.  I'm in Helsinki ... <br>  But if there is anyone from Moscow who wants to go there for free, I can share an invitation. <br><br>  I myself would love to go to this exhibition.  Even more likely not at an exhibition, but at lectures, round tables and presentations, because there are several topics that experienced IT specialists would have to come to discuss with ministerial officials (yes, there will be round tables with ministerial officials). <br>  For example, about the safety of children on the Internet or about the national operating system. <br>  So, the exhibition is a little publicized, so that more regular people get there :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, on May 12 the exhibition opens.  There will be some presentations, but on this day you just have to walk around, see, touch the exhibits and talk to the participants. <br>  On May 13, presentations and lectures will be mainly devoted to network and television technologies. <br>  May 14, the main theme of the day is Open Source and Cloud computing.  Interesting and relevant, I advise everyone to visit.  Speakers from Microsoft and Linuxcenter at the same table.  It would be very interesting to talk with people on this topic.  Well, and a unique event - a <b>round table on the creation of a national operating system.</b>  <b>Key speaker: Ilya Ponomarev, Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation</b> .  This should not be missed. <br>  And on May 15 at the exhibition there will be a round table <i>‚ÄúChild Safety on the Internet: risks, problems, opportunities for coordination of activities‚Äù</i> with the participation of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.  It would be interesting to know the ministerial level of understanding of this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù, because, I am afraid, everything will be reduced to the next impracticable laws, working groups, Internet ‚Äúfilters‚Äù, etc. <br>  Meanwhile, the solution to this problem is already there and it is very simple. <br>  Since I will not get to the exhibition, I will write my ideas about the safety of children on the Internet right here, maybe some of you will pass them on to someone.

      <br>
      First, it‚Äôs worth to understand right away that the problem of child safety on the Internet is not a problem of the state or the Internet providers.  Parents should take care of this.  This problem cannot be solved completely at the level of providers. <br>  One may try to remove or ban porn or cruelty on the Internet, but they are and always will be there.  And without parental control, children can easily access anything on the Internet. <br><br>  Secondly, as I wrote above, the solution has been around for a long time.  Virtually any antivirus package now contains the <i>Parental Control</i> module, and, starting with Windows Vista, even the operating system contains Parental Control functions. <br>  Unfortunately, I do not know how well <i>Parental Control</i> is implemented in Windows, but I can say that it is good for paid antiviruses. <br>  Usually a good Parental Control allows you to use several profiles: <br>  for parents - without restrictions <br>  for small children - only sites allowed by parents are allowed to visit, <br>  for adolescents - it is allowed to browse sites only by allowed categories (for example, adolescents can be denied access to violence, weapons, porn and erotica, but allowed to social networks like vkontakte). <br><br>  Actually, all that is required of parents to protect their child on the Internet is to learn how to use the <i>Parental Control</i> that is installed from them. <br>  And remember that if you have Vista or Windows 7, then you already have free Microsoft <i>Parental Control</i> .  Configure it and do not need any bans at the legislative level. <br><br>  I hope that some of you will get to this exhibition and tell the deputies what he thinks about their efforts to introduce control over the Internet and about their own Russian operating system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59036/</a></p>
