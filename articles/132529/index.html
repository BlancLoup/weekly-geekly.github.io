  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WayLinker - a smart travel startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, each of us faced with the problems of traffic or travel?  Often, to transport things you have to hire movers and wait.  It is a waste of time, money, and even, often, without much service.  And remember the taxi.  It is necessary to order a car, wait for it, pay a lot of money if you go far, and many other unpleasant moments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fb9de01a/7be2f105/ac70539e/1abaed91.png"><br><br>  The new startup WayLinker is trying to reduce the time and money costs, as well as give drivers the opportunity to make money.  We are glad to present you a search service for passing passenger trips and cargo transportation, and not only in Moscow or in Russia, but all over the world.  Yes, Habr√© already had similar startups, but, unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt justify themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Launched an international transport exchange, accessible from car navigators and smartphones on iOS, Android and Symbian.  The project is a search service for passing passenger trips and cargo transportation worldwide.  The exchange is open to all participants in the movement - from ordinary motorists and passengers to professional freight forwarders.  WayLinker solves many problems, saves time and helps earn any car owner.  The platform connects users with matching paths and helps to solve the problem of profitable road planning.

      ‚ÄúWayLinker is the first story of a successful investment search!  The second season of the Lift project began with a search for IT start-ups in conjunction with Intel.  25 startups were selected for 6 business investors, including Ivan Nechaev (Russian Navigation Technologies), Igor Taber (Intel Capital), Gleb Davidyuk (iTech Capital) and Alexander Turkot (Skolkovo IT Cluster), ‚Äùsays Manana Samuseva, creator project "Lift".  Director of Intel Capital in Russia and the CIS, Igor Taber, comments: ‚ÄúWe are confident that in the future many talented entrepreneurs will take part in the project.  Opportunities to obtain financing from such experienced investors are in themselves a kind of ‚Äúquality mark‚Äù of the campaign, but, of course, do not guarantee a positive result.  Therefore, I would like to wish the participants success and perseverance in achieving their goals. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ec08b403/f41f9dbc/4d2f1424/3cbc0103.jpg"><br><br>  The project WayLinker helps motorists, passengers and freight carriers to quickly solve transport problems.  With it, you can save time, make money on your own trips, use the vehicle more efficiently and keep up during traffic jams everywhere.  Know-how WayLinker is that this platform connects users who have the same routes, so they do not need to change their personal plans.  Looking for a travel companion for a trip from St. Petersburg to Astrakhan?  Need to quickly transport furniture between offices in the city?  WayLinker will help you find the right person and negotiate a mutually beneficial price.  Everything is very simple: the user leaves on the site a request ‚ÄúLooking for a driver‚Äù, ‚ÄúLooking for a passenger‚Äù or ‚ÄúLooking for a carrier‚Äù indicating the route and price, and the person to whom such conditions are suitable responds.  Travelers agree on the price of the trip directly, without intermediaries.  As a result, everyone stays positive: the passenger pays a reasonable price, the driver reduces the cost of gasoline, and the transport needs of the population are met by a smaller number of cars (that is, the environmental load is reduced). <br><br>  The startup creator Andrei Mazur comments: ‚ÄúWe use advanced path analysis technologies, and our service is always at hand with users on iOS, Android, Symbian smartphones and on car navigators.  By the way, we were the first to decide that it is necessary to encourage users for the fact of traveling by car, and therefore we came up with bonuses. ‚Äù  From November 10, bonus points for travel and transportation will be entered on WayLinker;  subsequently, these points will be able to pay for movie tickets, gasoline, mobile communications in Russia and in Europe. <br><br>  Ivan Nechaev, one of the creators of Russian Navigation Technologies (GLONASS), said: ‚ÄúStartup WayLinker is a very promising direction of the B2C sector for investment strategists.  Fleet Management will reach $ 1 trillion by 2020, and now the volume of the freight transportation market in Russia exceeds $ 3 billion. Aggregators of joint transportation are a global trend and one of the top 5 hot topics of the decade.  WayLinker created a global monitoring platform and smart solutions for any car enthusiast.  I am sure that the project will quickly find rounds of investment in the B2B sector. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is already possible to try to find a fellow traveler or passenger on the website <a href="http://waylinker.com/">waylinker.com</a> <br>  If you have any comments or suggestions, say, listen to everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132529/</a></p>
