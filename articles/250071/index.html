Already have an API for Windows that allow you to develop for it. <br><br>  Unlike Google Glass, many of which use scenarios were limited to the camera, and Oculus Rift, which assumes quite narrow application conditions, this concept opens up very interesting prospects for the work of the designer and designer.
