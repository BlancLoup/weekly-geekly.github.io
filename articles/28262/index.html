  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We rationalize the use of payment terminals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Payment terminals are a real source of ideas. <br><br>  What is given?  Full-fledged computers with a fairly convenient and simple input device - a touch screen, with a money receiving device, with internet connection.  Many (for example, Qiwi terminals) have already confirmed accounts of each user, tied to a phone number and personal ruble account.  These computers are very common and in large cities you can find them on every corner. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Offhand a few ideas for use: <br><ul><li>  Internet booth - Internet access is available for a fee.  You can urgently check the mail.  Find a cafe / restaurant nearby.  See where the nearest cinema is.  See the map and everything, everything, everything that comes to mind :). </li><li>  Charging - usb-ports, from which you can recharge gadgets.  It can be combined with a machine for charging phones (with the correct design of the terminal, no one will feel bad about this).  To check, install test terminals with charging, then look at the logs, how much is really needed. </li><li>  Advertising - advertising has already begun to turn on some terminals.  While he is in standby mode - banners are flying.  But for some reason, they don‚Äôt pay for services without interest.  And interest is even fought for using the terminal‚Äôs personal account: (. </li></ul><br>  The main problem, in my opinion, that may arise - the time of work of one person at the terminal will be much longer.  This is not just threw some money in 5 seconds on a mobile phone.  It means there will be queues, nerves and so on.  You can only solve the increase in the number of terminals.  They are not so expensive, it seems to me, they will pay for themselves.

    <h3>  Ethernet cabins </h3>  Or a different approach to the ‚ÄúInternet-booths‚Äù is possible.  More and more competent Internet users who cut ads.  And there are so many large-large sites with high traffic and good income.  Having organized (or it can be done by a separate company) they can make free for use iron terminals (again, by the type of payment terminals), on which their sites will be available in the form they want - with all the advertising, etc.  That is, in fact, this is what is now in an insignificant form, information terminals with a store site, located in the store itself.  Like for example in the SunRise store.  But there are many sites that do not have premises, which do not sell things, and their income comes from advertising.  They can place the terminals of their sites everywhere!  This will contribute to their popularity.  Bring even more advertising revenue.  And people will be nice and comfortable.  The same mail.ru can be taken if the terminals of their site were as common as the payment terminals (I repeat, this is a default city, i.e. Moscow time), it seems to me that their popularity would not know the limits.  And everyone would use the boxes on the mail.ru, and not on the mail, knowing that they will be able to check their emails everywhere, enter their address book, read blogs, etc. <br><br>  In general, if there was a company that would arrange such booths - from customers, IMHO, there would be no end.  This is such a local free network, accessible from any terminal, consisting of information sites on services.  In an amicable way, it needs to be linked with home networks, also for free use. <br><br>  There you can shove sites online stores.  Sites of all kinds of ticket offices, where you can pay for tickets right there, thrusting bills, without any problems.  Surrender?  The handover is sent to the personal account of the terminal user.  In general, freedom for creativity. <br><br>  In addition, it would give a lot of jobs in the IT field.  We need admins of all this expanse, installers, installers.  And of course, the designers of sites, specially sharpened for terminals.  Very convenient and simple, so that they can be used and enjoyed not only by geeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28262/</a></p>
