The experiment will show whether the plane is capable of tearing down a skyscraper at the root, or those who claim that 9/11 was a great performance are right.

      According to the official version of the events of September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorists seized four passenger planes, two of which crashed into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York, which led to their complete collapse (other buildings of the WTC complex also collapsed).  The third plane crashed into the Pentagon building, the fourth fell into the field of Pennsylvania, after the passengers tried to take the plane from the terrorists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7Olnv9RQmE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgV_t00ChFKOIcG9u53wmbXfVzXog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The tragedy led to the adoption in the United States of the " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Patriotic Act</a> " a month after the event.  According to this law, the government and the police were given very broad powers to supervise citizens.  The law, in particular, expanded the rights of the FBI in eavesdropping and electronic surveillance, which many considered to be a violation of the fourth amendment to the constitution. <br><br>  Conspiracy theories claim that the tragedy was dramatized by the US government precisely with the goal of passing laws that allow them to spy on their own citizens without hindrance.  Immediately after the events of 9/11, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Surveillance_Program">Terrorist Surveillance Program</a> was created, which was replaced by an even more extensive set of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%2528%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%2529">PRISM</a> events, exposed by Edward Snowden. <br><br>  The popular pamphlet documentary <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582_9/11">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> , criticizing George W.

The crowdfunding company at IndieGoGo offers thanks backers, T-shirts, pieces of ruins from a skyscraper to be destroyed, and a ‚Äúfront row place‚Äù for watching a landmark event live - for $ 5000. <br><br>  The businessman believes that if after a plane crash there remains a ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the building and the skyscraper does not fall, it will be able to put an end to disputes and prove that the tragic collapse of the twin towers was a dramatization. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394291/</a></p>
