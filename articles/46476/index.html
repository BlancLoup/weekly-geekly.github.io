  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10 Internet projects in 2008 according to ReadWriteWeb</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ReadWriteWeb selected 10 projects made outside the United States that create innovative services and support global Web standards.  Chart writers admit that many interesting projects were not mentioned, but this happened because the authors did not know them.  And they call to tell about interesting projects in the comments to their article, on the site The New York Times.  I urge you in your comments to tell about Russian projects that can compete in the global market, at the moment there is not a single Russian company on the chart. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Remember The Milk: Australia <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">www.rememberthemilk.com</a> <br>  Remember The Milk is an Australian startup who developed the Internet Task Manager, created to manage his time and work.  It all started in 2004, with Omar Kilani, Emily Boyd and a plush monkey united by one simple idea.  The development of this idea led to the creation and launch in 2005 of Remember The Milk. <br>  RTM has seen a huge influx of users in recent years: by October 2006, 100 thousand people used the service, a mark of 200 thousand was passed in May 2007, 500 thousand in March 2008. During 2008, RTM had a significant impact on Internet users.  RTM now has over a million users.  RTM was also named one of the 100 winners of CNET's Webware 100 Award held in April; in May, readers of ReadWriteWeb chose RTM as one of the best among Internet applications.  RTM recently created a gmail gadget and an iPhone app. <br><br>  2. Afrigator: South Africa <a href="http://www.afrigator.com/">www.afrigator.com</a> <br>  Afrigator is a social media aggregator from the African blog, similar to Technorati.  Every blogger in Africa can use Afrigator to promote his blog. <br>  Launched in 2007 (alpha), Afrigator experienced a steady growth of 25% every month, beta was launched in November of the same year.  In September 2008, MIH Print Africa became the main owner of the company, giving the startup a break and an opportunity to work on a new project: Adgator, the first African advertising network.  So far, 4,159 blogs from across the continent are being tracked, Afrigator is the best place to search for content from the Afrosphere.

      3. Zoho: India <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">www.zoho.com</a> <br>  Zoho is a startup from India offering office applications, project management software and CRM solutions.  During 2008, they seriously improved the quality and increased the functionality of office applications, reaching 1 million users in August of this year. <br>  In early 2008, Zoho updated Writer to include support for the DocX format and added some more features.  In April, Visual Basic macros were supported in Zoho Sheet, the macro recording and playback appeared a month later.  In October, Zoho Mail came out of closed beta testing, becoming accessible to everyone, offering offline access through Google Gears. <br><br>  4. Netvibes: France <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">www.netvibes.com</a> <br>  Users from 200 countries have created more than 50 million home pages on Netvibes since its launch in 2006. Available in 76 languages, Netvibes was named one of the best sites of 2007 according to Times.  But this did not make the creators enjoy fame and honor, they made Netvibes bigger and better, and in April 2008 Netvibes Ginger was launched. <br>  Ginger is a social version of NetVibes that allows you to share your new content with Flickr, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, blogs with friends, it also allows you to keep track of updates from your friends.  In November, Netvibes added support for Facebook Connect and Twitter. <br><br>  5. Dopplr: Finland / England <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/">www.dopplr.com</a> <br>  Dopplr is a startup that allows you to share travel plans, and find friends who are going to visit the same city as you, or just live there.  Since its inception, the company has almost immediately acquired large investors and, according to reports from Compete, has shown significant growth. <br>  Last month, Dopplr launched new city pages with photos imported from Flickr, which were taken by Dopplr users while traveling, to visualize user activity in cities.  If you do not use Dopplr, you will soon start, we think that Dopplr is a promising project. <br><br>  6. Maxthon: China <a href="http://www.maxthon.com/">www.maxthon.com</a> <br>  The browser market has changed a lot in 2008, Google's Chrome appeared in September, Mozilla's Firefox 3 got an entry in the Guinness book in June, Internet Explorer gives up its positions, and Firefox takes its place.  In Asia, another browser creates "waves."  Maxthon, based on the statistics of the European company Xiti, creates problems for its main rival, Firefox.  This was not a discovery, and Mozilla recently released a special version of Firefox for China. <br>  Maxthon, a browser made in China, now occupies the 2nd position among the most popular browsers in this country.  At the moment, it does not claim to the most widely distributed browser, only 174 million downloads at the moment.  Using the Internet Explorer engine, Maxthon has more than 1,400 plug-ins, the ability to switch proxies, an aggressive advertising blocker, split-screen browsing;  These are just a few of the functions of the browser.  We said this two years ago, and say it again, this project deserves attention. <br><br>  7. Xing: Germany <a href="http://www.xing.com/">www.xing.com</a> <br>  Xing, the German social network for professionals, and the first Web 2.0 company to become public (December 2006), today has more than 6.5 million users, is now engaged in globalization, along with LinkedIn. <br>  LinkedIn has over 30 million users, based on a Compete survey of its annual growth of 179.6%, more than that of Xing with its 137.6%.  However, it is important to note that monetization is not LinkedIn‚Äôs strength.  The Xing visitor remains on the site on average 43.4 minutes, while on LinkedIn 7.8 minutes, a difference of 456%.  We believe that Xing made some good decisions this year, especially the recent arrival at Stefan Gross-Selbeck. <br><br>  8. FreshBooks: Canada <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">www.freshbooks.com</a> <br>  FreshBooks, a Canadian startup, a service for accounting, both personal and for small companies, has shown steady growth over the past year;  More than 500 thousand users are registered on the service. <br>  We compared FreshBooks with other online accounting services in August of this year, our verdict: it is easier to use, it has a number of useful built-in functions, there is an active forum and the possibility of comparative analysis.  Recently, we appreciated the FreshBooks Report Cards feature that allows you to compare your business with similar ones in your field.  The service was chosen as one of Canada‚Äôs PICK 20 top Web 2.0 leaders in September of this year, and we believe that Freshbooks deserves a mention in this ranking, too. <br><br>  9. Mixi: Japan <a href="http://www.mixi.jp/">www.mixi.jp</a> <br>  Mixi is the largest Japanese social network (available only in Japanese), was previously known for the closeness of the platform.  But since August of this year, Mixi has begun to support OpenID, that is, it has become an OpenID provider for millions of Japanese users. <br>  Giving the opportunity to enter Mixi with OpenID from other networks, Mixi dramatically increased its functionality, according to the Asiajin blog, this ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù is quite radical for Mixi standards. <br><br>  10. Wuala: Switzerland <a href="http://www.wua.la/">www.wua.la</a> <br>  A Swiss startup offers an unusual social file storage system: it uses the disk space of network members as part of a common hard disk (cloud).  Wuala was launched in August 2008 and is the youngest startup on our list. <br>  Wuala is different from other file hosting sites.  The advantage in the absence of a limit on file size and the width of your connection, the big disadvantage of AES-128 and RSA-2048 encryption is that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing files on computers scattered around the world may also not please everyone.  But with 28 million downloaded files at the moment, Wuala certainly deserves your attention. <br><br>  Original: <br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2008/12/05/05readwriteweb-top_10_international_products_2008.html">www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2008/12/05/05readwriteweb-top_10_international_products_2008.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46476/</a></p>
