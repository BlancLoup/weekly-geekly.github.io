      That is who we are.  And this is our essence. <br><br>  We leave from different social strata, from populous gray cities, sleepy coastal settlements, snow-covered capitals, from small villages, lurking between the mountains covered with lush green vegetation.  We come from everywhere.  But our internal compass always leads us to the same place ... on the road. <br><br>  It seems to us that excitement is more valuable than money when it comes to travel.  We are not rich, we can not boast of success in financial affairs, and traveling, we are not looking for comfort.  We don‚Äôt get our money from rich parents or trust funds.  And, contrary to prejudice, we have no other sources that would support a nomadic life.  We work hard, work while traveling and save everything we get. <br><br>  To travel, we have to sacrifice something.  While on the road, we are happy to live, even barely making ends meet.  This means that we have abandoned comfort in favor of travel.  We would rather choose a dormitory in a cheap hostel, couch, hammock, tent or concrete floor.  We used to spend the night in boats, centenarian shacks, at train stations, in bamboo huts with native tribes, in houses built on stilts, in slums and God knows where else. <br><br>  We have learned to fill our lives with content, neglecting comfort.  Inconvenient becomes cozy for us.  Many of us do not have our own houses, and those who still own them prefer to rent them in order to invest this money in travel and research.  We do not spend money thoughtlessly on unnecessary things to us.  And in general, we buy little and do not allow things to take over us.  We managed to understand: <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/eksperiment-10-veshchey-kotorye-ya-uznal-upotreblyaya-tolko-vodu-v-techenie-mesyatsa/">the less we have, the better we live</a> . <br><br>  We feel more energetic, being somewhere far away.  Nomadic life, in which there is nothing but possessions in a backpack, and movement is our only constant.  Everything is possible when we meet a new day in a place where we have never been before and submit to the will of the universe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daf/017/8a9/daf0178a9c7845359de75057d9940bc8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We are fascinated by every culture.  We, like a sponge, absorb everything, getting into a new country, we plunge into every situation and fill it with our own souls.  And we believe: smiles are universal.  And no matter what language caresses our ears, we can read the stories of people by their smiles. <br><br>  We have learned not to allow minor troubles, misfortunes and misfortunes to draw out good from us, and we do not allow them to destroy our days.  After all, we are confident that at any given moment we have a choice: to suffer from any problems that come our way, or simply to accept them.  And we have grown to give preference to the latter. <br><br>  We are not afraid of the problems that lie ahead, even if most of the time we have to travel alone.  Our fears are familiar to us, and we have forgotten them, so our days are decorated with courage.  No matter what we are trying to intimidate, we smile and just do not pay attention to it.  We learned: if our mood is always sunny, and we keep a bright fire inside, we will never see the shadow. <br><br>  We continue to go, wherever we found the sunrise and sunset.  We are governed by moon cycles and star dust.  We look into the night sky, look into space and know that it doesn‚Äôt matter where we are or who are not with us, because we are never truly lonely.  And this very knowledge makes our existence comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61b/9fb/caf/61b9fbcaf4d44ddc930b64906077654c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We have given our hearts to the road.  Even when we are not there, we work to save up for the next trip.  Every time when we hear the rumble of an airplane, we look up, smile and imagine ourselves as its passengers.  We know that such a day will soon come, and this thought warms us.  When we get to the bookstore, we wander around the travel department, select guidebooks and stop there, skimming the pages and dreaming about the next trip.  Our mind constantly jumps to the next destination on the list.  Our passion for travel is insatiable, and even having satisfied it, we soon begin to starve again.  And this thirst torments us constantly. <br><br>  We travel not only to go, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-urokov-zhizni-iz-filosofii/">we strive for development</a> .  Diving into unfamiliar impressions, endless changing horizons and every new day is our lifestyle.  We live for airports, airplanes, buses, ships, trains, hikes.  Looking out the window, we find clarity in the obscure outlines of the places that have changed us.  Here is our home.  And he will always be like that. <br><br>  Here are the stories that we will tell to the beloved people whom we have just met, those who come and go, to excellent wanderers.  We will continue to demonstrate to others that we were born vagrants, and the passion for travel lives in each of us.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter who we are, where we are, what we do, and what we have.  After all, we can always follow her. <br><br>  We do not say that you need to immediately drop everything, buy a ticket and collect a backpack.  Although you can do so if you really want it.  If everything inside you is advised to do just that, listen to yourself.  But we say: when you decide to dump years of unnecessary baggage, you will gain freedom.  We do not urge you to take a risk and change dramatically, we do not promise that everything will always be amazing and excellent.  It does not happen.  But we say that you should allow yourself to be free.  You need to stand on the shore of life and dive into its seductive uncertainty.  Even if it makes you face your own fears. <br><br>  Even if it takes something to donate.  Even if it would be necessary to let go of the things you held so long.  Even if for this you have to part with the people you love.  Even if it all scares you.  We advise you to open yourself to the world.  Plunge into all his wealth.  Allow his teachings to infiltrate what you are.  When you do this, all the masks will fall, and you will open yourself to the present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/658/db9/02b/658db902bae64dba9d67e3415b3f60d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the truth.  We travel not only in order to drive and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">admire people who are worthy of it</a> , places, things.  It's not just that.  And for us everything never ended on this.  We travel to learn, gain experience and experience everything that a person can give in this world. <br><br>  One day we will grow old and turn gray, because of many years of wandering under the sun, we will have pigment spots, wrinkles on the skin and facial wrinkles.  The children of our children will make plans with us by the fire under the stars, on the moonlit beach somewhere far away.  We will tell them stories about dangerous adventures, living dreams, captivating places, defeated fears and lessons turned into gold.  About the very lessons that the road taught us and lived a full life.  Our travels will be the inspiration for their own travels. <br><br>  Our journey is our truth.  It is true that illuminates us while we stay where we grow rich and wander - on the road we call our home. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-veshchey-kotorye-ya-uznal-o-produktivnosti-zhivya-v-otshelnichestve-v-techenie-10-dney/">10 things that I learned about productivity, living in a hermit for 10 days</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300056/</a></p>
