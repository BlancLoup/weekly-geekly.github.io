The panels have two latches and two guides.  To fix the panel, you need to lower one latch at the beginning, and then slightly bending the panel to push towards the second.  The panel should take its place and sink into the cube. <br><br>  Separately, we will focus on trying to create an electronic designer for mastering the basics of electronics. <br><br>  The question has caused a format: ‚Äúfull-featured set‚Äù or else ‚Äúboard game‚Äù.  Immediately, we note that these questions were with us.  Since  when a bunch of panels are printed, and the final version of the electrical connection fails, by moving the blanks, we get different schemes that lead to thoughts about board games, i.e.  just "dragging by the hand" ...

If the constructor is acting and the child plays alone, then for him the signal to the correctness of the assignment is the working scheme.  Glowing or sounding, and in the presence of moving parts, then doing something.  But if this is a ‚Äúboard game‚Äù format with thematic dice, then the correctness of execution is either checked by the ‚Äúcontrol card‚Äù or it should be moderated by adults who understand circuit design. <br><br>  The collective game may have more options for development, since  competitiveness and mutual control between players appear, but again they must have solid knowledge in the field of circuit design.  Therefore, the question of the existence of the format "board game" is more likely to you, and from us you can take the panels themselves with conditional images of radio elements (the variety of which will expand) and the cubes. <br><br>  Let's return to functional cubes.  These cubes should be comfortable for children at the age when they still cannot work with prototyping boards, small pliers, side cutters and individual electronic components.  In general, they began to study the material, and so on.  books from the era of the USSR, and once again studied the instructions of the designer "on the buttons", which we sold. <br><br>  Let's start with the legendary book by V.V. Matskevich ‚ÄúEntertaining RADIO-ELECTRONICS IN THE PIONERLAGER‚Äù 1986.  In this book, many examples are given of the schemes themselves, as well as an example of how to make such a constructor ‚Äúon buttons‚Äù by ourselves.  The book, despite her age, did not lose its value and there are many interesting examples of the lessons themselves and there are explanations for the tasks and experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/353/7f8/b42/3537f8b4264c4f4cb1466d84b1f12720.jpg"><br><br>  Further, the book of Y.Voytsekhovsky ‚ÄúRADIO ELECTRONIC TOYS‚Äù was studied.  The book provides an overview and general recommendations on the selection and manufacture of sets of radio designers.  But, most importantly, there is a mention of "Lextron".  It is not searched through Yandex, but Google gave two correct sites at once. <br><br>  <a href="http://lectron.info/">lectron.inf</a> o - site-museum dedicated to these designers <br>  <a href="http://www.lectron.de/">www.lectron.de</a> - the site of the company itself and its product range, incl.  and modern. <br><br>  Information on the sites of the sea and anyone who is at least a little bit interested in this topic, we recommend to dive. <br><br>  But, despite this "sea", we did not choose the method of connection, which can be adapted to our blocks.  Although the use of magnets is mentioned very actively.  We also considered the variants of the designers of the USSR where either the connection by wires or brackets.  Classic connectors for wires we are not satisfied, because  our cubes are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, and the connectors are usually large.  With staples, too, not everything is clear, where to get in conditions of independent production elastic elements for contacts. <br><br>  Relatively speaking, all the contacts studied by us can be divided into mechanical or magnetic.  Mechanical is more reliable, but you need to create additional effort to clamp the contacts of neighboring modules, which is quite difficult to do in our sizes.  We liked the magnetic compound more, but the peculiarity of cheap magnets is that they have relatively speaking ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù and this did not allow them to be symmetrically centered in the center, since  it is likely that the scheme will meet "+" and "+" or "-" and "-". <br><br>  But, by sorting out the combinations of the forms of mutually mating parts, a working solution was found on both magnets and purely mechanical.  Both of them are still flawed, but we will work on them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/c9f/5a4/c81c9f5a4d784cfca276c737f13fed2b.jpg"><br><br>  The mechanical connection is simple, convenient and cheap to manufacture, but unfortunately it is subject to deformation due to the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù disconnection.  It can be clearly seen in the photo. <br><br>  Much more complicated and interesting is the situation with magnets.  they had "+" and "-".  Therefore, the magnets were logically removed from the design of the cubes in a separate connecting element.  And the contacts are arranged so that any rotation around the vertical axis ensures the mutual contact of the contacts of the two blocks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99d/b9b/7b2/99db9b7b22074e9babd7221f2959a363.jpg"><br><br>  All elements are printed on a <a href="http://3d.masterkit.ru/shop/3d-printers">3D printer</a> , and the body of the connecting element is glued together from two symmetrical halves rotated 90 degrees.  On the one hand, we managed to form a contact, but, on the other hand, the scheme has insufficient rigidity and any careless movement can destroy it.  In principle, the blocks work and the magnetic connections hold the blocks, but I want to improve a little more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/f8c/42f/d4df8c42f71b4ed2aac1f102ab5507c2.jpg"><br><br>  To the thoughts of improvement, we add calculations for the approximate price of such a connection for those who want to assemble on their own.  With a rough calculation, the cost of this type of connection consists of: <br><br>  - tinned tin from a tin can, conditionally eating in the kitchen at a price of 0 rubles.  (any can of canned food, etc.) <br>  - Neodymium magnet 12x2mm at a price of almost 7 rubles. <br>  - two parts of printed body 1g.  for magnet and glue <br>  - two contact holders of 1 gr., The contacts are worn on the unit according to the number of leads of the element <br>  - solder <br><br>  It is possible to neglect the cost of glue and solder so far and roughly take the figure of 10 rubles ‚Äúfor the connection‚Äù between two dice as a basis.  We will be guided by this figure when developing other ways of connecting cubes. <br><br>  One disadvantage of such a ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù connection is that it is difficult to sustain the geometry of the assembled circuit and to ensure the connection to it of ordinary Kubotronik blocks. <br><br>  In the process of testing the magnetic compound and writing this material, we have new ideas on how to implement a symmetrical (mirror) mechanical connection without magnets, but this is on Tuesday. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260309/</a></p>
