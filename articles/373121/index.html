These are: both our own programs and partnerships; in the “Stage 1.5” we can single out a banking co-brand.  But still, “you won’t get far on the carriage of the past”, so in the age of digital transformation it’s no longer “solid” to carry a stack of discount and bonus money in your pocket, but to find the right time (at the box office) in a plump deck of cards - forget necessary at home.

      Dozens of applications appeared in Google Play that allow you to recognize (read and restore) barcode cards (QR code), translate (fotk) physical cards “into a number” and accumulate (store) their digital images, like in the local memory of a smartphone , and on Google Drive.  This is the development stage number 2: e-Wallet discount and bonus cards, card aggregators.  A frequent question (remark, wish) to such an application is: how to share cards with friends (fumble cards, cardsharing, stage 2.5)? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>The next question is: how to share different cards with different applications (wallets), i.e.</i>  <i>need a standard for the exchange of both cards and their contents.</i>  <i>To the same generation, we will assign additional services, such as geolocation, programs — balance aggregators, and similar new information tuning services to the same basic and old design of bonus programs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The next step (Loyalty 3.0, “communal” loyalty) can be collective “family-wide” use of cards and discounts.</i>  <i>Family cardsharing - as a single pool of bonus “pecheneshuk”, which will allow optimal use of cards, both due to their total accounting (including promotions), automated control (often all “acquired overwhelming” burns), and due to synergy - summing effect, Accelerated accumulation of points and “volumes” - progressive bonus accrual scale.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Let's talk about the future of loyalty programs, but not from “CRM, CSI, NPS, Leads, average check, margin” and other scary words, but from the “reverse side” from the average client (therefore there will be a lot of criticism).</i>  <i>“Loyalty 3.0” is a new direction in socialization of loyalty using the technology (rules) “share a card” (cardsharing) and a “home” aggregator of discount and bonus cards of loyalty programs.</i> <br><br><h3>  Introduction (long) </h3><br>  Almost every self-respecting “stall” (retailer) has its own “wonderful” system of discounts or interest / points / bonuses / “thank you from Sberbank” and other “parrots” and almost forcibly cram your plastic card into your hand. in your pocket to lie with a couple dozen of the same.  Finding the right card is problematic, they all take up not only a place in the wallet, but also take time to search for them. <br><br>  <b>Bunnies - chips.</b>  We divide loyalty into: discount (discount) and bonus (accumulative, accumulative discount) cards.  They write a lot about the advantage of bonus programs over discount programs.  Sometimes they divide it this way: “cumulative discount” cards are when the discount amount increases as goods / services are purchased and is in monetary units (ruble, euro), and the bonus program - the discount amount is kept in conditional “parrots” (points, bunnies), linked to the currency. <br><br>  Often, “loyal inventors” use a “pumpkin chip” called “promotion bonuses”, which, unlike the usual “bonus chips”, have a term of “life”: they are burned if not spent “on time” (in other words, "Scam").  If we only assumed how much money we lost in this way (bonus)! <br><br>  Merchants ("traders", merchants) came up with a variety of loyalty scenarios.  There are mono-brands: from a small “stall-boutique” to large retail chains.  There are coalition programs from “Rag Brand”, i.e.  cooperation within the framework of the program of several fashion stores, up to universal, as “commodity”: raspberry, corn, etc., and commodity-banking (bank-kobrend): “Citi Thank You” (2004), its clone “Sberbank Thank you "and others.  There are telecom operators' programs and programs of practically any direction in the service sector (if there is a raspberry, then there should be a strawberry).  There are privilege cards (VIP cards) - providing the client with special conditions or additional (specific) services. <br><br>  In general: you need to learn how to store in electronic form any loyalty cards and with any “popular bunnies” - points - bonuses: “thanks to the savings from Sberbank and Citi”, “minutes”, “raspberries”, one “many” (.ru) and t . p., as well as "bunnies" in the form of just discounts, privileges, coupon, ticket to the event, etc.  Travel and bank cards are a special case. <br><br>  Identification can be made on a plastic card: embossing, card number (digital code), bar code (digital code), magnetic strip, contact or contactless chip (smart card), as well as any information (sales point addresses, company motto) . <br><br>  A separate category of "bunnies" are stickers or dies in the framework of the program "Accumulate and get", when, for example, in exchange for 500 stickers (given in proportion to the amount of the check), a simple glass cup is issued.  Fresh examples: Dixie with “Merry Stickers” and the Crossroads with a 50% discount on a saucepan for a bunch of stickers. <br><br>  <b>Wallets.</b>  There are ordinary (leather) and electronic wallets for loyalty cards of both types: discount and accumulative.  You can cram a lot of plastic loyalty cards into an ordinary wallet, but it’s likely that you’ll forget the right card at home or not hand it over to your spouse / child / neighbor when you need to use it in a store or salon. <br><br>  <i>The classification of electronic wallets for storing cards: "Wallets are different: black, white, red."</i> <br><br>  a) Wallets “Very simple” - i.e.  just a photographed card (a file in the smartphone folder “photo”) and a mobile storage (archive in a mobile phone) of discount card images: take photos of your discount cards from two sides and add them to the file folder. <br><br>  Can be stored in the program - organizer, i.e.  in the application in the smartphone - a primitive “card store” without an online catalog, barcode scanner, etc. <br><br>  Sometimes only a record of card details (number) or just a phone number attached to it and just a code word, code number (personal number and other cardless identification options) are sufficient.  If they had previously shown a “crust” or whisper saying “I am from Ivan Ivanovich - give a discount”, now in the digital age it is enough to know the correct “dial”: “I am from 16-17, let's give a discount” (and give); <br><br>  b) Advanced wallets.  The functionality of "advanced" mobile applications for storing loyalty cards is not only the digitization of plastic cards and their transfer to the phone.  Today, these are multifunctional programs for reliable (backup, etc.) storage of discount cards in a phone with additional powerful services. <br><br>  There are many programs and services that allow customers of retail networks to download discount and bonus cards to smartphones with a mobile application: Cards Mobile, Stocard, Pinbonus, etc.  These are soft-card aggregators, which are now rapidly multiplying. <br><br>  For example, “Wallet” downloads a photo card made by the user to its server and then recognizes it for a long time “with several optical recognition and artificial intelligence algorithms”.  Stocard has a built-in barcode scanner and quickly “comes” the card.  It is possible to reproduce not only the bar code and the QR code: some models of smartphones can imitate the operation of a magnetic strip of a plastic card. <br><br>  A few good reviews of "advanced" wallets and the ideology of the horse programs in general: <br><br>  → <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/expert-forum/karty-loyalnosti-v-smartfone-kratkiy-obzor-rynka-mobilnykh-prilozheniy-agregatorov-chast-2/">Loyalty cards - in the smartphone.</a>  <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/expert-forum/karty-loyalnosti-v-smartfone-kratkiy-obzor-rynka-mobilnykh-prilozheniy-agregatorov-chast-2/">Overview of the mobile application aggregator market.</a>  <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/expert-forum/karty-loyalnosti-v-smartfone-kratkiy-obzor-rynka-mobilnykh-prilozheniy-agregatorov-chast-2/">Part 2</a> <br>  → <a href="http://dom4korpus1.do.am/blog/obzor_android_prilozhenij_dlja_khranenija_diskontnykh_kart/2015-11-23-2/">Overview of Android applications for storing discount cards</a> <br>  → <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/expert-forum/mobilnye-koshelki-dlya-khraneniya-kart-loyalnosti-vygody-riteylera-mify-i-realnost-/">Mobile wallets for storing loyalty cards: retailer benefits.</a>  <a href="http://www.retail-loyalty.org/expert-forum/mobilnye-koshelki-dlya-khraneniya-kart-loyalnosti-vygody-riteylera-mify-i-realnost-/">Myths and Reality</a> <br><br>  Basic services of software wallets-aggregators (stores): storing a library of cards (although finding the right one is just as difficult as in a leather wallet), choosing a retail network (directory, classifier), photographing, scanning (recognizing) a bar code, supplement the card with information (with your note, note, mark).  The main thing: one application - many cards of different trading networks (map aggregator). <br><br>  Applications allow you to add “your” cards (“Add card” button) to the regular directory (local storage in the phone) and make a copy of the scanned card database to the “cloud”, and when you need to “pull them up from the cloud backup”.  Surprisingly, some “applications - wallets” work only in the “on-line”.  For example, ZR.card with the motto “all discounts are at hand”, only under what “hand”, if the Internet does not break through in the basement of the merchant? <br><br>  c) Issue of virtual cards from partners through on-line generators of new cards through the loyalty program operator (button “Issue card”).  If you do not have the card you need - “Ur Card” applications, yoCard, CardParking and others allow instant issue of virtual cards with official registration with the network operator. <br><br>  Services allow you to generate (register, authorize, issue a duplicate) a new virtual discount card or get a duplicate of an existing, registered (identification by registration data or phone number). <br><br>  Easy registration - and the "newly created" bonus card in your pocket (electronic wallet).  To do this, services must have integration with each loyalty program that they have included in their directory.  Here we add the presence of such services as determining the status of an issued or “recognized” (scanned) card: “valid” (accepted) or not.  Similar services are embedded in “advanced” e-wallets, for example, Cards Mobile, the validity of the card or coupon is displayed in SkyCard. <br><br>  Integration interaction includes an “information channel”, where the knowledge base (event calendar) about stocks is published by cards, etc. <br><br>  The “information channel” can include other various services, for example, in “up”: “Feedback” (complaint directly to the store director, geo-targeting data) or “down” (to the customer): push-notifications, Screen of the nearest outlets on the map where they will accept a card or give a discount (simple locator) or a “cool locator”, colored depending on the “latitude” of discounts, when geolocation is formed by the company-aggregator (application team), applying a layer of discounts and size (amount ) customer's accumulation, and the color scheme depends  bridges from size "freebies". <br><br>  d) purses "iron".  Electronic universal "iron", i.e.  hardware, real, tangible cards - chips.  This is a real FINTECH - in fact, a computer with a battery, transmitters and antennas almost in a plastic card form factor (54 x 86 x 0.76mm): Cardberry, hardware Qiwi Bonus (unfortunately, the brand is one with a software wallet), etc. <br><br>  d) Double.  Combines the storage of bonus and payment cards.  It can be either a software wallet (soft), for example, a Wallet (Passbook), or an “iron” (hard), for example, Coin. <br><br>  Programs - wallets on NFC phones allow you to pay for a product (service) and award loyalty points, turning the NFC-phone into a contactless bank card or loyalty card.  At the same time, on the fly, the current credit card (bank 1, bank 2, 3, ..) and the desired bonus card are switched (loaded).  A bunch of credit cards and bonus cards in one phone - choose any. <br><br>  Do not confuse the soft \ hard Double-wallet with the co-branded bank card.  These are fundamentally different directions.  Further development of the “co-brand” is a multi-card (“multi-passport”, see the “fifth element”). <br><br>  Sometime on one such multi-card, including virtual, besides monetary amounts (ruble and foreign currency accounts) and bonus points of various loyalty programs, commodity accounts will be stored: liters of hot and cold water, gasoline, kilowatts of electricity, travel (transport applications ), minutes of calls (telecom), etc., as well as personal data.  The first steps in this direction (three in one): “Sberbank-thank-three”, “Cobrand + Fuel Bank”, social card. <br><br>  Double-wallets actually emulate a “multi-card”, combining into a single pool all the credit cards of a person, his loyalty cards, travel tickets, etc. <br><br><h3>  Personal offices loyalty programs </h3><br>  Each loyalty program provides the user with control of his own currency - “points”, as a rule, through personal accounts (the program’s website or application).  To simplify this process came up with aggregators of balances: Balance BY, Any Balance, and more. <br><br>  Once there is integration with various loyalty programs, the following functions are possible: viewing the number of accumulated points of different loyalty programs (universal personal account), planned balance (the period when “everything is lost”), etc.  This is a separate business area - the aggregation of the balance of various loyalty programs, including coalition programs, as well as e-wallets and telebanks. <br><br>  What will the user choose: 20 personal accounts and mobile applications (for each loyalty program) or one “universal account with a bunch of providers” application for 20 cards (programs)?  This is no longer a card aggregator, but a balance aggregator (personal accounts, bonus and non-bonus accounts).  The next step is to combine: a card aggregator + a balance aggregator (two in one), as well as detailed information on purchases. <br><br>  Thus, the integration interaction should include only “Broadcast Storm” about promotions (calendar of events) and a personalized “information channel” of the “secret and only for your card” type, but also services such as “balance request” - “account statement” (information about accumulated discounts and bonuses). <br><br>  However, existing card aggregators - “advanced soft” and “iron” wallets and even Double-wallets, on-line card generators, personal bonus cabinet aggregators (balance viewing) and the like — cannot be the “most important”: the implementation of the internal “home” »An aggregator of your household (a cluster of trusted households) with a“ master ”of making“ reasonable ”purchases and optimizing the family budget, at least its“ bonus ”part. <br><br><h2>  Sharing bonus cards </h2><br>  <b>Cardsharing</b> - “share a card”, including a personalized plastic card (personal plastic).  In social networks there are separate topics "share / exchange discount cards."  When people are not ready for the Sharing of discount (just discount) cards - we unequivocally make the diagnosis “greed”.  Such, apparently, need to be treated and reminded: "Share your discount, and she will return to you more than once."  Card sharing is already embedded in advanced applications like the Wallet. <br><br>  Sharing cards with a bonus motivation system in a loyalty program is more problematic, but the principle is similar: share and it will be beneficial for you.  The sharing of bonus (accumulative) cards assumes their joint replenishment as well as the write-off of points.  Here the main account is: who brought how much and how much he “ate” (spent on “himself beloved”). <br><br>  <b>Horror stories for adults</b> “Cinderella-Midnight-Pumpkin” about “fabulous” promotion bonuses: <i>“... but remember Cinderella: exactly at midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin”.</i>  Monologues of sellers. <br><br>  The store has such horrors: Good afternoon!  Let's see your loyalty card (cumulative).  How many points on it!  Unfortunately, they are all burned today.  Once again, good day to you, come again. <br><br>  Another horror story: Thank you for your purchase.  But if you gave me a discount card (even a virtual one made on-line), then the purchase would be cheaper by a thousand rubles.  Do not worry - come to us again - here's a card for your next purchase.  Why I did not give it to you before the purchase?  Do you naively believe that we, the merchants-capitalists, are doing “really everything for the client”?  Such adults, and you all believe in fairy tales?  Do you also believe in the slogan of “traders” “customer is always right”?  Yes?  Oh, Excuse me, barely hold back (gy-gy-gy). <br><br>  When the points are burned “quietly” - this is half the problem, but when right before our eyes “instead of a carriage they become ...”.  Look in your personal account, for example, the Eldorado Write Off tab or MTS Bonus “Combustion Prediction”. <br><br>  Strange, but loyalty creatives (loyal-storytellers) and “traders” expect that people will love similar loyalty programs and “ballet” from “combustion predictions”.  It would be better for customers at each box office to put a bubble with heart drops and ammonia, at least at the time of the onset of "midnight".  Surprisingly, when only 100 rubles are stolen from our wallet, we shout: “robbery, hold the thief!”, And when the points in the same way disappear (burn, “tyk-blow”), we only regret.  There is no difference: these amounts have already been credited to our wallet (bonus account) and this is our money - equivalents! <br><br>  Therefore, we need to competently and in time to dispose of them: save, convert (exchange) or share with someone (sharing score) on mutually beneficial terms, or simply donate “to your neighbor” (and you will be rewarded), in a very extreme case - “to the enemy "Buy" at least something "(at least for the future, tablets for a washer with delivery).  By comparison, you keep a bunch of money in your wallet: donated for your birthday and easily earned and got you hard work, and when you spend it you don’t remember how you got it. <br><br>  Sometimes points come as a gift: for a birthday, an invite-code read on a fence, or another “just like that”, i.e.  unexpectedly fall on the head, like "manna from heaven."  If this is a “pumpkin carriage”, then in this case, you start to think frantically: so that you can quickly buy something like that before the points burn out (the monsters took the carrot back)?  In order not to burn, "thanksgiving", some are forced to take their children to the nearest fast food, where they change "thanksgiving" to "McDaki", and poison them with unhealthy food. <br><br>  In other words: it is necessary to prevent robbery, albeit from the loyalty program that issued the “carrot points”.  More precisely, not just quickly “eat” points, but to be able to manage their effective spending.  Therefore, we need not only a convenient universal mega-wallet of all cards (both discount and bonus), but also a sharing system with an accounting system, and ideally with on-line integration with a loyalty program (balance control, bonus account statement). <br><br>  Each specified direction will allow us to get a little rich, more precisely, to save considerably, but together they form a qualitatively new service: Loyalty 3.0.  In general, it is management of all loyalty processes on the client side (client groups): receiving (we don’t notice and lose a lot), accumulation (with multiplier), accounting (monitoring and reporting) and use (utilization) of bonuses and discounts. <br><br>  Consider the “Bonus of the Commune” card sharing group using the example of several related families (households, communes).  In the system, everyone has a cloned (actually shared) electronic wallet with identifiers (card scans, barcodes, phone numbers tied to a card, etc.) in the simplest version - one card for each loyalty system. <br><br>  Using an identifier (an image of a card in your e-wallet), everyone can either replenish a common collection of points (a single household bank) or spend (write off points for a purchase). <br><br>  This provides a summing effect (synergy): scores will “burn out” much less often, accumulate faster - accumulate by “mob” is easier, besides, many loyalty systems are “sharpened” on the amount of purchases: instead of one score they give three points (progressive discounts and accruals) etc.  Together, it is easier (and even better - automatically) to track sales and promotions: the promotion period, the discount amount or triple pricing conditions, changes in conditions, etc.     —  «   ». <br><br>     .      —    ( ).         ,       (, )  (). <br><br>   ,   —     (),      «» (-  ),  ,    (  ). :   —  , ..       «». <br><br>          -,    ,    « » loyalty-,    ( )   «»  -, ,     «» (« »  ..).  loyalty- –   «  »       ,       « 3.0». <br><br>            :     ,     ( ).  ,   ,  « », ..   «»  «    ,    ». <br><br> ,     (): « » —        ( ,  ),       (-, , )      ,    ( -  ).

Brick: “Wallet, wallet, what wallet?  Nate look, there is nothing in it, because  all maps are "in the cloud"! <br><br>  In the worst case, the company will disconnect (block) the bonus card, then register again, set up a new card and add it to our wallet.  If the program operator blacklists the "bonus" phone: then we take a new card and a new mobile phone number for the desired loyalty network, and not a personal number, but a "common" (communal) one. <br><br>  In extreme cases, you can buy Cardberry or a similar “miracle” (all cards in one real “smart card”): a universal card that emulates a lane and a bar code you need.  I hope soon such “iron” card aggregators will be with a removable “graphical shell” (e-ink, etc.) that change the appearance (“shirt”) of a smart card for the desired skin (priky): high-quality replica (an exact copy of the original a) any cards i.  skin chameleon on the photo (scan).  In any case, the principle of family (communal) sharinga remains - it is key: a common bank of accumulation cards. <br><br>  From practice, when the cashier requires only a "live" plastic card, and not its image on the display of the device, they will leave, because  The principle “a physical map cannot be passed from hand to hand” is not popular.  The requirement of the merchant: “Give me only my personal card, but I will not accept the card that my wife gave you —” is nonsense.  Although the card can put a photo and collate, examples: Metro Cash &amp; Carry, a social card. <br><br>  There are other risks: for example, it’s one thing to drop and even tread a “shovel” stuffed with plastic, and another to drop a smartphone with all electronic content: if the gadget says “grunt”, then on this day, most likely, it cannot be restored either and you can stay without discounts and without purchases. <br><br>  It is not clear how to maintain a communal account (accounting and consumption) of "winged" or "iron" bonuses (airline miles, Russian Railways Bonus), i.e.  when there is a confirmation through the ticket.  Apparently, the options (domains) should be provided in the "family cardsharing": global - "sharing with everyone", local - "sharing within the commune" (households), personal - "not sharing", because  it is impractical or impossible (miles, photo-identification and other "hard" identification). <br><br>  Actually, a classic ruble wallet can serve as a separate domain, for secrecy (care in “neglect”) called a “ruble bonus”.  Such a domain will represent a cast of a classic bank in the “family” accounting space. <br><br>  Not all companies will enjoy “cardsharing at home”.  What will “dissatisfied” companies do?  In each loyalty card instead of a magnetic strip (which is copied) will they put a chip or will they be transferred to a co-branded bank card (combined with a bank card) with a mandatory payment condition through them?  Will they burn their stigma on the client's forehead, complicate the registration procedure in the loyalty program? <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/wirex/blog/281136">70% of consumers refuse to participate in loyalty programs due to the lengthy registration process</a> .  Some delete applications, including e-wallets, “without looking” - if the application immediately requires any registration. <br><br>  What is the future of loyalty programs?  Cards (embossed plastic, barcode, magnetic stripes) are already past.  They will introduce biometric identification: identification of a person by fingerprint, retina, DNA and store biometrics (standard) and thus “tightly” tie a person to his “client ID” (portrait). <br><br>  Or they will be ready to bind to their company (program) whole households that use “family-friendly discount cardsharing”, albeit without personalizing its members.  In any case, the possibility of sharing the card with other users is claimed, sending it over the air (Internet, Bluetooth, etc.) and this will have to be considered all. <br><br>  <b>Co-brand-programs of banks and trading companies.</b>  A sustainable trend of “modern loyalty” is to bind a person to a bank card by launching the Bank Co-Brand loyalty program.  For example, an intersection issued cards with “x2” - doubled accrual of points, if a customer pays for a co-branded one: a “food retailer” gives a “cookie”, the second - a bank.  Accordingly, if you pay with another “credit card”, and present a cobrend card (card barcode) as a bonus one, then the coefficient remains “x1” from the check.  "Old" card "club crossroads", i.e.  non-banking, also work as "x1", see. <a href="http://www.banki.ru/news/daytheme/%3Fid%3D9373050">"Cross" pollination</a> . <br><br>  A co-brand with a bank is the consequences of a crisis of loyalty systems, which have long been turned into an independent industry (already with controversial advantages and KPI).  As shown in the “Loyalty &amp; reality” picture, not only customers, but also the merchants themselves (merchants) became hostages of this industry. <br><br>  Adding a “bank link” (an additional leash) is an attempt to “unleash loyalty” and banks that are headlong have already plunged into the world of card loyalty: “Thank you” and “strawberries” (Malinki, brunettes and blondes). <br><br>  There are and will be enough problems with cobrend cards: many customers think that they are only “loyal”, but, in fact, they are banking, that with “nominal” plastic, that they are “not identified”.  Some under the sign "loyalty card" or "prepaid card" may be initially debit (including overdraft) or credit, and under the sign "prepaid free" may be products with a high service charge, for example, after identification, including one that you will learn about later with surprise. <br><br>  That the product turned out to be “serious”, i.e.  with serious service, you will find out later, at the airport, when you will not let you go abroad for “debts” by reading the fine-fine print that you haven’t been interested in or “unexpectedly” changed the offer of services for your wonderful “loyal bank card”. <br><br>  <u>Unilaterally</u> (we read contracts, offers) to change card management conditions, tariffs, etc., are “classics of the genre”, and “sudden circumstances” can be various and anecdotal (but not funny), for example, <a href="http://vseiobovsem2015.mirtesen.ru/blog/43005178644/Bonusnaya-karta-Lukoyl-ili-kak-nas-obmanyivayut">Lukoil Bonus Card or how we cheat</a> <br><br>  There are a lot of cases when people pay for services that have come out of nowhere, such as “mobile content”, “strawberry” (and grannies also become victims), etc., because  It is easier to pay than to fight the arbitrariness of a large company with a bunch of full-time lawyers. <br><br>  Under the guise of loyalty cards, you can easily distribute thousands (millions) of credit cards with an exorbitant interest rate, especially since classic credit cards have long been “embedded in every bakery”, singing: how “this is cool and you need” and how “this stylish piece” plastic "emphasizes the high status of its owner." <br><br>  For a long time there is a massive distribution of co-branded bank cards (prepaid, debit, credit) and banks annually report on multi-million emissions of "loyal plastic".  Have you stopped taking credit cards?  You need to come up with something “new”: “credit loyalty cards” and offer (push) them under the guise of bonus cards, “without departing from the cash register”, i.e.  right at the checkout.  Attitude to bank cards - as to loyalty cards is very dangerous, for example, you took a card, thinking that only bonuses “drip” on it.  In reality, it turned out to be “extra” credit, which although you never paid, it was not indicated about it when you made a loan (it’s “loyalty”), after which you were denied a loan, and for a long time, with the wording “for cheating. " <br><br>  In general, it is difficult to imagine that having received a credit card at a gas station, for example, <a href="http://www.banki.ru/forum/%3FPAGE_NAME%3Dread%26FID%3D13%26TID%3D278562">Lukoil-Otkrytie</a> , they will pay for it everywhere: at other gas stations, in the Crossroads, in a boutique, in a network pharmacy, in a large online store.  Each of them has its own program and its partner bank, so there you need to show and pay from another co-brand loyalty card (another bank and for another program).  Who had the calculation that the client would choose ONLY one and the “right bank” from such an abundance of cobrand cards? <br><br>  Therefore, the number of cards in the wallet will only increase - at least due to crowding out existing partner (coalition) programs by bank-brands, for example, raspberries (“glades” have long been occupied, many are “raspberries”). <br><br>  Loyalty cards gradually become "bank", i.e.  with all the attendant risks: from theft of money, to the "strange" and non-permanent conditions of their service.  It is one thing to lose or “yawn lopatnik”, hammered by loyal plastic, and quite another - credit (payment cards). <br><br>  A dozen credit cards with paid SMS-notification or annual service can level the profitability of loyalty programs, and if you accidentally ran into the bank's “protective tariff”, then the negative monetary and ball balance is guaranteed. <br><br>  <b>Cashback.</b>  In addition to the above problems of the co-brand: no one canceled cashback and it is possible that it is more profitable to pay, for example, with tinkoff (cashback), presenting a co-brand card (operating in the loyalty program) only as a bonus for accruing points, i.e.  Do not pay with a card-brand. <br><br>  Therefore, the purchase algorithm is significantly complicated.  Earlier, I dragged a bunch of loyal plastic plus tinkoff and mastered soft wallets, hoping for a total rejection of loyal plastic. <br><br>  Now you need to carry the same bunch of bank loyal plastic plus a “normal cashback” payment card (I think about this kind of tinkoff), while checking the conditions of the loyalty program with the “normal cashback” card settings, i.e.  controlling which commodity cashback categories were chosen, which cashback promotions are going on, etc.  Buying has become more difficult, it is necessary that someone carefully "thought for you." <br><br>  Apparently they call it: “we think about each client”, “exceptional customer focus” and other “winged” slogans of “spectacular” loyalty programs.  Marketers expect that such a "co-brand improvement" will cause customer delight?  So far, such a "bend" is evident only in the capitals, but expansion in the regions is growing. <br><br>  Isn't it easier for banks to give only equivalent (equivalent) cashback, saving on the infrastructure of loyalty systems, which is a complex, expensive, “almost” payment system.  This is not only the emission of excess plastic (on the scale of "millions per year") and processing centers with high utilization, reliability and security - counting candy wrappers and chips, bonuses and points. <br><br>  This also includes “buying in” (selling), activating cards, personal accounts, Call Center, etc.  These are semi-analytical-consulting structures (advertising, marketing, promotion, business planning, design of cross-sales systems, evidence of the effectiveness of such a system, etc.) and newsletters (spam, push-trolling). <br><br>  Moreover, there are a lot of pitfalls: you can get millions in fines "thanks to" only violence - the madness of Rospotrebnadzor in terms of regulating personal data processing processes and advertising. <br><br>  The massive transition to a cobrand significantly complicates the use of e-wallets for loyalty cards and requires a transition to Double-wallets (soft or hard), which is much more difficult, more expensive, untested and risky. <br><br>  Soft: the loss or theft of a credit card phone is equivalent to the loss of a stack of the same plastic payment: two-factor user authentication messages will come to him, in addition, there are many places where you can do without it and without a CVV code. <br><br>  Hard: holding a “hi-tech device” of the Coin type, which takes on the appearance (emulates a magnetic stripe) of any bank card, comes to mind (own and surrounding) associations: skimming, carding, hacking.  And if in the second hand there is also an accessory for Coin - “credit card reader”, then it will be difficult to explain that it is not a hacker reader. <br><br><h3>  Family Cardsharing Prospects </h3><br>  If the topic of "loyalty" outside of bank cards will still survive, i.e.  reflect the onslaught of bank-krebrenda, and at the same time, the card sharing will “take off”, then the whole “bonus” industry can be formed, free from state regulation and not burdened by a banking license. <br><br>  If in addition to hi-tech, for example, the blockchain (many publications on the theme “loyalty-blockchain”), then there will be a new high-tech direction in the field of innovative financial services (classic banking - as an accounting / payment system - this is not hi-tech). <br><br>  When the cardsharing direction “takes off” and the non-bank service in question becomes widespread, classic problems will immediately appear: skimming, protection from <a href="http://www.banki.ru/forum/%3FPAGE_NAME%3Dread%26FID%3D9%26TID%3D298433">photographing the bonus card by the</a> “third-party buyer” at the checkout will be needed, the theft of bonuses (they stole five “thanks”, two “miles” and one "Nishtyak"), etc.  There will be fake points-bonuses, and funny ones, for example: Where is your conscience, that you give me your fake “Thank you”?  Even digital beggars will start: “fill up some bonuses and spasibok for food.  Thank you. ” <br><br>  Maybe the trend for the multiplication of bonuses “bunnies” and the popularization of card aggregators (programs or hardware) will become an independent direction and a driver of monetary transformation.  Then the “family-friendly” cardsharing should take a key place in it: “accumulative - calculated - investment - captive, etc.  - a real family bank, but without a banking license. <br><br>  The basis of such a credit and bonus system is trust (kinship and friendship of participants), but limited (restrained) by a system of limits (a system of overdraft points), locks (stop-loss), up to the “closing” of the personal bonus account of an unscrupulous household member by exclude it from the automated household eco-system. <br><br>  According to the same principle, the far-distant development (a very long-term perspective) provides for the replacement of classical banks with “bonus” ones, since  on the one hand, the corporate bonus bank is represented only by an accounting system and integration with payment systems and loyalty programs, and on the other hand, it requires almost nothing: neither banking licenses, nor highly paid staff who know all the Central Bank, do not require offices or authorized capital , no check and recalculation machines, or armored box booths. <br><br>  Almost nothing is needed - only special software, for example, based on CMS (Wodpress, Joomla) with a boxed “bonus add-in” and integration modules with all sorts of “wallets” and “personal accounts”. <br><br>  To obtain a balance and a planned balance, integration with personal accounts is taken directly from the loyalty program operator’s system: typical providers of popular balance keepers.  This will also allow another colossal advantage: you do not need to remember a bunch of logins and passwords to a bunch of cabinets or to buy each one and set up balance aggregators for a long time. <br><br>  More precisely, the need to use balancers, “Balance”, will remain only for highly personal services, such as the hundredth connection. <br><br>  No exchange controls, crowds of regulators (inspectors), and tons of reporting: what kind of reporting do you need for thank-yous and likes?  We have all the "raspberries" and "corn" are stored in a three-liter can.  This is a good startup for the next generation of new banking bankers. <br><br>  The spread of ballistic bonus banks, including international and conversion bourgeois "Thank You" (Citi) to our "Thanks", combined with the circulation of "unconventional" currency (bitcoins, etc.) will mark the already visible era of "Loyalty 4.0" .         - , ,   (, )   (  )      (, , ,   ..), ..       ,    ,        ,    ,    ,     ( ). <br><br>   ,    ,    ,      (   )  ,     !
