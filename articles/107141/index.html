  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web pathology: No button to click</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Captain Obvious will laugh again, but the facts are as follows: a good half of those who approached me for consultation with the ‚ÄúBad sales‚Äù problem - there was no price on the website next to the product description and the [Buy] button!  In this case, the creators of the site did not cause any doubts about the mental usefulness, on the contrary, the level of their sites was much higher than average.  There is a very reasonable explanation for this, and again it lies in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUX design and user experience modeling. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately I will clarify that these were not literally online stores (in which all the necessary buttons are already sewn into the engine), but rather informational sites with a list of services or a small catalog of goods.  As it turned out from the further conversation, they didn‚Äôt see any reason to indicate prices - ‚ÄúBecause the exact price is still dependent on a lot, let them call right away,‚Äù and didn‚Äôt post the [Buy] buttons - ‚ÄúWell, because it‚Äôs also clear to everyone that this is for sale why else to put the buttons, especially since we do not have a basket in the engine ‚Äù. <br><br>  If you want users to buy something from you, then: <br><br>  <b>1. Make the obvious - as likely as possible.</b> <br>  Make the product look like a product and in such a way that the user can instantly recognize it.  Nobody will think over your interface.  The user does not think - he looks. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <b>2. Write the price.</b> <br>  Let even in the approximate form ‚Äúthe price from XXX rubles ...‚Äù.  Without price, it is not a commodity.  And if this is not a commodity, then who will buy it then? <br><br>  <b>3. Designate the user the action that he must take to buy the product.</b> <br>  No functionality of the basket and the [Buy] button?  Then make a block similar to it with the text ‚Äú[To order a product call tel.  (XXX) XXX XX XX] ‚Äù.  Otherwise, what should the user do when he sees the product and does not see a guideline, what to do next?  Wait for a dial tone, waxed owls? <br><br>  <b>4. Show that when you clicked on the [Buy] button, a purchase occurred (or added to the basket).</b> <br>  When a user presses a button and visually nothing happens, often the actual purchase also does not occur.  Your well-hidden baskets remain unpaid. <br><br>  In general, this is only a particular type of pathology called ‚ÄúLack of clear instructions for user actions‚Äù or, in simple terms, the absence of ‚ÄúPush buttons‚Äù (these also include links and dynamic controls). <br><br>  After the user opened the page, looked through, recognized its structure, read the text and understood something from it - the choice ‚ÄúWhat to do next?‚Äù Appears before him.  If you have a likely answer to this question in the form of a ‚ÄúPush Button‚Äù, then it will most likely use it.  If there is no choice, then his thoughts will come to a standstill and return to the question ‚ÄúWhat am I doing here and with which task do I have?‚Äù. <br><br>  If he does not have a clear task related to your site, he will simply leave your page somewhere further on the Internet.  And you could stay on the site longer and thereby increase the likelihood of committing useful actions for you.  Ideally, the buttons for all the most useful actions for you should be beautiful and in most cases the only ones on the page.  But the buttons on those user actions that can upset you - hide away from users. <br><br>  As a rule, the lack of ‚Äúpush buttons‚Äù is often wrong: <br><ul><li>  Advertising text blocks \ sentences on the main page that are not banners.  (Discount on products? Two for the price of one? This is interesting to me. What do I need to do for this?) </li><li>  Lists of goods, services and offers.  (Ok, here are your prices. Where to click to order?) </li><li>  Tariff grids or a list of tariff plans.  (Ok, here are your tariffs. Where to click to order? Or do I need to memorize your tariff plans?) </li><li>  Marketing descriptions of products and services.  (I read, I liked it. Do you want to offer me something or are you just expanding my horizons?) </li></ul>  I ask the owners of such small business sites to look at their sites immediately after reading this note.  If you have a similar problem - write about it in the comments. <br><br>  <i>Users - keep clicking, in the name of all that is holy, keep clicking!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107141/</a></p>
