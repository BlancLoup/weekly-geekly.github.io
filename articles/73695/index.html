  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Collecting friends about yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The opinion of those around him is always important to a person as a social creature.  And to me, as the founder of a not-yet-launched project <a title="PollDruzey.ru" href="http://oprosdruzei.ru/">to collect the opinions of friends</a> , it is important that the habrasoobschestva about this project. <br><br>  After <a href="http://webradosti.ru/">we</a> started the project on <a title="Webdiktor.ru - audiversion articles" href="http://webdiktor.ru/">dubbing articles</a> , which turned out to be unclaimed, and the rest, it was decided to take up a long-standing idea to create a service to collect the opinions of friends about ourselves.  The launch is on the way, and here I am ripe for a public story.  It turned out in the presentation style for the investor, but I‚Äôll say at once that the investor is not required. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Relevance of the topic </h2><br>  It is important for people, the opinion of friends is interesting.  Knowing something good from the opinions of friends, a man is proud of it.  Knowing something that does not seem attractive, a person can try to change for the better.  People like to compare themselves with others. <br>  Yes, there are people who believe that the opinions of those around them are not important. <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  Service to collect opinions of friends about yourself. <img alt="Poll of friends" src="http://oprosdruzei.ru/images/img/logo.jpg" align="right"><ul><li>  The person is registered on the site </li><li>  Receives a link and sends it to friends </li><li>  Friends answer questions </li><li>  A person gets an opinion of friends about himself </li></ul><h2>  As arranged </h2><br>  Each answer to a question determines a person by some characteristic - a certain number of points (kindness, justice, beauty, intellect, etc. - 30 characteristics).  After collecting a certain number of answers from a certain number of friends, the average score for each characteristic is calculated.  Each characteristic has several text transcripts, depending on the number of points gained.  These decryptions are collected in the text, and the text is issued to the user.  The questionnaire was compiled by joint efforts of a professional copywriter, psychologist, proofreader under my leadership.

(For example, "Friends think you're super modest handsome") </li><li>  Lots of various other nice little things </li></ul><h2>  Business model </h2><br>  Free: decoding only 2-3 characteristics from 30, and only 3-5 answers from friends. <br>  For a fee, for SMS: full decoding and all answers of friends (who as answered has not been issued). <br><br><h2>  Technology </h2><br>  YII framework, exporting the questionnaire from their Excel file, SMS billing, where you need Ajax. <br><br><h2>  Promotion </h2><br>  Viral effect.  This project is one of the few that spreads precisely because of the viral effect. <br><br><h2>  Competitors </h2><ul><li>  <a title="Naushko.ru - a bank of opinions of friends" href="http://www.naushko.ru/">Naushko.ru</a> - Launched at the end of 2007, for the year gained about 300 thousand users.  The project instantly paid for itself through advertising, but for certain did not bring serious money.  The user base has grown solely due to the viral effect. </li><li>  Survey creation services.  Over the past year, a lot of them appeared in runet.  Only the tool is provided, and the questionnaires need to come up with yourself. </li></ul>  The listed services are rather similar projects than competitors, since  there is no rivalry with them as such. <br><br><h2>  People </h2><ul><li>  Leader: idea, investment, preparation of TZ, execution control, management. </li><li>  Copywriter: compiling a questionnaire, the total text volume is about 250 thousand characters. </li><li>  Proofreader: check and adjustment of the questionnaire. </li><li>  Psychologist: placement of points in the correspondences Answer-Characteristic (about 100 thousand intersections), recommendations on the questionnaire. </li><li>  Designer: Design </li><li>  Layout designer: layout </li><li>  Developer: website development </li></ul><h2>  Plans, prospects </h2><ul><li>  The operating time of the user base is 1-5 million people in the first year. </li><li>  Comparison of their own opinions about themselves with the opinions of friends. </li><li>  Sale of paid services of a psychologist for particularly severe cases according to the survey results. </li><li>  Ratings among friends, contests on guessing the characteristics of strangers. </li><li>  Application for Vkontakte. </li><li>  Other thematic, social surveys (conditions at work, happiness, holidays, etc.).  The business model is the same. </li><li>  Dating based on the opinions of friends.  Subscription fee. </li><li>  Selling information about the characteristics of users of contextual advertising systems for psychological targeting (such as, for example, <a href="http://www.begun.ru/begun/press/releases/detail.php%3FID%3D2245">Mamba sold its base to Begun</a> and how <a href="http://mediarevolution.ru/formats/vehicle/1458.html">psychological targeting is used 24open.ru</a> ) </li></ul><h2>  Current state </h2><br>  The project is fully developed, but contains a huge number of bugs, making it inoperative.  The programmer who developed it can no longer devote time to the project, and from today the project is frozen.  I am looking for a new developer or developers to collaborate on an ongoing basis, piece by piece, by design.  TK in the free style, but describing everything to the smallest detail there. <br><br>  I would be damn glad about the offers of cooperation and any constructive criticism.  Ready to answer questions. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  Mark </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73695/</a></p>
