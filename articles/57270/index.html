I tried to figure out what was wrong. <br><br>  I will say straight away that this description of the problem concerns only those who have chosen the Rapid payment system in the payment receipt options.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It turned out that the Rapid system is quite fastidious. <br><br>  Items to check for payment. <br><br>  <b>- The post office that you have chosen to deliver the payment does not serve the issuance of transfers.</b> <br><br>  In this case, it is necessary to choose another branch to receive demand transfers.  Thus, the following steps are as follows: find out in which post office work with the Rapid payment system by calling a specific post office.  Then change the payment delivery address, enter the new post office code that works with Rapid.  In the address line, specify "on demand".  When you come to receive payment by mail, ask the mail worker to look for your payment by name and not by last name, since the data in the payment is indicated in exactly this sequence. <br><br>  <b>- The payment was not claimed and came back.</b> <br><br>  Perhaps you did not receive a notification that the payment arrived in the mail, or the mail worker did not find your payment.  Since the purpose of the payment is first given your first and middle name, and then the last name, sometimes the mail service cannot find a payment by last name.  Therefore, when you come to receive your next payment, ask to search by name. <br><br>  <b>- Incorrect postal code.</b> <br><br>  In case if your address contains the postal code of another post office that does not work in your area / block / city, the payment will be returned back.  Please check the correctness of the index in your address. <br><br>  <b>- Specified non-existent address, zip code, city</b> <br><br>  Check the correctness of your address, and make the necessary changes. <br><br>  <b>- The address of your account is different from the address to receive payments on Rapida.</b>  <b>Or in the address for receiving payments for Rapid indicated two addresses.</b> <br><br>  Since the Rapida payment system does not accept more than one address, a technical failure occurs in the system and the payment is returned.  Please make the necessary changes to your address, leaving only one address. <br>  <b>- The payment address in the Rapida system is written in Latin</b> <br><br>  It is forbidden to write the address or part of the address in Latin letters, including those signs that are identical in appearance with the Cyrillic characters. <br><br>  <b>- Used signs ";" semicolon, "/" fraction</b> <br><br>  The Rapid payment system is very sensitive to the format in which the address of the payee is indicated.  Try changing it by removing the above punctuation. <br><br>  In order to view and make changes to the address for Rapida, update the payment method and select the Rapida system again, then you can update the address. <br><br>  I hope these tips based on google will help you in solving problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57270/</a></p>
