Now we seem to have three jackets, and a tape recorder in each phone, and every New Year you want magic, you want to please and rejoice at the gifts.  Under our tree gets more and more gadgets and devices that make life easier or serve as entertainment.  It seems to be glands, wiring, but how mental they can be, if they are selected with care and understanding of what you love.  We chose several products that hooked us and which we are ready to give to our loved ones - today we are sharing them with you. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/977/9c2/8f89779c2b961f9f8d6ae08ec3e5009e.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the very whirlwind of the New Year's actions, Gearbest is a landing <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-270.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">with discounts</a> and flash sales.  As always, all discounts are grouped and conveniently divided, finding the right is easy.  Please note - at the end of the post, we once again highlighted all the necessary pages: with coupons, sales in warehouses and a Russian-language page for gadzhetomanov. <br><br><h3>  Techno-tusa in our club </h3><br>  In the Christmas discounts, we included not only popular products, but also professional pieces that already earned the trust of customers.  Among them - a graphic tablet <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/graphics-tablets/pp_364944.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">UGEE UG-2150</a> .  It will suit both beginners and sophisticated designers and other freelance artists.  This is a tablet that does not have functional buttons, with a Full HD screen, large viewing angles and a 21.5-inch display.  The pen on the battery works without delay, of the shortcomings - there is no eraser function and sometimes a small parallax effect.  In fact, this is not only a pure graphics tablet, which allows you to manipulate the cursor and indirectly draw on a PC, this is an LCD monitor with a graphic tablet technology, so you can draw directly on this monitor using the included stylus.  For beginners, this is especially valuable - so greatly increases the accuracy and accuracy of work, in contrast to graphic tablets without a screen, which you need to get used to.  UGEE 2150 has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity, a display with a resolution of 1920x1080, a really responsive pen in some places better than well-known analogs, works without noticeable delay and has a VGA, DVI-I and HDMI port. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/graphics-tablets/pp_364944.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2d/99a/557/f2d99a55748955eb2139856386e0b92c.jpg"></a>

On board the laptop is an Intel Cherry Trail Z8300 Quad Core 1.44GHz processor - a solution ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for games.  And in general, the laptop pulls pretty well even heavy toys.  With a weight of 1860 grams, the laptop also becomes an excellent companion on trips and business trips.  For a price of $ 185.99, the device exceeds all imaginable and unimaginable expectations and can be a gift to both an adult and a schoolboy. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_488238.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5b/a03/34e/b5ba0334eda77d709d5285b03d7bbf91.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another representative of reliable devices for every day is the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_349080.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Oukitel K6000 Pro 4G Phablet</a> , a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display and a 6000 mAh capacity battery.

The main camera is 16 megapixel, the front one also did not pump up - 8 megapixel.  To control the security of the smartphone on the back is a fingerprint scanner.  The metal case pleasantly lies in a hand, but nevertheless it is felt that it is a phablet, and not just a smartphone.  The manufacturer announces the resistance of the smartphone to the effects of water, but there is no special protection class - so it‚Äôs better not to involve the device in participation in ice fishing. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_349080.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45b/302/db3/45b302db38d55fe0808400e5cffe66f0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In winter, an action camera is very necessary.  True, without it, as without hands - the Russians find thousands of ways to descend from the mountains, hills and ice structures, you just need to capture everything and share the snowy emotions with the whole world.

For $ 155.99, it‚Äôs not even a pity to take it in order to see what a 3D printer is and test yourself as a designer.  The device is heavy, but rather compact.  By the way, another plus for real fans is that you need to assemble the device yourself, and then proceed to print.
