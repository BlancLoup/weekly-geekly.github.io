But if you think that reports are only about programming, then you are mistaken.  Nothing human is alien to technical companies, so two whole thematic conferences are devoted to management issues. <br><br>  The <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018">Whale Rider</a> conference on <strong>project management and entrepreneurship</strong> in the Internet area will combine discussion of pressing topics in the context of IT specifics: business processes, strategy, work with clients, performance metrics, and even jurisprudence (hello, GDRP) - learn more about the program under the cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4b/jz/ja/4bjzjazxjajovmx7-6ymj6ms-68.png">

      The <a href="http://conf.aletheia.business/2018">Aletheia Business</a> conference <a href="http://conf.aletheia.business/2018">this</a> year focuses on the practices and technologies of working with the " <strong>human factor</strong> " - all that concerns the personality of the manager and the employee, teamwork.  And earlier, if you remember, they actively fought with <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/348714/">procrastination</a> - you see, we won! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Whale Rider Program </h2><br>  Fortunately, the reports of the Whale Rider will go in one stream and in one hall.  But, firstly, without a break for lunch, and, secondly, there will be additional interesting <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/meetups">meetings around</a> .  Therefore, in order to correctly prioritize, and not to miss anything important, you must familiarize yourself with everything. <br><blockquote>  It is not harmful to remind that the main hall, that is, the coolest reports and speakers, as usual, will be broadcast for free. <br></blockquote>  Below are the reports in the order of their presentation, and the remaining activity in the <a href="http://ritfest.ru/moscow/2018/schedule.html">schedule</a> . <br><br><h2>  May 28, Monday </h2><br>  <strong>Vladimir Likhtansky</strong> <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3424.html">will</a> <strong>begin</strong> and <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3424.html">share his experience with</a> Plesk, how to stop firing a cannon at sparrows, and <strong>choose the right team for each task</strong> , and how to systematize this process. <br><br>  <strong>Alexander Andronov</strong> (Dodo Pizza) begins a report with a <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3486.html">terrible story</a> about the fall of the system on the ‚ÄúLast Bell‚Äù in 2017, and proceeds to how you can <strong>change processes</strong> on all fronts almost simultaneously while not die. <br><br>  <strong>Andrey Revyashko</strong> will tell the real <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3571.html">story</a> of IT reform in Wildberries.ru from the company's monolithic IT department to such a department in each department. <br><br>  As you can see, <strong>our speakers are practitioners</strong> and all their decisions are verified by personal experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/e9/mu/rae9mua-fqvzj56riw28l-ukh0u.jpeg"><br><br>  The report by <strong>Alexey Vasiliev</strong> from BIPULSE <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3404.html">will deal</a> with solving problems with resource constraints, applying the <strong>Theory of Limitations</strong> , and how to structure work and survive in the conditions of project chaos. <br><br>  <strong>Pavel Ryskov</strong> (FRII) <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3518.html">promises to highlight the</a> most significant trends in sales and development of an IT product, to speculate about evolution, what a ‚Äúsuccessful transaction‚Äù really is and <strong>what KPI to put to</strong> sales, and why b2b is no longer relevant. <br><br>  The CEO of 1C-Bitrix <strong>Sergey Ryzhikov</strong> is going to continue the strategic theme and <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3696.html">discuss</a> what the startup should aim at so as not to close in a few years. <br><br>  Continuing the topic of sales, <strong>Alexey Kolokolov</strong> (Institute for Business Intelligence) <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3555.html">will teach you</a> how to show a client the results of your work, if you create an IT product based on complex <strong>analytics of big data</strong> , so that he does not doubt the price of the solution. <br><blockquote>  For the first time at the RHS, we are holding a <a href="https://ritfest.ru/moscow/2018/reunion">congress of activists of</a> Russian-speaking IT communities.  In our opinion, this is a unique event.  All the most passionate guys will gather in one place - about 60 people from 40 communities. </blockquote>  <strong>Yevgeny Romanovsky</strong> (Pavlova Dog) believes that <strong>microtexts have become the standard of communication</strong> in the digital world, and offers to <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3220.html">tell you</a> how to change your attitude to texts, how to design content for a product, what it looks like traditional formats and what the fundamental differences are. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Gryazev</strong> from Dodo Pizza will talk about how it is important to <strong>rethink</strong> an existing functionality.  <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3426.html">The approach</a> to this was quite radical ‚Äî the team got out of their chairs, <strong>put on aprons and went to the kitchen</strong> at the pizzeria.  This saved the children in the kitchen half an hour of life a day, and the company - <strong>5 million</strong> a year. <br><br>  <strong>Peter Markov</strong> (CIAN) recommends a systematic approach to goal-setting in projects, and <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3499.html">offers</a> several approaches, tested on personal experience, which will help <strong>not to stray from the optimal trajectory</strong> and not lose the final goal for local tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/je/0p/h2/je0ph2yyxx_j9ytdqw7bodtgwq0.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  May 29, Tuesday </h2><br>  New day let's start with <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  choosing the starting point of the DevOps transformation under the leadership of <strong>Andrei Alexandrov</strong> (Express42), who in his report plans to <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3352.html">discuss</a> , among other things, the <strong>creation of a temporary team</strong> performing the transformation, the <strong>formulation of the problem</strong> , and the need to <strong>involve people from outside</strong> . <br><br>  Next, take a look at the changes from the other side.  <strong>Sergey Putin</strong> (Rosvodokanal MC) in his report ‚ÄúInternal obstacles of digital transformation of the company from housing and communal services 2.0‚Äù <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3525.html">will share</a> real cases of the beginning of a difficult path of forced evolution. <br><br>  <strong>Let us inspire</strong> start-up activities after the report, in which <strong>Roman Kumar Vias</strong> <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3524.html">will share the</a> secrets of promoting a startup using the example of the Qlean online cleaning service. <br><br>  <strong>Mikhail Smirnov</strong> <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3480.html">believes</a> that checklists are one of the simplest <strong>quality control tools</strong> .  With their help, web studios can build <strong>controlled processes</strong> for business growth and customize team work, improve quality, keep margins within specified limits and much more.  The report of Michael will <strong>only practice the work</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/tp/pz/eutppzudqutcgr69kfkeehg-dl8.jpeg"><br><br>  With <strong>Darya Yatskina</strong> (Ingram Micro Cloud), we will tune in to a serious mood and <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3377.html">listen to a</a> brief educational program on patents, focused on the <strong>IT industry</strong> and accumulating all the pain of questions from senior management of companies that "understand the topic." <br><br>  Let's continue to understand legal issues with information security specialist <strong>Maxim Lagutin</strong> (B-152). Based on his experience in bringing companies in line with <strong>152-FZ</strong> , Maxim intends to highlight <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3580.html">issues</a> related to <strong>GDRP</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/e9/mu/rae9mua-fqvzj56riw28l-ukh0u.jpeg"><br><br>  <strong>Vitaly Katorgin</strong> from DocDoc says that in order to change something for the better, we need to measure it first.  And in his <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3432.html">report, he</a> promises to tell what and how it is necessary to <strong>measure IT production</strong> , which KPIs can be assigned, and which <strong>statistics</strong> can be useful for the team. <br><br>  <strong>Anastasia Novikova</strong> CFO Wallarm promises to <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3422.html">tell you</a> about the main <strong>metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of a</strong> SaaS company, to share what features of counting metrics should be taken into account, and what to look for when evaluating key indicators for different sales models. <br><br>  And finally, <strong>Alexander Bogdanov</strong> (AGIMA) will try to <a href="http://whalerider.ru/2018/abstracts/3566.html">formulate the</a> main <strong>directions of the company's development</strong> , and answer the questions: how to <strong>determine priorities</strong> and correlate them with resources;  which business areas to subsidize;  how to choose partners <br><br><h2>  See you in Skolkovo! </h2><br><blockquote>  If you are not yet treated, then purchase <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/rit2018.html">tickets</a> , otherwise it will be too late in a week :) <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358856/</a></p>
