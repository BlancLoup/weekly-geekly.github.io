It is time to try to use the flexibility of a computer at full capacity. <br><br>  By the way, the next part is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sound_and_music/128436/">here</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cantabilesoftware.com/">Cantabile Performer 2</a> is a mix of vst host and recorder.  The program works only under the win platform, and apparently therefore the interface is based on ribbon.  This is a convenience of dubious quality, but for a year of use I no longer pay attention to it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having launched the software, we see a somewhat overloaded interface, but you can get used to it after a certain time or turn it off by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting ‚ÄúMinimaze the Ribbon‚Äù

    <img src="http://i.minus.com/ibsZSe63q1Fh5X.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Rack </h4><br>  The main element with which we will work - the river.  This is a set of effects and synthesizers, united among themselves and grouped by us in the right order.  Rivers can be created as much as you like, they weigh almost nothing and noticeably facilitate the work, especially during multichannel play. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iydKvKAbIH0EX.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The program works with most VST and VSTi tools, ignoring only Wave plugins.  Which greatly expands our horizons - I personally have always been grieved by the rather meager delays of guitar processors and ordinary pedals.  But on the topic of effects, I plan to write a separate article at all, so we will not go into details. <br><br><h4>  Sub-session </h4><br>  Further I suggest to look at the sub-session.  In principle, it is only because of this that I contacted Cantabile and consider sub-sessions the main advantage of this program. <br><br>  The creators divided everything into saving track settings into two concepts: songs and sub-sessions.  By song (Song), they mean a set of rivers, effects, settings, and everything else.  Sub session is the internal settings of the program.  In addition, some triggers can be hung on the sub-session, but we'll talk about them a little later. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iPxVskYls6NOj.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As an example, I created several sub-sessions and assigned them different parameters.  In the screenshot above, we have the first sub-session loaded, in which all effects are included, except for the compressor in Rack 1. <br><br>  On the screen below, you will see the second sub-session, with an equalizer in the bypass mode in the Voice river and a jazz Kontakt 4 in the Piano river. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iCMPMarOyeJDx.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, among other things, the program that I asked for Guitar Rig has also changed.  Unfortunately, programs can be changed only for those plug-ins that independently support program change.  So, FabFilter's Timeless 2, my crazy favorite, does not support this, and if I want to use several different ones in one song, I need to add and configure each of them, and then put them into the bypass or suspension for each sub-session.  And so - we can save the program inside the vst effect and creating a new song - load the programs already familiar to us. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iSSIGdrxnNkrS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the bypass and suspension perform the same function of disconnecting the plug-in from the sound chain, but in various ways: the bypass does not unload the plug-in from memory, but removes it from the sound chain, and the suspension-completely ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the plug-in.  From personal experience I want to note that the suspension justifies itself only by connecting several synthesizers and switching between them. <br><br><h4>  Set list </h4><br>  Even in Cantabile Performer there is such a wonderful thing as the Set List - list of songs. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/iS7vIH2StgJew.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Each list can be saved and loaded whenever it pleases, and this is extremely convenient for any concert.  Songs can be moved within the list by usual overtightening and among other things - even choose a sub-session from which the song will be loaded. <br><br><img src="http://i.minus.com/ibf2n4cgAraobJ.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the following articles we will talk about midi: global midi, assignment of triggers, midi filters and much more.  Cantabile Performer has a lot of possibilities, but is somewhat confusing in itself, so there will be about two or three more articles about it if the information is in demand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128093/</a></p>
