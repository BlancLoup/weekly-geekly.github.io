  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Isaac Brooke. Pioneer of domestic computing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Soviet scientist, inventor, founder and first director of the Institute of Electronic Control Machines of the USSR Academy of Sciences. <br>  Together with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it_bigraphy/81207/">S.A.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it_bigraphy/81207/">Lebedev</a> was the founder of domestic computing technology.  If S.A.  Lebedev was the father of domestic mainframes, then we are obliged to Issak Brooke to create few machines. <br><img src="http://schools.keldysh.ru/sch444/museum/PICTURE/BRUK.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As B. N. Malinovsky writes, ‚ÄúThe similarity of the biographies of these two remarkable scientists is striking.  Both were born in the same year, studied at the same institute, ‚Äúgot on their feet‚Äù as scientists in the same scientific organization, both dealt with energy issues, went from it to computer technology, both became heads of leading scientific schools in the field of digital computers ‚Äù. <br><br>  I.S.Bruk was born on November 8, 1902 in Minsk in a poor family of a working tobacco factory.  In 1920 he graduated from a real school, and in 1925 he graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Moscow State Technical University.  N.E. Bauman.  While still a student, I.S. Brook engaged in scientific research.  His diploma was devoted to new ways of regulating asynchronous motors.  ‚ÄúAbilities and interest in technology <br>  inherited from his father, - remembers his sister, Mirra Semenovna Bruk.  - While studying in Minsk a real school, he was especially fond of the exact sciences - mathematics, physics, and technology.  In educational laboratories, he was sometimes given old waste devices.  At the ‚ÄúEnergia‚Äù plant, where Isaac, the craftsmen, began to arrive, the boy‚Äôs exceptional curiosity about the technique explained the structure of machines and machines to him, gave some old details.  At the end of the MSTU he was invited to work at the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute.  VI Lenin, where he participated in the creation of a new series of asynchronous motors and was engaged in solving problems of parallel operation of electric generators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 1930, Brooke moved to Kharkov, where several electric machines, including explosion-proof asynchronous motors, were developed and built at one of the factories under his leadership. <br><br>  In 1935, I.S. Brook returned to Moscow and was sent to the Energy Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences (ENIN).  Here he organized the laboratory of electrical systems and launched research on the calculation of the regimes of powerful power systems.  To simulate such systems, he created an AC calculating table ‚Äî an analog computer.  For these works in May 1936, I.S. Brook was awarded the academic degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences without defending a thesis, and in October 1936 he defended his doctoral thesis on the topic ‚ÄúLongitudinal Compensation of Power Lines‚Äù.  After completing the differential analyzer, Brooke was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences.

      In 1938, Brooke began creating a mechanical differential analyzer for solving systems of differential equations up to the 6th order inclusive.  The analyzer occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 square meters.  m, and only one gears in it was more than a thousand. <br>  In 1939, at one of the meetings of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences, I.S.Bruk reported on the mechanical analyzer created under his leadership to solve differential equations up to the 6th order, after which he was elected in 1939 as a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. <br><br>  During the Great Patriotic War, continuing research in the field of electric power engineering, I.S. Brook successfully worked on anti-aircraft fire control systems, invented the aircraft gun synchronizer, which fired through a rotating propeller of the aircraft. <br><br>  In 1947, I.S. Brook was elected a full member of the Academy of Artillery Sciences.  Solving problems in the field of electric power industry using analog computing technology, I.S.Bruk concluded that it was necessary to create electronic digital <br>  computers (digital computers) to obtain the necessary accuracy of calculations.  The beginning of work of I.S.Bruk on digital computers dates back to 1948.  It is interesting to note that both S.A. Lebedev and I.S.Bruk approached the development of digital machines, having <br>  experience in solving problems in the field of electric power on analog computers.  In 1948, I.S. Brook, together with B.I.Rameev, compiled a report on the principles of operation of a binary computer with a stored program. <br>  The first in the USSR author's certificate for the invention of a digital computer in the name of I.S. Brook and B.I.Rameyev is dated December 1948. <br>  But, alas, this project remained unfulfilled. <br><br>  In 1949, Rameeva was drafted into the army.  Brooke lost his only performer.  The drafted digital computer project remained on paper.  Nevertheless, Brooke‚Äôs ambitious emotional nature was certainly fueled by the information about the beginning of the creation of computers in ITM and BT of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which turned around with M. A. Lavrent'ev and then S. A. Lebedeva, and <br>  in SKB-245, where Rameev appeared.  In January 1950, I. S. Brook turned to the personnel department of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute with a request to send him talented young specialists who graduated from the radio engineering faculty.  In March 1950, the department <br>  cadres MEI sent him to the laboratory of Nikolai Yakovlevich Matyukhin, who received a diploma with honors for his brilliant studies and participation in scientific research still on the student's bench, but did not pass the personnel commission upon admission to graduate school. <br><br>  In 1950-1952  under the leadership of I.S. Brook a small-sized electronic automatic digital machine "M-1" was developed.  In the summer of 1951, approximately simultaneously with the MESM machine, the M-1 machine also started working, and in early 1952 it <br>  was put into trial operation.  But its creation involved only nine employees of the laboratory who did not have <br>  academic degrees (with the exception of I. S. Brooke).  If you imagine the conditions in which they worked, then this can be assessed as a remarkable creative impulse of the young team.  The developers of M-1 preserved the report ‚ÄúAutomatic <br>  M-1 computer, approved by Academician G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, Director of the Energy Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences on December 15, 1951 ‚Äù. <br>  From the memoirs of M. A. Kartsev: ‚ÄúAt the beginning of 1950, among the property brought from the trophy warehouse, a strange detail was discovered (I can‚Äôt say exactly who made this find, maybe Brooke, maybe Matyukhin, maybe <br>  Rameev, who previously worked for us).  For a long time nobody could understand her purpose and origin until they realized that this is a miniature cuprox rectifier.  This detail was appreciated, and M-1 was the first in the world. <br>  A computer in which all logic circuits were made on semiconductors. " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/222/217/359/2222173594455c8cdde06bd88f250e9f.gif" alt="image"><br>  In April 1952, the Brooke Laboratory began to create a more advanced digital computer M-2.  The development team was headed by M. A. Kartsev.  M-2 had a three-address system of commands, the format of 34 binary digits, <br>  representation of floating-point and fixed-point numbers; memory on cathode-ray tubes (CRT) with a capacity of 512 numbers and additional memory on a magnetic drum with a capacity of 512 numbers.  Performance M-2 was in <br>  average 2 thousand OP / sec.  In memory M-2, ordinary oscillographic CRTs were used, and in logic circuits semiconductor diodes - which significantly reduced the number of electronic tubes, power consumption and cost.  Building experience <br>  The diode logic circuits used in the M-2 served as the basis for the diode-transistor logic - the circuit design of the second generation computer circuitry.  In the summer of 1953, the M-2 was commissioned.  The M-2 machine, generally speaking, remained in a single copy, it was tried to be repeated in China, but we did not have information about what it earned there.  But it was a serious car.  It was very large and very important calculations.  As a matter of fact, for several years in the Soviet Union there were two working machines: the M-2 and the BESM machine of the Institute of Precise Mechanics and Computer Engineering of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  Big calculations were conducted by Sergey Lvovich Sobolev for Kurchatov.  Considered tasks for the company of Axel Ivanovich Berg. <br>  In the future, under the leadership of I.S. Brook, small digital computers ‚ÄúM-2‚Äù, ‚ÄúM-3‚Äù, ‚ÄúM-4‚Äù and others were created. Understanding that high-performance is not required for solving a number of tasks, <br><br>  I.S. Brook in 1955-1956  developed and economically justified the concept of small computers, introducing the term "small-sized machine." <br><br>  In 1956, I.S. Brook delivered a report at a session of the USSR Academy of Sciences on automation, in which he outlined the main areas of industrial application of computing and control machines, and in 1957 set the task of developing a theory, principles for constructing and using electronic control machines .  To solve it, the Institute of Electronic Control Machines of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (INEUM) was established in 1958.  The director of the institute was I.S. Brook. <br><br>  In the second half of the 1950s, IS Brook came to the conclusion that along with the use of computers for scientific calculations and object management, it is necessary to develop another field of application for computers ‚Äî the processing of economic information for accounting tasks, <br>  statistics, planning, modeling economy.  Having become acquainted with the methods of linear programming of L.V. Kantorovich, classical dynamic models of economics and methods of interindustry balances V.Leontiev, I.S.Bruk developed in INEUM work on the application of mathematical methods and computing equipment to solve economic problems at the state level. <br><br>  The first solution to the task of creating small computers, set by I. S. Brook, was the development of M-3, carried out jointly by the Laboratory of Control Machines and Systems of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and VNIIEM in 1956-57.  M-3 worked with 30-bit binary numbers with a fixed point, had a two-address command format, a memory with a capacity of 2048 numbers on a magnetic drum and a capacity of 30 op / sec.  When working with ferrite memory of the same capacity, the performance of the M-3 increased to 1.5 thousand O / s.  It had a total of 770 electronic lamps and 3 thousand. Of a standard diode and occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3 sq. M.  The main ideas of building the M-3 were formulated by JSBruk, N.Ya.Matyukhin and V.V.Belynsky.  M-3 was intended for design and research institutes and after its acceptance in 1957 by the State Commission under the chairmanship of Academician N. G. Bruyevich was mass-produced at the S. Ordzhonikidze plant in Minsk.  Prior to the start of mass production, three organizations in cooperation on equal footing produced M-3 samples for themselves: the Academician S.P. Korolev Design Bureau, VNIIEM (Acad. AG Iosifyan) and the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian USSR (Acad. S. Mergelyan ), from which the Yerevan Institute of Mathematical Machines later emerged.  Thus, the M-3 served as the prototype for the two industrial series of computers - "Minsk" and "Hrazdan".  The later Minsk-2, Minsk-3 and other machines produced in Belarus and Armenia showed the M-1 and M-3 genes.  The school of control machines of VNIIEM also had its ancestor M-3, which was repeatedly noted by the participants of its development B.M.Kagan, V.M. Dolkart. <br><br>  In the traditions of the school of small computers of I.S. Brook, the development of the Setun machine, produced serially by the Kazan computer plant, was carried out.  The author of the Setun, N.P. Brusentsov, collaborated with I.S. Brook during the creation of the M-2 and developed engineering approaches to the design of small computers that were typical of the I.S. Brooke school.  The Setun machine is interesting because it was based on the ternary number system.  Also of interest is the experience of programming tasks on the Setun machine, which gave an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe approaches to structured programming and interactive mode of operation. <br><br>  In INEUM of the USSR Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Brooke, control machines were created: M-4 (1957‚Äì1960) to solve special problems in the systems of the Radio Engineering Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences (chief designer is M. A. Kartsev);  M-5 (1959-1960) - for solving economic problems, planning and managing the national economy (chief designer - V. V. Belynsky);  M-7-200 and M-7-800 (1966-1969) - for the tasks of managing powerful power units (Konakovskaya State District Power Station, Slavyanskaya State District Power Plant) and technological processes (the main designer is N. N. Lenov). <br><br>  As a director of the institute, I. S. Bruk paid much attention to the needs of a growing institute, creating a healthy, workable team, and nurturing high scientific demands from his students.  After retirement in 1964, Isaak Semenovich remained a scientific consultant and head of the INEUM Scientific and Technical Council.  I.S.  Brooke was an outstanding and very peculiar man.  According to the style of his activity, he was, rather, a lone scientist, a generator of ideas that his pupils and colleagues picked up and implemented.  And he switched his creative energy and talent to something new.  He did not know how to advertise himself and his scientific achievements, so the direction of developing small computers sounded, perhaps, not as loud as the achievements of the creators of the first and second generation superproductive machines. <br><br>  For his merits in the field of national science and technology, I.S.Bruk was awarded four Orders of the Red Banner of Labor and medals of the USSR. <br>  He has published over 100 scientific papers.  A scholar of wide scholarship, a talented inventor and experimenter, he received more than 50 copyright certificates on his inventions, 16 of them - in the last five years of his life, being already in old age. <br><br>  Isaac Brooke died on October 6, 1974, three months after the death of S. A. Lebedev, he was buried in Vvedensky cemetery in Moscow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81389/</a></p>
