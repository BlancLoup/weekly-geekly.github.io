  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DevCon School schools and other good news for the day of knowledge</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear our readers!  One of the most enjoyable activities in life is to learn!  After all, precisely in order to learn throughout life, we choose such areas of knowledge in which everything is constantly changing, isn't it?  Therefore, we are happy to congratulate all our readers with the day of knowledge!  Students, of course, especially ... <br><br>  By the way, about knowledge.  We, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sos/2008/12/10/10-2/">technology evangelists</a> , love to share knowledge, and we do it in different ways.  For example, at conferences like <a href="http://msdevcon.ru/">DevCon</a> .  However, this year we decided to give knowledge more profound and interesting, and to do it periodically, not once a year.  From here was born the <b>DevCon Schools</b> format, which you can read more about under the cut.  By the way, the first such school on cognitive services, chat bots and artificial intelligence will be held <b>on September 11th</b> . <br><br> <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cognitive-School/2016-09"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c6/d17/37b/5c6d1737b5d24da7a715b317b20d61e6.jpg"></a>

      By the way, under the cut there are a few gifts for the day of knowledge and special opportunities for students, so if you like gifts - look in there too! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  DevCon Schools </h2><br>  DevCon Schools are practical events that most resemble a mixture of a master class and a hackathon.  During such events, you will be able to dive deeper into the study of the most modern technologies and "try the code with your hands."  And lectures ... you can see them online? <br><br>  DevCon Schools - this will be a series of events of various formats.  The nearest will take place on September 11-17, and I will tell about it below.  The next school will be in November, and we plan that it will gather more than 500 developers.  But about this - in our next posts. <br><br>  And of course, do not forget that there is still an online learning format!  For example, we recently wrote about the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/305294/">most popular courses at the Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> , and in the coming months we hope to please you with even more interesting projects in the field of online learning! <br><br><h2>  Cognitive school </h2><br>  <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cognitive-School/2016-09">The nearest school</a> will be devoted to cognitive services and artificial intelligence, and it is intended for those who want to learn how to use the entire arsenal of Microsoft services and technologies related to artificial intelligence in one week.  These include: <br><br><ul><li>  Chat bots and Microsoft Bot Framework </li><li>  Cognitive services, i.e.  cloud services for image analysis, natural language, speech, etc. </li><li>  Machine Learning, Azure ML and Neural Networks </li></ul><br>  The school will be held 2 full days on weekends, and 2 days during the week in the evenings.  In the course of the school, you will be asked, in addition to lectures, to do small laboratory work (ie, you need to come with your laptops), as well as a graduation project, the topic of which you can think up on your own.  According to the results of the implementation of the graduation project and laboratory works, the school participants will be issued a certificate of its completion, which you can then be proud of. <br><br>  The event is focused primarily on developers and enthusiasts who want to use the capabilities of artificial intelligence in their applications, but do not yet know how.  We will not go deep into the theoretical aspects of this complex and interesting discipline, but show how in practice modern technologies can be used to solve real problems.  We also invited partners from Mail.ru, Abbyy, Nanosemantics, CleverData to share their experiences and capabilities of their products. <br><br>  The school will be held in our office in Moscow in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKrylatskoye.  Given the practical nature of the school, we can invite only 70 people to it.  Already (before this article was written) we had about 200 participants registered, so for selecting decent and motivated participants we came up with a number of entrance tests (mini-essays and answer questions) that must be completed during <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cognitive-School/2016-09/apply">registration</a> .  We will honestly read all your answers and select those that we liked, and invite these participants to participate in person (letters will be sent around the 7th of September).  If you do not get caught - do not be offended and do not worry, many materials will eventually be available for study online! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some categories of participants can count on guaranteed (or highly prioritized) participation in the school.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Our partners to whom we have already sent out an individual promotional code </li><li>  Lecturers at Moscow State University, Higher School of Economics and some other universities - to participate, you must <a href="http://vk.com/shwars">contact me</a> for a promotional code </li><li>  Teachers who teach the discipline "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning" </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  We look forward to the first school of DevCon and hope that it will be great!  <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cognitive-School/2016-09/apply">Sign up</a> ! <br><br><h2>  Gifts from partners </h2><br>  In fact, besides us, there are many more places where you can learn how to use Microsoft technologies in practice.  For example, training centers " <a href="http://specialist.ru/">Specialist</a> " and " <a href="http://www.academy.ru/">Network Academy Lanit</a> ". <br><br>  In the network academy, you can take one of three courses on the Microsoft Azure cloud - an <a href="http://www.academy.ru/catalog/microsoft/vvedenie-v-azure-dlya-razrabotchikov-.html">introductory course</a> , a <a href="http://www.academy.ru/catalog/microsoft/M20532.html">course for developers</a> or <a href="http://www.academy.ru/catalog/microsoft/M20533.html">for creators of infrastructure solutions</a> - with a 15% discount on the ACADEMY promo code (enter it when ordering on the website).  Based on the results of these courses, you can take the appropriate certification exams. <br><br>  And for the initial acquaintance with the possibilities of the cloud, the course ‚Äú <a href="http://www.specialist.ru/course/m55195a">Introduction to Cloud Computing</a> ‚Äù from the center ‚ÄúSpecialist‚Äù is well suited, for which we have a 10% discount on the promo code CLOUD. <br><br><h2>  To students </h2><br>  As always, with the start of the new school year, we invite the most active students to join the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Student_Partners">Microsoft Student Partner</a> Community (MSP).  Already this month, the most active of our friends are waiting for amazing surprises!  To learn more about the program "first hand", you can chat with the president of the MSP program in Russia, Egor Lyakh - he will be happy to answer your questions on <a href="https://vk.com/lyakhegor">VKontakte</a> or <a href="">by email</a> . <br><br>  To join the program, write us a motivation letter <a href="">by email</a> .  In the letter, indicate what you think Microsoft can do to improve education in Russia, and also what would you personally improve in your high school and how.  According to the results of the letter, we will contact you before mid-September or earlier. <br><br>  At this I say goodbye to you, but not for long.  I wish all readers interesting projects, a good autumn and a wonderful mood! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309012/</a></p>
