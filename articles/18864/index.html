They grow twice as fast as in the West - by 50% per year.  They sell wallpapers and flowers, cameras and frozen meat, discs and books.  No traffic jams, queues to the cashier and heavy bags - just press a few buttons on the computer - will deliver everything.  However, the obvious advantages of distance trading are often negated by even more obvious disadvantages. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>‚ÄúThis form of trade immediately proved itself to be unfair, and people could not refuse goods,</em> ‚Äù said Gennady Onishchenko <em>,</em> head of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare.

      There is no time to go to regular stores, so Natalya and Alexander Babintsev decided to buy the oven on the Internet.  He was brought quickly.  But Natalia and Alexander were happy with the purchase not for long.  <em>‚ÄúThis is at best a beautiful nightstand,</em> ‚Äù said the master, who was called to install the oven.  Enamel inside was in cracks.  <em>‚ÄúA closet for beauty only,</em> ‚Äù sighs Natalia.  Three months called for experts, wrote to the online store, but did not wait for a response.  And then the company disappeared altogether, although, according to Alexander, she successfully sells equipment.  ‚ÄúThe company has several legal entities so that people could not make claims,‚Äù he noted. <br><br>  Online stores save on rent, so they can sell products or equipment with a minimum mark-up.  Hold the goods in the hands can not be brought, is unknown.  And after the first claims the store can even be ‚Äúlost‚Äù. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúSometimes they ask for prepayment - they don‚Äôt have working capital.</em>  <em>There are such companies on the Internet.</em>  <em>Then you can simply not find the end, "</em> - said the general director of the online store Vyacheslav Vavilov. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe response time to the order is such that they can call in a day.</em>  <em>This does not mean that you are deceived, but it speaks about the level of service, ‚Äùsaid</em> Anastasia Modestova, PR director of the online store. <br><br>  Change stale vegetables, return money for torn packaging - few online stores burden themselves with such attention to customers.  Rospotrebnadzor decided to strengthen control over distance trading. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThis form of trade was not regulated at all.</em>  <em>Last year, the State Duma adopted amendments to the law on consumer protection, which introduced clear restrictions on Internet commerce,</em> ‚ÄùGennady Onishchenko emphasized. <br><br>  The seller must tell all about the product, and at the same time provide full information about himself - the real address and full name of the company, so that the buyer does not have to write to a non-existent e-mail later.  If the courier is late or brings the wrong item, the customer can refuse to purchase.  However, you can refuse, even if everything was perfect.  <em>‚ÄúThe client can refuse without giving reasons.</em>  <em>The law on consumer protection is harsh,</em> ‚Äùsaid Vyacheslav Vavilov. <br><br>  The Ministry of Interior will help Rospotrebnadzor to take care of unscrupulous sellers: couriers have no change, the goods in reality turn out to be more expensive than on the website, the store does not get through to the phone.  Internet customers are becoming more demanding and are no longer willing to put up with unreliable service. <br>  <em>According to the source Vesti.ru</em> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18864/</a></p>
