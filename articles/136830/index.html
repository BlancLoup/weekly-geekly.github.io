  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imaginary personalities. How to create your twins for the good</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Thanks to Hollywood blockbusters, we know that people with an upset psyche have many diseases, for example, they can imagine themselves to be someone else and behave accordingly.  A classic example of such a film is ‚ÄúFight Club‚Äù from Fincher, the film was shot with large stitches, in the book Palanik, this story is told more fully and better.  For those who are not familiar with the film or book, I recommend to catch up, but here I will state a brief synopsis. <br>  The main character is tired of everyday life and once he meets a man who shows him a way out of his usual life, this is a fighting club or battles with other yuppies who are also tired of the surrounding reality.  Fights give a taste for life, open up new opportunities, give a new world.  At the end of the film, the hero realizes that all this time he has been two people at the same time, he will recognize this by indirect signs and this is where the picture ends.  And our story begins with this. <br><br>  Unfortunately, mass culture loves stamps, and the history of psychological twins is built on them.  In the mind of an ordinary person, to have a psychological double means to be flawed, and also to have a serious pathology - to hurt in one word.  Balls, which came for the videos, it is not the best diagnosis for any person, so we avoid even the thought that this is possible with us.  And we drive away everything that we consider pathology.  Fortunately, psychological twins are not only negative, they are part of our consciousness, which today has been studied from the point of view of pathology only.  And, probably, this explains how we relate to such a phenomenon and why we often do not put it in our service. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      People invented additional personalities or disguises for their consciousness from time immemorial.  As a rule, they projected a new person outward in order to achieve results in the outside world.  As part of my story, we are not interested in this part of the story, we all try to be better in the eyes of others and achieve this in different ways.  This is part of the life of any person; fortunately, I do not know any exceptions (I have seen posturing and denial of this fact, but the complete lack of a game of disguise is never - the question is how much the person is different from a person). <br>  If the projection of its appearance outside is considered acceptable in society and is not specifically discussed, then it is quite another thing when a person begins to project it onto his consciousness.  This is already interpreted as a sign of mental disorder.  But is it?  Is it possible to create your second self or alter-ego without damaging your consciousness, and what benefits can we derive from this? <br><br>  The answer should be sought in children's games, through which any person passes.  At the age of 3 to 5, imaginary friends appear for the first time in children, they also try on different roles (superhero, princess, cosmonaut, fireman, etc.).  If parents take the roles of their children calmly, then they often see an attempt to talk with imaginary friends as a deviation from the norm.  Child psychologists have eaten more than one dog to explain why this is normal and why this stage is important for the development of a child.  By the way, this is an excellent illustration of what is considered the norm in our society and what is not.  For children, we allow the possibility to play with the imagination of someone else, for ourselves we almost always deny this possibility.  And in vain. <br><br>  I do not pretend to be the ultimate truth, but it seems to me that mass culture and the old man Freud worked to enclose our consciousness in the erroneous concept of ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù perception of consciousness within the framework of one personality with rigidly defined characteristics and characteristics.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Freud, in his work ‚ÄúEerie,‚Äù considers the effect of twins, an exceptional negative interpretation - according to Freud, this is pathology.  Approximately the same views are held by the students of the founder of psychoanalysis, they set quite a sure direction of development of this science.  Is Freud to blame for this, and should we blame him?  I do not think, since he grew up in an environment where there were already well-formed ideas about psychological twins.  One of the brightest novels is "The Strange History of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" by Robert Stevenson, this work appeared in 1886.  In the posthumous letter, the main character, positive Dr. Jekyll, admits that he discovered that there is both a positive and a negative principle in the mind.  Man is a synthesis of two principles, and he was able to separate them.  And so all the crimes done by Mr. Hyde are the crimes of the dark side of Dr. Jekyll‚Äôs personality.  In my opinion, this story is the most vivid reflection of those concepts that existed during the period of romanticism and were picked up by modern mass culture. <br><br>  Dig a little deeper - 17-18 century, the era of romanticism.  For psychological counterparts in German works, the term doppelganger is introduced (in translation this is a banal double - Doppelganger).  It is obvious that this twin of a person appears as an antipode to the already existing image of the guardian angel and carries a negative direction, it has a demonic nature.  Someone says that the doppelganger has a physical essence, someone indicates that this is an aspect of human consciousness.  We can go even further in time, plunge into Celtic legends, which also tells about the twins.  But as part of my story, it was important for me to show that the phenomenon of psychological twins was known for a long time, as well as the fact that an extremely negative attitude towards it was developed in popular culture. <br>  <b>The psychological counterpart in practice - the pros and cons</b> <br>  Meeting with a doppelganger brings death, which can be interpreted as the initial destruction of the personality and the subsequent death of the body.  I think the story of Dr. Jekyll is exactly the same.  The set of moral values ‚Äã‚Äãthat you have may not coincide with your counterpart.  Moving from one state to another, you save the memory of what was done, as a result, a psychological problem arises - fracture.  But often such stories are associated with organic brain lesions, diseases, and the like.  For a healthy person, the creation of temporary psychological twins is a great way to change the limitations that exist in his mind, psychological attitudes, even in the physical abilities of the body.  It sounds like a kind of shamanism, which works fine in practice.  The main thing is not to play this game and control the process.  Below I will give the simplest examples of how psychological twins can be used, although I prefer the term psychological disguises. <br><br>  <u>Sample Routine Work</u> <br>  There are many things in life that we don‚Äôt like to do.  They are not interesting to us, cause boredom and so on.  As a rule, these are routine things.  Making yourself to do them is very hard.  Psychological guise allows you to achieve the implementation of such work, without negative emotions and work from under the stick.  For example, this method is recommended by J√ºrgen Wolf in the book ‚ÄúSchool of Literary Excellence‚Äù, he imagines that he is the superhero ‚ÄúCleaner‚Äù.  When he needs to disassemble the desktop, he enters this image - his hero does not waste time on anything other than disassembling papers.  Having presented this image, J√ºrgen Wolf begins to disassemble his table and as a result spends less time on this action, but most importantly, it does not irritate him. <br><br>  For my taste, this real life example works, but it looks somewhat ridiculous and artificial.  Who among us thinks so picturesque and stereotyped?  Few.  Moreover, the thinking of Wolf, this thinking of a screenwriter writing for Hollywood, doesn‚Äôt suit us as a prototype.  So how to be?  <b>Constructing a psychological disguise</b> <br>  The best material for the design of your face than you yourself can not be found.  You know all your strengths and weaknesses, and also imagine what exactly you do not like to do.  The vast majority of methods related to psychology or success stories, changes in consciousness, talk about how <b>to achieve a permanent change in consciousness</b> .  In my opinion, this is unnecessary for most life situations, since we <b>need a temporary structure that can be used as needed</b> .  Creating a temporary structure does not require such constant effort, maintaining yourself in a certain tone and does not break your psychological attitudes.  This is very important, this is a mild and most important temporary change that is completely under your control. <br>  For example, working with statistics, I was always sad.  A huge amount of numbers, a large number of sheets, only a kind person who I am not can love this kind of work.  Unfortunately, this work requires not only attentiveness and perseverance, but also attempts to find patterns.  How to show creativity if you need to sit for a long time and look at monotonous columns of numbers?  Output in the construction of psychological faces.  My alter ego for such a case is me, with a number of changes.  In particular, I constructed my mind in such a way that I get pleasure from finding similarities or patterns, as well as unusualness in rows of numbers.  Everything that stands out from the general plan gives a surge of emotions, the joy of having found something new.  I took my impressions from the emotions that were caused by an unexpected win in the casino (strong impressions that fit perfectly into any mask), as well as a feeling of completeness at the end of assembling a big puzzle, as a basis for designing.  Two main emotions that are important, as I associate with pleasure, and assembling a puzzle gives the experience that I will end up with moral satisfaction, but for this you need to be assiduous. <br>  Someone does something similar, but resorts to other tricks - it is often called tune in to work.  It is very important to understand that once you create such a psychological persona that relies on your personal experience, you can get it out of the closet at any desired moment.  That is, you will show those traits that you already have, only when you need to.  Regardless of how you feel at the moment, you simply switch to the work that you need and do it qualitatively. <br><br>  From small tricks - having done the work, you need to remember to ‚Äúturn off‚Äù your mask, and return to the normal state.  Someone needs it, someone like me not.  Just a recommendation for every fire case. <br><br>  It is possible that by this time you already had a rejection of "quackery", which I preach.  Then you should not even try to apply it in practice, it still will not work.  Yes, and you do not need it.  If you think that something like this is possible, and you are ready to try, then create a psychological figure of a very simple configuration and see how it works for you.  For each person it is individual.  Do not try to create a complex structure, choose one or two emotions and build on them, create an alter-ego that will help you in solving routine tasks.  Practice a week, another.  I am sure that you will see that it works. <br>  If a large number of people will like this technique, then in the following material I can tell you more about what you can do with constructs and what useful tricks in this area are.  I hope that you were interested in reading this text, and he forced you to think about the psychology of people, to sort out your life experience in memory. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136830/</a></p>
