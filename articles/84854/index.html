My personal opinion is little data.  But what I have, I have.  There will be more respondents - I will correct the statistics. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  First, I will give diagrams (for convenience, one divided into four big ones), where user preferences of different countries (USA, Canada, UK, Russia) are compared. <br><br><img src="http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/7/80565985.png" alt="q1-4">

There were eight groups. <br>  There is one exception, he does not look like 118 others.  Nothing to choose from <br>  especially not affected.  A little more than the rest, he singled out the design, the possibility of return, the availability of reviews, comprehensive information about the products and links to the store from other resources.  This is the first group.  I will number them just for convenience. <br><br>  There are still three people who make up the second group.  There are few people there, so the statistics did not work out.  I will give you the most obvious features of the other groups relative to each other. <br><br>  The largest group of people is the third.  49% of the number of respondents whose preferences it would be good to navigate when creating a popular online store.  For them, there are no completely unimportant characteristics that do not affect their choice of an online store.  Particularly important for them: product variety, graphic design of the site, availability of a search option, availability of organization of products to various parameters, availability of return policy, availability of personal data processing policy, price level, general information about products, information on specific products, possibility to choose payment, the ability to pay after receiving the goods.  Sometimes, the choice is influenced by the following characteristics: the variety of trademarks, the availability of reviews about products on the site, discounts, store references to other resources, and high results in search results.  It can be seen that these people go to the online store often already for a specific product and choose the place of purchase at a general price level, rather than temporary special offers. <br><br>  The fourth group (14.3%) is characterized by increased attention to the variety of goods and lowered attention to shipping discounts and the availability of reviews on the site. <br><br>  Members of the fifth group (9.2%), unlike others, pay special attention to reviews about the store on other sites. <br><br>  The guys from the sixth (12.6) general information about the goods is considered less valuable than <br>  specific.  If you do not touch the characteristics that are unique to the fifth and sixth groups, they are otherwise very similar. <br><br>  The seventh group (5%) considers the policy of personal information processing and <br>  unimportant - the ability to pay after receiving the goods. <br><br>  And the last, eighth group.  This is 6.7%.  For them, discounts on shipping are important (live <br>  far?) and no matter the variety of goods and brands. <br><br>  Characteristics that are very important for almost everyone: availability of search, general and specific information about products, price level and choice of payment methods.  And yet: the design of the store is important for almost everyone, and for more than half of the respondents it is very important;  Availability of search and the possibility of flexible classification is very important for almost everyone. <br><br>  Features least important to almost everyone: personalized processing policy <br>  information, the presence of the store in the first positions in the search results and the presence <br>  mentions it on other resources on the network. <br><br>  I advise you not to take the wording of the questions literally, if suddenly you want <br>  to benefit from the results, here it is possible and necessary to think more widely: great importance, <br>  for example, the presence of a search on the site can also tell about increased attention <br>  users to the convenience of the search form, the need for deep study. <br><br>  Between the chosen characteristics, directly proportional relationships (correlations) were found.  It can be said that the relation to one parameter in certain cases is similar to the relation to another.  The most obvious relationship between the variety of brands and products.  It can be said that for people who choose one or the other, the very concept of diversity in general is important.  Respondents in most cases noted (or did not mark) both items together.  There is still a significant connection between: product discounts and delivery discounts (that is, people often like or dislike discounts in general), personal information processing policies and return policies (I can assume here that these points determine the trust of users of the store, therefore related), the presence of references to the store on other resources and its positions in the search results (the propensity or inclination of users to a comprehensive analysis of the reputation and competitive environment).  There are other, less pronounced dependencies. <br><br>  I was interested to look at the collected data in these sections.  If you would like to know or see something, let me know and I will add information to the post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84854/</a></p>
