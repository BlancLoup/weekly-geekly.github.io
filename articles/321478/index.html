Seth Godin on professional skills, requirements for employees and their training. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAre you a good employee?  Or let's start with a simpler question.  Was Ty Cobb a good baseball player? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/830/a15/ddf/830a15ddf1124ffea0ee4ef75fae6939.jpg"></div><br>  In general and in general, it is believed that as a person he was not sugar.  The team did not like him.  However, this did not prevent him from entering the Hall of Fame.  And all because in baseball everything is calculated - hits, wounds, caught balls.

      Do you have a job?  Most likely it's not that simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are company pillars among your employees who are not afraid to take responsibility when it takes a serious turn.  Also, among others, there are ‚Äúlinks‚Äù, people with interesting ideas / fresh eyes, those who never despair.  The specialists who work for you in an organization cannot be assessed on any single linear scale, because you do not play baseball.  You control, invent, lead, encourage, support, engage in bureaucracy and generally do what is necessary on the little things. <br><br>  But still‚Ä¶ <br><br>  And yet we persevere in recruiting and training people as if we are a baseball team.  It‚Äôs as if only skills that are easily identified are important. <br><br>  Why seemingly successful organizations fail?  Why are investments running low, innovations slowing down, customers leaving? <br><br>  No one argues that some narrowly focused skills are needed.  Hiring programmers who do not know how to program, sales people who do not know how to sell, and architects who do not know how to design is the shortest way to failure.  Such skills (let's call them professional) have long become the main criterion in the selection of candidates. <br><br>  But how can we explain the fact that similar enterprises with approximately the same level of professional training of employees come to different results? <br><br>  By incorrectly defining professional skills and giving them too much attention as supposedly necessary, we devalue those skills that are truly important.  In textbooks and tests, which are taught in business schools, we are talking exclusively about professional skills, everything that needs to be learned for a tick. <br><br>  We treat other skills without due respect, defining them as ‚Äúsoft‚Äù skills and thus transferring them to the category of non-binding ones. <br><br>  Meanwhile, as it turns out, the difference between prosperous and companies and companies that barely keep afloat is precisely in these indefinable qualities, processes and relationships that the people working in them bring. <br><br>  Culture is more important than strategy - this rule always works. <br><br>  But still‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Organizations take the time to assess their skills, simply because.  Because the process worked out over the last century.  And most importantly - because there is no risk.  Nothing personal, just business. <br><br>  How to measure print speed, we know.  But measuring commitment or loyalty is much more difficult.  The feedback on professional quality is provided in companies daily, and everything else is affected only in annual reports, if at all. <br><br>  Employees are often hired and fired, guided by the results of their professional activities, but to get rid of a pessimist, a bully or a bummer (if they are good at something that is easy to measure), you need almost a special order from the Board of Directors. <br><br><h3>  Theft </h3><br>  If someone from your employees would take out a new laptop from work every day, you would have at least fired him, or even told the police.  With an accountant who assigns a portion of the funds each month, you would do the same. <br><br>  But when an employee demotivates the whole team, tearing down a project, or not doing his part of the work, or surviving from the place of future stars of the company - often we just shrug our shoulders and say: well, he has the same experience and professional skills, and everything is not so bad . <br><br>  Meanwhile, they rob us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/608/661/3a4/6086613a4a7346ef8f03af33ed418564.jpg"><br><br><h3>  What can you teach? </h3><br>  Along the way, we made sure that professional skills can be taught (we are not born with knowledge of how to design or write texts, or even engage in graphic design - which means that all this can be learned).  But we do not make the same demands to ourselves when it comes to making decisions, being active, coping with fears, speaking with confidence, working in a team, seeing the true state of things, speaking cleanly, inspiring others, doing more than they ask to be partial and not afraid of change. <br><br>  We refuse to invest in the development of these qualities for fear that they are innate and cannot be learned.  We call them "soft" skills to make it easier to switch to something more vital. <br><br>  We seldom hire those who possess such skills, because we have inspired ourselves that only professional skills that are easy to measure can claim objectivity.  And we are reluctant to dismiss or send for advanced training those who lack some personal qualities - we are worried that we are oppressing someone, accused of being subjective or wasting time. <br><br>  This is complete nonsense: after all, babies do not have any "soft" skills.  Of course, they learn.  They learn randomly, imitating others, through the experience of their own clashes with teachers, parents, bosses, and the world at large.  The fact that they are difficult to measure does not mean that one cannot train, improve or change in this area.  Even as you can. <br><br>  Let's call them true skills, not ‚Äúsoft.‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, you can define them as interpersonal skills, leadership, charisma, diligence, contribution to the common cause.  But all these definitions, although they reflect the essence, but at the same time separate the qualities in question from professional skills.  Those skills that decide whether we hire a person to work and whether he deserves a diploma. <br><br>  So let's call them true skills, even if it hurts us. <br><br>  They are true, because they work, because we need them most of all today.  Because from professional qualities there is no sense if they are not accompanied by human ones - all that cannot be listed or computerized. <br><br>  Of course, true skills cannot be replaced by professional ones, but they can enhance everything that gives a ‚Äúmeasurable‚Äù result. <br><br>  Imagine an employee with a standard set of skills: productivity, knowledge of the specialty, experience.  And with a resume that confirms the presence of all this. <br><br>  Nothing special, right?  This is a required minimum. <br><br>  And now add to this even insight, charisma, perseverance, the ability to set goals and inspire and motivate.  As well as the ability to listen and patience. <br><br>  If such a person joins your team, how will that affect her? <br><br><h3>  Front of works </h3><br>  In his article in Harvard Business Review, Lou Solomon reports that 69% of managers experience discomfort when communicating with subordinates.  The only thing surprising here is that the figure is not higher. <br><br>  Can we say that we are building organizations around people, if we accept as a rule the fact that two-thirds of our managers (most likely highly qualified specialists with a good stake, on whom the success of our enterprise is based) have such difficulties with performing one of the most basic duties? <br><br>  The Graduate Management Admission Council (the very guys who are responsible for the GMAT exam) recently conducted a survey, which revealed that specialists with a master's degree show themselves well in terms of analytical skills, quantitative analysis and information gathering, but they are not competent enough in other critical areas - strategic thinking, speaking and writing skills, leadership skills, flexibility. <br><br>  Are these mutually exclusive skills?  Do we have to choose? <br><br><h3>  Encyclopedia of true skills </h3><br>  The mere fact that there is no generally accepted list of true skills shows how little an organization is making to discover, hone and develop similar skills in their team. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/476/7a6/db74767a6c2d4c60b4b52a8d3c9dadc3.jpg" width="350"></div><br>  In this draft, we have identified five major categories of skills and provided examples for each.  This is not an exhaustive list, but rather an initial version to make the discussion more substantive and convince managers to invest more resources in these areas. <br><br>  Categories may include: <br><br>  <b>Self control</b> <br><br>  Are you able to work hard on what you put in priority, not allowing yourself to be distracted or give in to bad habits?  Self-control helps redefine itself here and now for long-term goals. <br><br>  <b>Productivity</b> <br><br>  Do you have a good knowledge of the tools you use in your work?  Do you know how to make your thoughts and your dedication bring real benefits to the cause?  Productivity is needed for tasks not related to your specialization. <br><br>  <b>Wisdom</b> <br><br>  Have you learned something that you don‚Äôt learn from a textbook or manual?  There is only one way to grow up - by gaining experience. <br><br>  <b>Insight</b> <br><br>  Do you have enough experience and practice to see the world in a clear light?  Insight is the ability to notice, without waiting for others to show you. <br><br>  <b>Ability to influence people</b> <br><br>  Have you developed the qualities you need to motivate others to act?  Charisma is just one example of such skills. <br><br><h4>  Self control </h4><br><ul><li>  Susceptibility to criticism </li><li>  Endurance on long distances </li><li>  Harmony </li><li>  Flexibility </li><li>  Willingness and ability to quickly start and end the process </li><li>  Good faith in fulfilling promises </li><li>  Friendliness </li><li>  Desire to move forward </li><li>  Desire to learn and teach </li><li>  Interest in working with a client </li><li>  Sincerity and solid character </li><li>  Resourcefulness </li><li>  Teamwork orientation </li><li>  Quick wit in the face of unexpected obstacles </li><li>  Risk appetite </li><li>  Ability to adapt to changing requirements </li><li>  The ability to easily recover from failures </li><li>  Empathy </li><li>  Desire to grow above oneself </li><li>  Persistence </li><li>  Traction competition </li><li>  Passion </li><li>  Self-confidence </li><li>  Ability to understand other people's emotions </li><li>  Ability to look at oneself </li><li>  The ability to put the interests of the company above the immediate benefits </li><li>  Stress management </li><li>  Negotiation skills </li><li>  Resistance to change and uncertainty </li><li>  Good manners </li><li>  Purposefulness </li><li>  Honesty </li><li>  Sense of humor </li><li>  Enthusiasm at work </li><li>  Ethical behavior, including without witnesses </li></ul><br><h4>  Productivity </h4><br><ul><li>  Attention to detail </li><li>  Possession of "lean" technicians </li><li>  Innovative problem solving techniques </li><li>  Management Art </li><li>  Thinking entrepreneur and presence of mind </li><li>  Skill set goals </li><li>  Information Search Skills </li><li>  Thinking outside the box </li><li>  Proper organization of meetings </li><li>  Project planning </li><li>  Problem solving </li><li>  Diligence </li><li>  Ability to act in a critical situation </li><li>  The ability to delegate authority for greater efficiency. </li><li>  Ability to maintain a lively discussion </li><li>  Listening skills </li><li>  Ability to be controlled with equipment </li><li>  Ability to plan time </li><li>  Problem solving skills as they arise </li><li>  Efficiency in decision making </li></ul><br><h4>  Wisdom </h4><br><ul><li>  The look of the artist and good taste </li><li>  Diplomacy in difficult situations </li><li>  Knowledge of other cultures </li><li>  Creativity in overcoming difficulties </li><li>  Critical thinking instead of passive acceptance </li><li>  Communication skills </li><li>  Understanding how to resolve conflicts </li><li>  Ability to train other people </li><li>  Confidence in managing people </li><li>  The ability to communicate with difficult people </li><li>  Empathy for customers, colleagues and suppliers </li></ul><br><h4>  Insight </h4><br><ul><li>  Design thinking </li><li>  Strategic thinking </li><li>  Skill mapping </li><li>  The ability to assess people and situations </li><li>  Sense of style </li></ul><br><h4>  Ability to influence people </h4><br><ul><li>  Influence </li><li>  Leader Skills </li><li>  Presentation Skills </li><li>  Public speaking skills </li><li>  Team building skills </li><li>  Reframing </li><li>  The ability to give feedback without personal evaluation </li><li>  Ability to inspire others </li><li>  Ability to show clear and useful criticisms </li><li>  Ability to build connections </li><li>  The ability to defend what is important </li><li>  Ability to resolve conflicts </li><li>  Interpersonal skills </li><li>  Negotiation skills </li><li>  Ability to convince </li><li>  Selling skills </li><li>  Ability to tell </li><li>  Ability to use talents </li><li>  The ability to write affective texts </li><li>  Charisma and ability to influence people </li><li>  Sign language (both understanding and ability to apply) </li><li>  Clarity of presentation and vision " </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321478/</a></p>
