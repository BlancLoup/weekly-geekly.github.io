Today we took part in the opening of the All-Russian Engineering Festival, which organizes a serious technical university of Kazan, under the cut of photos and a story about the exhibition of the Festival. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1e/cf5/518/c1ecf551836042829c692fdb4ed27d2c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Engineering Festival is a series of events from September 2, 2014 to April 30, 2015, united for the consistent promotion of engineering professions among schoolchildren and their mentors: teachers, parents.  This year it is planned to hold everything mainly on the basis of the Republic of Tatarstan, and then expand the movement throughout Russia. <br><br>  Schedule and list of events of the Engineering Festival in the form of a simple infographic.  In the fall. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/004/fcf/495/004fcf495f2c4800ae1f70aee52108a5.png"><br>  In the winter of 2014/2015. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/1ce/178/09e1ce17874d40a2aa32432a7c2e0f5d.png"><br>  And in the spring of 2015. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/cab/1a7/5abcab1a7b9f45fe826ad5692fb3612d.png"><br><br>  At the same time, the German-Russian Institute of New Technologies (GRINT) KNRTU-KAI officially opened at KAI with the forces of the Deputy Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation Alexander Povalko and the German Ambassador to the Russian Federation R√ºdiger von Fritsch (no <i>sanctions? Not heard</i> ).  The members of the crew of the 40th expedition welcomed the greeting from the ISS via video link (or was it recorded? I don‚Äôt know).

      The university organizer of the Engineering Festival, which I shortly call KAI, is the former Kazan Aviation Institute.  A.N.  Tupolev, and now <a href="http://www.kai.ru/">Kazan National Research Technical University.</a>  <a href="http://www.kai.ru/">A.N.</a>  <a href="http://www.kai.ru/">Tupolev</a> . <br>  Our self-assembled copter with KAI flag. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df5/335/95d/df533595df5c49bbba025e77359736fc.JPG"><br><br>  Next will be a description of the exhibition of the festival.  Attention, the exhibition of children, school!  Almost everything is done in schools, at schools and by the forces of schoolchildren.  Moreover, these are mostly not large cities, such as Kazan or Naberezhnye Chelny, but small ones.  And not a city at all.  This is mainly the work of children from areas of Tatarstan, from small towns and villages. <br>  Here are the children hanging aeromodels before the exhibition. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/6bc/2a8/9e46bc2a87284410be0d93c9bc3fda51.JPG"><br><br>  One of the most interesting exhibits is the exhibition of the <a href="https://vk.com/science_house">House of Entertaining Science and Technology</a> .  In Kazan, in the building of the old cinema, a completely private engineering show-park was opened for children and adults, which is now functioning quite successfully. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f89/0f2/7a8/f890f27a8d1b421fbd21270185be3250.JPG"><br>  Chair for experiments with nails <s>and booty</s> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/4a6/197/81f4a6197a014149905d1ec84c6630bb.JPG"><br>  Experimenter.  Judging by the queue to the chair, there were plenty of people who wanted to tickle their <s>buttocks</s> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ab/56b/8eb/0ab56b8eb45c4a898a8dc4de7be40f61.JPG"><br>  Air cannon.  Even two.  Shoot air and smoke rings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/28c/99c/49528c99c6b14a0ebb86e93fc2a04bb3.JPG"><br>  The same guns in the work: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGrD9fAV8lY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhP8bwhp6bc88G55dRhx5ZGJeYOjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The guys on the video so enthusiastically beat at the guns, because they portray the anti-aircraft complex.  Alexander just launched one of their Copters, and the anti-aircraft gunners tried to get into it with smoke rings. <br>  Of course, Lego, where without him.  In Tatarstan, each school has one robot class, if not more.  I envy the manufacturer, I want our designers to disperse in the same way. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a35/672/a71/a35672a7183c45a7a1cf4a9f334ad70c.JPG"><br>  There were all sorts of modellers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae0/f9d/f03/ae0f9df03ca44aa79ebf20e55c526b8d.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06a/841/933/06a8419331bc4341a7cf6f9021ea674f.JPG"><br>  Kulibin with homemade machines <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/90f/c34/14d90fc346dc47509d5845d968d59a99.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/0fa/a81/8100faa8164347089dd99d32fae4663c.JPG"><br>  And quite adult toys.  By the way, completely working, at the last event from KAI there were races for them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c9/b78/f21/7c9b78f216ff4ed3b6875c4a9ee05813.JPG"><br>  Gently turn to our exposure.  The guys who collected their printers on our school <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/navigatorcampus/blog/227145/">makerton</a> , also came with their printers and works. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92d/06e/ba5/92d06eba54be4d9f959cd7af8d4f09ba.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/b1d/b53/2a0b1db531d844b18d36d1b14f5f222a.JPG"><br>  The photographs above are simple works, models for which are taken from the Internet.  I want to draw attention to these guys, who model and print parts for their designs on a 3D printer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77f/275/5ac/77f2755ac15f4cd8b5ddfb77260e9e07.JPG"><br>  Here they have a well model, if I'm not mistaken.  Hehe, and here Crimea. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/722/b9b/020/722b9b020f1c4c9787d1073247a4815f.JPG"><br>  And an electric spinning wheel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/431/522/7bf/4315227bfc6149688f0a99d893f36065.JPG"><br>  A piece of plastic? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8a/52e/e9d/e8a52ee9d40946cd852feb589f306dfc.JPG"><br>  No, this is Tesla! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ef/f79/a2d/1eff79a2dfa245f4b461cff6b6da4efc.JPG"><br>  Vika and her Technoclass helps to open her own circle of technical creativity in our franchise in any city in Russia. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/f3f/de1/86df3fde17b24a4685b00e5eaa595a70.JPG"><br>  Technoclass is only for those enthusiasts who besides the love of children and technical creativity can pull the creation of their business.  And the problem of many such circles is that they do not stand for more than a year.  We made a format when a debit with a loan converges and now we can open a TechnoClass with you with a franchise with a set of training programs, various equipment, the right certificates, teacher training and an internal social network. <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/microchasti">Microparty</a> - the development of one of our residents, will also be included in the Technoclass. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efb/351/afa/efb351afadd94d898eecb0dd63288a0d.JPG"><br>  IRON 3D printer, also our resident.  Together with them, we have already sold more than two hundred printers this year and on the new makertons from October, the participants will be already assembling our IRON printers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/4f3/cbc/6ce4f3cbc580420388396c04372da951.JPG"><br>  Our geography of presence.  Made a couple of hours before the festival on the laser cutting machine and arduine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a9/2c0/982/3a92c098297f4f978b4cd2114aa0022d.JPG"><br>  Alexander robicom.pro and his copters (not everything, of course). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/c2f/971/1a2c2f971a654515be53e519a494839c.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/f11/fa0/b01f11fa05bf421fbae96dd335df12ca.JPG"><br>  99% of the first starts of the copters end with broken screws, so you need to learn.  For example, here on such a simulator (sorry for the light), I have already broken 100+ copters.  By the way, I assembled the middle quadcopter in the top picture with my own hands at the Copter Academy in our haxseys. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/531/d53/623/531d53623406475f88e8b8cd1175e905.JPG"><br>  Now we are working on how to massively learn how to work with school students' copters, so that they break a little and learn quickly.  How will that tell - we will write. <br>  In general, the level of technical provision of schools now is excellent, even in distant villages and villages, at least in Tatarstan, although I think this statement is true for all of Russia.  It remains, perhaps, to reduce the load on the USE for children and free up some time for work.  I hope that students who are engaged in schoolchildren and students will find a lot of writing for thought in this post.
