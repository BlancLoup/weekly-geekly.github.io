  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of one bug or how I zip password</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is the story of personal experience, the experience of finding a bug in someone else's, old, unsupported code. <br>  It all started as usual, I had a simple at first glance task: to make packing files in the current folder in a <em>ZIP</em> archive with a certain password in <em>C ++ / Qt</em> , it would seem that it could be easier? <br>  Naturally, the first assistant is <em>Google</em> , he suggested that there are two <em>Qt</em> libraries for working with <em>ZIP</em> archives: <br>  <a href="http://quazip.sourceforge.net/">QuaZIP</a> and <a href="http://osdab.42cows.org/snippets/zip.php%3Fmode%3Dadvanced">OSDab ZIP</a> , among other things, <em>Qt</em> itself supports <em>qCompress</em> and <em>qDecompress methods</em> for packaging. <br>  I found out that the methods suit me a little, because they can only compress the stream, all the headers and encryption on the developer‚Äôs conscience.  This path was too long and I immediately refused it and turned my attention to the libraries. <br>  <em>The OSDaB ZIP</em> had to be dropped immediately, despite the fact that it is a great library, its code is distributed only under the <em>GPL license</em> , I also had to build in the functionality of the proprietary application.  Fortunately, <em>QuaZIP</em> ended up with two <em>GPL</em> and <em>LGPL licenses</em> .  I stopped at it.  Especially without delving into his device, I sketched the simplest class to work with him and began to test. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is where the problems started: the archive was perfectly created and encrypted by this library, it also unpacked it well, but bad luck: any other archiver refused to recognize the correct password, saying that it was not true.  First, the decompression algorithm was checked by me, I thought this way: if the error is symmetrical, then I will not be able to decompress the file created and password-protected by another archiver, however, the library coped with it perfectly.  It became obvious that the problem is only in the encryption algorithm, but how to find it? <br><br>  To begin with, I studied the code, comments to the code, and information about the author.  I learned that the <em>QuaZIP</em> classes <em>themselves</em> are a <em>Qt</em> wrapper over the <a href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html">MiniZip</a> library written in pure C. Quickly making sure that the QuaZIP wrapper has nothing to do with the error, I began to learn the MiniZip code.  At first glance, everything worked perfectly.  And so I decided to go back to Google with the question, as well as to the <a href="http://www.winimage.info/forum/viewforum.php%3Ff%3D9">site of the developer of</a> this library itself.  there I found two unreported bug reports with the same question that I had, dated 2007.

      <strong>Frustratingly.</strong> <br><br>  Well, I set about studying the problem.  The first file on which the suspicion fell was, of course, the <strong>crypt.h</strong> file, in which the encryption algorithm itself was implemented. <br>  I found out that this file is slightly adapted and copied under the BSD license <strong>crypt.h</strong> file from the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">Info-ZIP</a> software package (this is the same zip / unzip any Linux system has), visually comparing the files did not show significant differences and errors. <br><br>  Then I picked up the description of the <a href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">ZIP format on the PKWARE website</a> , <a href="http://utils.kde.org/projects/okteta/">Okteta's</a> favorite <a href="http://utils.kde.org/projects/okteta/">,</a> and creating an archive using the library, as well as a similar one using a standard <em>ZIP</em> , began to compare them. <br>  The picture was very interesting, here it is: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://dl.yarlug.org/misc/quazip/okteta1.png"></a> <br><br>  The encrypted ZIP file has a fairly simple structure: <br>  The entire file is divided into two sections, a section with the content itself and a section called the <em>Central header</em> . <br>  <em>The</em> central <em>header</em> contains information about files, their size, creation date, file attributes, etc., this is necessary so that the program-archiver can quickly read information about the contents and display to the user without analyzing the entire archive file. <br>  The file section is built like this: <br><blockquote>  [local file header 1] <br>  [12 bytes encrypt header 1] <br>  [file data 1] <br>  [data descriptor 1] <br>  . <br>  . <br>  . <br>  [local file header n] <br>  [12 bytes encrypt header n] <br>  [file data n] <br>  [data descriptor n] </blockquote><br><br>  It is interesting to look at the local file header: <br><blockquote>  local file header signature 4 bytes (0x04034b50) <br>  version needed to extract 2 bytes <br>  general purpose bit flag 2 bytes <br>  compression method 2 bytes <br>  last mod file time 2 bytes <br>  last mod file date 2 bytes <br>  crc-32 4 bytes <br>  compressed size 4 bytes <br>  uncompressed size 4 bytes <br>  file name length 2 bytes <br>  extra field length 2 bytes <br>  file name (variable size) <br>  extra field (variable size) </blockquote><br>  It should also be noted that any header block starts with 4 "magic" bytes "PK ..", where the last two bytes change depending on which block has started. <br><br>  So, as can be seen from the screenshot, the discrepancy with the original is only one, and in order to achieve full compliance, I corrected the flag bit. <br><br>  And I went to look further, naturally, the 12-byte crypto header will always be different, because when it is generated, a random number generator is used.  The file contents matched in length - this is a good sign, but the <em>data descriptor was</em> completely absent from the file generated by the library.  I decided to add it.  As it turned out, it was not necessary at all. <br><br>  As a result, the files became absolutely identical in everything regarding header fields and other supporting information. <br><br>  To check the algorithm, I decided to remove the random and replace it with a static value in the library and in the <em>Info-Zip</em> program set, compile both programs and create archives with them, let these archives be guaranteed not working, but they should look identical if the algorithms match. <br><br>  Replacing string <br><pre><code class="cpp hljs">c = (rand() &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">7</span></span>) &amp; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xff</span></span>;</code> </pre> <br>  In the <strong>crypt.h</strong> file and in the one and the other program, I received two new archives created in a similar way and began to investigate them in Okteta <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://dl.yarlug.org/misc/quazip/okteta2.png"></a> <br><br>  It can be seen that the files again turned out completely different, but they had a new common part - the first 10 bytes after the local header.  Those.  10 of the 12 bytes of the cryptographic title matched, but two did not. <br>  We look at the contents of <strong>crypt.h</strong> and see that the last two bytes are generated in a special way with the help of a certain key <strong>crcForCrypting</strong> . <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> buf[n++] = zencode(pkeys, pcrc_32_tab, (<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span>)(crcForCrypting &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">16</span></span>) &amp; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xff</span></span>, t); buf[n++] = zencode(pkeys, pcrc_32_tab, (<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span>)(crcForCrypting &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">24</span></span>) &amp; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xff</span></span>, t);</code> </pre> <br>  OK, substituting the hard-coded <strong>crcForCrypting</strong> in both programs, I saw that the files matched <strong>(!)</strong> , That is, they completely matched, as if they were the same file. <br>  Feeling that the truth is somewhere nearby, I decided to study how does the value of the variable <strong>crcForCrypting come out</strong> ?  And I found out that in <em>Info-ZIP</em> this variable is obtained by shifting left by 16 bits of file creation time, while in <em>MiniZIP</em> this variable always turned out to be zero. <br><br>  This turned out to be a solution.  Having added the necessary code to populate this variable and, not forgetting to return the random to the site, I again generated the archive using the library, and it was successfully unpacked into <em>ark</em> . <br><br>  In conclusion, I will say that I wrote off with the author <em>QuaZIP</em> in the process of digging, he, by the way, is our compatriot, but unfortunately I could not help me.  However, after completing my research, he accepted the patch and promised to release a new version of <em>QuaZIP</em> in the near future. <br>  For the time being, there is no QuaZIP update, I attach it to the <a href="">diff</a> article with a patch for the current version. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100200/</a></p>
