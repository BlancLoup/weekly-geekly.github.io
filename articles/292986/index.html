  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotions: the first serious experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> My first investment experience happened at school, we already had dial-up, and after a while the first companies offering to trade on Forex.  At that time, the attitude to all this trade was purely playful - I made deals without much analysis, using the simplest indicators of the levels on the price chart.  Years later, I came "adult exchange". <br><br>  After a few months of playing on currencies, I noticed that the schedule regularly ‚Äúslows down‚Äù, and applications for selling or buying currencies are executed with a delay and are always not in my favor.  Having understood the question, I learned that most of the companies that associate themselves with Forex do not actually conduct operations in the real market and, at best, accept bets on currency exchange rates in the same market.  Having played enough, I tied up. <br><br>  I have nothing to do with finance, and therefore only in 2014 I returned to trade, began to read articles and books on this topic.  My interest was dictated by the desire to learn not only to save money, but also to protect them from inflation and many other scary words.

      Very soon I learned that in reality everything is not so difficult, and the amount of basic knowledge necessary for the rational management of personal money is small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/624/35c/411/62435c4115884fa29390e6682e4da1a2.jpg" width="700"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are two ways to invest in securities: you can come to a specialized company, choose a portfolio (a set of different stocks, bonds and derivatives) for a certain amount of money and, having signed a contract with the company, transfer the necessary amount of money. <br><br>  The second way is to conclude an agreement with a broker to trade on the market in person.  To do this, you will have to open your personal investment account, replenish it with money, install a trading terminal. <br><br>  In the first case, simply invest in a fixed product.  The company has already considered the possible risks and decided on the type of securities, based on their profitability.  Most often, such investments are clearly limited in time. <br>  The positive side: in many products the maximum possible loss is fixed. <br><br>  In the second case, additional risks are borne by us - we ourselves must understand how much the shares actually cost and at what price they are now sold on the stock exchange, whether their value will increase after a while, how much and when the dividend will be paid. <br>  The positive side: at any time you can withdraw money, independently choose the composition of the portfolio of all available securities. <br><br>  I decided to access the stock exchange and make my first securities transactions myself.  To do this, I chose a broker for several weeks - a company with a specialized license needed to make deals in the markets and provide access to the stock exchanges to my clients. <br><br>  The selection process was delayed, because there are a lot of offers on the market and each of them causes different concerns, and I was in no hurry to trust any strange companies. <br><br>  First of all, I came across the <a href="http://www.alfacapital.ru/individual/">Alfa Capital</a> management company, since I was already a client of Alfa Bank.  I will briefly tell you about the options for working with Alpha, as they are typical of most banks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a45/163/710/a451637104844ac495cb0ec787d669c9.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  <b>Mutual funds</b> - a ready investment tool in the stock market.  The entry threshold is from 5 thousand rubles, but you can invest only for a fixed time, from 6 months. <br><br>  <b>Alpha Profit</b> is actually a finished product with 100% capital protection. <br>  The minimum investment amount is 50 thousand rubles.  The minimum investment period is 3 years. <br><br>  <b>Structural products</b> - a group of finished products, one of the instruments of which are derivative financial instruments, such as futures, forwards, options, etc. Here I also cannot touch the exchange and transactions, and the instruments themselves are too complicated for me now. <br><br>  <b>Trust management</b> - the broker will do all the transactions for me.  Entry threshold of 15 million rubles.  When I become super busy and rich, I will definitely return to this service. <br><br>  <b>Individual solutions</b> are strategies implemented exclusively for the needs of a unique client.  Interesting, but the threshold of entry from 50 million rubles. <br><br>  Pension <b>management</b> - in short, you can transfer your pension from the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation to the Alfa Capital Special Fund, this will be another time. <br><br>  Walking through this wonderful list of offers from a well-known investment company, I did not find a suitable offer for me, but I was able to formulate a brief set of conditions for myself: <br><br>  - Ability to trade independently. <br>  - The minimum entry threshold is 30 thousand rubles. <br>  - Minimum commission for service and transactions. <br>  - The ability to withdraw your money at any time. <br>  - Trade only your own money, without a loan (leverage). <br><br>  Realizing this list, I began the search for a broker who will be my guide to the stock exchange, in fact, a provider. <br><br>  The second company was <a href="http://bcs.ru/">BCS</a> .  They have a lot of advertising, in which they often declare themselves as the market leader.  I looked through their conditions and found a suitable option for myself - the company is ready to provide access to the exchange, it arranged a minimum amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6d/49e/196/b6d49e19622c4ec1a82700c81eb7f080.png" width="400"><br><br>  <i>The first thing I encountered in BCS was a huge package of documents of several dozen pages in small print that needed to be signed in order to get started.</i> <br><br>  I never sign documents without looking, and nobody warned me about their number in advance, so I was stuck on studying papers for more than half an hour. <br><br>  <i>Second: the service itself.</i>  <i>At first, I had to wait a long time for the manager at his empty table, and in parallel with working with me, he solved some difficult situation with another client.</i> <br><br>  When signing the contract, I was asked for the details of my regular account for withdrawing money to him if necessary.  I do not like to produce a million accounts, so as not to encounter various related expenses, such as a fee for maintaining an account, so I provided the details of an existing account with another bank. <br><br>  After signing, I was asked to proceed to the cashier in order to make the minimum amount for opening an account - 30 thousand rubles, but since the paperwork and the manager‚Äôs wait took more than an hour, the lunch break expired, I had to return to work and I decided to deposit money on another day. <br><br>  After a couple of days, I went to the office again at lunchtime, this time without an appointment, because last time she had no influence and I still had to wait for the manager.  And what do you think?  Of the two cash desks, only one works, the cashier is not there, so I was asked to wait.  After 10 minutes, a lovely woman came, from which she smelled very temptingly of borsch, and invited me to the cashier. <br><br>  <i>When I tried to deposit cash in a cash office, I found out a surprising thing - it is impossible to deposit money directly into an investment account in BCS, for this you first need to open a regular ruble account of an individual.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  I went back to the manager, filled out a bunch of papers again.  I was already in the BCS customer base, so this time I just signed attachments to the contract.  Back to the cashier;  contributed money by spending another lunch;  went to the office. <br><br>  A few days later I logged in to the personal account of BCS-Bank in order to transfer money from a regular account to an investment account.  I made a transfer using the details specified in one of the million annexes to the agreement.  And the money "fell into my brokerage account." <br><br>  <b>Choosing a trading platform</b> <br><br>  And here the most interesting thing began - an attempt to understand how exactly to make the first deal.  There are no clear instructions from BCS.  With other brokers, everything is also difficult, usually it all comes down to the offer to call the hotline and receive instructions there. <br><br>  It was possible to find out that BCS supports two trading platforms: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaTrader">MetaTrader</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIK">QUIK</a> .  Supported operating systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95f/40b/848/95f40b848f19460d875112f8dd4adc8a.png" width="400"><br><br>  There are no working exchange terminals for iMac.  Gorgeous.  If you have an iMac at work and you have a MacBook at home, you have nothing to do in the stock market.  I didn‚Äôt stop it either, I had to install a virtual machine, and QUIK on it.  I made a choice in his favor because I had been familiar with MetaTrader since the days of Forex, and, according to reviews in brokerage forums, ‚Äúprofessionals are at QUIK‚Äù, so it‚Äôs better to immediately learn from it than retraining. <br><br>  <b>We trade in QUIK</b> <br><br>  QUIK guys is something.  When I first saw it, the interface brought me into a stupor, and when the aftertaste was over, I wanted to pull my eyes out to never see this hell again.  In the blue window on the bottom right - the text of the news.  News, Karl! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef7/995/732/ef7995732eff40b599c03bc85ab5a962.png" width="800"><br>  QUIK.  News interface <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a2/696/5c6/8a26965c6f404e41b7e2f9eb66ac7f81.png" width="300"><br>  The best way to inspire a newbie is to ask him a million incomprehensible questions just before launching the trading platform. <br><br>  <b>QUIK</b> is so poor software that it is not even able to remember your login after restarting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/30a/7d3/b8830a7d3f614e7582cbb088fad5dc87.png" width="700"><br><br>  <b>QUIK</b> is the only program in my life where at the time of entry you need to specify your last name and first name in Cyrillic with spaces.  While in the entrance window you are asked to enter ‚ÄúYour Name‚Äù, and the password, by the way, is in Latin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/6e8/fff/8426e8fffc3d450083eda403c51ae02f.png" height="700"><br>  QUIK.  Just a context menu. <br><br>  QUIK is one of the few programs that I cannot log in from the first time, even after half a year of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9c/813/15e/c9c81315eb414acd9800a1e9fbee66a8.png" width="700"><br>  After successful authorization, QUIK continues to delight - the product philosophy implies a huge number of interface settings.  Up to the position of the windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/038/0da/5a2/0380da5a2cea488c879d5da39b172891.png" width="700"><br>  QUIK.  Transaction interface <br><br>  By the way, in the ‚ÄúTrading Account‚Äù field, you must specify one of your trading accounts, but each time after restarting QUIK, the drop-down list is cleared.  It is necessary to rummage in the settings, first add all existing trading accounts to the list of displayed ones, only after that they will appear in the drop-down list of the deals window.  To find out, I spent half a day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9ac/d45/3c4/9acd453c44d6c12abf1fb247adbd975d.png" width="700"><br>  QUIK.  Portfolio section interface. <br><br>  By the way, while I was writing this article, my portfolio fell by 2.63% (‚Äì4883.2 rubles), but since I currently work in long positions, such fluctuations, although unpleasant, are acceptable. <br><br>  <b>Back to trade</b> <br><br>  Strange psychological effect: in a few months I began to freely operate with the sum of 30 thousand rubles.  And I got bored.  Financial result: I occasionally lost money on poorly thought-out transactions, but since I tried to buy different papers, some transactions brought me profit and some loss. <br><br>  After two months of work, I made hundreds of transactions totaling several million rubles.  In fact, I earned only a few thousand rubles, and if you compare the risks with a classic deposit, this is a very dangerous game, but on the other hand, it‚Äôs satisfactory for a freshman in the first month of work. <br><br>  I decided to bring a larger amount to the brokerage account in order to feel the results of my work and feel responsibility again. <br><br>  <i>Since childhood, I hate rewriting payment details from a piece of paper.</i>  <i>What prevents banks from registering a new client to send him the details of his email in electronic form, a mystery to me.</i> <br><br>  I waited for the result of the transfer for four days, but the money never came.  For an interbank transfer, it is terribly long, and I began the search. <br><br>  It turned out that in the case of an intrabank transfer I did not indicate in the purpose of the payment the number of my master agreement and its date.  The managers asked me for a corrective letter.  This can be done in three ways: <br><br><ol><li>  In the nearest branch of the BCS. </li><li>  By fax. </li><li>  Through your bank. </li></ol><br><br>  So, I came back to the office of BCS, handed over, filled in, after a while the money was credited to the account, and I continued trading. <br><br>  The bottom line: <br><br><ul><li>  There is a lot of information, but it is fragmented and very complex. </li><li>  To come "from the street" to the stock market is very difficult. </li><li>  Even the largest brokers in Russia have a disgusting level of service, and the number of ‚Äúholes‚Äù in customer service is enormous. </li></ul><br>  In BCS, I noticed one important plus - all system errors can be solved with the help of people.  It is important to find the right employee, and he will try to help you overcome the difficulties. <br><br>  I was already lucky to see a historical moment - as the dollar rose to 100 rubles and how several times in one day trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange stopped. <br><br>  I started watching straight lines with V. Putin, his every word creates something terrible with the shares of Russian companies on the Moscow Stock Exchange.  From the point of view of the market, this is terrible, but the show is unimaginable! <br><br>  My experience is unique, someone does not sit on OS X and calmly react to the interfaces in the style of Norton Commander, someone doesn‚Äôt have QUIK specific settings rejected, but someone will be more lucky with the quality of a broker, but the fact remains to start trading in Russia on a real exchange, you need to be <s>stubborn,</s> stubborn samurai. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292986/</a></p>
