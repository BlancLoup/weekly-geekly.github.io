  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headphones Review Denon MM-400: Solidity in everything</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For more than a hundred years, the Japanese audio equipment maker Denon has been pleasing the lovers of quality sound with their devices.  For many decades, the company was known to audiophiles as a developer primarily of turntables, amplifiers, receivers and blu-ray players.  By the way, Denon and now remains the trendsetter in this class of Hi-Fi devices.  However, time does not stand still, and the Japanese do not intend to lag behind the ‚ÄúDepeche Mode‚Äù of the modern audio industry.  Therefore, it was clear that such a well-known and sophisticated manufacturer could not fail to have the devices that are now called ‚Äúpersonal audio‚Äù, and more simply, headphones and portable amplifiers.  And the entrance to this market was very, very successful ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/b24/028/ff4b240281324c469c9f956561da6279.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">A little bit of nostalgia</font> </h2><br>  I remember with great pleasure and nostalgia, which has already become a classic, the D-series from Denon-D2000, D5000 and crowning all these masterpieces of ‚Äúseven thousand meters‚Äù.  Even then, many audiophiles began talking about a special, easily recognizable ‚ÄúDenon‚Äù sound, so different from the sound standard adopted in Japan with an emphasis on high frequencies, from which we, Europeans, often just started to get a headache.  Well, we do not understand these strange inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun ... It was all the more pleasant to hear in Denon headphones a sound that is dearer to the European ear, with a ‚Äúdarker‚Äù color, solid, but not bubbling bass, even middle.  And the wooden cups of the same D-7000 added some elusive charm to all this.

Well, let's look and listen, because in front of me are <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/denon_ah_mm400_nakladnye_naushniki_black/">Denon MM-400 headphones</a> from the latest collection of 2015.  And I use the word "collection", more related to the field of clothing, fashion and style is not by chance.  At first glance, the MM-400 gives the impression ... an impression not just of an audio device, but also an accessory from a person‚Äôs ‚Äúwardrobe‚Äù of a certain status and position in life.  Classic lines with modern elements in design, American walnut cups, all-aluminum headband design, ear pads made from a special ‚Äúmemory effect‚Äù material ... <br><br>  The first association that comes to mind when seeing the MM-400 is Solidity.  Yes, it is Solidity - these headphones are clearly not for teenagers who are trying to surprise their company with the brightness and uncommon accessory.  Immediately a classic in every line.  The classics are extremely stylish and sophisticated, which will perfectly coexist with a Brioni suit, a Louis Vuitton briefcase and a business class ticket lying in a Petek purse.  This is a headset for a successful man, a great gift for the boss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/67c/a2f/fcd67ca2f86a4b6dbbf01389bfcfdae7.png"><br><br>  However, no matter how beautiful and stylish the headphones are, they remain primarily the headphones - the device with which we listen to music.  Therefore, the sound, anyway, is of great importance.  Let's hear how this is with the MM-400. <br>  Since the headphones are positioned by the manufacturer as portable, i.e., for listening to music, primarily ‚Äúon the go‚Äù, the iPhone was taken on the road (the MM-400 also combines the function of the headset for Apple). devices) and equally solid Sony Walkman NW-ZX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30a/58f/ea8/30a58fea86fb4d098bb41bbf2c495808.jpg"><br><br>  Well what can I say?  To begin, I will say about landing.  She is very comfortable.  Ear pads are not very tight to the ears, without creating excessive pressure on the head.  Of course, I would not recommend dancing in these headphones, they may fly off, but they are not made for dancers.  I did not experience the discomfort of the MM-400 put on my head, despite the fact that I did not shoot them for several hours in a row.  Moreover, at a certain stage of using them, you simply stop noticing on your head. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Solidity in sound</font> </h2><br>  Now about the sound.  And again the first word that flowed from my tongue when I started listening was ... ‚Äúsolidity,‚Äù and also calm.  Habitual compositions sounded more pacifying, while not losing anything from the information that they carried earlier.  With a small resistance of 32 ohms, the MM-400 has a relatively low sensitivity of 96 dB.  The main emphasis in the development of speakers Denon made a flat frequency response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20e/c1e/370/20ec1e370fe24fd58e8d20b04f822f72.png"><br>  <i>AFC Denon MM-400</i> <br><br>  The headphones have a beautiful, calm, intelligible bass, worthy of its eminent predecessor D-7000, a slight decline comes in the middle, making the vocals a little less bright and emotional and completely saving the listener from the problem of sibilants.  At the same time, a small increase in the frequency response somewhere around 8 kHz gives a good ‚Äúair‚Äù to the compositions due to the good study of the second and third harmonics of the vocals and guitar parts.  Let's add here a special design of wooden cups, on the inner side of which there is a complex relief for the repayment of resonances.  As a result, it is safe to say that the Japanese have done everything possible so that the sound does not tire the listener for a very long time.  Indeed, it is smooth, calm, solid, matched by the appearance that MM-400 has. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ad/dfb/7d2/5addfb7d2bda4b7b95af7d20ccd0962b.png"><br><br>  As for the sources with which the headphones were tested, I can say that Walkman coped with the task of unlocking the potential of the MM-400 at 100%, the standard iPhone didn‚Äôt have enough for this, although it was impossible to say that the sound was bad.  Definitely, he was at a very high level, but still, to this bundle, I would advise adding a portable amplifier, for example, the same <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/denon_ah_mm400_nakladnye_naushniki_black/">Denon DA-10</a> .  The sound will add detail, it will become more powerful and developed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/426/495/a9e/426495a9e893497aa6fe3a60083de7cb.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Specifications</font> </h2><br>  Type: Active <br>  Speakers: √ò 40 mm <br>  Input resistance: 32 Œ© / ohm <br>  Sensitivity: 96 dB / mW <br>  Maximum input power: 1,000 mW <br>  Playback Frequencies: 10 - 40,000 Hz <br>  Weight: 310 g (not including cable) <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Summary</font> </h2><br>  So, what we got in the end?  And we received from Denon excellent headphones with a solid design, calm, smooth, not tiring ears, in the best traditions of classic Denon models.  In addition, headphones with excellent potential for improving the sound by adding a portable amplifier.  Expensive-looking, expensive-sounding thing, which even the name of the accessory will not turn the name.  Moreover, considering the cost of headphones, I can confidently say that in terms of price / quality ratio, this model is very difficult to find analogues in this price range, because headphones that are comparable in build quality and sound to the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/denon_ah_mm400_nakladnye_naushniki_black/">MM-400</a> are already much more expensive . <br><br>  And finally, good news for those who are interested in buying Denon headphones.
