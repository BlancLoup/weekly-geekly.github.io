And there are those that can be read in parallel, depending on the mood and needs.  "Innovators" Walter Isaacson - about people, without whom the development of technology would be impossible. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe emotional intelligence of the child‚Äù by John Gottman - I want to understand whether it is possible to regulate the emotions of your child and help him with this. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  Probably Andy Weyer's The Martian, I wanted to first read and then watch a movie.  Read in one breath. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I like paper books very much, I follow the novelties of publishers.  Reading a well-published book is a real pleasure, from the smell of paper to beautiful illustrations.  I try to regularly buy books on interesting topics for me.  E-books are usually read on the road, it saves space. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  On weekdays 6-7 hours, on weekends, if I can, I like to sleep during the day. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  An owl that can be a morning person, since I'm a schoolboy's mom.  I try to leave work early, to take a break, if there are things left - to finish it completely in the evening.  This allows you to stay up quite late.  On weekdays, I almost never go to bed before one in the morning. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  I love a full breakfast - scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, cereals, pancakes, etc. Breakfast charges energy for the whole day <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I listen to music or ‚ÄúMonte-Carlo‚Äù radio, although my journey to work by car takes only 5 minutes. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  Learn to forgive and not keep evil on people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296068/</a></p>
