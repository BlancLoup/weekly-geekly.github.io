    <h5>  Virtual machines </h5><br><br>  Servers are divided into 4 types of performance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18f/f79/5b9/18ff795b9383b1c810bbff044c01e37a.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the system disk space, which amounts to 20-40 GB, additional disks up to 1 TB can be connected to virtual machines.  In total, such disks can be connected up to 12 to each machine, after which they can be freely moved between servers without loss of information. <br><br><h5>  Operating Systems </h5><br>  All virtual servers are provided with a pre-installed operating system.  Currently the most popular server platforms are supported, the list of which is constantly growing: <br><br>  <b>Microsoft</b> <br><ul><li>  Windows Servers (64 bits, English): </li><li>  Windows Server (32 bits, English): </li><li>  Internet Information Server 6.0 and 7.5 (Eng.) </li></ul><br>  <b>CentOS</b> <br><ul><li>  CentOS 5.4 32bit (English); </li><li>  CentOS 5.4 64bit (English). </li></ul><br>  <b>Linux</b> <br><ul><li>  RedHat Linux RHEL 5.5 64bit w SPT1 (English); </li><li>  RedHat Linux RHEL 5.5 64bit w SPT2 (eng.); </li><li>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Network structure </h5><br><br>  There are three options for networking in the system: one-, two- and three-level.  Each level is a separate virtual network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f54/149/18d/f5414918dd1c8b39292b0f9be2ba5bf1.jpg"><br><br>  All levels are interconnected through a firewall, which also acts as a gateway.  The systems themselves can also be connected to a single intranet within a single subscription.  And, of course, you can create one or more physical IP addresses for the system and thereby provide access to the Internet. <br><br><h5>  Firewall </h5><br><br>  A firewall is a specially configured virtual machine that acts as a firewall, gateway, and is responsible for network address translation (NAT).  The flexible configuration system allows users to filter incoming and outgoing connections by the following parameters: connection direction, sender and recipient addresses, used protocols and ports.  The direction of the connection refers to two networks, selected as the initial and final.  The role of such networks can be the actual network segments of the user's system, as well as the Internet and intranet. <br><br><h5>  Additional services </h5><br><br>  Optionally, the user is offered load balancing services, backup of system components, setting up a VPN connection between systems and the user's local network.  The full list is available on the cloud platform portal: <a href="http://globalcloud.de.fujitsu.com/">globalcloud.de.fujitsu.com</a> <br><br>  Consider the processes of creating, managing and monitoring systems. <br><br>  <b>Control</b> <br><br>  All work with systems is carried out through the portal: <a href="http://globalcloud.de.fujitsu.com/">globalcloud.de.fujitsu.com</a> .  You can get acquainted with the terms of service and the provisions of the contract, even without having an account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/3a2/8f4/1f23a28f41bce42bd8a3d6044a6aaf46.png"><br><br>  Access to all information - on currently spent resources and their cost, both total and by position - is carried out from the personal account.  It is also possible to use one account by several users with the division of access rights between them. <br><br>  We turn to the most interesting - the process of creating a system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/785/80c/f2178580c5d6a93b28a56293660fda1f.png"><br><br>  The whole process is based on intuitive actions.  First, a system template is selected.  In the example above, a template consisting of two subnets is selected.  Required servers are added by the Drag-and-Drop method, the type of their performance is selected from the drop-down list.  In the same way, additional disks and load balancers are added.  In general, the entire deployment process in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù for a small infrastructure takes about fifteen minutes, including the system startup time. <br><br>  The system reconfiguration process looks the same way.  All components and parameters of the system can be changed at any time, the user can delete or add new virtual machines, change their type, transfer between network segments, connect, transfer or delete additional disks. <br><br>  Systems are also managed through the portal - in a few clicks you can set up firewall rules, make backups, view logs, or even delete the entire system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69f/c1e/46a/69fc1e46a8168681cbd5d3a788a027f1.png"><br><br>  Manage and configure the virtual machines themselves using standard RDP or SSH protocols.  For this, it is possible to connect the administrator's PC to any of the subnets of the managed system via a VPN connection.  There is also the option of setting up a permanent VPN connection between the user's and the system‚Äôs networks. <br><br>  When using cloud servers it is very important to accurately compare the performance parameters and the tasks assigned.  If an underpowered machine is not selected enough, it‚Äôs pretty simple to track, and all the symptoms, as they say, are on the face.  In the opposite situation, the procedure is much more complicated.  To understand that the requested resources are unnecessary for current tasks, and in order to save money, the monitoring system helps to switch to a less productive server type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd2/e26/421/dd2e26421d02e8d421e9525f328c034b.jpg"><br><br>  For each individual machine, it is possible to view its load on a scale from one hour to a week, which allows you to track the degree of server utilization and periods of peak loads. <br><br>  All management and monitoring features presented on the portal are duplicated via an API set.  Console commands of Windows and Linux systems and a set of Java SDKs make it possible to automate management processes and reconfiguration of the system, allowing the user to create their own portals for resale services or implement automated work scenarios with a sharp increase in loads. <br><br>  <b>Terms of Service</b> <br><br>  The Fujitsu cloud platform is designed primarily for the corporate user segment, so each registration on the portal is separately supported by a service agreement.  This allows you to guarantee service levels and take into account specific user requirements. <br><br>  Only actually used resources are paid for, which is fully consistent with the concept of cloud services.  Depending on the types of resources, the pricing process may vary slightly.  For example, virtual machines are paid for hours of operation, that is, the time when the server is turned off is not taken into account, while disk space is paid based on the reserved volumes, regardless of whether the disk is stuck to any server or not. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting that for each new contract there is a trial period of 1 month.  During this time, the organization can become more familiar with the capabilities of the platform and test the necessary functionality.  Consultation services are also provided to customers for launching cloud infrastructure and migrating applications. <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br><br>  Fujitsu's global cloud platform is deployed in high availability data centers and is tailored to load balancing, ensuring minimal impact on network performance. <br><br>  Multi-level network security is provided by a complex of antivirus and antispyware software.  The software used is constantly updated, which allows you to timely identify all known threats. <br><br>  How is client security guaranteed? <br><ul><li>  Data is available only to customers. </li><li>  All data is encrypted, and Fujitsu administrators do not have access to customer content. </li><li>  Physical access to the equipment is available only to data center administrators, who are mandatory certified and tested on a polygraph. </li><li>  Fujitsu provides all data center security measures that meet Tier 3 reliability categories: </li></ul><br>  o biometric identification, <br>  o full video surveillance, <br>  o redundancy of most systems <br>  o preservation of the health of the data center in most cases of intentional and accidental human interventions, <br>  o backup entrances, duplicating driveways, access control, no windows, protection from electromagnetic radiation, bearing capacity of floors at least 1225 kg / m¬≤ with a load from above and 245 kg / m¬≤ load from the bottom. <br><ul><li>  All Fujitsu data centers are certified in various areas of security, including: </li></ul><br>  o ISO 9001, <br>  o ISO 20000, <br>  o ISO 27001, <br>  o ISO 27001 IT Basic Protection, <br>  o GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), <br>  o ¬ß25a KWG. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c99/544/dc5/c99544dc5bfb7abb75a217cc1fc462df.png"><br><br>  Fujitsu cloud platform exists not the first year and has several hundreds of subscribers around the world.  Six data centers around the world provide a standardized stack of services for customers of different levels.  This includes Fujitsu's own projects, for example, the solution for independent software vendors of the Fujitsu Cloud Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175637/</a></p>
