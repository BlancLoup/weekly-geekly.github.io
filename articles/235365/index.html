Someone has long been in the comments advised to publish a collection of the best articles in the form of a book.  I am pleased that this idea has finally come true! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/174/4ae/53d/1744ae53de474cb88d7158c431c808e5.jpg"><br>  <i>Quintessence of IT industry</i> <br><br>  I am glad to present to your attention the book "When I spoke ... About education, IT and not only."  The title of the book was taken from the most popular article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145960/">‚ÄúWhen I Said ...‚Äù</a> , which at the time of publication was included in the top 20 best articles of habr in the entire history. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Book Description:
