This is the day of sv.  Valentine, the holiday of love for red cardboard. <br><br>  If love is crazy, then Valentine's Day is an open door in a madhouse.  Otherwise, how to explain everything that is going on in this ordinary, by all concepts, day?  Thousands, millions of people go shopping in search of some tasteless muck, decorated with cupids, red ‚Äúhearts‚Äù and something brilliant.  In general, all that sweet, petty-bourgeois tenderness of pinkish tones and ruff, on which a normal man on ordinary days looks with disgust, on this day becomes the center of the universe.  And you thought it was a celebration of love and lovers?  No, no and NO!  This is a holiday of shopping and consumption: February 14, February 23 and March 8 long ago turned into days when merchants dumped the illiquid assets that had lain on the shelves all the previous year and profit from despair of people trying to find a gift to their second half. <br><br>  Sometimes it comes to the point of absurdity: schoolchildren and students are bought on the eve of some completely wild number of cards, up to several dozen.  Apparently love at a young age is enough for the whole group or class.  However, no one says anything about love: all the fuss with the red cardboard is done only out of politeness.  It seems like, "you give me a valentine, and I give you a valentine," such, you know, "the circulation of paper in nature."  In the rite of the exchange of this printed matter, it is imperative, as if imbecile, to be embarrassed and smile, and in a hurry to ‚Äúissue-write‚Äù a response valentine, otherwise the whole year you will not have simple human happiness later.

      In general, all this hysteria about Valentine's Day is unlikely to touch you, if you are not handsome (beautiful) and the soul of the company in the bargain.  Botanists, geeks, and simply ugly people on this day will once again receive confirmation of their asexuality in the form of two or three ‚Äúvalentines of mercy‚Äù donated from the most compassionate acquaintances.  Also out of courtesy.  But the popular and sexy personalities on this day boast to each other the number of received postcards, which makes their self-esteem grow by leaps and bounds, and begin to plan relationships with two or three individuals of the opposite sex at once. <br><br>  In adulthood, all this goes into a different plane: a simple piece of red cardboard with words of love will hardly satisfy the woman he loves (men, as a rule, become the giver).  Need romance, an evening in a restaurant, dinner, candles, and then a night of love.  And all this should take place with some kind of hot Spanish passion, with Banderas temperament or at least chic Johnny Depp.  And no one cares that you have been married for 20 years, and in the yard stands a stern Russian February: ‚ÄúPicture Banderas, to whom they say!  Well, or at least pull in the stomach ... " <br><br>  If you are unlucky, and you have managed to meet this day alone and on the horizon there is not a little bit impressive man or pretty lady, then everything is very sad.  You are threatened, in a fit of love enthusiasm, to visit one of the dances of the marriage illiquid: entertainment clubs, as a rule, organize themed discotheques on this day, which, however, are also visited by well-off couples.  The chances of being lonely to find their ‚Äúmate‚Äù greatly increase at such events: the atmosphere nevertheless contributes. <br><br>  Now almost everyone knows the approximate history of the holiday, which became so popular in Russia just a couple of decades ago.  In different versions of the story, the priest Valentine, disobeyed the decree of the Roman emperor and clandestinely crowned the soldiers and their girlfriends, the prison in which he pleased for this, the jailer‚Äôs blind daughter and love notes - ‚Äúvalentines‚Äù - appear preliminarily.  Perhaps this explains why this holiday is so popular in our country.  This is not a story, but a real song!  The genre is not difficult to guess - it is called a chanson and ‚Äúblatnyak.‚Äù  All elements of the genre are in place: an innocently planted prisoner, a love story and correspondence with the "zone".  Since such songs enjoy the same success with the Russians, along with the criminal serials, there was a place in the calendar and bourgeois and in general alien to our people holiday. <br><br>  There are 365 days in a year to donate some bunny in chocolate with a rose on the ears and a little note in the paws or in any other place ... So there is no February 14!  And suddenly, someone does not have money on February 14, but will they, for example, on November 18 or June 21, then what to do?  After all, it was laid on February 14!  And besides, you have to give gifts not only to your beloved, but also to all brothers, sisters and other ‚Äúloved ones‚Äù there, again out of politeness, a sort of second ‚Äúnew year‚Äù.  Rasta alone!  You certainly understand that my hopes are just a joke, because often we forget to make our loved ones pleasant, just like that, for no reason, and this day helps us.  By the way, many on this day make a marriage proposal.  Well, if the relationship is not yet fully strengthened, then it offers: a movie, ice cream, a walk, ‚ÄúI have no one‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn a name for a start,‚Äù leave the phone </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84236/</a></p>
