      On October 17, 2012, NASA held a series of meetings dedicated to the future of the Agency‚Äôs strategic directions.  Some participants joined the discussions by phone.  The focus was on the future of the International Space Station (ISS).  The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate team on exploration and planning for missions presented the launch plans for the ISS until 2028. <br><br>  These long-term operational plans for the ISS are not good enough, according to NASA chief executive Charlie Bolden.  Bolden says he needs to know directly from President Obama whether a manned flight to Mars is planned after 2030 as the main goal for NASA.  If this is not the President‚Äôs goal for NASA, then Bolden wonders why NASA should continue funding the ISS for another decade and a half. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once Bolden turned up and said that "The goal is Marsl."  Bolden said he was determined to come to the White House, "knocking the table with his shoe," and demanding President Obama‚Äôs commitment that NASA send people to Mars.  Bolden said that he needed these commitments, which would allow him to decide what to do or not to do in relation to the expansion of the ISS.  Given that the administration is now focused on re-election, it is rather unlikely that Bolden will knock Obama‚Äôs shoe in the White House anytime soon.  Given the uncertainty of the congressional election and the threat of a sequestration, it is highly unlikely that any formal confirmation of the multi-year program focused on a manned mission to Mars will occur in the foreseeable time under President Obama.  Bolden‚Äôs influence on the Obama administration implies, of course, that he remains as head of NASA in the second Obama administration.  But I'm not sure that ‚Äúknocking the shoe‚Äù will help him in this. <br><br>  As for the effect of Bolden's ‚Äúknock-off shoe‚Äù against the people of Romney in cases of their gain, then the sketch of their space policy is now rather vague.  But they made it quite clear that there would be no increase in the budget for NASA.  In addition, it is unlikely that Charlie Bolden will be able to maneuver like Dan Goldin and remain the head of the Agency in the Romney administration. <br><br>  What is a little incomprehensible in this concern of Bolden and his conversations behind closed doors about Mars with the President is that the President has already spoken quite a lot on this topic.  Below is a random <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search%3Faffiliate%3Dwh%26query%3DMars%2BNASA%26a%2520mp%3Bsubmit.x%3D49%26submit.y%3D10%26submit%3DSearch%26form_id%3Dusasearch_box">collection of search results</a> from the White House website for the words "Mars NASA."  It would seem that President Obama does when he mentions a manned mission to Mars almost every time he talks about NASA?  Thus, the adaptation of the Agency's efforts in these areas, it would seem, is exactly what the president expects from Charlie Bolden's actions, right? <br><br>  NASA is considering a one-year flight on the ISS, and there is talk about a manned station on the Moon, perhaps built using the components and / or technologies of the ISS - in any case, the ISS can be expected to be used as an element of a wider infrastructure of human space in space than assumed at the present time. <br><br>  If Charlie Bolden wants an immediate presidential statement about Kennedy or Bush-style space politics, I would advise him to turn on the TV.  With the current state of the economy and the world, this simply will not happen in the near future. <br><br>  Obama's Favorite Comments on NASA and Mars <br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/nasa.pdf">The OMB FY 13 consolidated budget estimate</a> ‚Äú <i>implements a lower cost of Mars exploration program by robots that will promote science and also help lay the foundation for the future development of man by man</i> " <br><br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/15/making-investments-groundbreaking-developments-21st-century-space-exploration">The twenty-first century of space exploration: "The next chapter, which we can write together here at NASA</a> , the White House" <i>at the beginning of the next decade, a series of flights with crews will check and prove the efficiency of the systems necessary for reconnaissance outside the near-earth orbit, and by 2025 we expect that a new spacecraft designed for long flights will appear, which will allow us to begin the first manned mission out of the moon in deep space, so we will start ... by sending astronauts to asteroids for the first time</i>  <i>history.</i>  <i>By the mid-2030s, I believe we will be able to send people to the orbit of Mars and safely return them to Earth, and then landing on Mars will follow.</i>  <i>And I expect to be there to see it</i> .
