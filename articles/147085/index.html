  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I am a brand or how to raise my value?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After writing a post about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146927/">the IT interview algorithm</a> , we discussed in the comments that someone constantly needs to prove something, perform stupid test tasks, etc.  The area in which we operate grows and develops very quickly.  Classical institutions do not have time to change their programs, and teachers are no longer aware of what is happening. <br><br>  We cannot simply accept a specialist on the basis of the crust of a reputable institute, except for PMI, PMP, PM, etc.  certificates that can say that a person studied in a reputable company that is part of an international network of project managers and guarantees quality education and issues certificates only to those who have fully mastered all the knowledge. <br><br>  I will even say more that this is unlikely to appear in the next decade, which means that it is necessary to change the approach to yourself.  In this post, I want to express my point of view on this issue and very much look forward to starting a large constructive discussion of possible options for adding value to myself for an employer.

About trends </h5><br>  A lot of people are now sitting in social networks, paper newspapers with work are no longer working, and in developed countries they are simply not there.  Now there are professional social networks that replace the resume in its usual form.  In the global world, there are already shark businesses - such as LinkedIn, several new global and local players are emerging.  Developing countries are showing explosive growth in the use of such services - in particular, China and India.  Our banana republic is next. <br><br>  Western bigwigs believe that we do not understand why we need MyKrug service.  They see very big prospects in our market, and where there are prospects, there are changes.  And as proof of the seriousness of intentions, now HH.ru is doing its social network, and the French network Viadeo has been testing the ground for half a year. <br><br>  I will not go into the philosophy, all the information is in the vast expanses of the Internet, I will express my vision of the changes that have already begun. <br><br>  Firstly, IT residents are looking for 99.9% via the Internet; if you are a large or average specialist, it is hard to imagine that you do not use the Internet to look for work.  The distance from you to the employer was minimal, straight in one / two handshakes.  Moreover, all that we write personal in social networks, now and employers, both current and future are able to trace and learn about us even more of what we want to tell them. <br><br>  Secondly, for Russia, where people are not accustomed to engage in self-presentation and actually praise themselves, they will have to learn how to do it, as this is demanded by the market.  And here for activists there is a great opportunity to get ahead in comparison with those who are still slowing down and cannot overcome their modesty. <br><br>  Then I will describe the possibilities that we can use both for job search and for creating our image in between the search intervals :). <br><br><h5>  2. Check the recommendations of the company via the Internet </h5><br><br>  The most important, in my opinion, advantage is that earlier the company asked to fill in various forms, passport data, indicate relatives, ring up recommendations, punch through various databases from security services.  But now you can check the company. <br><br>  Thus, not only the company about applicants can verify the recommendations, but also applicants about the company.  To do this, as an example, you need to take advantage of professional social networks, find people who are now working in the company, and learn firsthand.  Ask about whether what was promised at the interview coincides with what is real. <br><ul><li>  Is white salary? </li><li>  Is it issued in time? </li><li>  How does a boss behave at work? </li><li>  What office and jobs?  etc. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  3. Be proactive </h5><br>  You need to think about your business reputation every day and every day you need to work for it, bringing in a little something useful.  If you decide to create it at the moment when you started looking for work, that time is already missed. <br><br>  Take care in advance that you have thematic articles on the Internet on a professional profile, in the area in which you want to work.  So headhunter or future employer can evaluate your knowledge in practice. <br><br>  It is very good if you have the opportunity to speak in public in front of an audience that is relevant to your professional interests.  And it does not matter if it is a seminar or a webinar, an article on a site or a message on Twitter - you should use a maximum of tools that will help you to make yourself known and visible. <br><br><h5>  4. The power of recommendations - or how to earn credibility </h5><br>  First of all, the credibility of those companies in which you worked from your position also plays your authority.  So try to look for either more reputable companies or more reputable positions.  Ideally, this is of course a combination of these parameters. <br><br>  Secondly, use the transfer of authority from a trusted person, for example, if some guru in your specific area mentioned you or retweeted, this automatically added credibility to you. <br><br>  Thirdly, your authority depends on your circle of acquaintances, those whom you know and who know you.  Take care of your professional acquaintances, networking. The more you give, the more you get.  Your friends should know you as a person who is always ready to help them establish the necessary contacts. <br><br><h5>  5. Toolkit </h5><br>  As usual from theory, go to practice.  Here I want to dwell on the toolkit and find out who uses what and what tools - it will be useful for everyone. <br><br>  Actually, all the business sharks mentioned at the beginning of the article work for us - they want us to have a good job, to work comfortably, build connections, etc., so let's share such tools and keep track of new products, trends and changes. <br><br>  <b>MyCircle from Yandex</b> is the first tool I use.  Here, the most important service for the authority, in addition to the 1st round and a summary, are Facts, as well as recommendations of services.  It uses direct transfer of authority between people.  And it depends a lot on the text of the message, on the quantity and quality (authority) of people, who confirm this. <br><br>  <b>Actually, HH.ru</b> is an ordinary high-quality service that helps to make a resume correctly and most of the vacancies are closed here.  We are waiting for when they open their professional soc.  network. <br><br>  <b>Twitter</b> - microblogging service.  Allows you to quickly enter your professional get-together, be aware of current events.  And most importantly - to flash in front of potential employers.  So for credibility affects who you read and most importantly, who reads you. <br><br>  <b>HabraHabr</b> - of course, here is the main Russian- <b>speaking</b> get-together IT.  Why is not the first?  Because here they are not very fond of managers (or so far it seems to me :)), who tell the truth, share their experience.  Moreover, in Russia it is difficult NOT to become a manager in the future. <br><br> <code> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/varnak/" class="user_link">Varnak</a>   ,   ,       ,             ,    .               . ..           . <br> <br>      ,            . <br> <br>    <br> <b>code.google.com</b> -  ,   . <br> <br> <b>sourceforge.net</b> -      <br> <br> <b>github.com</b> -     .      .       <b>jobs.github.com</b>        . <br> <br> <b>bitbucket.org</b>         . <br> <br>     -   . <br> <b>stackoverflow.com</b>      ,     70%      25%     .       <b>careers.stackoverflow.com</b> <br> <br> <b>serverfault.com</b>     ,     . <br> <br>       -  ,   ,       . <br> <br></code> <br><br>  <i>I take this opportunity to make a remark: it‚Äôs like a butterfly (manager) conversation with a caterpillar (specialist).</i>  <i>That when you become a butterfly, you can fly like a bird.</i>  <i>And the caterpillar is angry, because the birds have a very negative attitude.</i>  <i>Here for it and minus.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  We continue. <br><br>  Not long ago, I learned about the new <b>Resumup.com</b> service, the essence of which is to make your boring resume or job beautiful and visual using beautiful infographics. <br><br>  An example of what a resume looks like.  Beauty. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a6/4e9/383/5a64e93839e3d288c02be1bad3108bb8.png"><br><br>  <b>LinkedIn</b> is a well-known professional social service.  The network, which is very popular in America, after coming to the Russian market, without active marketing, was able to increase its share 4-fold compared to when it was not here.  It is recommended for those who are looking for work in large Western companies, both in Russia and abroad. <br><br>  If you are looking for serious Western investments, you can write to the right people on this network directly and if you have a good idea and you have described it correctly, then it is likely that the next meetings will be initiated and the money will be received. <br><br>  <b>Viadeo</b> is new to our market and already a serious player in the world.  Its main features are that when coming to each specific market: in Europe, America, China, India, they use national individual characteristics. <br><br>  For example, in India it is absolutely necessary to have a horoscope for today at the service; without it, no serious matters are done.  In China, there is no button - to invite as a friend, because there it is not accepted to add those whom you do not know personally. <br><br>  People also have different traditions in different countries: in France people have practically no business cards, in America business cards scornfully rush, in Japan everyone has business cards, including janitors, and here it‚Äôs customary to give and take business cards with two hands, be sure to read it immediately content and pay homage to its owner. <br><br>  We are so different, but our shirt is closer to the body :) We are wondering what will soon be offered and adapted specifically for us - right?  What do you think are the features / differences that we have, which business sharks will need to take into account while working in our market for us? <br>  - Personal advice - ‚ÄúDo you want to add value to your candidacy - delete resumes from all online databases from job search sites‚Äù (c) Alena Vladimirskaya (Pruffi) <br><br>  **** <br>  Thank you for reading the article - the main thing is not to get carried away, in all you need to know when to stop.  Successes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/104/3c9/29d/1043c929d04ed05717fce717ed43ec12.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147085/</a></p>
