    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  All Facebook ads are shows </h4><br>  Although there is a ‚Äúpay-per-click‚Äù option, it is disguised as a fee for impressions.  Everything is considered CTR - in the end, you still pay for the shows.  That is, if you have a low CTR - your ad will simply not show, and you will still have to either turn on impressions, or increase your bid per click. <br><br><h4>  When you need impressions - pay per click </h4><br>  It so happens that I need the fans of the page only to see my news as a reminder, but it is not necessary that they click on the news.  Then I put a ‚Äúpay per click‚Äù and my ad is shown, but I don‚Äôt pay for it, or I pay very little, because there are few clicks.  This will be seen in scope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/cc9/d44/f21cc9d448bc07751a75a87da4d844e4.jpg"><br><br>  So we managed to see that 5,558 people saw our ad, and we paid a little for it, because we pay for clicks, although we actually need impressions. <br><br><h4>  When you need impressions - precisely target </h4><br>  It happens when you need to attract a new audience or somehow revive the old one, you need to include a fee for the shows - you cannot go anywhere. <br><br><h4>  What was before with the shows </h4><br>  Previously, before changing the algorithm and functionality of the admin panel of an advertising account on Facebook, I did the following: I set the price per click, starting from 1 cent.  Then I waited for a couple of hours, and if a warning in the form of a yellow triangle was shown that your ad wasn‚Äôt showing due to a low bid or low CTR, then I raised the price by 1 cent, at some point the ad started to appear, and then I twisted the audience‚Äôs target . <br><br>  And then the opportunity to regulate something in the pay for shows was gone.  If earlier you yourself appointed a price for 1000 impressions, now Facebook as if says: you sit, and we ourselves will set the price.  In this regard, Google-Adwords is more democratic: if you want, set everything up yourself, and if you want, give it to the system so that it sets up automatically. <br><br><h4>  Configure your audience very precisely. </h4><br>  In this case, when you cannot adjust the price for the shows, you need to very precisely adjust the target audience.  In this respect, Facebook functional is not great, but good.  In addition to the standard attributes (age, gender, education, geography), a very good option is available - indicate where those who you want to show your ad work for.  It is clear that they (users) do not always indicate their place of work, nevertheless it works, and very well. <br><br>  If you feel sorry for your money - make several options for the target audience, and choose the most effective one. <br><br>  What else: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Write several variations of the same ad and keep the most effective. <br>  ‚Ä¢ During the period of setting up the ad, watch the statistics every 2-3 hours, or else you will pour money into the pipe. <br><br>  So, at first I think about what kind of announcement I need to write to my Central Asia, then I make 3-4 variants of Central Asia (after all, as I already wrote, it happens that a person, especially women, will write 25 for himself and not 35 years for him, where and by whom he works, etc.) then, on the basis of the most effective target, I make 10 ad options, with different pictures, different text, etc. And then I choose the most effective ad, plus a couple of tweaks, plus a day or two to make it work out - and already everything, I launch the announcement on all advertising reel. <br><br><h4>  Lyrical afterword in the style of "I resent" </h4><br><br>  Find a typo <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de9/0be/c7c/de90bec7ca0954542487e008d2f39d19.jpg"><br><br>  Guys, tell Facebook - let them correct this mistake in the word ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù!  I wrote in support repeatedly - nothing.  I can‚Äôt look at this ‚Äúlittle street‚Äù, it‚Äôs annoyingly creepy.  So it turns out that Facebook does not have a policy, but a price ‚Äúweed‚Äù - a prophetic typo. <br><br>  UPD: Literally, I opened Facebook today, and it turns out that Facebook has returned the option of ‚Äúassigning a payment for 1000 impressions manually‚Äù.  And a few more options have appeared - we will explore. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154055/</a></p>
