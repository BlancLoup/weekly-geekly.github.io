But such is the world of finance, at least ordinary, even digital.  Let's take a closer look at what is happening in the world of fintech. <br><br><h3>  Rockefellers and Soros start investing in cryptocurrencies </h3><br>  Most recently, many reputable financiers have stated that cryptocurrency is an ordinary bubble that is about to burst.  According to experts, Bitcoin and Altcoins are worthless and exist only temporarily while the HYIP is running. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/tj/vh/kntjvh8imga0vs9dtmdrgwdjutq.jpeg">

      Nevertheless, institutional players gradually come to this area.  Some act in secret, others announce the start of action quite openly.  Among the latter - the Rockefellers and Soros. <br><br>  As for the Rockefellers, their company Venrock <a href="http://thebitplex.com/2018/04/07/rockefeller-crypto/">announced</a> a partnership with venture company CoinFund.  She specializes in investments in cryptoindustry and a variety of blockchain solutions. <br><br>  For the cryptocurrency market, this can be a positive factor, since the leaders of Venrock, in their own words, are not interested in receiving short-term profits, and are going to give maximum attention to the long-term prospects for the development of the cryptocurrency sphere.  So far, the company is ready to invest several million US dollars, no more. <br><br>  The Soros Foundation is not far behind the Rockefellers.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soros-management-cryptocurrency/george-soros-set-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-bloomberg-idUSKCN1HD217">According to sources</a> close to the financier, in the near future he will invest heavily in cryptocurrency.  By the way, this information came just a month after Soros <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-06/george-soros-prepares-to-trade-cryptocurrenceis">called the</a> crypto side "bubble."  Actually, he is not alone. <br><br><h3>  The central bank will look dissatisfied with banking services in social networks </h3><br>  The regulator <a href="https://iz.ru/725616/tatiana-gladysheva/tcentrobank-zaimetsia-monitoringom-sotcsetei">decided to</a> follow the dissemination of information about the difficulties of various banks in social networks.  Doing this organization intends daily. <br><br>  According to representatives of the Central Bank, it will allow to speak with people directly, affecting their behavior and expectations.  Social networks have become a powerful tool for the dissemination of information, it is possible to judge the moods and demands of society, which will allow time to respond to current problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/mq/ug/-cmqugygltdolgypxqvgrogpz9s.jpeg"><br>  Source: rb.ru <br><br>  Social networks in this regard are ideal for this task, since the vast majority of Internet users do not visit the websites of government agencies.  But almost every citizen of the Russian Federation has an account in one or another social network.  According to the head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications Leonid Levin, today almost any government agency should communicate with people without intermediaries. <br><br>  Monitoring the social network of the Central Bank will not be himself, but with the help of the contractor - the digital agency "Next."  It won an open tender in the Sberbank AST procurement system, setting a contract price of 25 million rubles.  The agency, in addition to analyzing information, will also give advice on how to respond to various information channels. <br><br><h3>  Cryptocurrencies fall </h3><br>  Despite some correction, cryptocurrency rates continue to decline.  During the day, Bitcoin lost about 6%, altcoins also fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6h/kj/3n/6hkj3nyy1k8v0rzugzv2e3goqwq.jpeg"><br><br>  Since the beginning of the year, the capitalization of the crypto market has significantly decreased, and only last week the bitcoin fell to its lowest level since the beginning of February, losing about 20% of its initial value.  The fall occurs, in particular, against the background of negative news - restrictions on the cryptocurrency market from both state regulators and large companies. <br><br>  In addition, online companies prohibit advertising cryptocurrency and ICO, and Google went even further, prohibiting the addition of cryptocurrency mining to the official Google Chrome Web Store online store. <br><br>  <a href="https://ria.ru/economy/20180405/1517976094.html">According to</a> some experts, the immediate goal of the Bitcoin rate is now the February minimum of 5.93 thousand US dollars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353176/</a></p>
