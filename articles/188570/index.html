  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup-gatherings: Aigul Mirzayanova held a master class on working with the audience in public speaking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many start-up project managers have to speak to the public.  The practice of public speaking begins with the presentation of the project for investors and continues even when the startup becomes successful - an interesting idea is filmed for the central television, reports in the news.  About how to organize your performance in public and how not to lose face because of the sudden unrest, she told Aigul Mirzayanova at her master class in Kazan IT Park. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58c/9f3/2b9/58c9f32b9deecaa07e4d33233e95208d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In her speech, Aigul primarily paid attention to the psychology of communication and perception of the world around and the people to whom he will speak.  ‚ÄúIf you are afraid that the interlocutors will not understand you, then this happens primarily because you put them below yourself,‚Äù said the guest at the very beginning of the seminar.  Aigul advised to speak to the public in such a way that people would be keenly interested in the problem raised, and this is only possible if it affects them.  The guest advised in the process of public speaking not to lose contact with the public, listen to questions from the audience, try to speak with the audience in the same language.  ‚ÄúDuring the performance, look at those who listen to you, and most importantly - hear,‚Äù Aigul advised.  ‚ÄúOften there are several people in the hall who are really ready to make contact - start your presentation, relying on their attention and, in the end, you will achieve the attention of the entire audience.‚Äù  Speaking about the public performance, Mirzayanova tried to tell the audience about the very essence of fear - the internal barrier that everyone builds inside of them.  A well-known TV presenter advised to take fear only as a fear of something unknown - something that might not happen.  The guest noticed that we all fear failure, but only failure makes us stronger.  And since any situation can end in either victory or loss, you should not be afraid, because in any case you will achieve something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b11/cd1/850/b11cd18501755f7b0e08a5523cab9e4e.jpg" alt="image">

      Much attention was paid during the seminar and the personality of the speaker as a person who is trying to convey a thought to others.  Aigul noted that 80% of the final impression about you is made up of how you look and only 11% of what you say.  Therefore, when speaking, one should always look good, follow the timbre of the voice, the manner of presentation, and only then the text itself.  If you are not satisfied with your voice timbre, Mirzayanova advises you to contact professional teachers in speech technology and work on yourself.  ‚ÄúFor any speech, you need to prepare exclusively for 200% and believe in yourself - then everything will definitely work out!‚Äù - such was the message of Aigul Mirzayanova to the audience gathered in the hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba8/a5b/e40/ba8a5be401eb33a1a73d0a3a7df423e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The event was held under the auspices of the Business Incubator in conjunction with the PR-workshop GRRYADKA.  The press center of the IT park was a real sell-out from the crowd to listen to an interesting guest.  During the master class, everyone could ask their questions, to which Aigul answered with unfailing openness, demonstrating the talent of communication with the public.  Everyone was able to take something out of this meeting for himself and get a positive experience in communicating with a professional in his field.  We are waiting for you at the new Startup-gatherings in the Kazan IT Park, then it will only be more interesting. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188570/</a></p>
