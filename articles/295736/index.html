  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The question of the 21st century. Freelance or state? Remotely or in the office?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In each team, sooner or later the question arises about the completion of the composition.  We, for example, needed an Android developer.  After the release of the application, many people noted that they would like to see Ridewithme for the operating system from Google.  So, the questions we will try to answer in this article, and there are only two of them, are: <br>  <b>State or freelance?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>To the office or remotely?</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6e/6e0/2a2/c6e6e02a270344ca9d25c182350b73c0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A full-time employee</b> is an employee who can be guided and controlled in real time.  In addition, such an important aspect as live communication distinguishes a regular employee from any other. <br><br>  <b>A freelancer</b> is a person who is not infected with your idea, it is almost impossible to control it in real time, and it is only money that can motivate such an employee, often. <br><br>  According to the first two formulations, a full-time employee is good, and a freelancer is a fiend.  But this is far from the case.  A full-time employee, of course, has a number of advantages over a freelancer, however, do not forget about pay. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      A full-time employee requires: a chair, a table, tea, a cookie, a computer, a window, six square meters of space, salary, social package, taxes, holidays, and so on. <br><br>  The freelancer, in turn, requires money only for one specific task, no social contributions, permanent salaries, and so on.  As the saying goes, "Made a deal - thank you, here is your payment!" <br><br>  If you want to implement one specific project, then freelancing is a great solution.  For the sake of, for example, drawing one logo, it makes no sense to take a designer to the state.  If there are a large number of tasks, then there is no point in giving them to freelancing every time for different people with different styles, terms and so on.  And this, I note, design is a matter of taste.  And when the question is about programming?  Where then to look for this g @ vnokodera?  Here is another pitfall - no one owes nothing to anyone.  This problem concerns both the employer and the employee, for obvious reasons. <br><br>  What if I do not pay?  What if he does nothing? <br>  Nothing, look for a new partner.  Once again, no one owes nothing to anyone. <br><br>  So, to understand what kind of employee you need, you need to think about what he will do after he does what is required of him now.  If you can't imagine him as a full-time team member, then you definitely need a freelancer.  Also, freelancing is suitable if you have a limited budget. <br>  If you choose such a method, it will be necessary to coordinate with the employee.  Remember, if an employee trusts you, this will certainly have a positive effect on his activity and responsibility.  It is also very important to discuss aspects of further cooperation.  Since the task given to an outsource, will cost less than the salary of a staff member.  Plus, if once budgets allow you to hire an employee in this area, you will already have a proven candidate. <br><br>  <b>Remotely or in the office?</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d8/d43/916/1d8d43916fc14fb991b694d86dafc610.jpg"><br>  Imagine that our team is complete.  Where to stay and how to organize the work?  These questions can be answered in different ways, it all depends on the means and capabilities of your team. <br>  You can rent an office and buy furniture if you have money for it.  If not, then remote work is your choice.  This is not bad, no: it is convenient and comfortable.  You do not have to get to work 40 minutes, everyone has their own mugs and nobody pulls your food from the refrigerator. <br><br>  If you are together from the very beginning, then remote mode will not shake the efficiency of work.  But with new employees, if any, problems may arise.  In fact, for an employee who is not enthusiastic about your common idea, remote work is the same freelancing, and if a person is not responsible, something wrong may happen at the most inappropriate moment.  If all the guys are reliable, no need to worry, everything will work out.  Moreover, the means for communication are huge.  For our team, this list is not long, but sufficient. <br><br>  1) <b>Slack</b> is a wonderful service, say, corporate chat, which supports the separation of users by channels, file sharing, private messages and so on.  By the way, another undoubted plus of Slack is different subscriptions, including a free one, which came up to us. <br>  2) <b>Skype</b> - everyone knows what it is.  We used it for live communication, so to speak.  It is not always convenient to write, but on the telephone for a long time to speak is expensive. <br>  3) <b>iMessage / WhatsApp / Viber / VK</b> - we rarely used of course, but very functional programs. <br><br>  <b>Total.</b> <br>  As we wrote in the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ridewithme/blog/20558/">article on team building</a> , each team needs to develop its own methodology, because each member of each team is unique, and in order to win, you need to pick up a special ‚ÄúStaff‚Äù and a set of ‚Äúskills‚Äù for a specific task.
