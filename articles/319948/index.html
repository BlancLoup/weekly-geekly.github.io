And on December 21st of the last, 2016, the Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring Suites (MQ for APM Suites) finally appeared.  In the pre-New Year dedmorozhno-fur-tree-bustle did not have time to lay out all last year, so let's talk today about newcomers, leaders and losers of 2016, as well as the latest market news disclosed by Gartner.  I ask under the cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cc/529/7c8/1cc5297c80efc878e21cffa561f55eb1.jpg" width="900" title="gartner_mag1.jpg" alt="gartner_mag1.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Quadrant">The Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> is an annual analytical report on various IT systems markets.  Monitoring systems are one such market.  In 2016, the leaders remained the same (this is not even surprising), but the competition in other squares became fiercer and new contenders for the square of leaders appeared.  By the way, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jetinfosystems/blog/313210/">last year we already wrote</a> about two permanent leaders - AppDynamics and NewRelic.

They have a wide product portfolio without significant integration problems.  Leaders ensure timely implementation of market needs and have an innovative approach. <br><br>  Challengers - occupy a significant market share and large installations.  Currently, they are focusing on the modernization of the model range and the internal integration of architectures and feature sets for serious competition with market leaders. <br><br>  Visionaries - provide an essential product line, but the current portfolio of solutions is under development.  They have less compliance (as opposed to Square Leaders), which is associated with low financial strength and lack of viability in a competitive environment. <br><br>  Niche Players are niche players.  They do not demonstrate the same conformity in the required measurements, do not meet the requirements of large enterprises, or do it only in a specific segment.  They have limited opportunities to invest in product development and marketing support. <br><br>  <b>Ability to Execute</b> is an assessment of the quality and efficiency of the processes, systems, methods and procedures that ultimately provide the vendor with competitiveness and have a positive effect on revenues.  The criteria are presented below. <br>  <b>Product / Service</b> (Product / Service) - the capabilities of the current product, service, feature set delivered directly or through OEM suppliers. <br>  <b>Viability</b> (Overall Viability) - assessment of the financial condition of the vendor as a whole. <br>  <b>Sales / Pricing</b> (Sales Execution / Pricing) - the effectiveness of sales channels, pricing and possibilities of contractual processes. <br>  <b>Responsiveness to market requirements / History of reactions to previous requirements</b> (Market Responsiveness and Track Record) - the ability to respond to market requirements to achieve competitive success and meet customer needs.  The parameter includes the history of response to previous requirements. <br>  <b>Marketing</b> (Marketing Execution) - the effectiveness of marketing channels, positive identification of products. <br>  <b>Customer Experience</b> (Customer Experience) - success stories of customers using the product. <br>  <b>Completeness of Vision</b> - the fullness of vision.  Gartner analysts evaluate vendors by their ability to convincingly formulate statements about current and future market needs, innovations and possible competitive forces.  Criteria below. <br>  Market Understanding - the vendor‚Äôs ability to understand customer needs and translate it into a product. <br>  <b>Marketing Strategy</b> (Marketing Strategy) - a clear set of messages transmitted through marketing channels. <br>  Sales Strategy is a sales strategy of products, provided by an established network of direct and indirect sales. <br>  <b>The proposed strategy for the product</b> (Offering (Product) Strategy) is a vendor's approach to product development that meets market needs. <br>  Business Model - the validity and consistency of the vendor‚Äôs business proposal. <br>  <b>Strategy for individual market segments</b> (Vertical / Industry Strategy) - vendor strategy to meet the needs of individual market segments. <br>  <b>Innovation</b> - direct, interconnected, complementary schemes for achieving goals. <br>  Geographic Strategy - a vendor's strategy for meeting needs in geographic regions outside the ‚Äúhome region / country‚Äù <br><br>  In 2016, Gartner began to apply a new assessment to determine an APM solution consisting of three main dimensions. <br><br>  1. Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) - availability (availability) and performance (performance) of the environment, interacting with corporate applications and services.  It includes monitoring of real user transactions (real-user monitoring, RUM) and monitoring of synthetic transactions (synthetic transaction monitoring, STM) for web and mobile users. <br><br>  2. Application Discovery, tracing and diagnostics (ADTD) ‚Äîa set of processes created to understand the relationships between the infrastructure, match the business transactions between these nodes, and analyze in depth the methods of interaction used.  Includes three previously used measurements (application topology discovery and visualization, user-defined transaction profiling and application component deep-dive).  All three dimensions are focused on restoring health and are interconnected with each other. <br><br>  3. Application Analytics (AA) - application analytics that allows you to automatically determine the true cause of the problem with HTTP / S transaction performance provided by Java and .NET application servers using machine learning, statistical inference and / or other methods. <br><br>  And now let's take a quick look at the vendors presented in the quadrant. <br><br>  <b>Appdynamics</b> <br>  Vendor showed the highest profit growth over the past year.  Gartner believes that the new CEO of the company (who came from Adobe in September 2015) aims to grow the organization without any consequences for the current corporate culture.  Appdynamics is growing strongly in the corporate segment and is trying to build a vertically integrated product.  There are some problems with the timing of reactions to user requests (you can say, the spirit of a startup is eroding).  We regularly observe the expansion of functionality. <br><br>  <b>BMC</b> <br>  The vendor has resumed serious investments in the TrueSight product line, and there are hopes that the updates will appear with enviable regularity, and some interfaces will finally lose their outdated Flash technology (we are already seeing this now).  The strengths of the BMC were and are vertically integrated solutions that span various ITSM processes. <br><br>  <b>CA Technologies</b> <br>  Since last year, the vendor continues to work on updating and expanding its APM portfolio (applications for 10 patents have been submitted).  In the recent past, a vendor has introduced a new product, CA App Experience Analytics (related to DEM), which brings the vendor closer to a full-fledged APM supplier.  The strengths are a large number of personnel associated with sales and support, which ultimately translates into extensive partnerships and intensive development of relationships with corporate customers.  CA has several large customers with tens of thousands of APM agents, which allows them to have a good testing ground for scalability.  Now for the comments of Gartner.  Significant breadth of the product line significantly increases the time to value (the speed of response to customer needs).  From technological features: the core of the CA Introscope APM solution does not have a SaaS version. <br><br>  <b>Correrelse</b> <br>  Rookie Quadrant Gartner.  The company was founded in 2005 and has headquarters in the United States and Israel.  Correlsense received three rounds of financing worth more than $ 30 million (which allows us to dream about the appropriate investment in the product).  SharePath received several patents through its unique metric collection technology.  The company employs highly qualified engineers (by engineers, I think, mainly programmers are meant), which allows them to find and implement innovative approaches to solving the monitoring problem.  This applies to the instrumentation of web servers, proxy servers, C / C ++, COBOL-based applications, VDI infrastructure, Oracle applications and corporate bus.  Correlsense is little known, which limits its growth in the close market of monitoring solutions.  From the technological features: the vendor does not support the technology of synthetic transactional monitoring. <br><br>  <b>Dynatrace</b> <br>  Revenue is the largest supplier in the APM market.  Dynatrace is a serious competitor to other players in the market, and especially for Appdynamics.  It has a wide product line.  Vendor has a large distributed team of sales, which gives significant advantages in the corporate market.  At the moment, a single user interface at the development stage, the problem with a large number of product interfaces will not allow reducing everything to a ‚Äúsingle window‚Äù (minus, of course). <br><br>  <b>HPE</b> <br>  From a technological point of view, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) continues to strengthen its monitoring product line and especially the SaaS version.  The highlight of 2017 will be the merging of the HPE and Microfocus product lines.  Immediately there is a question about the support of various products within the framework of solutions from both vendors.  Wait and see. <br><br>  <b>Ibm</b> <br>  A major vendor offering enterprise-level solutions.  The set of products that make up the solution makes the implementation or migration of a time consuming task. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft</b> <br>  Gartner notes the benefits of the Azure Applications Insights solution (which, in my opinion, pulled the vendor into the quadrant).  The product allows you to collect specific data from the Azure cloud. <br><br>  <b>Nastel Technologies</b> <br>  The company is developing and not so long ago introduced a new product for monitoring real user transactions.  Nastel is headed by the same co-founders who founded the company 20 years ago.  He has good relationships with financial institutions.  Product AutoPilot Insight allows you to work with him, even a non-professional.  From technological features: the AutoPilot line has limited functionality in the field of monitoring synthetic user transactions. <br><br>  <b>Newrelic</b> <br>  The only representative of the magic quadrant, which has only the SaaS version.  Revenue growth from FY15 to FY16 was 65% (weighty), and the number of customers exceeded 14,000. Since the previous quadrant was published, in 2015, NewRelic acquired Opsmatic, which specialized in tracking changes in infrastructure.  A new product based on NewRelic Opsmatic called NewRelic Infrastructure.  Now the company is seeking to enter the corporate market.  From technological features: NewRelic does not offer any (so now fashionable) machine learning.  However, after the final formation of the magic quadrant of 2016, the vendor announced the Seymour project, focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence (artificial intelligence - AI). <br><br>  <b>Oracle</b> <br>  The vendor fell into the magic quadrant largely due to its Oracle Management Cloud Application Performance Monitoring (OMCAPM) product.  The release of this product suggests that Oracle has begun to consider supporting the monitoring of third-party products (not Oracle and not Java). <br><br>  <b>Riverbed</b> <br>  Over the past year, the company continued its strategy of expanding the SteelCentral product line into a comprehensive monitoring platform that combines users, network, infrastructure and application monitoring.  Since the release of the previous magic quadrant, major events have been the acquisition of Aternity, the redesign of the SteelCentral AppInternals product and the integration of AppInternals with AppResponse and the SteelCentral Portal.  Aternity provides the ability to monitor user transactions from a user device perspective.  It is noteworthy that the Riverbed brand is still more connected with network optimization than with APM solutions, and this carries the risk of underfinancing APM solutions. <br><br>  <b>Added vendors</b> (since the release of the previous quadrant): Correlsense, Oracle <br><br>  <b>Remote vendors</b> (since the release of the previous quadrant): <br><br>  AppNeta - excluded because  was acquired by solarwinds <br>  Dell Software - has ceased to meet the updated technical requirements.  By the way, now the company is called Quest <br>  JenniferSoft - ceased to meet the updated technical requirements <br>  ManageEngine - stopped responding to updated technical requirements <br>  Tingyun - stopped responding to updated technical requirements <br><br>  This is how large-scale strokes looked like the market of APM solutions in 2016.  Of course, there are other vendors that have their own interesting products, and their absence in the quadrant does not mean their unsuitability, poor quality, etc. <br><br>  Please contact us with questions in the comments.  And if the task requires a slightly more thoughtful approach, <a href="http://www.jet.msk.su/services/upravlenie-it-uslugami-i-it-infrastrukturoy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3D319948">our consulting - it, as a heating point of the Emergencies Ministry on the federal highway</a> , - always appears at the right moment. <br><br>  At the end of the post for purely practical interest, we attached a survey on the vendors listed in the quadrant.  Pay attention to the last two points (this is if you are using a product from another vendor).  Thank you in advance for your feedback. <br><br>  Author of the article: <b>Anton Kasimov</b> , architect of control systems, Jet Infosystems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319948/</a></p>
