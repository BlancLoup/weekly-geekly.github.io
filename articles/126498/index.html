Bauman</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, my future fellow student threw a Habr-link to me with a very interesting but not new subject for me - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/126211/">As I entered Baumanka, or ‚ÄúStep into the Future‚Äù</a> . <br>  The project described interested, because I myself Shagist with 3 years of experience and have seen many projects of different guys. <br><br>  In the end, I also wanted to introduce to you for review my project, which allowed me to enroll in <b>MSTU</b> (Place Where You Die) to <b>them.</b>  <b>Bauman</b> .  The idea to make a project for ‚ÄúStep‚Äù arose as early as September 2010, when <s>teachers were</s> intimidated by the scare of our entire parallel with the ‚Äúscary‚Äù word of the Unified State Exam.  At that time, while my classmates, under the pressure of teachers, ran to the tutors and wondered / memorized tests, and I began to work on the project. <br>  My wonderful mentor <b><a href="http://old.yamaledu.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D1075:2010-09-22-11-13-37">Dolinsky Valery Sergeyevich</a></b> suggested me the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, his initial idea was the development and creation of a self-propelled mobile complex with a hybrid system consisting of a diesel generator and a solar battery.  But I didn‚Äôt really like this idea, because I‚Äôm an electronics engineer, not a robotics ... Yes, in my town of Nadym there are virtually no technical possibilities to make a platform for such an installation on my own, but to order <br>  ready from China, in my opinion, is not very correct, because you need to think with your head, not with Chinese hands. <br><br>  In general, in a month I already knew for sure that I wanted to develop a technique that would allow the modernization of a diesel power plant based on the container ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù and turn it into a hybrid one.  As a result, my project was named <br>  <b>Automatic hybrid power plant based on diesel generator and solar battery</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>The essence of the project is as follows.</b> <br>  In the vast expanses of our country uses a large number of diesel power plants and diesel generators.  Tons of diesel fuel are consumed daily to generate electricity in those areas where the power engineers have not stepped.  Diesel generators are especially relevant in the conditions of the Far North, because not all industrial complexes are electrified with power lines.  For such remote areas, a completely new type of power plants was recently developed - <b>diesel generators in the North container block.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b3f/db9/ce5/b3fdb9ce50fd8837e83e50d7589b7a65.jpg" alt="Hybrid Power Station North"><br><br>  My development will help to significantly reduce the consumption of diesel fuel in the daytime by adding a solar battery to the existing power plant.  As you can see, this power plant is a warmed container filled with diesel generator and electronics.  I immediately noticed that the roof of the container is perfectly flat, and you can easily place a solar battery on it!  From my <a href="http://chiper.pro/list.php%3Fcategory/71">experience with optical systems</a> and solar panels, I know that a solar battery must be mobile and always be directed perpendicular to the sun in order to obtain the greatest efficiency throughout the day.  In other words, the solar battery must be located on a mobile platform, while the electronic system must direct it <br>  in the sun, guided by photo sensors. <br>  As a result, managed to simulate the appearance of a hybrid power plant in 3ds Max. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYZyIhPA_Qs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgUEMY0stIjq5A4jShr-AeexM5nDQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Then I faced a more serious, but interesting task: how to implement all this technically?  Below is a block diagram where you can see the principle of interaction of the existing power plant systems with the system I developed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b9d/906/12e/b9d90612edc3e18f1c0125a2199f316e.png" alt="System interaction with power station"><br><br>  The control system I proposed is an electronic circuit that is controlled by the PIC16F877 microcontroller. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/71b/914/75e/71b91475e3f19329c1b94ec33e2b32a1.png" alt="control system diagrams"><br><br>  Of course, I did not set myself the task of creating a real prototype of such a power plant, but I did the actual model at a scale of 1:20!  Further, the model and became the main highlight of my project.  Below you can see a photo of the demo model, it is made mainly of Plexiglas and wood.  Solar battery for installation was made to order and cost 1000r. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/519/974/c0e/519974c0e1236d0745a19c2f71557d3e.jpg" alt="The appearance of the model of a hybrid power plant"><br><br>  The rotation of the solar battery in two planes is carried out with the help of electric motors with gearboxes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f99/e2a/cd1/f99e2acd1650fb9b4ef7954396b0e2be.png" alt="motor + gearbox"><br><br>  For a more vivid demonstration of automation, I needed to make a model of a real diesel generator.  To do this, I connected 2 electric motors of different power with a belt drive, thereby obtaining a generator simulator. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/71b/914/75e/71b91475e3f19329c1b94ec33e2b32a1.png" alt="Generator simulator"><br><br>  The final step was the spike and debugging of the control system itself, the creation of an ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù for the installation, so to speak.  As mentioned earlier, the circuit was developed based on a PIC microcontroller. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/959/6e8/11c/9596e811c6dbcba4947a49f1609cd7ed.png" alt="electronics before installation"><br>  And here is the circuit embedded in the demonstration installation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/51b/27d/fe1/51b27dfe144077fba6beedd6def2eace.jpg" alt="installed electronics"><br><br>  By the New Year, my demonstration installation was completed at 85-90%.  There was a final touch - painting the wooden rotary base of the solar battery in metallic.  In the meantime, my classmates were nervous and indignant because of the upcoming USE and told me that ‚Äúit would be better if you prepared yourself too,‚Äù and I was engaged in a very exciting process.  After the New Year, trips began with my new development throughout Russia.  I was lucky with this project, and in fact at all exhibitions and conferences I was awarded only <a href="http://chiper.pro/abaut.html">first places</a> . <br><br>  An article on my personal site about this project is <a href="http://chiper.pro/content.php%3F126-Gibride-stancia/">chiper.pro/content.php?126-Gibride-stancia</a> <br><br>  In March, I took my next step: successfully defended the project at the ‚ÄúStep into the Future‚Äù conference in the Design and Technology section of radio-electronic equipment.  In Baumanka, my jury also liked my device, for which I received a diploma ‚ÄúFor the best scientific work‚Äù.  A couple of days later I successfully wrote the Olympiad, which I sometimes prepared for in the evenings.  That's how I entered MGTU back in March.  Then he defended the honor of a student-baumantsa and passed the exam, not worse, and even better than those who persistently prepared and hired tutors. <br><br>  <b>The moral of this story is:</b> <br>  Dear schoolchildren and applicants, listen to your teachers less when they are intimidated with preparations for the Unified State Exam, if you are not stupid and think creatively, then you have Over9000 ways to enter the best universities of the country.  The academic council of universities is important to recruit creative and promising students, and not hundred columnists from Adygea.  There are programs like Step into the Future in almost every self-respecting university.  Developing a project and writing a scientific work is many times more useful than learning tests!  Time and money spent on the creation of the project, more than justify the stress and nerves during the preparation / delivery of the exam.  And, of course, the biggest bonus is not spoiled due to <br>  your parents' vacation receipts.  After successful protection and receipt of benefits for admission, you can apply to the university on May 25 and have a free summer break, while your classmates will sit on needles waiting for lists and running around in universities! <br><br>  <b>Good luck, future Capricorns MSTU!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126498/</a></p>
