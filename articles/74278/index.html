  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Project Note</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/72368/">Last time</a> I tried to think about a possible environment for the implementation of various projects by users.  Which naturally requires the definition of the concept of "project".  Once in LJ <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/beskov/" class="user_link">beskov I</a> <a href="http://beskov.livejournal.com/60358.html">tried</a> to define it and found out that in Russian it corresponds to what is in English designated by two different words - <i>design</i> and <i>project</i> .  The first is something static, ready, the goal that you want to realize and realize.  The second, according to Beskov, reflects the organizational aspect, dynamics, process, activities for the implementation of the plan.  And probably it is, with the proviso that not always these things can be completely separated.  Sometimes it is possible: the construction of buildings is usually carried out according to a project prepared in advance and approved, deviations from it are dangerous for collapse and are treated as a crime.  Regarding the decoration of the premises, even a separate term ‚Äúdesign project‚Äù has taken root, in order to emphasize its relatively static nature. <br><br>  But in other cases it is impossible;  as Zhvanetsky said, the repair cannot be completed, it can only be stopped.  In other words, for many projects there is no completion criterion, but you can only talk about signs of performing certain stages. <a name="habracut"></a>  Often this is the business.  Let's say making money is the goal, but this condition is vague.  Even if you have reached the planned income level and do not want more, a successful business cannot be static, it needs to expand, diversify, invest in a strategy, etc., otherwise competition-related problems will begin.  Scientific projects are also a good example - they usually cannot be known in advance exactly what will happen in the end;  the goal is refined or modified as intermediate results are obtained.  Big discoveries are the "side effect" of some other research.  A similar situation is not uncommon for IT projects - in the process of implementation, plans can change radically and the final product will be completely different from the initial idea.  It is good if such transformations occur in the head of a start-up person in the process of thinking about an idea, but the same can happen in software companies as software develops, then this is a systemic problem.  In reality, changes to the goal are natural, it is just a sign that you are moving, including upwards - the horizon line is shifting, and the scale of the view is changing.  This is a sign of life.  There was even such a definition of life (for a long time on TV they spoke about a book by one author, I reproduce only the essence from memory): static dynamism.  Or dynamic statics.  Quite in the spirit of the old Hegel - if opposites converge in one thing, then truth is somewhere nearby. <br><br>  Projects with an uncertain completion criterion, respectively, can last indefinitely.  If the processes inside are quite intensive, they grow into large or very large forms.  Something like Microsoft and Google.  In the ancient Roman Empire.  Or the Aum Shinrikyo Sect.  And if inside there is ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù, then a noticeable growth and result will not be observed for many years.  It is also worth noting that such projects do not always have a conscious beginning.  For example, someone's hobby gradually turned into a profession and a successful business, but initially it was not thought of by business.

      According to these criteria, you can classify network activity.  Note that usually people do not come to the Internet to leave it soon.  For most, the Internet, like other benefits of civilization, such as cell phones, is becoming more or less part of life, most likely the rest of life.  Therefore, we have an interesting thing here - the activity of most people in the network can be attributed to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsomething indefinitely long.  Can you call it a project?  If you regularly invest your time and energy into something, this thing in any case begins to develop, has its own phases of development.  I would call it projects, but in the latent (latent, potential, unconscious) phase.  From this point of view, almost everything in society and in the lives of individuals is a project.  The project "family", the project "career", the project "country", etc., etc. It turns out a kind of project thinking.  The transition from the latent phase to the obvious and conscious occurs spontaneously, as the ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù accumulates, and means a more traditional understanding of the project.  These are, for example, Internet startups. <br><br>  As noted above, for this transition is important, firstly, the intensity of the processes of accumulation.  Secondly, self-awareness is a stimulant, for example, someone can give you an idea to make a startup.  In a more general form, this is manifested in the public awareness of some things, even in the fashion for something.  Thirdly, the availability and convenience of ready-made formats - if people have ready-made tools for various activities, this facilitates undertakings. <br><br>  To be closer to specifics, I will give examples of savings.  The two most massive components of network activity are communication and content creation.  Communication leads to the formation of social connections.  In this case, we observe a dependence on the format - for example, blogging mainly leads to a quantitative accumulation of connections (audience growth), while the forum format is more conducive to ‚Äúquality accumulation‚Äù, for example, with long-term communication, virtual links almost inevitably turn into real.  In both cases, there is an accumulation of (small format) content.  And what, in turn, should it lead to?  - to the formation of increasingly larger and structurally related units of content, such as books.  But in the mass this does not happen, because the blog and forum formats (as well as other common ones) do not contribute to the structuring and high-quality transformations of the content.  Also, because there is no awareness that, in fact, everyone on the web is writing his book (often not one).  A book is a project.  Which, with a conscious approach, requires its strategy of network behavior, new formats of communication and knowledge representation.  This is one of the large and fairly empty niches of the modern Internet.  And its relevance only increases with the non-linear growth of the amount of information collected annually on the Internet. <br><br>  Directly or indirectly, projects accumulate opportunities for the social realization of people, the social realization space on the Internet becomes more and more multidimensional (multivariate).  Brad Fitzpatrick created live magazines and became famous.  This is his project and his self-realization.  But with the help of blog services many people have become famous bloggers.  Their blogs as author-based media actually turned into independent projects, the success of which forms in the society a conscious attitude to this type of activity and stimulates new users to attempt self-realization in this format.  You can position a service as a ‚Äúproject environment‚Äù, a convenient tool for experimenting with new formats, or for self-realization through established formats.  Anyway, in this environment the word ‚Äúproject‚Äù will be key.  Each user will do their projects on the Internet, it will become part of public understanding, will affect the formation of a specific tradition and culture of the "human network". <br><br>  <b>UPD 11/24/2009</b> Lifehacker has a <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2009/09/25/kak-napisat-knigu-s-pomoshhju-interneta/">review</a> with various services that help to ‚Äúwrite a book‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74278/</a></p>
