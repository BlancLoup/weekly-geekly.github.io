  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sovok Ozon, or how not to do online shopping</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As a preface: perhaps most of the audience Habra no longer caught the joys of Soviet trade.  It was a unique time when buying something was much more difficult than doing it yourself ... <br><br>  I ordered a couple of interesting and rare books in Ozone.  I chose a pickup from the nearest point of issue of orders - I thought that it would be faster, it seemed to be 15 minutes to go - almost near.  Yesterday I received a letter stating that ‚Äúthe order has been sent to this item, bla-bla-bla, when issuing, give your name and order number‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>  Well, I happily rewrote the number on a piece of paper, dug out the car from the snow and drove off. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, snowfall all week.  Having rammed through the snow up to the knee, I got to the store.  Spent about ten minutes to find out that the books are issued in the camera department (logical, isn‚Äôt it?).  The guy behind the counter looked at the piece of paper and turned from the gate: "tomorrow, and maybe the day after." 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In general, I am a polite person, but then, out of surprise, I said out loud "what ... whoa" loudly and clearly to the whole store.  The guy sympathized with me and explained that in addition to the first letter (that the books were <i>sent</i> to the issuing point), the second must come - that the books <i>reached</i> the store, and then the third one - confirming that they <i>really</i> can be taken away.  <i>[UPD: in fact, it turned out that the guy was a little mistaken, according to the logic of Ozone, there will be no more letters, but for now we read further]</i> <br><br>  After returning home, I carefully read the letter again.  I will quote part of it: <br><br> <code>  ‚Ññ xxxxxxxx-xxxx-x     . <br>     : <br>    " ", .  <br> : . -,  , . 7- , . 32. <br>  : ,  9.00  21.00. <br>   :        7 . <br>       ,      xxxxxxxxx.</code> <br> <br>  Do you see information here that the order is not yet ready?  And I do not see.  Here it is written in black and white where and at what time it is necessary to come.  It turns out that in one of the previous letters it was said that the order would actually be ready for issue only a day after receiving the letter, which says that it is already ready.  I do not know which cranks wrote the mechanism for working with orders on Ozone, but they definitely have roots from Israel, forcing them to ask and ask again, and then specify and interchange the same thing three times. <br><br>  The moral is: if your customers care about you, do not be idiots and do not write them stupid non-informative letters.  The customer is always right, while paying.  The customer does not give a shit how your internal logistics are arranged.  The client expects only one message: the order is ready, come.  If the client has received a letter and at the same time <i>does not have to do anything</i> , then write about it in large letters: ‚ÄúClient, sit on a well ... e exactly, we haven‚Äôt prepared any nichrome yet, but you just wrote so that you don‚Äôt miss it.  And better - keep quiet.  More benefit will be. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : yes, the story had a sequel.  I wrote a complaint to the Ozone customer support department, and the lovely girl told me that, due to their internal features, an order at this point would be available only after the 15th.  Guess what letter I received early on the next business day after the 15th day?  Right!  A letter stating that my order has been canceled, since (I quote) "is not claimed during the storage period at the point of issue". <br><br>  Bravo, "Ozone"!  You, like no one else, keep the true traditions of the Soviet trade, and you get five plus on this scale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79577/</a></p>
